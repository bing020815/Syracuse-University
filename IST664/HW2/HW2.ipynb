    "This homework is based on a similar homework called SpamLord! from the Stanford NLP course, in particular, both the programs and the data has been adapted. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the web, many people who want to give their email addresses or phone numbers for people to contact them will try to make it hard for spammers to automatically search text for email addresses and phone numbers by giving non-standard forms of them, sometimes called obfuscation.  You may have seen examples like:\n",
    "\n",
    "jurafsky(at)cs.stanford.edu \n",
    "jurafsky at csli dot stanford dot edu\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework, we are going use regular expressions to try to find these email addresses anyway.  Although our main objective is to learn more about using regular expressions, we can also observe what types of obfuscations work best to foil the spammers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data/dev directory are text files that have html text with obscured emails and phone numbers from faculty and staff at Stanford.  (This data is both out-of-date and has been modified to require more interesting regular expressions.)  In the data/devGold file are the corresponding standard form emails and phone numbers;  these are the correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program ContactFinder.py is set up so that you can write a set of regular expressions with parentheses to pick out the parts of the email address or phone numbers that match it in their obscured form.  Then there is a function “process_filename” that goes through lines of the file, matches all the regular expressions and builds up a result list called “res” that has the name of the file, an ‘e’ or ‘p’ for email or phone, and the standard format email address or phone number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the program processes all the files in the dev directory and combines the standard form results, it compares them with the devGold file and reports how many your program got right.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the evaluation part,   \n",
    "    * the true positive section displays e-mails and phone numbers which the code correctly matches, \n",
    "    * the false positive section displays e-mails which the code regular expressions match but which are not correct, and \n",
    "    * the false negative section displays e-mails and phone numbers which the starter code did not match, but which do exist in the html files. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Your goal, then, is to reduce the number of false positives and negatives.  The false positive section also lists the correct matches to help debugging.\n"

    "1.  (Required)  Write more regular expressions that correct false positives or fit false negatives.  Do as best as you can using the epatterns and ppatterns lists in the program.  For each regular expression that you write or extend, list\n",

For each example, or set of examples that fit the same pattern, explain briefly why it won’t work.  If you can make expressions in regexpal that match, but don’t work in the program to extract the email or phone numbers, list those here.  If you had any false positives in Part 1, include a discussion here of why that rule generated them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * b. Then search the web and find a couple of additional examples of obscured email addresses or phone numbers and report on them, or try to design a way to obscure an email address that would be extremely difficult for ContactFinder to match with a regular expression.  For the latter, try to have something more specific than things like “To send me email, try the simplest address that makes sense.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  (Option)  Python programming:  Continue working on the regular expressions to match more examples by having other lists of patterns.  For example, you may want to have patterns that will match three parts of the email addresses, or you may want to make a list of patterns for email addresses that end in .com. For each list, you will need to add a part to process_filename that matches that list and puts its parts into a standard format answer.\n",
