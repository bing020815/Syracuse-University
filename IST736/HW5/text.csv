The lettuce was wilted, the tomato was green, and nothing outstanding about the flavor. I'd say better options nearby are Joe's farm grill, In-n-out, or Culvers. Cleanliness was average. The floor was a little sticky and the beverage area was kept very neat. The kitchen appeared clean. Service was below average/horrible. The cashier was very unpleasant. We all ordered at the same time and the first half of the food came out about 15 minutes prior to the 2nd part. It was pretty slow. By the time we got the fries they were cold. The staff literally acted like they were a bunch of highschoolers who were annoyed that there were any customers who interrupted their hangout. I know this sounds harsh...it is. My experience was absolutely horrible. We will not be back and I don't recommend that you should either."

The BBQ is definitely a winner, but their now commercialized packaged BBQ sauce is horrible! Bring back the other stuff in the Styrofoam containers! I will still keep coming for the brisket when I'm in the area!!!!!"

This place was over priced, had fairly poor service, and the pizza just wasn't that good.I ordered the sausage pizza.  The sausage was pretty bland.  They also screwed up my order by adding onions when I didn't ask for them.  I've had my order messed up on pizzas before by having toppings left off, but never added on that I simply didn't order.  Found that strange.  I would have sent it back, but the waiter didn't check to see how everything was until about fifteen minutes after the food was brought to the table.I'd give Humbe Pie 1.5 stars if I could, but rounded up since it is better than Dominos and Pizza Hut.  I went after buying the GroupOn coupon, but won't be returning."

5,4,p,,,,,,,p,p,,p,,,,,,p,p,,"Via Delosantos is one of the few places in Phoenix that a vegetarian can get a good Mexican meal.  Neither the beans or rice are cooked in lard, which is hard to find in this town.  The chips and salsa are premium, just watch out for the fried potatoes and such - very greasy. Thanks to Philip's illuminating review, I hadn't heard about their health code violations.  It's something I'll keep an eye on in the future though... if they take another dive like they did in 2004 I'll keep my distance for a while."
6,2,n,,,,,,,,,n,p,n,,,,,n,p,,"The food leans toward the SouthWest and is located near Old Scottsdale.  The place has a couple of patios as well as couches/easy chairs for seating.  Large curved bar with televisions.  Tons of tequila.The place tends to be busy because of its location, however the food is nothing special - burgers, wraps, tacos, etc.  Prices are steep considering what you get.  Service can be spotty depending on time of day."
