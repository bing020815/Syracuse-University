0,pos,"let's say you live at the end of an airport runway . large jetliners continuously pass over your house   rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . let's say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances   and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . now let's say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway   and offers you more than it's worth . wouldn't you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? of course you would . but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise   and the house your castle ? that's what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton )   and although he's happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home   sorry   it's not for sale . unfortunately   the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government   which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . not about to take this lying down   darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined   albeit pathetic   attempt to fight back . the castle   an australian comedy by rob sitch   is perhaps one of the simplest movies i've seen in recent memory   yet also one of the funniest . in fact   it is this film's reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . the good guys and the bad guys are clear   the humor is straightforward   and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . it's the perfect setup for a relaxing   hilarious good time   and as much as i hate to admit it   i liked the fact that i didn't have to think all that much while watching this film . i just sat back and enjoyed myself . the situation is one we've seen before : regular joe fights back against the government   or big business   or whatever . what makes this film different is its characters . darryl thinks he's got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind   he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he's got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny )   and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . steve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for "" investments "" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors   while wayne kerrigan is in jail   as a result of dennis denuto's incompetent courtroom maneuvers . the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren't so stupid that they get annoying . they're just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . we look upon them with a little bit of pity   but a whole lot of affection . screenwriters sitch   santo cilauro   tom gleisner   and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate   further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . sympathy for their situation   the laughter they bring us   and the family's wonderful characterization   simple as it may be   leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans   but trust me   it works . i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . don't get me wrong - slapstick   when executed well   can be genius . it's just that too often   a film will resort to it's use as a shortcut to amusing the audience   not always successfully . instead   the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . when they are by themselves   the are funny   and when they are with normal people   they are hilarious . one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film's running time . luckily   it's a funny little detour that   while slightly distracting from the film's main drive   is still quite enjoyable . with all the levity abound in the castle   the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept   that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property   an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . i'm not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life   but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . and   for that matter   it's more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this .

1,pos,in this good natured   pleasent and easy going comedy   bill murray ( ghostbusters   1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners   who   every year   is sent to punxsutawney   p . a   to report on groundhog day . the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box   and if he dosen't see a shadow   it will be an early spring . phil really hates the ceremony   and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind . however   fate has a cruel trick for phil   and he starts re-living groundhog day over   and over   and over   until he gradually likes it   and rita falls in love with him . groundhog day is a well written   totatly unoffensive and funny comedy . the screenwriters   director ramis and danny rubin   have written a funny   warm   but never overly senitmental comedy . although the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious   there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film . ramis's direction also helps   and although he dosen't try any flash director tricks   the film is directed well enough   and the jokes are set up well . and the editing is also good   especially when it shows one part of the day over   and over again   such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita . the performances are also excellent . bill murray is great fun   and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth   and delivers his lines in his usual smary style . andie macdowell is good as rita   although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film . there is chemistry between the two leads   thankfully   otherwise the whole film would probably fall part . chris elliot   as the cameraman larry   is also funny   although you have to like his goofy style   otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film   and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall . the supporting cast aren't bad either   with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson   and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist . in fact   there is not one dud performance in this film   and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase . overall   there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all . it almost seems perfect . however   the film can get a bit soppy sometimes   and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over   and over   and over   and over . also   there's not much of an music score   and the music there is is pretty bad . but these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all . overall   then   groundhog day is a funny   smart   and also has some room in there for some heart . an excellent comedy . overall rating= ( 
2,neg,"i'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . sure   she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy )   but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in   she always strikes out . the crush was a slow-moving   predictable piece of fluff . hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . clueless was an annoying   unfunny waste of time . and people have e-mailed me too   saying clueless is a good movie and that i'm the only one who doesn't like it . one girl said if i'd seen the movie with "" an open mind   "" i would have enjoyed it . nothing could be further from the truth . i went into the theater expecting to love the movie . the preview looked good and of course i'm crazymadinlove with alicia   but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny   unlikable characters . almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . when we were walking out of the theater   one guy ( and it wasn't me ) yelled out   "" that was the worst f$&#in' movie i've ever seen "" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . what i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . where to begin in criticizing this movie ? the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier   the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old   alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . there is zero humor   zero suspense   zero drama and zero action   until the last ten minutes   when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . so why does this movie get one star out of me ? well   alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . and if it wasn't bubble bath   the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features   but you settle for what you can get . alicia plays a babysitter who's spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . as the movie trods along   we discover she's not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character's fantasies ( and probably every male viewer's too ) . the drunken father thinks she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth   her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside   even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she's taking her bubble bath . they even throw in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . in fact   i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it . so you can't call it a sex flick . i've already pointed out that it can't fall under drama   comedy   thriller or action   so what do you classify the babysitter as ? bad .

3,neg,"so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind   2001 : a space odyssey   apollo 13 and contact ? well   whatever it is   you'd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange   considering the disastrous results we're left with here . this is a film that takes a little bit of everything   but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! it's like i said . . . this movie sucks . plot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020   after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . critique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . uneven   would be another . the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise   the buzz around it had been so-so   and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes   all leading you to believe that it's actually going to go "" somewhere "" . but it isn't long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral   features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet   tries too hard to get us into the "" pain "" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . in a sci-fi movie ? well   i don't know   much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half   only to figure out some big secret in the end   a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . ultimately   this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise   joins the crew in their "" misadventures in space "" for the main crux of its journey   and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . mind you   if you enjoyed that film's shrug-of-the-shoulders ending   you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . of course   i don't remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . ugh . what a friggin' mess . films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . didn't anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? didn't they read the bad dialogue   the cheezy lines   the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you   with a director like depalma at the helm   that ain't saying much ! ) . of course   you can't really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o'connell in this fine crew of thespians . 'nuff said . neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film's musical score during the last fifteen minutes   presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay   we get it brian   this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my ears hurt ! ) . so is anything salvageable in this movie ? sure . gary sinise does another great job   as does cheadle   the film doesn't completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening   and yes   the "" sand-twister "" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . other than that ? i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops   did i say "" admire ""   i meant "" am disgusted "" ! all in all   this movie delivers very little in actual substance   offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo   pretends to be deep when really it's just sappy   and eventually just settles into an ending which   other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story   gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . go see the ninth gate . . . now there's a great movie ! and on a personal note   i think it's time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences   and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . "
4,neg,"the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film's end . if you're not familiar with this law   then maybe you've seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film's end . now if you're a regular reader of mine   you've heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end   but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? no   it definitely is not . melissa joan hart ( from abc's "" sabrina   the teenage witch "" ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team . adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who's just broken up with his activist girlfriend . apparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back   and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance . so the two pretend to date for some reason   but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud . will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ? will this crazy scheme work ? do i care ? the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy . what makes movies like can't hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent   she's all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly . i don't know what the writer's intention was with drive me crazy . there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to . here there's nothing . . . just teens whining about who's going to take them to the big dance . do me a favor kids   go get a job or something . . . just shut the hell up . in all honesty   the best part of this film is the end credits . now normally when i say that it's followed with the joke "" . . . because the movie is finally over . "" in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film . after the obligatory second playing of britney spears' titular song   there's a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school . nothing great   but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them . sci-fi fans take note : there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye grant ( the tv miniseries "" v "" and "" v : the final battle "" ) .
