n,'Mike\'s Pizza High Point, NY Service was very slow and the quality was low. You would think they would know at least how to make good pizza, not. Stick to pre-made dishes like stuffed pasta or a salad. You should consider dining else where.',,
n,'i really like this buffet restaurant in Marshall street. they have a lot of selection of american, japanese, and chinese dishes. we also got a free drink and free refill. there are also different kinds of dessert. the staff is very friendly. it is also quite cheap compared with the other restaurant in syracuse area. i will definitely coming back here.',,
n,'After I went shopping with some of my friend, we went to DODO restaurant for dinner. I found worm in one of the dishes .',,,
n,'Olive Oil Garden was very disappointing. I expect good food and good service (at least!!) when I go out to eat. The meal was cold when we got it, and the waitor had no manners whatsoever. Don\'t go to the Olive Oil Garden. ',,,
n,'The Seven Heaven restaurant was never known for a superior service but what we experienced last week was a disaster. The waiter would not notice us until we asked him 4 times to bring us the menu. The food was not exceptional either. It took them though 2 minutes to bring us a check after they spotted we finished eating and are not ordering more. Well, never more. ',,,
p,I went to XYZ restaurant and loved it. I had a YELP Free Appetizer coupon which could be applied upon checking in to the restaurant. The person serving us was very kind and nice and  acknowledged the coupon. When I asked her about it, she nicely replied back. Then I inquired about the free salad that they serve. She was so nice and told me about it., I had a great experience as I had taken my family to that restaurant for the first time and I had high hopes from the restaurant which is, otherwise, my favorite place to dine. '
p,I went to ABC restaurant two days ago and I really liked the food and the service. We were  just to get seated and once we ordered, our food came out great. I ordered the pasta and it was excellent - completely delicious and very appatizing. I definitely would recommend going there, especially if you\'re in a hurry!',,
p,I went to the Chilis on Erie Blvd and had the best meal of my life. We arrived and waited 5 minutes for a hostess, and then were seated by a waiter who was obviously in a fun mood. We order drinks and it took them 15 minutes to bring us both the delicious beers which were nice and cold. Then we order an appetizer and wait  only 5 minutes for southwest egg rolls, at which point we just paid and left. ,,
p,OMG. This restaurant is great. The receptionist greeted us with kindness., we just stood there and waited for five minutes. The food came ontime and served  warm. Me and my pet ordered a bowl of salad and a cheese pizza. The salad was fresh, the crust of a pizza great.  I love this place!!!!!!!!!!',,
