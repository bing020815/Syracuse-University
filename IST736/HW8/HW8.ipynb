    "LDA is an algorithm that can “summarize” the main topics of a text collection, now you are asked to use this algorithm to analyze the main topics in the floor debate of the 110th Congress (House only). According to political scientists, there are usually 40-50 common topics going on in each Congress. Tune the number of topics and see if LDA can get you the common topics, such as defense, education, healthcare, economy, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set “110” consists of four subfolders. For the subfolder names, “m” means “male”, “f” means “female”, “d” means “democrat”, “r” means “republican”. You can merge all of them into one folder to run Mallet LDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "OR If you cannot work with Mallet – you can use my code for LDA which also generates a great interactive vis. \n",

    "Interpreting topic clustering results is very difficult. See if this article “Reading Tea Leaves” may help you. http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/docs/nips2009-rtl.pdf. The recommended readings are also great examples to demonstrate how to articulate topic modeling results. \n",

    "ALSO – do not start with this HUGE dataset. First, create a small and balanced sample of data or even a different dataset that you find or make that will work. Make sure your code runs on that smaller data first. Then, when everything work – try it on the large dataset. If you still cannot – cut the large dataset down until you can.\n",

    "NOTE from other Professor: \n",
    "To prevent your program from being interrupted, run it as a backend process by adding \"&\" to the end of your command (for Linux system). Or you can use one subset of the data to build a topic model and explain what topics you have discovered from the data."

      "   Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag. \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 431, a resolution I introduced along with the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), commemorating the 40th anniversary of Loving v. Virginia, the landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing interracial marriages within the United States. \n",
      "   I thank Chairman Conyers for expedition consideration of this resolution so it could be brought to the floor before the actual date of the anniversary which is tomorrow, June 12. \n",
      "   In June of 1958, two residents of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Mildred Jeter, a black Native American woman, and Richard Perry Loving, a Caucasian man, were married in Washington, D.C. Upon their return to Virginia, Richard Perry Loving and Mildred Jeter Loving were charged with violating Virginia's anti-miscegenation statutes, which made their marriage a felony.     \n",
      "   They challenged their convictions, culminating in the June 12, 1967, U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Loving v. Virginia, striking down the remaining anti-miscegenation laws that were still in effect in 16 States. \n",
      "   In the unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court rejected bigotry against interracial relations, recognizing an individual's right to marry under the 14th amendment. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote: ``Marriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamental to our very existence and survival ..... To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the 14th amendment, is surely to deprive all the States' citizens of liberty without due process of law.'' \n",
      "   The opinion also stated that ``the 14th amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.'' \n",
      "   The Loving decision marked a critical step forward in our Nation's struggle toward equal rights for all, particularly full marriage equality. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, from 1970 to the year 2000 the percentage of interracial marriages has increased from 1 percent of all marriages to more than 5 percent. The number of children living in interracial families has quadrupled between 1970 and 2000, going from 900,000 to more than 3 million. Because of the decision's profound impact in our society, numerous cities and towns across this country have already proclaimed June 12 Loving Day in commemoration of this decision. \n",
      "   Indeed, the Supreme Court's opinion forcefully rejected the argument employed by Leon Bazile, the trial judge of the case, who defended his decision convicting the Lovings as part of God's plan. Unfortunately, after 40 years, similar types of arguments are still being employed by a few to deny full marriage equality to everyone. \n",
      "   In commemorating the legacy of Loving v. Virginia in ending the ban on interracial marriage in the United States, H. Res. 431 reaffirms the Loving court's recognition that marriage is one of the ``basic civil rights of man'' at the heart of the 14th amendment protections. \n",

      "   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, the matter before us today, the Iraq Supplemental, is before us for the first time. However, this is not the last time that we will vote on this bill. This bill will go to the Senate and from the Senate to a Conference Committee and from there back to the floor of this house. If the President exercises his veto power, we may ultimately vote on this matter as many as three or four times. \n",
      "   Today, I make no commitments about what I will do or how I will vote when this matter comes back to this house. How could I? I don't know what this bill will look like when it comes back ..... I don't know what it will say. Rather, I rise to explain how I will vote today, as this bill comes before this house for the first time. \n",
      "   It is clear to me that today, we have only two options. We can send to the Senate the bill before us, with binding language to end the war or, should this bill fail, we will send a bill that gives the President unchecked power to continue his misguided, mismanaged war without end. \n",
      "   That is the choice today. And my vote will be ``yes'' to advance the bill which begins to end the war. Reaching this decision has been difficult. My deliberation has been long and thoughtful. The difficulty of the decision may seem somewhat surprising given the rather stark description I just provided of the choice before us. However, there are several reasons why this decision has been hard. \n",
      "   First, the bill before us, despite its binding language to end the war, is far from perfect. It does not end the war soon enough. It mishandles the issue of Iraqi oil. It fails to address necessary safeguards to prevent this President from taking military action in Iran without Congressional authorization. The bill's shortcomings are reason enough for a no vote. \n",
      "   Second, until today ..... until this vote ..... I have played a different role. My job yesterday, and the day before (like so many war opponents) was to fight to make the language in this bill stronger and to make this legislation better. And having failed to accomplish all I sought to achieve provides me with another reason to vote no. \n",
      "   Third, until this day I have voted against all of the Iraqi war spending bills. I strongly favor using the power of the purse to end the war. That this binding language to end the war is attached to a war funding bill provided me with yet another reason to vote no. \n",
      "   Many on the left have invoked the words of Saul Alinsky in describing today's vote: ``..... I start from where the world is, as it is, not as I would like it to be,'' he says in his book Rules for Radicals. ``That we accept the world  as it is does not in any sense weaken our desire to change it into what we believe it should be--it is necessary to begin where the world is if we are going to change it to what we think it should be,'' Alinsky continues. So today we start where this congressional world is, with this imperfect bill as the vehicle to begin to end the war. \n",
      "   The choice is clear, today we can begin to end the war, or we can stand in the way of doing so. I will vote to end the war. \n",

We must bring an end to our military occupation and replace it with a program of humanitarian relief, rebuilding political stabilization, and diplomatic engagement. We must participate in a robust regional diplomatic effort, including direct discussions with Syria and Iran, to promote stability in Iraq. And I think that this effort will be well received by Iraq's neighbors because regardless of whether these countries are close allies of the United States or not, Iraq's neighbors have more to gain if Iraq is stabilized and more to lose if it is not. \n",
      "   We must also heed the advice of many, including the Iraq Study Group, and acknowledge that other conflicts in the Middle East require our attention and leadership if the region is to achieve lasting stability. Therefore, we must also initiate a new push for Arab-Israeli peace. I believe that Congress has not only the right but the responsibility to assert its constitutional role as a co-equal branch of government in overseeing the conduct of this war and bringing it to an end. In doing so, I believe all options, including using the power of the purse, should be on the table. \n",
      "   The United States is the lone superpower in the world today. And along with that awesome power comes responsibility to humankind. America's reason for maintaining its superpower status must be to export the best of our democratic system of governance and the hope of the American Dream to the rest of the world. But these cherished ideals cannot be exported through force. We must teach and lead by example  \n",

Many of my colleagues have introduced bills that would redeploy our troops in a responsible manner within a reasonable time frame, while focusing on aggressive diplomatic efforts to stabilize the Middle East. A number of these bills and resolutions establish concrete benchmarks for the Iraqi government. It is long overdue for this Administration to start paying attention to these alternative proposals, that chart a new course in Iraq. I believe that we must redefine our mission in Iraq. We must bring an end to our military occupation and replace it with a program of humanitarian relief, political stabilization,and diplomatic engagement. We must participate in a robust regional diplomatic effort, including direct discussions with Syria and Iran, to promote stability in Iraq. And I think that effort would be well received by all Iraq's neighbors, because regardless of whether these countries are close allies of the United States, or not, Iraq's neighbors have more to gain if Iraq is stabilized and more to lose if it is not. \n",
      "   We must also heed the advice of many, including the Iraq Study Group, and acknowledge that other conflicts in the Middle East require our attention and leadership, if the region is to achieve lasting stability. Therefore, we must also initiate a new push for Arab-Israeli peace. \n",
      "   I believe Congress not only has the right, but the responsibility, to assert its constitutional role as a co-equal branch of government in overseeing the conduct of this war and bringing it to an end. Our Constitution explicitly authorizes Congress the power to declare war and to raise and support armies. If Congress is given the power to make wars, we must also exercise our power to end wars. In doing so, I believe all options, including using ``the power of the purse,'' should be on the table. \n",
      "   The United States is the lone superpower in the world today. Along with that awesome and unprecedented power comes responsibilities to humankind. America's reason for maintaining her superpower status must be to export the best of our democratic system of governance and the hope of the American Dream to the rest of the world. But these cherished ideals can't be exported through force. We must teach and lead by example. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, while I support the resolution, I strongly believe Congress needs to do more to represent the will of the people and pursue all options that would lead to an end to this occupation and this war.  \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Filner. \n",
      "   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 855, the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act that I introduced earlier this year. This bill fixes an inequity in the current paired organ statute that has resulted in a denial of appropriate disability compensation to blinded veterans. \n",
      "   Congress has rightly recognized that some human organs or limbs are designed to work in pairs: legs, hands, kidneys, lungs, ears and, of course, eyes. In the instance of eyes, blindness in one eye profoundly affects depth perception even if sight is fully retained in the other eye. The paired organ statute was written to assist those veterans who experience a service-connected loss of a paired organ or limb. The statute recognizes the interdependency of paired organs and endeavors to treat the combined disability created by a nonservice-connected loss, injury or degeneration of the remaining paired organ or limb as though it was the result of a service-connected disability. In general, the paired organ statute accomplishes this task, with the exception of its treatment of eyes and loss of sight. \n",
      "   I want to share with you the story of Dr. James Allen, after whom this legislation is named. Dr. Allen is a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine in my district. He has worked at the Veterans Affairs Hospital for 33 years and treated numerous eye patients, including veterans who are blind. \n",
      "   One example is Mr. Donald May. Don is a World War II veteran who lost his right eye in a hand grenade explosion. A few years ago, Mr. May became legally blind in the nonservice-connected left eye. He applied to the Department of Veterans Affairs for help and was denied further benefits. He was told that the current law in regard to paired organs did not apply to him, even though he was legally blind in his service-connected right eye. \n",
      "   After Dr. Allen brought the plight of his patients to my attention, I began to research why these veterans were being denied the benefits I felt they deserved, benefits that I believe Congress intended to grant them. Through my work with the Blinded Veterans Association, we discovered that while the current paired organ statute covers blindness, in practice few, if any, veterans have ever been able to qualify for such compensation. \n",
      "   In theory, the statute provides that a veteran who is service-connected for blindness in one eye could qualify for additional disability compensation if they become blind in the remaining eye for nonservice-connected reasons. However, the statute does not define the term ``blindness,'' nor is any provision made for impairment of vision in the nonservice-connected eye short of blindness. \n",
      "   Rather than using visual acuity of 20/200 or loss of field of vision to 20 degrees as the definition of legal blindness that has been adopted by all 50 States and the Social Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs uses a much more restrictive definition, 5/200, as a rating for legal blindness, which in rough layman's term is the equivalent of having an eye with light perception only. As a result, few, if any, blinded veterans are able to qualify for additional compensation under the paired organ statute. \n",
      "   H. Res. 855, the Dr. James Allen Veterans Vision Equity Act, fixes this problem. It defines blindness as impairment of vision where the impairment is to a visual acuity of 20/200 or less or of a peripheral field loss of vision of 20 degrees or less. This change in the law would only affect a small percentage, estimated to be roughly 5 percent of the 13,000-plus veterans who are service-connected for loss of vision in one eye. Yet such a change would send a powerful message that our Nation's blinded veterans and the hardships that they have faced are not forgotten. \n",
      "   Indeed, our Nation's blinded veterans face significant challenges in the labor market. The National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research found that for individuals with visual impairments, to the extent that they are unable to read letters, the employment rate is only 30.8 percent, compared to 82.1 percent for those without disability. \n",
      "   I want to mention that this resolution complies with the PAYGO rules. The costs associated with H. Res. 855 are fully offset. This bill directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to match and compare VA needs-based pension benefits data, parents' dependency and indemnity compensation data, health care services data and unemployability compensation data with the National Directory of New Hires maintained by DHHS, for the purpose of determining eligibility for such benefits and services. According to the GAO, such data matching will help reduce fraud and abuse within the VA system as it determines eligibility and benefits to those veterans thought to be unemployable but are indeed working. \n",
      "   I would like to just thank Chairman Filner, Subcommittee Chairman John Hall, as well as Congressmen John Boozman and Vic Snyder for their unwavering support of this bill. I also want to thank the staff of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for their help in advancing this legislation. \n",
      "   H. Res. 855 is a modest but important step in restoring fair treatment to those veterans blinded due to their service to our country and to further our commitment to them. Their sacrifices and their service to this Nation should be matched by our desire to improve the quality of life for them and their families. \n",
      "   Earlier this year, the Blinded Veterans Association had found over 200 soldiers returning from Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom who are blinded in one eye due to their service-related injuries. They could be benefited in the future by this legislation. \n",
      "   I strongly encourage all my colleagues to support H. Res. 855. \n",

I was asked to describe exactly what that 5/200 means.

      "   Madam Chairman, in the United States, the law forbids discrimination in employment on the basis of a person's race, color, sex, religion or national origin. It forbids discrimination based on age or disability, perceived or real. These protections were not easy to achieve, but we are better for them. \n",

      "   We have worked steadily over the years to rid our Nation of irrational hate and fear against gay and transgender Americans that too often results in violent hate crimes, ostracism, bullying and discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations or education. \n",
      "   Today, at least 282 cities and towns and 19 States across the country have protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation in both public and private sector jobs. And more than 93 local jurisdictions in 11 States have laws that include protections based on gender identity. \n",

      "   I rise today in support of the Crane Conservation Act of 2008, legislation to help protect and preserve the world's 15 species of cranes for generations to come. Cranes are the most endangered family of birds in the world, with 11 of the world's 15 crane species at risk of extinction. Their special characteristics and unique ability to bring people together across cities, States, and international boundaries places them in a class worthy of our conservation efforts. \n",
      "   Cranes are revered throughout the world for their beauty, grace, and long-distance migrations, frequently spanning numerous countries. In fact, their appeal is so vast that they figure prominently in the culture, folklore, and art of many people around the world. They are featured in the silks, sculpture, poetry, and folk tales of many cultures. And, because of their long life spans, they have become symbols of longevity and good fortune. \n",
      "   These magnificent birds have served as ambassadors of harmony and peace in the international arena. Representatives from nations with various political struggles have reached beyond the instability to address the conservation of cranes. In fact, just about a year ago, representatives from bordering nations, including India, China, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and others, met in an attempt to overcome strained relations and send a message of goodwill for the sake of protecting this threatened species. Similarly, African nations which share troubled borders have also joined together in recent years to stop the illegal trade of cranes. \n",
      "   In North America, the whooping crane is the rarest of the crane species. Back in 1941, only 21 whooping cranes existed in the entire world. Today, there are almost 400 birds in existence. The resurgence is attributed to the birds' tenacity for survival and to the efforts of conservationists in the United States and Canada. In fact, since 2001, coordinated efforts have focused on encouraging young whooping cranes to migrate from their breeding grounds in Wisconsin's Necedah National Wildlife Refuge to their winter destination in Florida. In an effort to reintroduce migratory flocks into their historic range in the eastern United States, the recovery team used ultralight aircraft to train and lead the young cranes on their spectacular journey stretching from city to city and State to State. Fortunately, these efforts have been successful, and the Crane Conservation Act would complement them, both domestically and internationally. \n",
      "   The bill will provide the resources to support initiatives to protect cranes and their habitats, which have deteriorated due to industrial development, pollution, and other human disturbances, including wars. \n",
      "   The bill will also provide the means for the United States to fulfill various international obligations and commitments, thus having a large environmental and cultural impact across the globe. Additionally, the Crane Conservation Act will provide resources for the United States to bring people and governments around the world together to protect ecosystems, develop adequate habitats, and encourage overall goodwill. Specifically, the Crane Conservation Act will authorize up to $5 million per year to be distributed in the form of conservation project grants to protect cranes and the wetlands and grassland ecosystems on which they depend. \n",
      "   Congress has passed similar bills in support of globally significant and endangered wildlife species, including tigers, rhinos, elephants, and neotropical migratory birds. And just as these efforts took significant steps in international wildlife conservation, the Crane Conservation Act would play a similar and promising role in improving endangered wildlife and their habitats. \n",

      "    Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. \n",
      "    All Americans deserve access to affordable, comprehensive health care--to meet both their physical and mental needs. I believe that Americans should be provided comprehensive coverage for mental health services. Mental illness and substance abuse are real and treatable health problems--just like hypertension, cancer and heart disease; yet millions of hardworking men and women still find that their health plans place strict limits on coverage for mental health benefits. \n",
      "    I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 1424. This bill will finally provide for equity in coverage of mental health and substance-related disorders. \n",
      "    We know all too well the inequities that currently exist for those seeking mental health care and substance-related care. They are subjected to higher co-payments, higher deductibles, and more restrictive treatment limits. \n",
      "    I have heard hundreds of heart-wrenching stories from my constituents in Wisconsin about the effects that these inequities have had on their families. \n",
      "    One woman's story was especially poignant about the inequities of the current system. In the same year, both her husband and her daughter required major medical care because of life-threatening conditions. One had a disease of the kidneys, and one suffered from severe clinical depression. Both patients required emergency visits and extended treatment. Both patients were compliant and followed their doctor's treatment instructions. Both patients were covered under the same family policy. \n",
      "    But the insurance paid for twice as much of the costs associated with the kidney disease than they did for the severe depression, because depression is a mental illness. \n",
      "    And while her husband underwent multiple treatments for his kidney disease, her daughter was told after a few psychiatric visits that her insurance would not pay anything toward further visits because she had used up her allotted number of visits for the year. \n",
      "    These higher patient costs and treatment limits are unconscionable. I am delighted that H.R. 1424 will require equity in financial commitments and equity in treatment limits for mental health and substance-related disorders as compared to medical and surgical benefits. In addition, it will prohibit discrimination by diagnosis and provide Americans with the same mental health coverage that Members of Congress have. \n",
      "    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 1424. \n",

      "   In lieu of offering an amendment this evening, I appreciate the opportunity to briefly share with Members a concern regarding the education title of this bill. I have learned that taxpayer dollars in this bill, combined with taxpayer dollars at the State and local level, are used to purchase textbooks printed and manufactured in countries that censor these teaching materials. \n",
      "   Madam Chairman, one of the consequences of outsourcing to cheaper labor sources overseas is that an increasingly large number of American textbooks and educational materials are printed overseas, especially in China, a country which the State Department's 2006 Country Report on Human Rights concludes actively censors all publications. \n",
      "   The State Department's Human Rights report reads, ``By law, only government-approved publishing houses are permitted to print books. The State Press and Publications Administration controls all licenses to publish. The Chinese Communist Party exerts control over the publishing industry by preemptively classifying certain topics as off limits.'' \n",
      "   In addition, ``the government does not respect academic freedom and increases controls on political and social discourses at colleges, universities, and research institutes.'' \n",
      "   Madam Chairman, the Chinese Government is forcing the same censorship on American students and teachers, and let me just explain how this happens. \n",
      "   An American publishing company develops a textbook or any educational material and decides to print it overseas because they can save on printing costs by doing so. But the material content will be censored by the government-sanctioned publishing houses to conform to Chinese requirements. The Dalai Lama, Tiananmen Square, and balanced discussions of Tibet, political freedoms and descriptions of democratic participation and public protest will intentionally be left on the cutting room floor. \n",
      "   And then a well-meaning, well-prepared unsuspecting teacher or school district buys this textbook for their classroom, a textbook which contains no mention of the Dalai Lama and a decidedly altered discussion of politics and culture, even American politics and culture because Chinese censorship laws do not discriminate between Chinese and American texts and contexts. \n",
      "   And ultimately public funds meant to educate our children are simultaneously suppressing human rights and freedoms, and limiting exposure and curriculums on important topics of history, politics and culture. \n",
      "   The same situation exists, with far more harmful consequences, for teacher manuals because if a lesson does not exist in the teacher's curriculum, chances are that the students won't be taught that lesson. \n",
      "   Madam Chairman, the lesson that our students truly need to learn, and which must not be censored, is that State-sponsored censorship should not be supported with public dollars. I hope that my colleagues will join me in future efforts to teach our schoolchildren that ethics and morals and their education are more important, and more valuable, than cheap labor and production costs. \n",

      "   Studies show that 1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men will be a victim of rape or attempted rape in their lifetime and that, on average, a person is sexually assaulted in the United States every 2 1/2 minutes. In my State of Wisconsin, there were 5,628 sexual assaults reported in the year 2004, the last year statistics are available. This marks a 3.7 percent increase from the previous year. Nationwide, we know that children and young adults are most at risk. Forty-four percent of sexual assault victims are under the age of 18, and 80 percent are under the age of 30. \n",
      "   Although most victims are younger women, the effects of sexual assault cross all racial, social, religious, ethnic, and economic boundaries. Whether the crime is rape, incest, child sexual abuse, stalking, or sexual harassment, sexual assault impacts our schools, our workplaces, our streets, and our homes. Survivors are our sons, our daughters, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our grandparents. \n",
      "   In addition to the physical effects of victimization, the emotional scars felt by sexual assault survivors may persist long after the physical scars have healed. Sexual violence costs an estimated $127 billion per year in medical expenses, lost productivity, treatment of psychological trauma, and pain and suffering. Yet we know that only 41 percent of sexual assault survivors pursue prosecution by reporting their attack to law enforcement officials, and despite the support services offered by the National Sexual Assault Hotline and more than 1,000 crisis centers across the Nation, fewer than 50 percent of survivors ever tell anyone about their experience. These statistics are staggering and unconscionable. Despite the alarming prevalence of sexual assault, there is a clear and significant need for more public education and awareness. \n",
      "   National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month does just this. Observed each year in April, this dedicated month provides a special opportunity to educate Americans about sexual violence and to encourage the prevention of sexual assault, the improved treatment of its survivors, and the prosecution of its perpetrators. \n",
      "   As part of the National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, we recognize national and community organizations, as well as private sector supporters, for their work in promoting awareness about sexual assault. We also applaud public safety, law enforcement, and health professionals for their hard work and innovative strategies to increase the percentage of sexual assault cases that result in the prosecution and incarceration of offenders. \n",
      "   Along with my colleague, Congressman TED POE from Texas, I introduced House Concurrent Resolution 330 to recognize April 2008 as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. By supporting this resolution, we highlight the efforts of individuals and agencies that provide rape crisis intervention and prevention services. We also call attention to sexual violence as a major public health issue and raise awareness of the need for increased resources for preventing sexual violence. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, I want to quickly extend my thanks to a number of advocates for their work on sexual assault prevention. In Wisconsin, we are incredibly lucky to have the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault working to create the social change necessary to end sexual violence. My thanks to the Coalition and their member organizations across the State for the important work that they do. \n",
      "   Since the first national observance of Sexual Assault Awareness Month in 2001, many Members of Congress have been actively involved in ensuring congressional support for efforts to raise awareness around sexual violence. I wholeheartedly thank all the cosponsors of this bipartisan resolution for once again lending their names to this worthy cause. \n",
      "   Finally, I want to extend my sincerest thank you to my colleague, Congressman TED POE, for his strong support as the lead sponsor of this resolution. Mr. Poe has been a dedicated advocate for victims and victims' rights in this Congress, and I have very much admired his commitment to ending sexual violence in all forms. Thank for your hard work and leadership on this resolution. \n",
      "   Although we have made significant progress, we still have far to go in eradicating the harm inflicted on our community by sexual assault. I urge all of my colleagues to fully support this resolution recognizing the National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. \n",

      "   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the CHAMP Act, and our chairmen who have worked so hard to craft this bill deserve great credit. It is a very strong measure. \n",
      "   There are many reasons to support this bill, but chief among them is the fact that this bill will provide health care coverage for an additional 5 million low income children, bringing the total to 11 million insured infants and children covered under SCHIP. This represents real progress at reducing America's 46.6 million uninsured people, and I am proud to support this progress. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, I am also proud to note that the CHAMP Act does not pit children against seniors, as has been suggested by many of the Republicans, but instead works to improve health care for both children and seniors. \n",
      "   The bill includes many investments in Medicare that will directly benefit the health of our seniors. The bill includes a physician fix so that our doctors will not be subjected to the harsh 10 percent scheduled cut in reimbursement, and, providing this fix will ensure that beneficiaries have continued access to their physicians. \n",
      "   In addition, this bill provides many more protections to Medicare beneficiaries by expanding and improving the programs which ensure that Medicare remains affordable to those with lower income. The CHAMP Act also expands access to preventative benefits and mental health benefits for all Medicare seniors. \n",
      "   But back to my first point. If this Congress stands for anything, it should stand for children, for providing them with comprehensive health care, for giving them the support and care they need for a healthy life.  \n",
      "   I am reminded of the first day of this session when Speaker Pelosi invited all the children to join her at the podium. This Congress should be judged based on how we protect our Nation's children. That is this vote.     \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, the House today has a historic opportunity to expand upon the principles of equal rights and equal protection embodied in our Constitution by passing the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. \n",
      "   This Act would offer Federal protections for victims of hate crimes targeted because of their race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability. These characteristics are included in this hate crimes legislation, not because they deserve any special protection as opponents of this legislation claim, but because of the history of particularly heinous and violent crimes committed against individuals based on such characteristics. That's what warrants this inclusion. \n",
      "   I wanted to share several stories about why this legislation is so important. I only have time for one. Let us never forget the story of Matthew Shepard, who was brutally attacked by his hateful, homophobic assailants and left to die on a fence in a remote area of Wyoming. \n",
      "   Matthew's death generated international outrage by exposing the violent nature of hate crimes and its horrific effect on the entire targeted commune. The sponsors of the Senate hate crimes legislation have renamed the bill the Matthew Shepard Act. Today we have been joined by Matthew's mother, Judy Shepard and a lead investigator in this case, David O'Malley, who are still courageously advocating for the passage of this legislation more than 8 years after Matthew's death. \n",
      "   The passage of hate crimes legislation is long overdue. This will be critical for both symbolic and substantive reasons. The legal protections are essential to our system of ordered justice and essential for ensuring that those who commit heinous crimes are punished. But on a symbolic basis, it is important for Congress to enunciate clearly that hate-based violence targeting women, gays, lesbians, transgender individuals and people with disabilities will no longer be tolerated.  \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman CONYERS, Chairman SCOTT, and the staff of the Judiciary Committee for their diligent work in bringing the bill to the floor. \n",
      "   Hate crimes are different than other violent crimes because they seek to instill fear into a whole community--be it burning a cross in someone's yard, the burning of a synagogue, or a rash of aggravated batteries of people outside a gay community center. These are crimes motivated by prejudice and meant to send a message to society and others who  belong to the same category. This sort of domestic terrorism demands a strong, federal response because this country was founded on the premise that persons should be free to be who they are--without fear of violence. \n",
      "   I want to share with you a few reasons why the passage of this legislation is so urgent and necessary. Last week in Committee, we heard from a very young man, Mr. David Ritcheson, who was brutally beaten last year by two individuals due to his ethnicity as a Mexican-American. Mr. Ritcheson spent the next 3 months and 8 days in the hospital, recovering from severe internal injuries. Yet because the attack took place in a private yard rather than an area of public access, the FBI had no grounds to investigate the attack under existing hate crimes laws. \n",
      "   The story of Brandon Teena also demonstrates the need for this legislation. Dramatized in the movie ``Boys Don't Cry,'' Brandon was raped and later killed after the discovery of his biological gender by two acquaintances. Five days before his murder, Brandon reported his rape and beating by the same perpetrators, but the Richardson County Nebraska Sheriff would not pursue the case against Brandon's attackers. \n",
      "   Let us never forget the story of Matthew Shepard, who was brutally attacked by his hateful homophobic assailants and left to die on a fence in a remote area of Wyoming. Matthew's death generated international outrage by exposing the violent nature of hate crimes and its horrific effect on the targeted community. I remember the impact locally in Wyoming. I was in the midst of my first campaign for Congress in October 1998. Many gay and lesbian youths roughly Matthew's age were working on my campaign. I remember the impact of the crime on them. They were afraid for their safety, and that is precisely the effect these crimes have. The sponsors of the Senate hate crimes legislation have renamed the bill the \n",
      "   Matthew Shepard Act, and today we are joined by Matthew's mother Judy Shepard and the lead investigator in his case David O'Malley, who are still courageously advocating for the passage of this legislation more than 8 years after Matthew's tragic death. Mr. Speaker, the passage of hate crimes legislation is long overdue. \n",
      "   The passage of H.R. 1592 today will be critical for both substantive and symbolic reasons. The legal protections are essential to our system of ordered justice and essential for ensuring that those who commit these heinous crimes are punished ..... but on a symbolic basis, it is important for Congress to enunciate clearly that hate-based violence targeting women, gays and lesbians, transgender individuals, and people with disabilities will no longer be tolerated. \n",
      "   The opponents of this legislation will disseminate a lot of misinformation today in order to derail this bill. But make no mistake, the legislation we are considering today has been carefully crafted to protect an individual's First Amendment right to speech, expression, and association. It also provides much needed federal resources to local law enforcement authorities without usurping local authority. Finally, the bill is fully consistent with Supreme Court precedence on both First Amendment and interstate commerce cases. \n",
      "   Our society is not perfect; the passage of the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act will not make all hate crimes go away. H.R. 1592 is about giving state, local, and federal law enforcement authorities the necessary resources and tools to combat violent crimes based on prejudice and intended to terrorize a group of people or an entire community. Such hate crimes are in desperate need of a federal response, and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill.  \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3406, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Amendments Act. \n",
      "   This vital legislation restores the civil rights protections that Congress intended for people with disabilities in passing the ADA in 1990. In the years since passage of the ADA, courts--including the U.S. Supreme Court--have narrowed the protective reach of this law, undermining Congress' intent. It is flatly unacceptable that Americans who experienced disability-based discrimination have been denied protection of the ADA and barred from challenging discriminatory conduct. This bill is an important and necessary remedy, and I'm grateful to our champions in the House, Mr. HOYER and Mr. SENSENBRENNER, as well as Senator HARKIN and others who shepherded the ADA Amendments Act through the Senate. \n",
      "   Importantly, the ADA Amendments Act addresses the restrictive interpretation of what it means to have a ``disability'' and therefore be protected against disability discrimination. In Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, the Supreme Court ruled that the definition of disability must be read ``strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled'' and, to meet the definition, an individual must have an impairment that ``prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives.'' \n",
      "   Due to that and other narrow court interpretations, people with HIV who have been fired, not hired, or suffered other adverse employment actions have been denied the protections of the ADA. Although the ADA clearly intended to protect people living with HIV from being discriminated against based on having HIV, many have had their lawsuits derailed by disputes over whether they meet a narrowly interpreted definition of the term ``disability.'' For people living with HIV, all too often whether or not they could proceed with their discrimination claim has turned on the court's view of evidence as to their child-bearing ability and intentions: highly personal, intimate matters that are completely unrelated to the discrimination they experienced. \n",
      "   The ADA Amendments Act remedies the courts' misinterpretation of the ADA by explicitly stating that the definition of ``disability'' must be interpreted broadly to achieve the ADA's remedial purposes, by clarifying the definition of ``disability'' through examples of ``major life activities,'' and by providing that the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity must be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. Of significance for people living with HIV, among the listed examples of ``major life activities'' are ``functions of the immune system,'' as well as ``reproductive functions.'' Under these new provisions, many individuals who were incorrectly denied coverage under the ADA will now be protected from discrimination. Some examples follow: \n",
      "   Rubin Cruz Carrillo was fired from his job as a flight attendant 1 day after he told his employer that he had been diagnosed with HIV and asked to speak with his supervisors about this under ``strict confidentiality.'' Because he was fired immediately after disclosing his HIV \n",
      "   status, Rubin believed that the airline terminated him because of his disability and filed suit under the ADA. To show that his HIV infection ``substantially limits'' a ``major life activity,'' Rubin explained that he decided not to have children because of the risk of infecting his female partner or their resulting child through unprotected sexual intercourse. The trial judge discounted his testimony, saying that Rubin was ``not an expert in the medical field of immunology or reproduction.'' The court concluded that Rubin had not established that he had a ``disability'' because he failed to introduce medical evidence that HIV substantially limits a man's ability to reproduce. Therefore, the court ruled Rubin was not entitled to the protections of the ADA. \n",
      "   In contrast, another judge on the same Federal district court found that a female with HIV was entitled to ADA protection. Yesenia Rodriguez alleged that she was discharged  from an assignment because she had HIV. The court found that she was ``disabled'' under the meaning of the ADA, based on her testimony that she decided not to have more children due to the possibility of transmitting HIV to her child if she did. \n",
      "   Other courts have granted summary judgment for employers (dismissing discrimination claims) on the grounds that the employee with HIV did not establish that his HIV was a ``disability.'' For example, Fabio Gutwaks'' discrimination claim was dismissed after the court concluded that he had failed to establish that he was substantially limited in the major life activity of reproduction because he testified that he did not currently, or previously, desire to father children. Similarly, Albenjamin Blanks' claim was dismissed after he testified that he and his wife had decided not to have any more children long before the discriminatory conduct occurred and that his wife had undergone a procedure to prevent her from having any more children. \n",
      "   The ADA was meant to prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities. Yet, many people with HIV have been denied coverage under the ADA and therefore left without any legal recourse against discrimination. Under the ADA Amendments Act, these men and women will all be assured legal protection for discrimination based on their HIV status, irrespective of their child-bearing intentions or lack of expert testimony about HIV's impact on child-bearing. \n",
      "   By passing the ADA Amendments Act, we reaffirm the right for American workers--including any American living with HIV--to be judged based upon their skills, talents, loyalty, character, integrity and work ethic. I am pleased to support this bill to ensure that all Americans have a fair opportunity to work.  \n",

      "   The scientific advancement that has been made in sequencing the human genome is groundbreaking. We have only just begun to understand how we can harness the vast amount of information that is included in our genetic code to benefit human health and longevity. The ability to predict disease will greatly increase our opportunities for early treatment and prevention efforts and this can have a real impact on people's lives. \n",
      "   So I am proud to support the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. This bill will provide strong protections to prevent employers and insurers from denying health coverage or job opportunities on the basis of predictive genetic information. Providing this protection will ensure that Americans are not unfairly penalized, either by health insurers or by employers, for something that is a part of their genetic makeup. In addition, these protections will encourage individuals to participate in genetic research, which will lead to new technologies and new therapies. \n",
      "   This important nondiscrimination protection is necessitated by the advancements in science, like the mapping of the human genome.

      "   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I rise tonight one month after our Nation recognized Cover the Uninsured Week to draw attention to a national crisis, and that is the crisis of the uninsured. This crisis affects all Americans, and so for the fifth straight year, I have reserved this hour to highlight the issue of the uninsured. \n",
      "   Madam Speaker, I believe that all Americans have a right to affordable and comprehensive health care. But unfortunately, according to the Census Bureau, 47 million Americans are without health insurance. Millions more encounter a health care system that is inadequate in meeting their basic medical needs because they are underinsured. \n",
      "   According to a recent Commonwealth Foundation study, there are 16 million Americans who are underinsured, meaning their insurance did not adequately protect them against catastrophic health care expenses. That means that 63 million Americans, or one-in-five Americans, have either no health insurance, have only sporadic coverage, or have health insurance coverage that leaves them exposed to high health care costs. \n",
      "   Additionally, even those with health care coverage are faced with rising health care costs. As our economy continues to falter and the price of food and gas rises, high health care costs are straining more and more family budgets. The lack of affordable comprehensive health care affects every congressional district in the Nation. \n",
      "   To highlight this issue and the real impact that is being--that being uninsured has on the lives of Americans, I have reserved this time to share some of the letters that I have read in my office from constituents who have had difficulty in obtaining and affording comprehensive health care coverage. \n",
      "   Too often here in Congress, we speak of health care issues and the antiseptic jargon of policymakers and lawyers. We talk about Medicare Part D and insurance risk pools, but people across America are hurting. And these letters tell their stories in their own words. \n",
      "   I represent a district in south-central Wisconsin, and while the letters I read may be from Wisconsinites, they speak to the difficulties that people all over America face every day. \n",
      "   I'm going to start with a few letters about the ever-increasing price of health care. \n",
      "   Vickie in Beloit, Wisconsin, writes, ``I am a 51-year-old woman, and was recently in the hospital. I have no insurance and my bill was almost $22,000. I was unconscious when I was taken there by ambulance, so I didn't know they were going to run all of these tests which were going to be the biggest part of my bill. I really have no idea how I'm going to pay this. I inquired about health insurance about 6 months ago, and it was over $700 a month.'' \n",
      "   Ross in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, writes to me, ``I am 78 years old. My wife is 82. We have Medicare part A, B, and D and supplemental insurance. There is so much that is not covered that we spend ALL our Social Security on medical costs and stuff that Medicare doesn't cover, like hearing aids and dental bills. If we didn't have some income besides our Social Security, we would both be in a nursing home, but I am not sick.'' \n",
      "   Michael in Poynette, Wisconsin, writes that ``I am a Federal employee and a member of the Wisconsin Air National Guard. This past year we were granted a wage increase of roughly 2.3 percent. At the same time, the cost of our Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan benefit increased by up to 44 percent. Along with this, many of the co-pays also increased. This has put a tremendous strain on my colleagues in the Wisconsin Air National Guard, many who have been deployed three or more times in support of operations throughout the Middle East region.'' \n",
      "   Ed in Monroe, Wisconsin, writes, ``My wife and I live in the gap. Between our Social Security and the disability policy she had, we get too much money to qualify for help, but not enough to really get by. With the donut hole in Medicare D, we would only be able to get my wife's meds for three months if it were not for samples provided by her doctors. Four out of her 10 meds would take 65 percent of our total income if it were not for the help of that doctor. I live with chronic pain because of a cancer treatment, but as the years go by, it helps less and I have other medical problems that are gradually getting worse. I have a wife and a son that I have to take care of because neither can do it all for themselves. I am the one who battles with Social Security and the insurance companies. I have to deal with problems that arise with their medications, their finances and many day-to-day things. Every time I hear a politician talk about cutting Medicare and other programs for the elderly and disabled, it scares me to death because I am just hanging on by a thread.'' \n",
      "   Glen in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, writes, ``My wife and I are retired and are on Medicare and supplemental insurance with drug coverage through my former employer. Our monthly cost for both is about $1,050 a month. With next year's increase, it will take my whole monthly pension to pay for our health insurance. It's like an adjustable rate mortgage that only increases.'' \n",
      "   Sue in Beloit, Wisconsin, writes, ``My husband was diagnosed with lung cancer. After treatment began, we found out that the insurance company had a small loophole for the treatment of cancer. Under our insurance, they have a $13,000 limit per year on radiation and chemotherapy. That amount did not even cover the first treatment of either radiation or chemo. I was not going to have my husband die for lack of treatment, so we started to use our savings and available credit to pay for  medical expenses. My husband later died. After having completely depleted our savings and facing insurmountable credit card debt, I had no choice but to file bankruptcy last year.''     \n",
      "   Michelle in Middleton writes: ``My sister had been diagnosed with a possible brain tumor. She has a job with minimal pay and minimal insurance. It pays for the first $1,000 of medical costs per year and then the patient is to pay the next $5,000 before it kicks in again. She cannot afford this. She has already incurred the $1,000 of cost and bills are piling up. She has no idea how she will ever pay for all of the medical care she has needed and the stress is huge. Medical care should be a right of all. We all pay if prevention and early intervention don't happen.'' \n",
      "   Michelle brings up an important point in her letter because people without comprehensive health insurance are often not getting the care that they desperately need. A recent study released by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that cost prevented 41.1 percent of uninsured adults from seeing a doctor that they needed to see. \n",
      "   Madam Speaker, I'd like to next focus on the connection between employment and health care. Only about 40 percent of businesses who employ low-wage or part-time workers offer health benefits. And at $11,480 per year, the average family's health insurance premium now costs more than a minimum-wage worker makes in a whole year. \n",
      "   And as we all know, the costs of health care are rising far faster than inflation. Between 2000 and 2006, health premiums for employer-sponsored insurance jumped 87 percent, far outpacing inflation's 18 percent overall increase over the same period of time. \n",
      "   Many of my constituents feel trapped. Either they cannot find jobs that offer good health care benefits, or they do have jobs that offer health insurance but they feel that they can't leave those jobs for fear of losing that health insurance. \n",
      "   Lisa in Beloit, Wisconsin, writes me. She says: ``My husband and I have been without insurance on and off for the last 8 months. My husband is diabetic and his insulin can run up to $500 a month, not to mention all the other medications he takes. Thank God for the VA and their assistance. So we are managing with his health issues, but I have not had any well-woman check-ups in a long time because I either had no insurance or the work I was doing, I couldn't get any time off to go to a doctor. I have made quite a few job changes in the last year to find the right fit for me, and I feel that I have finally found one, but my concern is that why do we have to suffer health-wise? Why do I have to rely on employers for benefits and be at their mercy, employment-wise, in order to obtain health care?'' \n",
      "   Carolyn from Madison, Wisconsin, writes: ``In 2002, I left my full-time job to pursue my dream of having my own business. Unable to afford COBRA, I looked around for affordable insurance with a high deductible. Imagine my surprise when five companies turned me down because of my controlled hypertension and 30 pounds overweight. I struggled for over a year, paying $150 a month for medication at the pharmacy. I developed extremely painful neuropathy in my feet and was unable to seek medical treatment for the condition because I had no insurance. So I just suffered, and I do mean suffered. After more than a year of endless suffering, I had no choice but to take a part-time job driving a school bus so that I could get health insurance. Eventually I had to give up my business because I no longer had the strength or energy to handle a growing business as well as a part-time job.'' \n",
      "   Frank in Madison, Wisconsin, writes: ``I'm a 42-year-old male who has diabetes. I cannot get private health care coverage due to my illness. Two years ago, I stepped out of a corporate job to start my own business to fulfill a dream. I was not prepared for the fact that I would not be able to purchase a private health care policy for myself, due to my preexisting condition of diabetes. After 2 years of self-employment and lack of adequate health care coverage, I have no choice but to let go of my dream to own my own business and go back to working for a corporation so I can again receive health care coverage.'' \n",

I could not take just any job I wanted. It was so nice when he turned 65 and was able to get Medicare. I was able to take a job that offered a plan for just singles. Since starting this job, I have had significant health issues. I have tried to keep working because I will be unable to find insurance and I can't afford the COBRA payments. I realize that there are people worse off. But I find it so difficult some days to have to come to work; if I work part-time, I would have no insurance to cover my health expenses.'' \n",

      "   Greg in Verona, who owns a small business, wrote me recently. He writes: ``Since 1998, we've been providing health care to our employees. Every year, we've had double-digit increases in our costs. This year, the insurance company has informed us that we'll be paying 42 percent more next year, which will lead to one of several eventualities: \n",
      "   ``1. We'll have to reduce what we cover as a benefit for our employees and hopefully retain them. Reality is, many will leave and we'll have trouble replacing them. \n",
      "   ``2. We'll eat the increase but offer no employee raises for the next 3 years. \n",
      "   ``3. We'll raise our prices and force customers to look elsewhere for the services that we currently provide them. \n",
      "   ``The very real possibility is we'll end up with some element of all of the scenarios and end up not being able to keep the doors open. Very scary thought when one considers that my business has been around for 55 years.'' \n",
      "   Madam Speaker, I also get many letters from constituents who are nearing 65 but are not yet eligible for Medicare. I'd like to share some of their stories with you, too. \n",
      "   Daniel in Madison, Wisconsin, writes: ``I am close to 57 and the combination of my disability and age are making work more difficult all the time. I have been thinking about retirement, but I found that if I do retire, I would lose my medical assistance that I count on for my medical needs. This is due to the fact that I would receive a small State pension. Pensions are considered unearned income, even though the pension was part of our compensation for working. One cannot have any unearned income and receive medical assistance. This seems very unfair. People with disabilities have a difficult time getting employed if they need benefits. Now I find it's just as hard to stop working and retain the needed medical benefits.'' \n",
      "   Marilyn in Oregon, Wisconsin, writes: ``Tammy, I am writing you this e-mail to let you know how frustrated I am with the health insurance coverage in this country, especially for people over 50. I recently lost my job. I did not reach my retirement age. I was only 2 years away. My husband and I have had to use our life savings to pay $700 a month for health insurance. I just received a letter that the premium is going to go up next year $60 a month. My only choice is to cancel, since we have used up almost all of our savings. My husband and I do not know what to do for health insurance anymore.'' \n",
      "   Charlotte in Baraboo, Wisconsin, writes: ``I am 54 years old and work 40 hours a week. A lot of jobs in our area have health care but might as well not offer any. It is really bad insurance. I know a lot of people in their 50s that have health problems that make it very hard for them to continue working, but they have to in order to have insurance for their health problems. Many of them would like to retire.'' \n",
      "   Madam Speaker, simply put, our health care system is failing and America knows this. Among the thousands of letters regarding health care that I receive, there is a common thread, a common theme that binds them together; and that common theme is an overwhelming frustration with a system they know just is not working and a call for those of us in Congress to take action. \n",
      "   Here are some more stories. Michael in Burlington, Wisconsin, writes: ``My late daughter was diagnosed with lymphangiomatosis and Gorham's vanishing bone disease in March 2005. We  found out how much a child with a terminal illness costs a person. My wife and I used every amount of credit and refinanced our house three times just to take care of her. Since her death, the bills mounted so bad that now we will have to file bankruptcy and we have already been foreclosed on our home. \n",
      "   ``Secondly, my wife was born with a hole in her heart. In 1972, the doctors repaired the hole. In doing so, through the blood transfusion they gave her hepatitis C. Now she is preexisting at 37 and can't get life insurance and has been repeatedly denied health care coverage. Her mental breakdown because of the death of our daughter left the insurance companies another reason not to let her have health care. This needs to change.'' \n",
      "   Sherry in Lake Delton, Wisconsin, writes: ``I live in a place where most jobs are low quality and low paying and don't offer health insurance benefits. I have had jobs on occasion that have offered insurance, but they have never lasted due to the fact that this area prefers to believe that you are not entitled to a life if you work here. In 1995, I gave birth to my first and only child. In my quest to find employment that would allow me to afford raising my child and pay enough for me to support her without working 18 hours a day, I met my future husband. I was employed when I sustained a work injury that went through on workman's comp. I was left with an injury that was never addressed and bills that workman's comp refused to pay. This injury has prevented me from even applying for better jobs, as the physical pain prevents me from performing many tasks that I have done in the past. My inability to bring a decent income to our home has created major stress on my husband. My marriage is falling apart daily due to health problems and my inability to support my husband. I tried to apply for Badger Care, Wisconsin's Medicaid program, and was told that we slightly exceeded the limits for a family of three, but if I was willing to leave my marriage and my home, that they would be more than happy to give me everything that was available. This just doesn't make any sense.'' \n",
      "   Cindy from Fitchburg, Wisconsin, writes: ``I was in a motorcycle accident in Wyoming in 2004. The driver lost control on a gravel road. I ended up on the bottom of a mountain. I was found unconscious and covered in blood. Unfortunately, the people I was with didn't take me to a hospital. It wasn't until I was driven back to Wisconsin that I was taken to a hospital. When I did go to the hospital, doctors told me I should have died. \n",
      "   ``My company where I worked had been sold just prior to this trip to Wyoming. I was supposed to start a new job when I returned. During that transition, I had just a few months without health insurance. I could not afford COBRA at $426 a month along with rent. \n",
      "   ``The ER in Wisconsin did a CAT scan and recommended that I follow up with my doctor. At this point, I had problems talking, walking, and was in a great deal of pain. I had to give up my apartment and move in with a friend. I was able to continue my health care with COBRA paying for it with my unemployment. But once my unemployment ended so did my ability to pay for health insurance. My savings and 401(k) are all gone. \n",
      "   ``My condition worsened without medical treatment. I had tried to get medical assistance, but was refused because I have no dependents and have not been diagnosed as terminal. I had applied for SSDI, which now takes 2 to 3 years for approval. \n",
      "   ``I have been left with no income, unable to work, no insurance, and no home. The doctors told me that it may be possible for me to work again, if I can resume my medical treatments. As of now, I have no chance.     \n",
      "   ``With private health insurance or universal health care, I may have been taken to the hospital the night of the accident instead of being left to die. I would have gotten the treatment needed to prevent my brain from swelling, which caused further damage I may not have had today. \n",
      "   ``If there were a mandatory law that people had to carry vehicle insurance, it might have also helped. If SSDI didn't have a 2 or 3-year waiting list, I may be able to get the health care and finances now for me to get better and return to work. If there were some dollars set aside for people without insurance, would my GP have helped? \n",

      "   Julie from Beloit, Wisconsin writes, ``I was just notified that my insurance company will be raising my house insurance by nearly $100 per year solely based on my credit report. Eight years ago, I had a sterling credit report; in fact, I was able to get a very low interest loan for the house that I bought because of it. Five years ago, I had a medical emergency which caused me to default on two credit cards and to create medical bills I have no hope of ever repaying. I had the choice between buying bandages and ointments, which are not covered by my insurance, for my legs or making my monthly credit card payments. I chose life. For as my doctors told me, I would have eventually lost my legs, if not my life, if I had not sought treatment. \n",
      "   ``I know it's legal for insurance companies to do this just as it is legal for businesses to do a credit report on potential employees, but that doesn't mean it's right. I can see the point, to some extent, if poor credit rating were caused by irresponsibility. What I do not get is why people whose sole financial error was to have a health care crisis should be penalized for it. \n",
      "   ``It does not take a rocket scientist to see that this will affect the poor, the elderly, and the disabled the most, who are often already either underinsured or uninsured. As for me, I will have to raise my deductible substantially and seriously consider filing for bankruptcy in the hopes of eventually improving my credit rating.'' \n",

I recently sprained my ankle playing soccer and had to go to the emergency room for x-rays. My bill came out to $1,242.50 because I can only afford a measly insurance that has only catastrophic coverage. This is a ridiculous amount of money for such a visit, and it causes me to consider those less fortunate than me who have even more serious injuries and less familial support. This cost can truly make waves in the lives of people.'' \n",
      "   Suzanne from Stoughton, Wisconsin writes, ``It is time to have the government deal with health care. We are covered under COBRA, which will run out in March. The cost is going from $500 per month to $900 per month. We checked with Blue Cross, and they refused us coverage because of a preexisting condition. They will not even offer a waiver for this preexisting condition. We checked with the Wisconsin State Insurance Program, which will cover us for $1,200 a month. Please let people over 60 buy into Medicare. It is impossible to find a job that offers health insurance.'' \n",
      "   Silvia from Fitchburg, Wisconsin shared her story with me. Silvia was uninsured when she was hospitalized with the need for an appendectomy. Even after the hospital charity program reduced her bill, she still owed over $11,000 to the hospital. Sometimes bill collectors call her at home five times per day. Silvia chips away at the bills, sending $20 or $50 a month. \n",

We live a modest, middle class life, managing to always have what we need, except  health care.

I am grateful that we can afford this, but it does make a difference. Even now, if I have a sore throat, I will wait a few days to see how I feel. I will wait because if I don't need to go, I certainly need to save the money. This is disturbing to me as a nursing student because I know the importance of early treatment and prevention. And it's upsetting to me as a person because I value my health.

Just imagine how you would feel after being dismissed by this many companies. I was finally insured through disability and Medicare.

In January of this year, the company that I worked for informed us that they would be closing down. I was laid off in December while I was out due to my cancer treatments. I have been searching for health care everywhere because my COBRA will be going up, and I am on unemployment and am barely able to pay the $244.76 for the coverage now. I cannot get insurance because of the breast cancer. The high-risk insurance program in Wisconsin is too expensive for me to get coverage since they want 4 months of premiums up front, and they only cover some things. What are single people supposed to do? We don't qualify for any government assistance because we are single. We cannot go without insurance. There are no programs to help us out. So, when you are working on health care in the House of Representatives, please remember that there are other single people out there also in my shoes. I am at a crossroad because I have no avenue for assistance when it comes to health care. Come November, I will be unable to get coverage when I need it at this point in my life.'' \n",

There is nothing to help him get his shoulder fixed, but after it heals wrong and he is disabled because of it, then there are programs to help him. They will not help get it fixed so he could find a good job. Instead, they would rather support him for the rest of his life instead of trying to help him now.'' \n",

Long-term care is an often overlooked part of the continuum of care for many Americans, and many of us find ourselves ill informed and ill prepared to make choices for our own long-term care needs and those of our loved ones. \n",
      "   According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, long-term care represents a variety of services that include medical and nonmedical care for people who have a chronic illness or disability. Most long-term care is to assist people with the activities of daily living, such as dressing, bathing, and using the bathroom. It is important to remember that you may need long-term care at any age. The need for support and health services for persons who have diminished capacity for self-care is projected to strain both public and private resources. \n",
      "   Madam Speaker, H. Con. Res. 133 calls for public education about the need for long-term care so that people of all ages throughout our Nation are better prepared to meet their own long-term care needs.

Making the right decision about long-term care requires us to look at all of the options before us and to make informed decisions.  \n",

      "   A small but significant portion of children have visual impairments. It is estimated that vision impairment affects approximately 1.2 out of every 1,000 8-year-olds. When detected early, many childhood vision abnormalities are treatable, but the potential for correction and normal visual development diminishes with age. Vision problems can occur at any point during a lifetime, but tend to be particularly damaging to school-age children. \n",
      "   Impaired vision can result in adverse physical, emotional, and social consequences. For instance, a child may miss learning opportunities by failing to explore his or her environment. Additionally, if a child is visually impaired, he or she may be unable to imitate social behavior or understand nonverbal cues. \n",
      "   Early recognition of eye disease results in more effective treatment and that can be sight saving and sometimes even life saving. Yet, many children under the age of five do not receive any vision screening at all. \n",
      "   The Vision Care for Kids Act of 2007 would authorize a grant program to provide comprehensive eye exams for uninsured children with vision disorders, with priority for children under the age of 9. Funds would be used for treatment and services to correct vision disorders identified through eye exams and to increase public awareness of visual impairment in children. H.R. 507 would require States receiving funds to contribute a 25 percent match of funds for each Federal dollar obtained through the program. \n",

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, about 10 percent of new moms experience postpartum depression, a form of depression that can develop within the first 6 months after giving birth. \n",

Rarely, a more extreme form of depression known as postpartum psychosis can develop. Postpartum depression and psychosis can have an adverse effect on a woman's mental health and impair their ability to bond with their newborn child. \n",
      "   The legislation before us today will go a long way towards helping to increase awareness of postpartum depression and psychosis.

      "   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight during Cover the Uninsured Week to draw attention to a national crisis. \n",
      "   According to the Census Bureau, 46.6 million Americans are without health insurance. Millions more encounter a health care system that is inadequate in meeting their basic medical needs because they are underinsured. \n",
      "   According to a recent Commonwealth Fund study, there are 16 million Americans who are underinsured, meaning that their insurance did not adequately protect them against catastrophic health care expenses. That means, in total, 61 million Americans have either no health insurance or only sporadic coverage, or have insurance coverage that leaves them exposed to high health care costs. Sixty-one million Americans is nearly 21 percent of all Americans, one in five. \n",
      "   The lack of affordable, comprehensive health care affects every congressional district in this Nation. To highlight the issue and the real impact that being uninsured has on the lives of Americans, I have selected some letters that I have received from my constituents who have had difficulty in obtaining and affording comprehensive health care coverage. Too often here in Congress we speak of health care issues in antiseptic jargon of policymakers and lawyers. But people across America are hurting, and these letters tell their stories in their own words. \n",
      "   I represent a district in south central Wisconsin, and while the letters I read may be from the State of Wisconsin, they speak to the difficulties of people all over the United States, difficulties people face every day. I am going to start with a few letters about the ever-increasing price of health care. \n",
      "   Eva from Madison, Wisconsin writes: ``I am contacting you in regards to my desperate need for public health care. I am a grad student. I recently sprained my ankle playing soccer and had to go to the emergency room for x-rays. My bill came out to $1,242.50 because I can only afford measly insurance that only has catastrophic coverage. This is a ridiculous amount of money for such a visit, and it causes me to consider those less fortunate than me who have even more serious injuries and less familial support. This cost can truly make waves in the lives of people.'' \n",
      "   Suzanne from Stoughton, Wisconsin writes: ``It is time, time to have the government deal with health care. We are covered under COBRA, which will run out in March. The cost is going from $500 per month to $900 per month. We checked with Blue Cross, and they refused us coverage because of a preexisting condition. They will not even offer a waiver for this preexisting condition. We checked with the Wisconsin State Insurance Program, which will cover us for $1,200 per month. Please, let people over 60 buy into Medicare. It is impossible to find a job that offers health insurance.'' \n",
      "   And then there is the story of Sylvia from Fitchburg, Wisconsin. Sylvia was uninsured when she was hospitalized with a need for an appendectomy. Even after the hospital charity program reduced her bill, she still owed over $11,000 to the hospital. Sometimes the bill collectors call her at home five times a day. Sylvia chips away at this bill sending in the most she can, $20 to $50 a month. \n",
      "   Roberta from Janesville, Wisconsin writes: ``I think insurance bills for both medical and dental care are horrendous. Both my husband and I work full time, with two small children, living pay check to pay check. My insurance costs have caused us many heartaches, with us owing more money than what needs to be paid. As a result, I will not get a needed medical procedure done. Something drastically needs to change in the United States of America where hardworking individuals and families can get the treatment they need without going broke.'' \n",
      "   Roberta brings up an important point in her letter, because people without health insurance are often not getting the care that they desperately need. A recent study released by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that cost prevented 41.1 percent of uninsured adults from seeking a doctor when they needed to seek care. \n",
      "   But getting needed care is also difficult for Americans who have health insurance because of the financial strain relating to high premiums, high health care costs, increasing copays, deductibles. These place an incredible strain on American families, often forcing them to choose between needed health care and basic necessities like food.     \n",
      "   It is no wonder that illness, injury and medical debt is responsible for nearly 50 percent of all personal bankruptcies in the United States. Only about 40 percent of businesses who employ low-wage or part-time workers offer health benefits. And at $11,480 a year, the average family's health insurance premiums now cost more than a minimum wage worker makes in a year. And as we all know, the costs of health care are rising faster than inflation. Between 2000 and 2006, health premiums for employer-sponsored insurance jumped 87 percent, far outpacing inflation's 18 percent overall increase over the same period of time. \n",
      "   Patricia, from Madison, Wisconsin writes: We need to fix health care. I have to choose between heat and food and medications. I have lost 80 pounds because of this. Please help. \n",
      "   Heather, from Waterloo, Wisconsin writes: I am married and together with my husband I own a home. We live a modest, middle-class life, managing to always have what we need except for health care coverage. My husband has excellent health care at his job, but for me to also be covered by his plan, we would need to pay nearly $400 per month. That is two-thirds as much as our home mortgage. Through school, I have worked less and less in order to maintain health coverage, and I have only been able to afford short-term, major medical coverage. I am grateful that we can afford this, and it does make a difference. However, even now, I have a sore throat and I will wait for a few days to see how I feel. And I will wait because if I don't need to go, I will certainly save the money. This is disturbing to me, as a nursing student, because I know about the importance of early treatment and prevention. And it is upsetting to me as a person because I value my health. It is unacceptable to me as a citizen, because I know there are other people just like me who wait and get sicker or can't take the medications they need. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, simply put, our health care system is failing, and America knows this. Among the thousands of letters regarding health care that I receive, there is a common thread, a common theme that brings them together, and that common theme is an overwhelming frustration with the system, a system they know is just not working, and a call for us in Congress to take action, bold action. \n",
      "   Brad, from Mount Horeb, Wisconsin writes: I write to you today to urge you to take action on a growing crisis in America: health care. I strongly believe that we need a national health care plan to insure all Americans. My major concern with the current system is that when people attempt to obtain insurance, insurance companies refuse them because of past health history. Let's face it. Insurance companies are in business to make a profit. The best way to make a profit is to insure the healthy so you can minimize the claims you pay out, and not insure those who need medical care or may potentially need medical care. \n",
      "   Brad goes on to write: I am 38 years old, with a family of four. I currently participate in a health savings account. For all practical purposes, I pay all of my own medical needs, including the recent birth of our daughter. I recently attempted to switch insurance providers. The insurance companies will insure me, but they will not insure my daughter for any type of treatment for her asthma for 3 years, along with no drug coverage for life. The policy I was requesting had a $10,000 deductible, yet they still refused the coverage. \n",
      "   Lisa, from Madison, Wisconsin writes: I am a very healthy person, and my husband and children are very healthy. We cannot get insurance. I think everyone should attempt to gain an individual health policy just to see how impossible it is. I am not a risk. Really, I am not. I am terrified right now because we are uninsured. \n",
      "   Carol, from Madison, Wisconsin writes: As someone who has had no health insurance at all for 3 years, I can tell you that it was pretty miserable being one of the millions of people in this country without health insurance. Not long ago, my best friend died  at age 42 because of ovarian cancer because she did not have health insurance and waited too long to see what was causing all of her symptoms. Yes, people in America actually die from not having health insurance. \n",
      "   Darla from Fitchburg, writes me. She says, ``I lost my job because of unpredictable attendance due to my health issues. Upon losing my job I signed up for COBRA. Last week I received a letter indicating that my COBRA eligibility ends soon. In order for me to get health coverage, I would have to work at least 20 hours per week, but my physicians believe that it would do me more harm than good relating to my health issues. If I don't get some sort of health insurance, I will need to stop all treatments, as I have no money to pay for doctors' services. My prescription drugs will have to stop, as I will not be able to pay for them either. What can I do?'' Darla asks. \n",
      "   Kimberly, from Madison, Wisconsin writes to me, ``I am writing today because of my family's frustration and anxiety over health care. Although we hear a lot of rhetoric about making health care more affordable and/or more available for Americans, nothing is happening, at least not soon enough. \n",
      "   ``Let me briefly share our story,'' Kimberly proceeds. ``My husband recently started his own business. Obviously, it will take some time for his new company to see any profits, much less income. In the meantime, we are without health insurance. I am 5 months pregnant, and we have a 2-year-old son. Because of my preexisting condition, we cannot buy affordable health coverage. COBRA would cost us $1,200 per month. I am currently applying for Medicaid and other forms of public assistance as a last resort. This is ridiculous. \n",
      "   ``As someone with no insurance, I wonder what could possibly be the problem with implementing a public health care system. Oh, I have heard the horrible stories about having fewer choices in doctors or longer waiting lists for procedures and less incentive among doctors and researchers to develop new technologies. But what is most frightening to me is the chance that my son might get sick, or my baby might be born with expensive complications while we are uninsured. \n",
      "   ``I am not naive. I know that funding public health care is an issue. But is it wise to sacrifice the health and well-being of American citizens to avoid the challenge of implementing a change? I, for one, would be satisfied to pay more for goods and services if I could rest assured that my family's basic health care needs were being met.'' \n",
      "   David, from Cross Plains, Wisconsin writes, ``My wife and I have been self-employed for over 18 years, and have paid thousands of dollars for health insurance premiums. As of a few months ago, we had to drop out and are now without health insurance. The cost is completely out of reach. In fact, it is nuts. Now that I am 50 years old, it is not a matter of if I will have health problems, it is a matter of when. Tammy, we will lose everything we have ever worked for. So much for the American dream. Now we look forward to dying broke and possibly homeless.'' \n",
      "   Victor, from Stoughton, Wisconsin, writes, ``My wife can only work part time because of her health. Her employer offers a generic policy that costs only $3.97 per week and requires no background check. This policy covers basically nothing. Medical supplies, check-ups, doctors' visits necessary on a routine basis for my wife to survive are now not covered. My wife is uninsurable because of her health, and we have been turned down for health insurance that we have applied for. We cannot believe that this is happening.'' \n",
      "   Ronald, from Deerfield, Wisconsin writes, ``I was on COBRA insurance for 3 years, which ended this past fall. I spent from March until September trying to get private insurance, but could not because of my neck injury. I was, in effect, looked at and dismissed by 33 private insurance companies because of my preexisting condition with my neck injury. Imagine how you would feel, after being dismissed by this many companies. I was finally insured through disability and Medicare. The sad reality of it is that if I want to try to work full-time again, I cannot, because in doing so it would cost me the only insurance options that I have left. \n",
      "   ``The truth is that many other countries can and do provide equitable health insurance to all of their citizens, no matter what preexisting conditions they have, or their ability to pay, or what income level they have. I believe this country does have top-notch medical facilities, but not decent or equitable insurance for the poor and middle-income families. \n",
      "   Susan, from Baraboo, Wisconsin writes me, ``I am writing you today regarding health insurance coverage for single people with no children. As of this time, I feel that I am left out of the loop in regards to this topic. I am 42, and last September I was diagnosed with breast cancer. In January of this year, the company that I worked for informed us that they would be closing down. I was laid off in December while I was out due to my cancer treatment. I have been searching for health care coverage everywhere because my COBRA will be going up, and I am on unemployment and barely able to pay the $244.76 for the coverage now. I cannot get insurance because of the breast cancer. \n",
      "   ``The High Risk State Insurance Program, which is the Wisconsin program, is too expensive for me to get coverage, since they want 4 months of premiums up front, and as they only cover some things. What are single people supposed to do,'' Susan asks? ``We don't qualify for any government assistance because we are single. We cannot go without insurance. There are no programs to help us out. So when you are working on health care in the House of Representatives, please remember that there are other single people out there also in my shoes. I am at a crossroads because I have no avenue for assistance when it comes to health care. Come November, I will be unable to get coverage when I need it at this point in my life: \n",
      "   Janet from Portage, Wisconsin writes, ``I have a 53-year-old brother who has psoriasis all over his body and arthritis that is caused by this. Three weeks ago he fell and needs surgery on his shoulder to repair it. He has no job, no money, and no insurance. We started looking for a program to help him. There are none that we can find. There is nothing to get him help to get his shoulder fixed. But after it heals wrong and he is disabled because of it, then there are programs to help him. They won't help him get it fixed so he can find a good job. Instead, they would rather support him for the rest of his life instead of trying to help him now: \n",
      "   Gail, from Janesville, Wisconsin writes, ``My husband recently lost his job. He applied for over 100 positions, only to be told that he lacked a college degree, or he is overqualified, or that they can only pay $8 an hour. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in June of 1998, and again in 2003. I have gone through breast cancer twice, and have undergone a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. COBRA has run out, and without a stable income, we cannot afford to pay the premiums for our own health care policy. My husband is 59 and I am 58, and we have no medical coverage. I have looked into every insurance company and get turned down because of my medical history. All our lives we have paid into these insurance companies, only to be turned away when we need the coverage the most.''     \n",
      "   Lastly, I want to relay a story that was shared with me by Laurie. Laurie is a fourth grade teacher in the Madison, Wisconsin, public school system. Laurie recently had a student fall during recess and break his foot. Laurie wrote: ``As he was waiting, in extreme pain and cold, for the school nurse to get to him, he cried to an assistant waiting with him, 'I can't go to the doctor. We don't have insurance.''' \n",
      "   That a 9- or 10-year-old boy should think even something like this is an atrocity. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, I hope that as Cover the Uninsured Week continues, my colleagues will join me in recognizing that obtaining comprehensive, affordable health care presents a very real challenge for millions upon millions of Americans. We cannot turn a deaf ear to our constituents' pleas for help. I invite my colleagues to join me in working on this most pressing domestic priority to provide affordable health care for all Americans. \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, it is high time we reauthorize the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. This important program provides breast and cervical cancer screening to low-income, uninsured women who otherwise would have little or no access to such care. Early detection is a woman's most powerful weapon against breast or cervical cancer because early detection, followed by early treatment intervention, greatly increases a woman's odds of beating cancer; and we know that our vigilance is having results as this is the second straight year of declining cancer deaths. \n",
      "   The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program is a Federal-State partnership that builds on the existing public health infrastructure and involves all sectors of the community in outreach and delivery of services. \n",
      "   Established in 1991, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program provides low-income women who have limited or no health insurance with breast and cervical cancer screening, education, outreach, and case management services. Administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program provides access to mammograms, pap tests, surgical consultations, and diagnostic testing. The program is operational in all 50 states, four U.S. territories, the District of Columbia, and 13 American Indian or Alaskan Native organizations. The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program also works with nonprofit organizations that provide supplemental funding for screening, education, outreach, case management and treatment services. \n",
      "   To date, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program has provided nearly 6.5 million screenings to 2.7 million women, detecting almost 30,000 breast cancers, almost 90,000 precancerous cervical lesions and 1,700 cervical cancers. \n",
      "   This reauthorization will strengthen this important program by increasing the program's authorization level. At its current $205 million funding level, it is estimated that the program only provides services to 20 percent of all eligible women in the United States. This additional authorization would enable the program to provide 147,000 more screenings per year. \n",
      "   In addition, it will assist rural communities and special populations by permitting a five-State demonstration program for States to receive a time-limited waiver of current regulatory requirements in order to provide greater emphasis on education and outreach, while ensuring that women continue to have access to life-saving screening services. \n",
      "   I have been honored to work on this reauthorization, and I want to thank the American Cancer Society and the Susan G. Komen Foundation for their continued support of this critical program. \n",
      "   In addition, I have been honored to work with my colleague, Congresswoman SUE MYRICK, in advancing this important legislation. In the war against breast and cervical cancer, we know that screening and early detection saves lives. I am very proud and pleased that on this issue Republicans and Democrats are working together to support a life-saving program. I urge all of my colleagues to support this reauthorization. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you, Congressman Latta. I appreciate your yielding to me for some comments. \n",
      "   We had a thrill to go on this trip this past weekend. It was the American energy tour. Leader John Boehner led that tour. We were so grateful that we were extended an invitation to join him. Representative Latta was there, and I was there representing the people from the Sixth District. So here we are, knowing we have very little time left before Congress takes a break in August when we are back in our districts, and we will be there for 5 weeks through Labor Day, we are here right now with a chance to talk to the American people. But more importantly, we have a chance to be here on the floor tonight and solve this energy issue. \n",
      "   One thing that we learned on this energy tour is that the problem is not a lack of natural resources that are available here in the United States, it isn't a lack of energy in the United States. The lack of energy is the inertia in the United States Congress, the Democrat-controlled United States Congress. That's where we lack energy. \n",
      "   The one thing that we found on this tour is that the problem is Congress. The problem isn't lack of resources. The problem isn't degradation to our environment. The problem is the fact that Congress has literally locked up and made illegal access to American energy. \n",
      "   Congressman Latta referenced the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge area up in Alaska. I would like to speak about that, but before that, I would like to talk about the areas that are off-limits. I mentioned that Congress is the problem, and Congress can be the answer. Congress has made it virtually illegal to access American energy. Where? Well, the first place is up in Alaska where Congressman Latta and I were, with fellow freshmen, and that is where there are over 10 billion barrels of oil. \n",
      "   I spoke with somebody who just read the recently released geological study which stated that there are over 90 billion barrels of oil in the Arctic region, and over 10 billion of which are in ANWR. This is a big story. \n",
      "   Let me go back now to the ANWR map. As Congressman Latta said, ANWR is all of 19 million acres and is the size of South Carolina. The size of the area that would be drilled upon is 2,000 acres of that 19 million acres. In other words, if you think of a football field, think of putting a little postage stamp on a football field. That is the size of the area that would be drilled upon. \n",
      "   Here is the Brooks Range up in northern Alaska. Here is the Arctic Ocean. You can't get any farther north than this. The area that we were in, the 1002 area where we are looking at drilling, and also President Carter set aside this area specifically for the purpose of drilling, this area is in direct proximity to the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline System. This is one of the modern marvels of human engineering. It really should be one of the seven wonders of the world. It is over 800 miles of pipeline. This is America's energy lifeline. \n",
      "   Do you know that the largest energy field in the United States is the Prudhoe Bay oil field that was discovered? We have had a living laboratory over the last 31 years. We have had a demonstration project for 31 years in Prudhoe Bay showing you in an environmentally safe and clean way, you can not only drill for oil but also transport oil and get it down to the lower 48. \n",
      "   One thing that Congressman Latta and I learned when we were there is that 31 years ago when drilling began, the flow was 2.1 million barrels a day that traveled through this pipeline. Today that oil flow is down to 700,000 barrels a day. And the reason for that is because no more oil fields have been opened for exploration. \n",
      "   Well, what happens when we get down to 300,000 barrels a day flowing through this pipeline? The pipeline stops. It doesn't work any more, and we are not able to get it back up online. It hurts that pipeline and we can't use it. \n",
      "   This wonderful gift of a pipeline will be actually gone. You want to talk about use it or lose it, that's the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. We have to use it. \n",
      "   Here is the great story, and here is the great answer, Mr. Speaker. The fact is in the 1002 area, the 2,000 acres in ANWR where we believe there is over 10 billion barrels of oil, this is just 74 miles away from the pipeline. It's the exact same terrain, completely frozen ground. Nine months of the year it is under snow and ice, 3 months of the year complete darkness. All we do is we build 74 miles of pipeline, and we have access to over 10 billion barrels of oil. Overnight we increase American reserves by over 50 percent. That's an answer, Congressman Latta. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. That is what is absolutely amazing that we saw, is that no roads are built to get into ANWR to do the drilling. The roads that do go to put in the oil rig are ice roads. Those roads go in the dark of winter when it is freezing. Bulldozers build ice roads out to where the rig is going to be set. The oil rig is set, and as Congressman Latta said, what formerly used to take 20 acres of a pad site to put a drill down, now because of technological advances has been reduced down to 6 acres of land. But if you look at underneath the earth with the directional drilling that is able to be accomplished now, literally we can go out 8 miles. \n",
      "   It is absolutely phenomenal what we are able to accomplish now, what the oil industry is able to accomplish now, to be able to give us American energy independence. Let's not forget what we are talking about, American energy independence. \n",
      "   We are looking at $4 a gallon gasoline right now. \n",
      "   This is incredible. This Chamber should be filled with Members of Congress. Unfortunately, and I don't know what the camera shows, but the Chamber is completely empty. Except for you and I, Congressman Latta, we are  the only Members of Congress, as well as the Speaker. No offense extended to the Speaker. There is no more important issue right now for the American people. \n",
      "   When we are at $4 a gallon gas, and when we have the capability of being at $2 a gallon gas, it is criminal to not allow the American people to be there. \n",
      "   How do I know it is possible? We know from the seismic studies that have been done that there are over 10.5 billion barrels in the ANWR region in very close proximity to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. \n",
      "   Also, I sit on the Committee on Financial Services. Last week Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman said to us regarding gas prices, he said that a 1 percent increase in supply could lower prices by as much as 10 percent. \n",
      "   Now what was the figure that we were told when drilling first started out in Prudhoe Bay, it was 2.1 million barrels per day. We are down to 700,000 barrels a day. We are able to increase another 1.4 million barrels a day. That's the capacity that we could increase, well over a 1 percent increase. \n",
      "   So instead of seeing prices fall by as much as 10 percent, we could be looking at a price fall by as much as 20 percent. Perhaps, Congressman Latta, what we should do is talk about the timeline. There have been a lot of fallacies stated, false information stating that there are 68 million acres of land that is being leased that is idle that the oil companies are currently not using under use-it-or-lose-it policies. That is a fact that we found out on this fact-finding mission, the fact that that is a completely false statement. It is an urban legend. \n",
      "   There is not one acre of land, Mr. Speaker, that has been leased that is currently not in the production or exploration stage because Congress again is at fault here. It is not companies, it is not consumers that are consuming too much oil, it is Congress. Congress created 10 years of an artificial delay period in the permitting, and they created in that 10-year period 11 different points of entries when nuisance lawsuits can be filed to stop the production of oil. \n",
      "   Do you remember the length of time that one lawsuit languished in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals? \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Also the native Alaskans as well, the native Alaskans that live up in the little villages. There is one little village up in ANWR that has less than 300 people. The native Alaskans that live in that village that are subsistence people. They live off of whale, they eat the caribou that they hunt, they want the drilling to start as well. \n",
      "   Why? Because they want to become greedy and wealthy? No, because they have seen, to their neighbors just to the immediate west of them in the Prudhoe Bay region, that this drilling that has occurred has been done in an environmentally safe and sensitive way. In fact, so much so, remember when we were going along up in Prudhoe Bay, we saw trucks, and we asked, what is that little plastic, it looks like a little plastic Barbie doll swimming pool that's underneath the trucks. \n",
      "   And we were told so strict are the environmental regulations in Alaska, the strictest environmental regulations in the entire country, they are so strict, that if a truck travels from point A to point B, as soon as the truck stops, the driver has to get out and take what's called a duck pond or a diaper. He slips this underneath the truck so in case even 1 drop of oil comes out of a crank case, they are so careful, that they don't want even one drop of oil to touch the tundra. That's how careful they are. \n",
      "   You don't see industrial waste. You don't see pools of oil. You don't see refuse lying about. You don't see excessive humans walking around with the pipelines. You see a very tiny footprint, and that's in the old area of oil drilling. With a new area of oil drilling, it is very difficult to even spot from the air a new pipeline, because a rig comes up out of the ground and a green house is literally, a little tiny casing, is put over that pipeline. There is very, very little impact on that region. \n",
      "   As Congressman Latta stated accurately, we did not see wildlife. We were 2 hours in the air flying over the National Petroleum Reserve, flying over Prudhoe Bay and then flying over the ANWR region. In that 2-hour time span, we did not see wildlife over in the ANWR area. We were straining to find Dall sheep, straining to see musk ox, straining to see caribou, looking for wildlife. Where did we see the wildlife? Just as Congressman Latta said, we saw it at mile marker zero, where the most activity was. \n",
      "   You know, it's interesting, caribou must be a lot like people. They like to be where the action is. We like to be where the action is. The caribou wanted to be where the action was. It was a great story. \n",

      "   We were here north of the Arctic circle. We touched other little toes up here actually in the Arctic Ocean. There are no trees up there, the mountain ranges that you see, as Congressman Latta said, the Brooks Range, it is, it was all granite. There were no trees. \n",
      "   But the area we were in was the coastal plain, the perfect area for drilling. So we have the National Petroleum Reserve, Prudhoe Bay, the Arctic refuge, this has been a gift for our country. \n",
      "   Remember, we cannot forget that this is a key to making America energy independent, not dependent upon OPEC for oil, not dependent on Huge Chavez for oil. We don't want to continue to send all of our American dollars and wealth overseas to make dictators happy and rich. \n",

No one actually lives in Prudhoe Bay, they come in for 2 weeks at a time, and then they leave and they go home for 2 weeks at a time. They have health care benefits. They make over $100,000 a year. They work 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off. \n",
      "   We were told that if we would open up this ANWR region for drilling, and if we would also be looking at Colorado to open that area up, we would be looking at over 750,000 jobs, American jobs, where the American economy would be stimulated, Americans could be making over $100,000 a year. \n",
      "   Why in the world, why in the world would anyone possibly not want to open up for the American people, not only energy reserves that could bring the price of energy down to less than $2 of a gallon of gas, but also to provide jobs. Wouldn't people in Ohio, in the great State of Ohio, want jobs at over $100,000? \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Well the Governor of Alaska says let's tap into that natural gas. We have the oil pipeline that's currently under way. But you can't put natural gas into a crude oil pipeline. They need to build a natural-gas pipeline that would run fairly parallel. \n",
      "   Every day, I believe it's well over 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas is extracted from the earth when the oil comes up. The great thing that the companies have been able to do is to take that natural gas and pump it back into the earth. The compression, I believe, from the natural gas, has forced more oil up. That's part of the reason why we have seen so much more yield from the Prudhoe Bay. \n",
      "   Without that advance in technology, we wouldn't have the tremendous abundance that we have had. This is really sobering news. Again, remember, when Prudhoe Bay was first opened up 31 years ago, it was the largest oil field in the United States. Oil fields don't get larger, they only deplete. After 31 years, it is still the largest oil field in the United States. \n",
      "   Knowing that, we have adjacent to this field the Arctic refuge, or the ANWR region 1002 which, again, president Jimmy Carter set aside specifically for the purpose of drilling for this oil and getting it back down for the American people, the American economy, and America's national security. Because whoever controls fuel controls your freedom. \n",
      "   If Hugo Chavez and Middle East dictators and OPEC control America's fuel, then Hugo Chavez and OPEC dictators control America's freedom. I know that you don't want to have dictators controlling America's freedom. I don't. I don't want that for the people of Minnesota. \n",

The other key point that we don't want to fail to remember is that when we went on our American energy tour, the purpose was to talk to the American people about our all-of-the-above strategy, the fact that we believe in conservation. We need more conservation of energy in this country, and Congressman Latta had talked about the wonderful new designs at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory where buildings can be designed to literally use zero energy. \n",
      "   I know it's hard to believe, but if you reorient the building, and if you use solar panels, there are amazing things that can be done now where buildings can actually get to the point of using zero energy. These are all techniques and great new breakthrough technologies that America can use to become energy independent. \n",

Conservation is one of the legs on our three-legged stool. But we do not, a stool won't stand up without that third leg. Right now the third leg that is the most key that we need to focus on, we have to focus on all three at the same time, an abundance of increase in American energy supply. And we have got it. We have oil in the Outer Continental Shelf, over 88 billion barrels. We have over 10 billion barrels in the ANWR region. We have about 2 trillion barrels worth of oil in the oil shale region, and we have nuclear. \n",

      "   It is true, Mr. Speaker, we are so grateful, as freshmen Members, to be here with new ideas and a new perspective. Part of that perspective is a positive outlook on life and a positive outlook on our country. One thing about Americans, Mr. Speaker, is we tend to be happy people, go-getter people, people that have ideas, innovation. We are entrepreneurs. We always look over the next hill. We always look for the next goal. We are forward-looking people. \n",
      "   One thing that I have been a little dismayed about in my time here in the Congress is I have heard so much negativity on the floor. As a matter of fact, in the previous Special Order, I was amazed at the level of negativity that I heard. That is not representative of the American people. It certainly is not representative of the people of the Sixth District of the State of Minnesota. They are positive people that are looking, as we Republican freshmen are looking, at new ideas, at fresh perspectives. \n",
      "   I was so intrigued this weekend when I was home in my district, I had the chance to read the Sunday paper. I found an article in that paper that talked about the incredible progress we have made in recent years. So much of that has to do, Mr. Speaker, with a lot of the very good decisions that were made in the previous Congresses, particularly, Mr. Speaker, the tax cuts that were passed in 2001, 2003. I say that because I am a Federal tax litigation attorney. I hate high taxation. If you speak with most Americans, they also detest high levels of taxation. One thing that the Congress did so well was to reduce that level in 2001 and in 2003. The one thing we don't want to see happen is to have the country take a dramatic turn now under the Democrat controlled House of Representatives and embrace tax increases. This really concerns us because what we have seen so far is the Democrats are now embracing what, you know, the argument is, will it be the largest or the second largest tax increase in American history? Whatever, it is a very large tax increase. But what the other formula for success has brought about, Mr. Speaker, is prosperity.     \n",
      "   Prosperity not just for those who are the high income earners, not even just the middle income earners. We have seen tremendous levels of prosperity, even for those who we would consider the poor among us, who government considers the poor among us, and if there is anyone who deserves help up, a hand up, it is the poorest among us. \n",
      "   In this article I read this weekend, it is really a scorecard of sorts on the Republicans and the great tax cuts that they put through this Congress, and it is very good news. \n",
      "   If you dig into the numbers, as this author writes, his name is Jason Lewis, he is a writer from the Twin Cities, and I want to quote from this article, he writes, ``We now have a record number of Americans with health insurance.'' \n",
      "   I will tell you what. You would never know that, listening to people speak on the floor of this House. You would think everyone is destitute and no one has health insurance. We are at an all-time high in this country with the number of people that have health insurance. \n",
      "   The doom-and-gloom focus says that most of those people who do not have health insurance currently live in households with incomes that are in excess of $50,000 a year. So even the people who don't have health insurance in the United States are making over $50,000 a year. In fact, many of them  today are eligible for government healthcare programs. They have just simply decided or elected not to enroll in those programs. \n",
      "   The median household income, more good news is that adjusted for inflation, the median household income today has risen in 2006 to over $48,451 nationwide, and in the Twin Cities in Minnesota, median household income today is at a robust $62,223. \n",
      "   This is great news. We should be talking about this great news. And how did we get to this level of prosperity? It is because of the tax cuts that came in 2001 and 2003, and that great investment is now paying off. \n",
      "   Surprisingly, in August, the figures show the first significant drop in poverty in a decade. This is great news. Shout it from the housetop, which we are. This is the ``big House.'' We are shouting it. The official rate declined from 12.6 percent in 2005 down to 12.3 percent. That is great. We want to reduce the level of poverty in the United States. \n",
      "   The Federal tax cuts of 2003 gave us an economy that added $1.3 trillion in real output. We have grown more than 3 percent annually, according to Investors Business Daily. \n",
      "   Business spending, way up, adding 8 million new jobs to this economy. Real labor compensation per hour has rebounded, because now wages have advanced 3.9 percent from a year ago. \n",
      "   Those are statistics. But it really means things for American families. As a woman, as a wife, as a mother of five children, we have raised over 23 foster children, I will tell you what: When your wage goes up, that means you can afford to pay the light bill at the end of the month. You can afford to have groceries. You can take your kids and buy them the clothes that they need for school. You can pay for the field trips they have to go on. And you can pay for all the sports activities that they love to do after school. \n",
      "   These are real benefits, when government doesn't have that money, when normal real people have this money. That is what we want, to have all households have that money, and the poorest families are the ones that need to benefit even the most. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, even with the slight decline in job creation in August, the Nation's unemployment rate remained in record low territory of 4.6 percent. Great news. Great news for today. \n",
      "   Robert Rector also just came out for the Heritage Foundation, and he told us among the households considered poor in our country, of those households that we call poor, 46 percent of those households in America, almost half actually own their own home. That is something that we don't always understand, that almost half of all poor people in this country own a home. If you own a home, Mr. Speaker, that is your greatest down payment on the next generation and on wealth creation. \n",
      "   Most people that are considered poor by our government own a car. In fact, of people considered poor, 31 percent of poor households own two or more cars. That is great, and we want to keep prosperity going for the poor. \n",
      "   Seventy-eight percent of those who are considered poor by the government have a DVD player or have a VCR player. In fact, 62 percent have cable or satellite TV. One-third of poor households have both cell phones and land line phones. And a stunning 80 percent have air conditioning. This is really good news, significant, because as recently as 1970, and I remember this, only 36 percent of all American households had air conditioning. \n",
      "   My family wasn't one of those. So I am grateful that today 80 percent of the people that even the government considers poor today have air conditioning. This is great news that we have. \n",
      "   In fact, the study said that 89 percent of poor families themselves, and this is very important, say that they have enough food. Boy, if there is any measure of poor, it is, are you hungry? No one wants to see one child, one older person, anyone go hungry in this country. Eight-nine percent of people who themselves are categorized as poor say that that they have enough food. Only 2 percent of that category say that they don't. \n",
      "   That isn't to say, Mr. Speaker, that there are not serious problems for those who live below the poverty line. Trust me. The foster children that we took into our home, they were categorized in this category. There are needs aplenty for those who are below the poverty line. We need to address those needs. \n",
      "   That being said, there is good news out there. Let's celebrate the fact that Census Bureau figures don't even include when they categorize people that are poor the value of non-cash benefits. So if you are poor, the government doesn't even include the fact of the amount of money you receive in food stamps. They don't include the amount you receive in housing subsidies, in Medicaid, or even the Earned Income Tax Credit. That is to say, and this again is good news, that the gap between the poor and average households is even smaller than sometimes what it is stated to be. \n",
      "   That being said, we are now at a juncture, Mr. Speaker, when we are looking at a turn. I know my colleagues that are also going to be speaking in the freshman class are going to be talking about this turn. \n",
      "   I will end on this note, because I gave a lot of great news. The negative news that we are looking at is that so far in this Congress, the Democrat majority in the House has passed their budget, and their budget included, again, the largest, or however you want to parse it, the second largest tax increase in American history. I just want to say that for the people of my district and the people for your district, they will probably have to be paying an additional $3,000 a year for every average American family, and that will negatively impact the poorest among us the most. \n",
      "   So we have two choices in front of us: Do we want to continue with lower taxes and prosperity, where the poorest among us have seen actually tangible benefits? Or do we want to take the route that the Democrats have proposed, and increase taxes knowingly $3,000 a year on my family, on your family, on families in our districts? I can't abide by that, especially for the low-income families in my district. \n",
      "   With that, I say let's do what our founders would want us to do, and that is to embrace hope, prosperity, new ideas and a fresh perspective. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield back to the kind gentleman from California, Congressman McCarthy. \n",

      "   When you look at purchasing American energy, Madam Speaker, through the coal-to-liquid program, Americans voted almost 100 percent of the time to buy American. Democrats voted ``no'' almost 80 percent of the time to buy American on coal-to-liquid fuels. \n",
      "   On oil shale exploration, purchasing American energy through this tremendous resource of oil shale exploration of which America is the Saudi Arabia of the world in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, Republicans voted ``yes'' 90 percent of the time, while Democrats voted ``no'' to buying American 85 percent of the time.     \n",
      "   Sounds like we're on a roll. Sounds like we're on a trend. \n",
      "   Well, unfortunately, Madam Speaker, the Outer Continental Shelf exploration, Republicans also voted ``yes'' to buy American oil and American natural gas over 80 percent of the time while our Democratic colleagues across the aisle voted ``no'' 80 percent of the time to buy American energy. \n",
      "   To purchase American energy, Madam Speaker, to increase refinery capacity--this is a crucial issue in our energy capacity--Republicans voted ``yes'' to buy American energy from refineries almost 100 percent of the time while Democrats voted ``no'' on increasing energy capacity with refineries 95 percent of the time. \n",
      "   I know it's hard to believe and hard to understand, but there has really been a very clear divide over energy policy in our country over the last 30 years. And unfortunately, our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle have made a very clear and distinct decision, and it has been this: No new energy exploration in the United States. They have been very clear about this. They don't want to increase energy exploration in the United States. We need to. \n",
      "   And we aren't choosing just oil, just natural gas, just coal; we want to say ``yes'' to wind, to solar, to biofuels, to nuclear power, to all of the above. We have to say ``yes'' to all of the above or America will find itself at an energy deficit. \n",
      "   I know the people that I serve, Madam Speaker, in the Sixth Congressional District in Minnesota are feeling that squeeze right now. I checked today in Minnesota, the average price of regular unleaded gas is $3.86 a gallon. It's something more than that nationally. But I will tell you the people in Minnesota, especially the people who are living on the margins, are feeling the pain right now of these price increases. \n",
      "   But a wonderful story that Congressman Heller and I learned when we were on the all-of-the-above exploratory tool is that we have great answers here in the United States. The good news, Madam Speaker, is that we do not have an energy deficit in the United States. We do not suffer from a lack of resources. We have 27 percent of all of the world's coal in the United States. We have 2 trillion barrels of oil just in the United States. We have 88 billion barrels, conservatively speaking, in the Outer Continental Shelf, over 10 billion barrels in ANWR, and also 10 billion barrels near my home State in the Bakken Oil Reserve. We have energy in abundance in the United States. The problem is that Congress has said ``no.'' \n",
      "   So what is standing between $2 gasoline and the American people, Madam Speaker, especially American-made energy? It's the United States Congress. It isn't the companies that have been bad guys or that the American people have been bad guys for using too much energy; it's the United States Congress, and unfortunately, the Democrat-controlled United States Congress that it's made a clear decision that they don't want to increase American energy. This is nonsense. \n",
      "   Both Congressman Heller and I learned together this weekend that we have the resources, we have them available, which is why we need to buy American energy now. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank my colleague, Mr. Heller. \n",
      "   I am so grateful that the majority brought this issue up of use-it-or-lose-it because this is something that the American people have been subjected to now for the last couple of weeks, this canard, that there are 68 million acres, and they somehow want the American people to believe that companies are risking their capital on leases that they're not using. \n",
      "   And what I challenge the majority to do is produce even one lease, even one lease in the U.S. where there is an acre of land that has been leased that is not in some stage of production or exploration. Not one. We haven't seen proof of even one lease where a company has bid for that lease and that lease is not in some stage of either production or exploration. \n",
      "   Again, let's look at Congress and Congress' complicity in this area because Congress has set artificial timelines, delayed timelines, for permitting. The leases are 10 years' long, and there are no less than 11 different stop points in that 10-year lease period where private parties can file lawsuits to stop the drilling. So, if a lawsuit is filed, for instance, by Friends of the Earth, by Sierra Club, by Earth Justice, the oil company, or whatever business it is, has to respond to the lawsuit. The lawsuit will end up in Federal district court. Then it may get kicked up to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. There's one case where a decision wasn't rendered for 2 years. Well, who made that scenario? The United States Congress. \n",
      "   The companies have bid on these leases. They've put money down on the barrel head to actually lease the land. They've got a 10-year timeline that Congress has given them, and there are artificial delays built in for the permitting and also 11 different points for private lawsuits to be filed. So those delays, again, are ones that Congress has allowed to occur. \n",
      "   There aren't companies that are sitting or dallying on a lease. I challenge this majority to produce even one, even one lease on even just 1 acre, where a company has a lease and they're not in some stage that Congress created of either producing or exploring on the land. Let alone defying any common sense of any businessman or -woman who puts their money on the line, their capital, they're not going to dissipate capital. \n",
      "   But you will hear the Democrat majority, Madam Speaker, rant and rail that there're somehow dilatory companies out there that are sitting on leases. They haven't produced one, they haven't shown one example that they can parade around this Chamber where a company is not producing on the land. It's just a patently false statement and, in fact, one that shouldn't be used. \n",
      "   I tell you, the real use-it-or-lose-it, Madam Speaker, it's this. When Congressman Heller and I were recently up in ANWR this weekend, we learned a very sobering fact, and the sobering fact is this. Thirty-one years ago, the largest oil field in the United States was up in the North Slope of Alaska, Prudhoe Bay. Today, the largest oil field in the United States remains up in Prudhoe Bay. \n",
      "   This Congress has made a decision not to increase its oil fields. When the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was built in Alaska in the mid seventies, when oil production first began, 2.1 million barrels a day was flowing through that 800 miles of pipeline, 2.1 million barrels a day. Do you know what that is today, Madam Speaker? We are now down to 700,000 barrels a day flowing through that pipeline, 700,000 barrels a day. We have diminished by more than half the amount of oil that we are sending down to the lower 48 from that wonderful energy lifeline in Alaska. \n",
      "   Here's the sobering news, Madam Speaker. We learned this weekend that once we get down to 300,000 barrels a day flowing through that pipeline, the pipeline won't work anymore. This pipeline is a marvel of modern human engineering, a marvel. It's an incredibly valuable asset. I was told this weekend, Madam Speaker, that if we had to rebuild that pipeline today, we could be looking at a $15 billion investment. \n",
      "   What's the window of opportunity that we have? If we don't open up new oil fields, potentially within 10 years' time, that pipeline will be of no use to us because what we were told is, if you don't use it, you lose it. \n",

It is the American energy lifeline that runs through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline that brings the valuable oil down to the lower 48. If we lose this pipeline, and if we lose it on this Democrat-controlled Congress' watch, we will lose our lifeline for any future oil development, which is all the more reason why we need to begin drilling here in the United States so we can buy American energy and buy it now. \n",
      "   If we fast track the permitting, if we pull out all of the unnecessary lawsuits, we could literally within just a few years' time build a 74-mile spur into ANWR, get that oil down to the United States, and increase American energy reserves by 50 percent. \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentleman from Indiana for yielding, and I hear the frustration that is in your voice, because you are echoing the frustration that the American people are feeling all over this country. Right now, they are taking their pencils and breaking them, they are taking their shoe and throwing it across the room, because they can't believe that for the 21 months that the Democrats have held the gavel in this Chamber, they have only now tonight, for the first time in 21 months, had the guts to put on this floor their ``commonsense energy plan.'' \n",
      "   From what we know of this bill so far, this ``commonsense energy plan'' doesn't have a lot of energy in it. If you take about 80 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf and make it illegal, permanently off limits to energy production, how can you with a straight face before the American people say that you want to get serious about solving this problem? \n",
      "   This isn't a bill. As our colleague Representative Shadegg said, this is a charade purported upon the American people. So what we are saying is, whose side are you on? Whose side are you on? Do you want a pro-American energy bill? That is what we want. We want to be truly energy independent. \n",
      "   I want to piggyback back on what Representative Shadegg said. He talked about the lawsuits that have been filed. Every single lease that has come up for sale has had a lawsuit filed. \n",
      "   I just want you to know, in my district we have the longest-running unfinished bridge project in the history of the United States of America. Why? Because we have lawsuits filed by the Sierra Club. We still don't have a bridge coming on line, because the Sierra Club now has run up the tab so that people in my district will be paying over $400 million to build a bridge because we have lawsuits filed against this bridge. \n",
      "   Why do we even allow lawsuits at all? If the United States Government certifies that land is available for leasing, shouldn't the United States Government certify that this land should be truly available for leasing? We don't need these outside groups to come in and file these lawsuits, because, after all, if there is a problem with the environment, if there is a problem with laws being violated, don't we have the Minerals Management Service that could issue a fine, that could issue a temporary restraining order, that could prohibit that company from drilling at all and pull that lease back? Certainly they could. \n",
      "   Why do we allow these leases at all? We are in a serious situation in this country. We just saw financial firms, Bear Stearns has had a problem. They have needed a government bailout. We have seen Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac. They needed the Federal government to come in and take them over. Just this week, Lehman Brothers is filing bankruptcy. We are seeing Morgan Stanley being \n",
      "   bought out by Bank of America. \n",
      "   What are the American people worried about tonight, Mr. Speaker? They are worried about if they are going to have a job tomorrow morning. They are worried if they will have enough money in their bank account to put gas in the tank so they can go to their job. This is serious, Mr. Speaker. This is no joke. That is why I think this is an insult to the American people. \n",
      "   This is 290-some pages, as the gentleman from Indiana said. But this is a joke on the American people. If this won't produce one drop of oil, then why are we wasting our time? \n",
      "   Let's face it: We have got now nine days before adjournment, nine days before the end of the year. Nine days. So we are going to, what, dance around a little bit and have a charade a little bit? We don't even know if we can file an amendment on this bill. We don't even know what we will be allowed to do. \n",
      "   But the one thing I guarantee, Mr. Speaker, is we will not remain silent. For the next nine days, the Republicans in the House on this floor will not remain silent before the American people, because we are going to tell the truth. We are going to tell the truth that under the last 21 months of Democrat-controlled Congress, we have seen post offices renamed. We have seen Federal buildings renamed. In fact, we have seen monkeys saved from being transported across State lines. We have even seen $25 million of American taxpayer money go to foreign countries in the form of foreign aid to pay for foreign cats and foreign dogs. We have seen this come off of the floor of this body. \n",
      "   But only tonight, at a quarter to 10, did we see an energy bill come before this body, which we believe will not produce one drop of energy, while the American people tonight are paying $4 a gallon for gasoline. If we don't get serious and really produce energy, come this November, the American people are going to have a choice: Do they want to pay $2 a gallon for gasoline under a commonsense Republican plan, or do they want to pay $6 or $8 or $10 a gallon for gasoline? That will be the reality, because under a President Obama, we won't have drilling, and under a Democrat-controlled Congress, we know we won't have drilling. That is the choice before the American people, Mr. Speaker: $2 a gallon for gasoline, or $6 or $8 or $10. \n",
      "   That is why I am so grateful to the gentleman from Indiana tonight, because he has pegged it. He has pegged it. He has said that this bill is nothing more than an insult to the American people. And that is why we are here tonight, as the precursor for the debate that will occur tomorrow. \n",

Madam Speaker, I want to bring before the body this morning an issue that needs more attention, not less, and that is the issue of the huge blob that ate the American Dream called the alternative minimum tax. One thing that we are seeing is that the alternative minimum tax, Madam Speaker, is set to rise at a level so unprecedented that the American economy has not experienced anything like this in the last 40 years. \n",

This means this money will come out of the pockets of the American taxpayer and will go into the coffers of the Federal Government. \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, on the first day that Republicans took control of the Congress in 1995, one of their very first actions was to establish a rule that required a supermajority, or three-fifths vote, to raise taxes. This was a good thing, Madam Speaker. On the very first day of Congress in 2007, however, the Democrats established new rules in this Chamber to make it easier to raise taxes with a simple majority vote. \n",
      "   And now, after just 2 weeks in power, the Democrats, our colleagues, have already passed legislation today to raise taxes. What is worse, the taxes that are collected under this new bill will not be going toward deficit reduction or toward paying down the Federal debt. The money is going to be set aside in a special account for more spending. \n",
      "   In Minnesota, we had a phrase when we were in session. We said, hold on to your wallets. And we can say that to the American people right now. \n",
      "   As a Federal tax litigation attorney myself, as a small business owner with my husband Marcus, and as a mother to Lucas, Harrison, Elisa, Caroline, and Sophia, and our 23 foster children, I can tell you as a parent the best way to grow an economy, the best way to raise more jobs is not to raise taxes but to let people, families, keep more of their hard-earned money. \n",
      "   In 2003, tax relief was passed, and the great thing is that 7.2 million jobs were created. In fact, our economy has been adding jobs for 40 straight months. The unemployment rate is incredibly low, at 4.5 percent, well below the average of the last 40 years. \n",
      "   Nowhere are the results more evident, Madam Speaker, than in my home State of Minnesota, which has closed out the calendar year with 54,000 more jobs than at the end of 2005, the strongest job growth since 1999. Our State's annual job growth rate of 2 percent has outpaced the national rate of 1.4 percent. Our unemployment rate is the envy of the Nation, phenomenally low at 4.2 percent. \n",
      "   Meanwhile, tax revenues are absolutely surging into the Treasury. Guess what? Federal receipts rose 14 percent in 2005, 11 percent in 2006, and they kept rising by 9 percent the first 2 months of 2007. These are the highest consecutive revenue increases in the past 25 years. \n",
      "   America, did you hear that? The highest revenue increases in the past 25 years. They come on the heels of the largest tax relief measures in American history.     \n",
      "   And the budget deficit, in turn, has fallen $165 billion over 2 years. And just as the economy is gaining tremendous momentum, now, unfortunately, my Democrat colleagues are saying, this is the time to raise taxes. \n",
      "   Madam Speaker, I have learned very quickly in the few days I have been here in Washington, D.C., that facts don't always get in the way of people's opinions here in this fair city. But it is hard to dispute 3 years of unparalleled prosperity. \n",

For centuries, Popes have provided inspiration and a strong foundation of faith for millions of Catholics around the world and many non-Catholics as well. As spiritual leader of the Roman Catholic Church, the Pope serves as the impassioned defender of Catholic doctrine and values, a role this Pope has taken to new heights. \n",
      "   On April 19, 2005, Catholics everywhere were introduced to Pope Benedict XVI, and in just 3 years, the Pope has emerged as a vocal and effective advocate, combating what many see as the world's sloping trend towards secularism. Rather than steering the Catholic Church towards a more moderate and relaxed approach to worship, Pope Benedict XVI has demonstrated the benefit and need of returning to fundamental Christian values. Certainly, it is not easy for a leader to take such a bold stand that bucks popular trends and culture, but it is an example of pure conviction and true leadership that inspires millions of Catholic believers. \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Chairman, today, the House will consider H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act. I rise in strong opposition to this legislation. \n",
      "   First of all, H.R. 3036 continues our Nation down the ill-fated road of shifting control of school curricula away from the parents and teachers and local school boards who best know what their children need into the hands of Federal Government and its one-size-fits-all approach. To best serve our children's educational needs, local school boards need flexibility to target resources where they are needed most--from school construction and class size reduction efforts to higher teacher salaries and technology in the classroom. The needs of individual school districts are dynamic and complex. They are not homogenous and are most certainly not best understood by bureaucrats in Washington. \n",
      "   I fervently believe that parents and teachers and local school boards know best how to educate our children, and it is time for Congress to stop removing them further and further from the equation. Congress must move back down the path to control, accountability, and authority at a local level for education. H.R. 3036 leads us away from this crucial goal. \n",
      "   Furthermore, while I agree it is important to promote conservation and environmental literacy, especially as America faces a crippling energy crisis, I do not agree that public school is the place to do it. H.R. 3036 would simply add another layer of bureaucracy and Federal mandates to our Nation's already overburdened schools, displacing important educational building blocks with questionable environmental education programs. At a time when American test scores continue to lag behind our global counterparts, can we honestly say that we need less time for the fundamentals of reading, writing, arithmetic? Church groups, scouting, extracurricular organizations, and the family promote conservation, love of and respect for the outdoors, and environmental messages daily. Let the teachers teach; let parents instill values. \n",
      "   Finally, let us not forget that Congress has already allotted funds for environmental literacy through an Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, grant program. Since 1992, that program has allocated over $40 million, or roughly $2.5 million per year. H.R. 3036 would spend an additional $14 million to create an additional grant program administered by a whole new executive branch agency, the Department of Education. Can there be any question that this represents an expansion of the Federal bureaucracy, a duplication of efforts, and a wholly irresponsible distribution of taxpayer dollars? \n",
      "   The No Child Left Inside Act represents a step in the wrong direction, adding the weight of increased Federal bureaucracy to an already sinking educational outlook. Forcing local school districts to direct scarce resources away from core curricula to serve a political agenda will only further suppress the academic performance of America's next generation. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. \n",

He is telling the story that the American people want to hear, and that is where we are in this particular quarter, what is happening with our finances, because that is what we do, after all, when we come here to the United States Congress. We come here for a very simple purpose. We have to deal with 11 spending bills covering various subjects, and we have to take care of those. We have to make sure that we fully fund the priorities that we believe in and make sure that we  are keeping faith with the American people and doing so in a way that respects their property, their private property. \n",
      "   Because after all, what is it that each one of us has? We have our time. We have our livelihood. And when we go out to work every day, the money that we bring home for our families, the money that we bring home that we hope that some day will buy us a home, put our children through college, maybe have enough to offer us a secure retirement, that is the result of our labor that we take every day. \n",
      "   And where are we at now in this country with the amount of money that the government is consuming out of our paychecks? It seems every year those days go a little bit longer and longer when Congress is consuming more money. That is a real concern for a lot of Americans. I know it is a concern for me. It is a concern for our family and for the people that I represent back in Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District. And I know as I have spoken with our fellow freshmen, and many will follow me up here when I conclude my remarks, they will tell you the same thing.     \n",
      "   They are very concerned about how the people back home are going to be able to hold on to the fruits of their labor, the private property that they have been able to amass and accumulate for the benefit of their family. \n",
      "   Well, here's just one topic that I want to take tonight, just one little piece, and spend a very few moments on it, and it's a concept called the alternative minimum tax. Now, this is something that came about in the Tax Code back in 1969. Back in 1969, there was a hue and cry because there were about 155 multimillionaires who didn't pay taxes that year, and rightly so. There were a lot of middle-income Americans, lower-income Americans that were pretty upset about this. They were paying taxes, but they saw that wealthier people, through legitimate loopholes, you might say, or legitimate provisions in the Tax Code, were able to completely escape taxation. \n",
      "   Well, this created, as you can imagine, a hue and cry right here in this body. So the Congress decided to create a bill called the alternative minimum tax. What this would do, essentially, is a person would have to figure their tax once. If they didn't have a tax liability, under the alternative minimum tax they figured their tax a second time, and whichever tax liability was higher, that is the tax that we get paid. In other words, whichever way that Uncle Sam did better, that would be the final outcome of a person's tax return. So the American citizen never was able to pay the lower amount of tax; they always had to pay the higher amount of tax. \n",
      "   Well, the alternative minimum tax kind of turned into something that you might equate with one of those 1950 science fiction movies called, maybe, ``The Blob that Ate New York City,'' because that is what has happened with the alternative minimum tax. It has become kind of like ``the blob that ate New York City.'' \n",
      "   Now, remember back in 1969, 155 Americans were impacted by the alternative minimum tax; in other words, they had to pay a higher tax. That is what that means; 155 Americans. Well, guess what Congress forgot to do? They forgot to index this tax for inflation. So, guess what? Every year more and more Americans had to pay this tax, and more and more Americans were reclassified as being wealthy or rich. \n",
      "   Well, guess what? Last year, 3.5 million Americans had to pay the alternative minimum tax. One hundred fifty-five, 3.5 million. Guess where we are today? As of today, this Congress has done nothing, absolutely nothing to eradicate the alternative minimum tax. You know what will happen? Twenty-three million Americans will be impacted by this measure. That is redefining what rich means in this country. \n",
      "   So, do you know what the new definition of rich will be? It will be a police officer married to a teacher. Now, think of that, a police officer married to a teacher. We don't usually think of people in those income tax categories as being redefined as rich. But now, under the so-called wisdom of this Congress, that is exactly what has happened \n",
      "   Now this is a problem. We cannot allow this higher level of taxation to seep down into the middle class where people are working hard. They aren't rich by any stretch of the imagination. They are just hardworking, decent people, trying to make a go of it; not what this tax was intended to impact. That is something we need to consider. There actually can be a conclusion. Sometimes the curtain needs to come down on ill-advised measures; and if there ever was an ill-advised measure, it's the alternative minimum tax. \n",
      "   I just want to give you a figure here. Historically, over the last 40 years, and we are standing here, it's a beautiful December evening in Washington, D.C., the year 2007. For the last 40 years in this country, the Federal Government has consumed about 18.2 percent of gross domestic product. That is pretty much the money that is created and generated in this country every year, gross domestic product. Well, guess what? The Federal Government has consumed about 18.2 percent. \n",
      "   If this Congress continues to do nothing, and unfortunately, that is a lot of what we have seen this year is a lot of do nothing, if Congress continues to do nothing with the alternative minimum tax, instead of 18.2 percent of all the money that is created in this country, that number will rise to 24 percent. Almost one-fourth of everything that is created, the income that is created in this country will come where, to your pocket? Are you kidding? It will come here to the United States Government. That is not what we want to see happen. \n",
      "   This is kind of a dream come true for politicians that love big government, because they don't have to vote for this tax increase. It's just on automatic overdrive. It's going to continue to grow. Just like I said, ``the blob that ate New York City,'' that is the alternative minimum tax. \n",
      "   That is not what those of us who are standing up here to talk to you about tonight, with fiscal responsibility, that is not what we are about. That is not what we want. What we are after is a clean, straight repeal. We want this ill-advised tax to go away. People think that a tax is here forever, that you will never get rid of it. You never get rid of death, you never get rid of taxes. Well, it is possible to do it. It's possible to do it if we have the will. \n",
      "   I believe collectively the American people would want us to get rid of this ``blob that ate New York City,'' the alternative minimum tax, because why should the government continue to profit from a bad law so that you will have to continue to spend more and more and more of your income. And pretty soon, everybody's going to be redefined as rich, everybody will be, and pay a higher level of taxation. This is absolutely ridiculous. There is no reason why we should continue a law like this, and I fully believe that we need to do something about this bill, and do it soon. \n",
      "   Now, here's one aspect that is being debated even this evening. There are those on the other side of the aisle that think that we have to ``pay'' for this tax. In other words, you need to continue to be taxed more. \n",
      "   Here's how they plan to do it. They plan to create a bank account, if you will. And what the other side across the aisle is planning to do, you know what they are going to put in that bank account? They want to put tax increases in that account. They want to have a 1-year tax or 1-year patch, or fix. So instead of 23 million people paying that tax this year, they just want it to be 3.5 million people. Still too many. It's 3.5 million too many people, if you ask me. \n",
      "   But what they want to do is create a bank account and put tax increases in it. And what they are going to do, just ``take it to the bank,'' as they say. The American people are going to be stuck with a bill of $50 billion in tax increases that you're going to have to pay, maybe not next year, but the year after. That bill is going to be stuck to the American taxpayer. \n",
      "   We can do so much better. Do you know that we have more revenues coming in this year into the Treasury than any other time in the history of this country? Revenues are not the problem. We don't need all this additional revenue. What we need is some fiscal discipline, some fiscal responsibility. We need to get our sense about us and realize we just can't be all things to all  people. We set our priorities. We do what you do every day at home in your home and in your business. You just realize you need to spend within your means. \n",
      "   So we need to get right on this. We need to not create any phony bank accounts where we don't put money in, we put IOUs in that you the American public are going to have to pay. We are going to get rid of that. \n",
      "   We want to just do a clean repeal, do away with the alternative minimum tax, be fiscally responsible, be good and kind to the American people. That is a Christmas present that we need to pass and send out to the American people tonight. That Christmas present needs to say that we respect you, we respect your work, we understand how hard you work, we understand that your family means the world to you, your children mean the world to you, your parents mean the world to you, your business could use a little bit more capital investment too. We trust you, and we know that you can put that money to work far better than any of us collectively ever could hope to do. There are essentials that government has to fund, but what we don't need to do is have a blob that eats not only New York City, but the rest of the United States. \n",
      "   So I for one, Representative McCarthy, believe with you that we need to do right by the American people, trust their judgment, be sensitive to their family needs, and do away with the alternative minimum tax. \n",

      "<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (PANIC AND THE ENERGY CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>\n",
      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, we are at what I think is a very refreshing moment of clarity on the national energy debate that is occurring right now in hamlets and towns and villages all across the United States. We have captured people's attention because we really are at a crisis point because, at least in my district, the Sixth District of Minnesota, people are paying close to $4 for a gallon of gas. I know that the national average is at about $4.11 a gallon. It's at historic highs and people are frantic. \n",
      "   When I was home over the break, I had met with people from all aspects of dealing with the energy issue. In particular, I met with some car dealers and they told me that people come into the dealership, this was Morrie Wagner Chevrolet, and they told me that they have people literally coming into the store with panicked looks on their faces saying, Take my truck, take my SUV. It's a new car. Take my minivan. It's new. We still owe quite a bit of money on it but we can't afford to drive this thing. Sheer panic and trying to find anything else because they just don't know how much higher prices are going.     \n",
      "   But I say that we are at a refreshing point in this debate for this reason: We have clarity right now on the debate that we have never had before. Frankly, I have been baffled; baffled by how are we going to be able to get us back to $2 a gallon gasoline or less? And I mean that sincerely. I know that we can be at $2 a gallon again. \n",
      "   It wasn't that long ago when I took office, 18 months ago. I am a first-termer in Congress, Mr. Speaker. When I came in, gas was $2 and change a gallon. Think of that. Eighteen months ago, gas was $2 and change, and here we are topping out at over $4 a gallon gasoline. \n",
      "   What happened in that amount of time, when we have seen a 76 percent rise in the price of gasoline? What happened? We have seen worldwide demand go up and up and up, so that worldwide demand exceeds the amount of supply. That has fed into the price going up and up and up. \n",
      "   Well, what do we do to deal with that? We need to get more supply so we can get the price down. Why isn't that happening? It is really clear to me now. And I was baffled about this. I couldn't believe it, but it is absolutely true. \n",
      "   The Democrats' position so far, Mr. Speaker, has been drive less, pay more. That is where they are coming from. I find that really hard to believe. I grew up a Democrat in a Democrat home, and I thought that just can't be. It defies commonsense. Drive less, pay more? That is your plan? \n",
      "   Well, that isn't just some Republican saying that. That is the Democrats' own words. There was just an aide of the Democrat leadership that just came out and said, ``This is what our plan is: It is drive small cars and wait for the wind.'' That is actually true. This was not a tongue in cheek remark. It is ``drive small cars and wait for the wind.'' Well, I don't know about you, but I think Members of Congress are going to be gone with the wind if we don't do something about the price of gasoline to bring it down again. \n",
      "   Not only that, I was reading on the Hill from Roll Call newspaper and another Democrat leadership aide had this to say: They said that the majority is confident they would be able to defeat the offshore drilling amendment. \n",
      "   Now, just think of that for a moment, Mr. Speaker. The Democrats are confident they would be able to defeat the offshore drilling amendment, which means what are we supposed to do for energy? We have got to go get it. We have got to drill for it. They want to kill being able to drill offshore to bring on line the energy that we need so we  can get the American people back to $2 a gallon and so we can get the economy back on track. But they are confident that they can kill this bill. \n",
      "   They have no intention of bringing more energy supplies on line. In fact, this aide was quoted as saying, ``We have defeated that amendment before, and we will defeat it again.'' They are proud of it. They admitted, at least I give them credit for that, yes, it is true, the Democrats are responsible for defeating drilling to get the energy that we need, and they are confident they are going to defeat it again. \n",
      "   It is almost unbelievable to me, because, as this chart says, what we need to do is bring it on. If we are short on energy, we need to bring it on. We need to bring the onshore oil on line, we need to bring the offshore oil on line, and the new refineries on line, because we are the Saudi Arabia of oil. We have more oil in three States, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, we have more oil in those three States than all of Saudi Arabia. We have 25 percent of the world's coal in this country. We can be the Saudi Arabia of coal. We have more natural gas. We have 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico, and we can't get it. \n",
      "   Now, why is that? It is because of Congress. Congress created this problem. We are about the only country in the world that has made it illegal to access our own energy. Congress created this problem. Congress can solve this problem by making it legal to access our own energy reserves. \n",
      "   Well, that can't be done. We hear, Mr. Speaker, from the Democrat presidential nominee, Senator Obama, it will take 20 years before we can get any of this energy on line. Are you kidding? That is balderdash, so-to-speak. Of course, we can. \n",
      "   I have a bill that I am introducing this week that will fast track the permitting so we can have the Secretary of the Interior start immediately to get it online. We need to do this, the American people want us to do this, and we can get back to $2 a gallon gas. \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. Congressman. \n",
      "   I'll be referring to an article that came out. It's a shocking article that many of us in this Congress read just a few weeks ago, and I commend the American people to pick this up on the Internet or go find it at your local library. June 23, 2008, the Wall Street Journal newspaper, it's on page 1. It's an article by Stephanie Simon called ``Abortion Provider Goes Upscale. Aid For Poor Questioned.'' And here is the bottom line of this article. \n",
      "   It exposes the fact that Planned Parenthood, a 501(c)3 organization, which is a nonprofit organization--in other words, Planned Parenthood pays no taxes. They don't have to pay taxes because they're considered a nonprofit. This nonprofit is big business. It was started back in 1916 by Margaret Sangar, a woman who promoted eugenics, and this organization has now become a big box retailer, big abortion, in other words. It is a big retailer. And it brought in, get this, $1 billion in revenues--$1 billion in revenues. \n",
      "   Not only does this organization not pay taxes like other businesses do, but they receive in that $1 billion, almost one-third of what they receive comes in the form of your tax money, Federal tax money, State tax money. But get this: they receive almost $1 billion, according to this article, in annual revenue, one-third of that coming from Federal and State grants to care for women. The nonprofit ended the year with a surplus of a $115 million. \n",
      "   So they had your money, your money that you're paying in taxes. They had an extra $115 million cash on hand at the year end. A $1 billion budget, and they had that much cash on hand, about 11 percent of its revenue, net assets of $952 million, almost a billion dollars in net assets. \n",
      "   So the article asks, Why are we giving them so much money? That's exactly right. Why are they receiving, as Congressman MIKE PENCE asked, why are we giving them so much tax money? They have 882 clinics State-wide, and they quietly dropped their statement that said no matter what a person's income, we're going to be helping those people. \n",
      "   Well, let me tell you, they've made a decision, Planned Parenthood, that they are going to go after the affluent. How do I know that? It's happening in my district, and it was detailed in this article. It said three express centers in wealthy Minnesota suburbs and shopping centers and malls, places where women are already doing their grocery shopping, picking up their Starbucks, living their daily lives. \n",
      "   Do we understand what this is? This is to promote women, to promote that woman intentionally take the lives of their unborn children. We are asking God-fearing Americans to subsidize this brutal and bloody procedure on a regular business in upscale shopping malls all across the United States. \n",
      "   Not only are they not paying taxes, but we are giving them over $330 million a year to do this dastardly deed. And when they do this, do you realize they could take this money and they can use it for political functions? I don't know how this works. What a game. Who wouldn't want to get in on this? \n",
      "   And all across the country, we have very poor, struggling life care centers, organizations that are trying to give positive alternatives to women. They don't get these grants. They don't get them. They get local donations to try to help women make a decision about saving lives and choosing life. \n",
      "   I just want to end with the fact that if we can agree on nothing else, it should be that the United States taxpayer shouldn't have to pay taxes to an organization that uses your money to  politicize, yes, in upcoming elections candidates who give them more of your tax money. This is unconscionable. \n",
      "   And I look so forward to hearing what our colleagues are going to have to say to the American people about this gross injustice. You bet we should defund Planned Parenthood. We should take away their tax fund and we should defund. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, today we are debating a bill which addresses an issue that is near and dear to my heart: helping those with mental health disorders. \n",
      "   As the wife of a clinical therapist, I have seen the many challenges that people who have mental health disorders face day after day. \n",
      "   These are very real impairments--but through counseling and appropriate treatments, real breakthroughs can be made. \n",
      "   We can help those individuals who suffer, as well as their families and our overall society. \n",
      "   But I have serious concerns about the scope of this legislation and the impact it will have on the affordability of health insurance for all Americans. \n",
      "   By mandating that group health plans offer the same financial benefit structure for both mental and physical disorders, the cost of insurance will increase across the board--and with accessibility of health care services and the affordability of health care coverage so paramount a concern for families across the country. \n",
      "   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost of these mandates in the private insurance market will total $3 billion annually by 2012. \n",
      "   This will inevitably set up a cycle of increasing costs on employers offering health insurance and thus increasing costs for employees seeking to obtain coverage. \n",
      "   These mandates may even have an adverse affect on access to mental health coverage at all. \n",
      "   My colleagues in support of the bill have stressed that it does nothing to require employers to offer coverage of mental health services--it only mandates what this coverage must include on those who choose to offer mental health coverage. \n",
      "   But it is not hard to imagine that many employers who are frustrated with the increased costs the bill will impose on them will simply drop mental health coverage altogether. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, today, over 5 million Americans rely on the National Flood Insurance Program to protect their homes and businesses in the event of a flood. \n",
      "   But since January of last year, there have been over 77 declared disasters involving flooding. And just this August, in our home State of southeastern Minnesota, we experienced severe flooding that caused distress to over 1,500 homes. \n",
      "   According to FEMA, and according to the Minnesota Homeland Security and the Emergency Management, the Federal Government has disbursed at this point nearly $31 million in Federal recovery funds to over 4,200 people. And currently, there are over 8,000 people, specifically, there are 8,434 national flood insurance policies in effect in my home State of Minnesota. \n",
      "   But, unfortunately, as floods continue to occur across our great Nation, the National Flood Insurance Program is in trouble. It's not good news. It's bad news. And the program today, unfortunately, is $18 billion in debt. That's today, as it stands, and it's required to pay that debt back with interest over time. This debt will be paid back with the premiums that are charged to those families who are relying on this flood insurance program. \n",
      "   The base bill that's before us is a good one because it attempts to help solve some of the fiscal problems today that are facing the National Flood Insurance Program. We agree with that, Mr. Speaker. \n",
      "   But, yet, there is one provision in this bill that has the potential to undo the very positive reform that is before us, and that is to send the flood insurance program into even further fiscal disarray and result in premium increases for homeowners all across America, something that no one in this body would want to do. \n",
      "   The proposal, Mr. Speaker, that's included in this bill is to expand the National Flood Insurance Program by creating a brand-new insurance program for wind damage. That's something that has never existed before, and it's akin to a homeowner who, upon discovering that his foundation is rotting, decides to ignore that problem and instead adds a second story on to that rotting house. And he shouldn't be surprised then when the whole house collapses around him. \n",
      "   I have a very simple amendment, Mr. Speaker, and it says this: it does not strike the brand-new wind insurance program. What it does is this: it stipulates that before the program can go into effect, three things have to occur. This is something that we can all agree on: \n",
      "   Number one, there has to be a certification that the existing National Flood Insurance Program, in fact, is actuarially sound, and this certification would provide all of us with the assurance that this program is correctly pricing its policies and has adequate reserves on hand to handle large flood events. We've seen that there's been a problem with this in some of the State reserve accounts. \n",
      "   Today, right now, both the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Budget Office have reported that the National Flood Insurance Program is likely to not be actuarially sound. \n",
      "   Second, there has to be a certification that premiums for people in the existing flood insurance program will not be increased to subsidize this brand-new insurance program. People all over America are wondering if that's going to happen to them as well as the insurance companies. \n",
      "   And then third, of this simple amendment, it says there has to be a certification that the new wind insurance program will, itself, be fiscally sound. Who can argue with that? \n",
      "   So, Mr. Speaker, the 8,434 people of the State of Minnesota and the 5 million Americans who today rely on our National Flood Insurance Program, they need to serve as a lifeline in the event of a major storm, that they would not have that program in endangered, that their premiums would not, in fact, be increased in order to help create, in fact, this new expansion of an expansion of a wind program. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, I thank my dear colleague for allowing me this moment to address the body. \n",
      "   I, too, offer my condolences and sympathy to the Members and families of our Minnesota community who endured one of the most horrific losses that anyone can imagine. When it's a beautiful, wonderful evening in Minnesota in August, August 1, when people are on their way to the Twins game and home from work, their minds are on the BBQ and what they're going to do when they go home, what they're going to say to their husband, what they're going to say to their wife, going to their child's T-ball game or their soccer game, those were the kind of things that were on the minds of Minnesotans when all of a sudden, inexplicably, this bridge that is the most traveled bridge in the State of Minnesota went down. Something no one would ever imagine could happen happened. \n",
      "   The Saturday after the bridge collapse occurred, I had the opportunity to go back and meet with some of the first responders, as my colleagues did as well. And I think to a person we can say what we saw that day was nothing short of just the joy and the grief, all of the emotions mixed together on the faces of the firemen, faces of the policemen, faces of the health care professionals as well who were there, who saw that horror firsthand and did what we expect that they would do, be first responders. Seems like an ordinary thing that they should do their job, but it's never an ordinary thing to lay down your life for your fellow man. That's what a police officer does every day when they put on that uniform. That's what a fireman does every day when they put on that uniform. And that day they were called upon to do that duty, make that sacrifice. They did it. And I'll tell you what, I could not be more proud of those first responders. \n",
      "   And it was wonderful, too, Madam Speaker, to see how in this body this wasn't a Republican or Democrat issue, this was about being human, this was about loving our fellow man. And I can't say enough about the effort of the two parties to come together and unanimously making the right decision, and that is, authorizing the  money for this bridge to get it up and built again, and then hopefully now appropriate that money to get it up again. \n",
      "   I commend Congressman Ellison, Congressman Walz, I commend Congresswoman McCollum and everyone in our delegation who came together to get behind this bridge. But more importantly, it's the first responders who came together and laid down their lives. \n",
      "   One of the people who did that was a constituent of mine. I just want to mention him a little bit. His name is Gary Babineau, 24 years old, lives up in Blaine. He is a construction worker. Gary was coming home from work that night, like most Minnesotans, thinking about what he was going to do. His wife is due with their first baby 2 weeks later. And that's what he was thinking about, that new little baby that was about to come 2 weeks from now, when all of a sudden he was right across from that yellow school bus that we all saw on the news. And Gary's truck was on the bridge, and he felt the bridge go down. And in a moment of time, his black pickup truck fell 30 feet down to the bottom. He never thought he would wake up again. He never thought he would open his eyes again, but he did. And he couldn't believe it, he could move. His back was severely hurt, but he could move. He got out of that truck and he went and he helped person after person get out of their vehicle, carried people to safety. And then Gary remarkably, here in the midst of having a severely injured back, he jumped off the bridge, got onto the ground, got back on the bridge, not knowing that the bridge would be stable, got on that bridge and went immediately to that yellow school bus. And he then assisted those 50 children getting off that bus. And as a matter of fact, it was reported in the paper it said, Gary Babineau said, ``I could see the whole bridge going down, and I was going down, too,'' he said. ``I have a baby coming in 2 weeks and that's all I could think about. We hit bottom, and I couldn't believe that I could open my eyes, I couldn't believe that I could move.'' \n",
      "   Gary Babineau was an ordinary man, but he became a first responder and he helped save lives. At the moment that he was needed he did it. We kind of expect that that's what Americans would do. We're just good people, we help each other in time of need. And here in this tragedy, as we have seen other tragedies that have befallen our Nation, when things didn't go exactly right in the recovery effort, here in Minnesota we saw that things were right. It happened right. And the reason why it happened right was because of first responders, official first responders, nonofficial first responders. But they did what was right because they acted out of love, out of a heart of love for their fellow man. \n",
      "   So I thank those first responders, the firemen, the policemen, the average Joes, the Gary Babineaus in their truck. And I thank the Federal officials, our President, our Members of Congress. I thank the county officials, the city officials, the State officials. Everybody did what was right. \n",
      "   But thank you, Congressman Ellison. This was the right resolution to bring forward today to honor these selfless individuals who none of us could live without. Thank you, first responders. I encourage my colleagues to give us a unanimous vote to this wonderful resolution. \n",

      "   Vera was born in 1902 in Melrose, Minnesota, on May 31, a great day. She is an unassuming Minnesotan, Mr. Speaker. She married, and 2 years later she moved to the big city of St. Cloud, Minnesota. During her time there, she touched many people's lives. Like so many Americans, she had numerous friends. She was on a bowling league for 40 years and she worked in the local department store. \n",
      "   But, Mr. Speaker, Vera Werner accomplished the most important work of any American: She was a mother to four children, she was a grandmother to 21, a great-grandmother to more than 40, and she has so many great-great-grandchildren that people can't keep count. There is no more important function as an American, Mr. Speaker, than to be a good mother or a good father. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. \n",
      "   I also want to thank the Speaker of the House for making the case why so many Republicans are unwilling at this point to sign on to this legislation that's before us. However, I do believe also, Madam Speaker, that Democrats and Republicans are both committed to finding a way out of this financial challenge, and we think we have one. But the answer we believe needn't cost taxpayers $700 billion. \n",
      "   The problem is a lack of credit for creditworthy people, people who are fully capable of paying that credit back. Why is there a lack of credit? It's because the SEC has mandated accounting rules that have forced banks to value assets well below their actual economic value. \n",
      "   So what does this mean? It means that if a bank has $1 worth of deposits, they can make $10 in loans. But if accounting rules are forcing banks to devalue assets, $500 billion, then that means that banks are prohibited from making $5 trillion worth of loans. And that's why we have a credit crunch. \n",
      "   Unfortunately, the bill that we have before us today doesn't even address this credit crisis. \n",
      "   Let's first direct the SEC to suspend mark-to-market accounting rules for assets for which there is no market. That only makes sense. Second, stop naked short selling. Then the FDIC can issue net asset certificates that saved banks during the S&L crisis and the FDIC can write a letter to United States banks telling them in the absence of fraud that the FDIC will fully back all deposits for first-tier creditors. \n",
      "   Let's try these practical solutions before we pull the trigger on a $700 billion bailout that doesn't even address the underlying program. \n",
      "   Today, Madam Speaker, Republicans and Democrats agree. It's time for a rest. It's time for a break. Let's embrace a practical solution before we tie a $700 billion bailout around the neck of the American people. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. \n",
      "   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for her wonderful amendment this evening. \n",
      "   Mr. Chairman, I am new to this body, and one thing I found is that in Minnesota, we have a little bit different definition of ``transparency.'' \n",
      "   ``Transparency'' in Minnesota means an individual stands on one side of a divide, and they can look through to see something on the other. Here in the case of this bill, you have the taxpayer and you have Members of Congress trying to look through a divide, and what they see on the other side is a very interesting definition of ``transparency.'' \n",
      "   Mr. Chairman, the first thing that they see is a slush fund for earmarks. And this is something I don't quite understand; the Democrat majority, they are leaving lump sums of money without a specified purpose in legislation being considered by this House and then later authorizing those funds for earmarks in a closed-door conference committee. It is just a real interesting definition of transparency, because the Democrats have created now, Mr. Chairman, a slush fund for earmarks which will be funded by the largest tax increase in American history. This is just so interesting to me, this new definition of ``transparency.'' \n",
      "   Also a part of this definition is that earmarks will no longer be allowed to be challenged here on this House floor because under the Democrats' rules, Members will be prohibited from challenging individual earmarks in bills on the floor or debating their merit as long as there is a list of earmarks in the bill. \n",
      "   But what is interesting, Mr. Chairman, is that it won't matter if this list is flat-out wrong, if it is incomplete, or whether the earmark which is one that a Member would like to debate is missing from the list. It is just a real interesting definition of ``transparency.''  \n",
      "   The ``truth in labeling'' that we are seeing in this bill is also interesting, Mr. Chairman, because earmark-laden bills can now be certified as earmark-free. Real interesting. I guess it depends on what the meaning of ``free'' is. \n",
      "   Democrats will be allowing their bills to be certified by the majority as earmark-free even if they contain earmarks. So as long as you take a magic wand, Mr. Chairman, and wave it over the bill, you can just say, ``Voila, it is now earmark-free.'' It is kind of like having fat-free french fries. It is something we would all love to have, but it just isn't possible. As long as any bill is certified by Chairman Obey as earmark-free, then, under the House rules, it is earmark-free. \n",
      "   This rule was exploited earlier in February, Mr. Chairman, by the House Democrats when they passed their continuing resolution that contained hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded, hidden earmarks, kind of like those fat-free french fries. \n",
      "   The largest tax increase in history, Mr. Chairman, is in the budget that was passed by the House Democrats, and that will likely be the story. Even though the majority likes to claim otherwise, they will raise taxes by at least $217 billion, Mr. Chairman, in all likelihood most likely $392 billion, and will raise marginal rates, except for the 10 percent rate, and capital gains rates and dividend rates and prevent a full repeal of the death tax, items the American public have indicated they are not for. \n",
      "   Speaker of the House Pelosi had said earlier that the budget should be ``a statement of our National values.'' Well, not only is this budget, Mr. Chairman, the largest in American history, it will sanction the largest tax increase in history upon more American families, because people in Minnesota, Mr. Chairman, my home State, will be paying an average of more than $3,000 a year more to this town, Washington, D.C. Again, a very interesting definition of ``transparency.'' \n",
      "   The budget is going to trigger more tax hikes, and it will greatly increase domestic spending. It will increase nondefense appropriations by $23 billion above what we spent in 2007. That is in addition, Mr. Chairman, to the $6 billion that the Democrats have already added to the omnibus bill and more than $20 billion in the war supplemental. \n",
      "   The American people, Mr. Chairman, are very concerned as well about the unlimited emergency spending, because the Democrat budget is going to abandon the emergency set-aside that was established in last year's budget resolution and change what Congress can call an emergency, unlimited exemption, exempting the Senate spending bill from any limits. \n",
      "   This is really, Mr. Chairman, putting the next election above the next generation, something that none of us should want to do. The Democrats in this bill, unfortunately, have ignored the warnings of the entitlement crisis. Let's not forget, we have heard from the Comptroller General David Walker. \n",

      "   During their time in the Middle East, the First Brigade Combat Team protected lives and helped to preserve the blessings of liberty here at home. They discovered 462 improvised explosive devices, IEDs, before they were able to wreak havoc on the innocent. By finding these IEDs prior to detonation, the First Brigade Combat Team surely saved the lives of countless fellow soldiers and Iraqi citizens. They also captured over 400 suspected insurgents and completed 137 reconstruction projects. In addition, the First Brigade Combat Team successfully processed over 1.5 million vehicles and 400,000 Iraqis into entry control points without any insurgent penetrations. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor the First Brigade Combat Team, whose bravery and commitment to serving our country is as apparent today as it has been in wars long past.

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding, and I honor and commend both the gentleman from Illinois and his counterpart for this important legislation. \n",
      "   And the gentleman is correct. My husband and I were privileged to be involved with raising 23 foster children. I am happy to report that each of them graduated from high school. They are launched into the world, and they are leading their lives. And, again, it was a privilege for me and my husband and also for our five biological children to be a part of their success story. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, that is why I rise today in support of this very important bill because it recognizes the month of November as ``National Homeless Youth Awareness Month.'' The problem of homelessness here in this country is a tragic one and we hope a preventable one, but the issue of homeless youth is especially devastating. \n",
      "   More than 2 million children and youth, Mr. Speaker, in our country are homeless for at least one night every year. It is almost impossible for many, not only just Minnesotans but for many Americans, to get their arms around that figure. \n",
      "   Many of these children have suffered various forms of abuse, which is also difficult to understand, or maybe were just thrown out on the street by their families. While others have spent years moving from home to home to home in various foster care systems. \n",
      "   In our own personal situation, we took in teenagers. We didn't take babies. And we were the last stop in a kid's life. Once they were placed in our home, that was it. We were their last stop. And it was our joy to be able to then launch them off into the world. I have a special interest in these latter cases because of our experience and because of the joys that we had in learning from these wonderful human beings. \n",
      "   These children often came from unstable families. And once they are placed, unfortunately, we saw firsthand they tend to get lost in the shuffle of a new home. It is difficult when you are a foster child and you are placed in a new home. You are not sure what your place is. You are not sure how you belong. And especially when you are in a new school, you kind of sometimes feel like you are second class even if your foster parents love you and don't want you to feel that way.     \n",
      "   Students often begin to feel as though no one really cares about them. And you know, Mr. Speaker, that's one thing my husband always said; we have to show these children that there is at least one adult in their life that's crazy about them. And if we can offer them that much, maybe that can be our part in their world. \n",
      "   In some of the worst cases, these children may even experience more abuse in what should be a safe place in foster homes. Not all foster homes are perfect, unfortunately. And even in the best cases, once a foster child turns 18, which is true for all of our children, except one, they're removed from the system, removed from the foster home, and they are made to live on their own, even though many of them aren't ready. As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, many children, I would say just from an anecdotal point of view, are less prepared than children who come from a biological home to be able to make it on their own when they're age 18. \n",
      "   And so unfortunately, as a result, 25 percent of foster children leaving care experience homelessness within 4 years of leaving their foster home. Just think, 25 percent, one-fourth of all foster children, when they leave that foster home, become homeless. Regardless of their backgrounds, once they become homeless, many youth find then that they are unable to lift themselves out of that situation. \n",
      "   While we can all kind of vaguely imagine what homelessness is like, I recently had the opportunity to hear the testimonies of two people who experienced homelessness, including a very courageous statement by the singer Jewel, absolutely lovely young woman, and her story was heartwrenching. She described how she had to wash her hair in a fast-food bathroom and what it was like for her to watch people as they looked down on her as a homeless teenager. She described her inability to find adequate shelter or food, as well as the feeling of hopelessness that she felt while fending for herself on the streets. \n",
      "   Despite these foster children's best efforts, continuing to go to school or finding a way to be able to hold a job becomes near close to impossible because they face a constant threat of illness, of violence, even worse things.  \n",
      "   What struck me the most about children who experience homelessness is that through everything they experienced, all they wanted is to just not be written off by people who saw them only as homeless kids and not as the people, the human beings that they really are and the potential that they had. They're good kids, Mr. Speaker, as I'm sure you would agree; they just have been dealt a bad hand. \n",
      "   A child never deserves to be left in the street. Congress has to ensure that those who have been cast out will be cared for and will be given the chance to grow into successful adults. It's time that we shed light on the problem of homeless youth and children. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Chairman, the proposed amendment that I'm bringing before the body today removes $106 million from Amtrak funding, restoring it back to the fiscal year 2007 level, and it adds that amount to the Homeless Assistance Grants. \n",
      "   Madam Chairman, Amtrak has run a deficit for over $1 billion every year. It is now funded at $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2008 in the Democrats' THUD bill, an increase of $106 million over the fiscal year 2007 levels. It's $600 million over the President's request. \n",
      "   Much of this deficit stems from Amtrak's long-distance routes, which carry only 15 percent of Amtrak's passengers, but that creates 80 percent of its cash operating losses. \n",
      "   Although Congress has made several attempts at getting Amtrak to reform itself, these attempts have resulted in very little improvement, I'm afraid, and tax dollars are continuing to be wasted on a service that is used by only a very small fraction of our American population. \n",
      "   It just seems to me that rather than pouring money into this colossally losing investment, we should stop pouring good money after bad, and Congress ought to be funding programs that are proven to help people that are in need and deliver results. We need to help poor people. We shouldn't help poor programs. I think we should be saying no, Madam Chairman, to poor programs because we should not be saying no to poor, homeless people just to continue to prop up a bloated government bureaucracy. \n",
      "   One such program is the Homeless Assistance Grants program. It has been awarding competitive grants to cities, to counties, to nonprofits, to housing authorities to provide transitional and permanent housing for the homeless. \n",
      "   In Minnesota, we have some great programs. Grants have gone to Lutheran Social Services in Minnesota, the Amherst H. Wilder Foundation, the Tubman Family Alliance, great groups. These have proven themselves to be very successful in housing programs in Minnesota. \n",
      "   The problem with Amtrak is not that rail is bad, but this program again has been running in the red. It's been bleeding, it's been hemorrhaging, and it needs transfusion, a big transfusion of over $1 billion in tax money every year. It's running in the red. We do not want to be owners of a loser of a program. It requires Federal assistance to cover these losses and the losses from their capital investment. Clearly, for all the years it's been in existence, Amtrak would not survive without this Federal funding. \n",
      "   In Minnesota, we have an old Lakota Indian proverb, and it says, if your horse is dead, get off. And the wisdom of our Native American is pretty clear, and I think that we should follow our Lakota elders when they have enough sense to dismount. \n",
      "   This bill would fund Amtrak again at $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2008. That's $106 million more than the 2007 level, $600 million over the President's request. $1 billion is worth a lot. If you fraction it out, it it's $1,000 a day every day, including Sundays, for 2,440 years. Even for government, that's a lot of money, and still after 35 years, Amtrak hasn't been able to get it right, Madam Chairman. \n",
      "   The Federal Government has provided $30 billion to Amtrak. On average, that's a Federal subsidy of over $210 per passenger per thousand miles that are traveled. It seems that the Federal Government can't even get people to ride Amtrak, so we almost pay them to ride the line. In fact, in 2005, the Sunset Limited route connected L.A. with Orlando. That route required a subsidy of $433 per passenger each way. That's on top of the round-trip fare of about $950 that each passenger paid. That's more than enough to buy a plane ticket for each passenger and save them a trip lasting 68 hours, but that's only if the trains run on time, and only 41 percent of the time do the trains run on time. \n",
      "   It gets worse, though, Madam Chairman. The passengers on sleeper cars are the most heavily subsidized. The average passenger in a sleeper car gets an additional $206 subsidy. That reaches an extra $358 per passenger depending on the route. So that means that the highest government subsidies go to passengers sitting in first class. We could be giving this money to homeless people, and that's our priority. \n",

Given the current instability in our credit markets and, Madam Speaker, given the pressing need for this United States Congress to focus on the financial services bailout that is now before us, this bill is simply not what the United States Congress should be debating today. In fact, this bill is just another example of how this Congress far too often charges ahead without full contemplation of the consequences of its actions. \n",
      "   In today's global marketplace, Madam Speaker, consumers are paying for products and services more and more with credit and debit cards, rather than with cash payments. It's a completely different way today that we have of doing business. In fact, electronic payments now account for more than half of all consumer purchases here in the United States. \n",
      "   With the increasing role that credit cards play in the everyday lives of most Americans, it's both timely, and appropriate that we update and improve standards to protect those American consumers from unfair and deceptive credit card practices. \n",

      "   The Federal Reserve Board has made a proposal. They proposed a rule known as Regulation Z which prescribes uniform methods for computing the cost of credit for disclosing credit terms and for resolving errors on certain types of credit accounts. This proposed rule is virtually identical to H.R. 5244, the Credit Card Holder's Bill of Rights Act of 2008. \n",
      "   While both Regulation Z and this bill are offered with the best of intentions, both could have very serious unintended consequences, and they could pose potentially significant, unnecessary costs on consumers and the United States economy. Goodness knows we don't need that right now. \n",
      "   Madam Speaker, Congress should absolutely allow the Federal Reserve Board's rulemaking process to play out before we rush to codify this proposed rule into law. The public comment periods, the public notice both serve a very important role that I think we all agree that will ensure that this government carefully considers every angle before we jump to regulatory change. \n",
      "   I'm very actually sorry to see the House Financial Service Committee hastily move to implement H.R. 5244 before the rulemaking process even had time to play out. It seems like that's the game now in Washington, DC: rush to judgment. Quick, hasty moves before the public even has time to weigh in. That's not democracy at its best, Madam Speaker, because this action shut out the comments of consumers. It shut out nonprofit organizations. It shut out industry representatives. It's certainly not in the best interests of credit card holders. \n",
      "   We all know that when Congress moves too quickly and bypasses important parts of the process, that it often does more harm than good. Take a look at this week. Take a look at what we're about to do: put the American consumer on the hook for almost another trillion dollars in bad debt. \n",
      "   This Congress has a responsibility to the people that we serve and to businesses to analyze this proposal's overall effectiveness and the effect on the cost of credit and market liquidity. Let's remember, the underlying, underpinning of this current crisis is the lack of liquidity. In other words, money into the marketplace. And that's very true today. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you to Congressman BOB LATTA. Thank you so much for your leadership on this issue and also for the fact that you've been willing to take on interest group after interest group on this issue, because one thing that I have learned, being a freshman Member of Congress, is that there are interest groups who are speaking loud and clear, and they aren't speaking on behalf of the American people who need to get gas prices back down to $2 a gallon or less, what they were just months ago. It wasn't that long ago that gas prices were $2.32 cents a gallon. And I'm sure that our colleague from Georgia, Mr. Gingrey, remembers. When we took office in January of 2007, gas prices were $2.32 a gallon. What are we being told now? That'll never happen again. We can never get gas prices back down to that level. \n",
      "   Well, we can't if the special interests that are now running this town stay in charge. They're exactly right. We never  can get it down. But we can get it down to $2.32 a gallon if we do what the American people called us to do when we came here, because as Congressman Latta knows, this is a congressionally created problem. This is not a problem of lack of energy resources in this country. This is not a problem of lack of technology for accessing these resources. \n",
      "   The problem is the United States Congress that has made it virtually illegal to access the answer to our problem that's contained right here underground, whether it's 27 percent of all the world's coal supplies, as I heard Congressman Gingrey state in his remarks, or whether it's the fact that we are the ``Saudi Arabia of Oil'' with three States, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, that have more oil than all of Saudi Arabia contained in shale oil. Or whether the answer is in natural gas, which we have over 420 trillion cubic square feet in the Gulf Coast region, or whether it's wind or solar or conservation. We've got it all. And again, the United States Congress is the problem. \n",
      "   What's that led to? \n",
      "   That's led to the largest wealth transfer in American history. Over $700 billion has gone out of our pockets directly overseas to people who don't like us to purchase energy. $700 billion. \n",
      "   Isn't it interesting that what we are hearing right now in this financial crisis is that the American people are being asked to pony up $700 billion to bail out private companies out of a financial mess that they've gotten themselves into. So just think about that for a moment. \n",
      "   Had we been drilling here in our own country, rather than going overseas to purchase foreign sources of energy, we would have had $700 billion worth of American dollars staying here within our own borders. \n",
      "   Now, Congressman Latta, I'm sure that you would agree with me that we would far prefer to see $700 billion worth of investment stay in the United States, because that would mean $700 billion worth of jobs that could have been created in the United States. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. What that means is $700 billion translates to one-sixth of the American economy. Eighteen percent of the American economy was transferred from your pocket at the pump overseas to people who don't like us very much. Now those countries are enriched with $700 billion worth of American money that could have stayed here. \n",

Well, we all know what's happened with the mortgage industry and with the housing industry. Imagine the impact that that's made on this company in my district for manufacturing windows. This is tremendously important. This is real. This is real pain that the American people are feeling, and it is fueling this crisis that we're seeing, both on Main Street and on Wall Street. \n",
      "   I don't know about you, but I've gotten an earful when I'm home talking to my constituents, and they want to know that, they are incredulous that the Democrat-controlled Congress, because, again, Republicans have not controlled Congress for almost 2 years. The Democrats have controlled Congress. \n",
      "   And under Democrat control, in 2 years we have seen gas prices escalate 76 percent. That's right. Gas prices have escalated 76 percent, and we have seen the largest wealth transfer in American history go out of your pocket over to countries that don't like us very much. \n",
      "   How can we reverse that? \n",
      "   Congressman Latta, what would be the solution that we can reverse that so that we could keep American money right here in the economy and start buying those American-made washing machines that are in your district and American-made windows that are in my district? \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. And if the gentleman would yield on that point, I just wanted to mention regarding jobs once more. Both yourself and I, together with eight of our colleagues, went up to Alaska 2 months ago. And while we were up in Alaska looking at the ANWR region, which, by the way is the most perfect place on the planet to drill for oil, absolutely perfect place. It's perfectly sited. Without any environmental degradation, we could increase American energy supplies by over 50 percent if we would bring on line just oil production in ANWR alone.  \n",
      "   But one thing we heard when we were up there from the people who were giving us tours, the Mineral Management Service, the Bureau of Land Management told us that just bringing on line oil production in Colorado and Alaska would add over 750,000 jobs.     \n",
      "   Over 750,000, three-quarters of a million American jobs, and the jobs in Alaska, we were told, start out with an astounding starting-level salary of $100,000 a year. Now, imagine that. How many Americans wouldn't be willing to go and work where they could be making $100,000 a year? Rather than being one of the largest importers of energy, America could turn around our economy by being one of the largest exporters of energy and one of the largest job creators of energy. \n",
      "   One thing I wanted to add, if I could just take a moment to a talk a little bit about the current economy and the current meltdown in the financial markets. \n",
      "   I have the privilege of sitting on the Financial Services Committee. And one thing that's important to remember, just as this energy crisis was created by the United States Congress because Congress made it illegal to access American energy and has put into law a Prohibition-era mentality on American-made energy production, so, too, Congress created this financial services mess. You ask how. Let me just briefly explain and just in a nutshell how this occurred. \n",
      "   Back in the 1930s, Congress created private companies to back mortgages. So when you go to buy a house from your bank, the bank doesn't keep that mortgage. The bank sells it to an organization called Freddie or Fannie. They're private companies. But the problem is, government implied, with a wink and a nod, that government would back up those mortgages from Freddie and Fannie. So these are private companies, but they can take any bloomin' risk they want because Uncle Sam said you're going to foot the bill in case those mortgages went sour. \n",
      "   Well, fast forward to the late 1970s. In 1977, the Credit Reinvestment Act was passed, and in the early 1990s, there were amendments made to the Credit Reinvestment Act. What did that do? It suspended, for the first time in American history, 200 years' worth of sound financial loan making. \n",
      "   So before when you and your wife, Congressman Latta, if you went to get a loan to buy a house or my husband and I got a loan to buy a house, we had to show that we were credit-worthy risks. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, the banks were ordered under penalty of fine and lawsuit, ``You don't make loans anymore to people who are creditworthy. Now you're forced to make loans to people who are not creditworthy.'' It turned the world upside down. \n",
      "   So the world of banking became like ``Alice in Wonderland'' where banking rules were turned topsy-turvy on their heads and banks were fined or threatened with lawsuits if they did not make loans, a certain quota of loans to people who weren't creditworthy. Guess what? That's when a new product called subprime loans started to be made. And unfortunately, now we all know what subprime loans are. They were made to people who weren't creditworthy, who, in other words, had no means to pay those loans back. \n",
      "   So what is happening today? Today the markets have melted down, and now the American taxpayer is being told, you, Mr. Speaker, and the American people, are being told that they have to pay for what private companies agreed to in contracts. So the beleaguered taxpayer is the forgotten man in this equation. \n",
      "   The American taxpayer didn't ask to be a part of these subprime contracts. They didn't receive any of the benefits. They didn't receive any of the profits when profits were being made. But now that losses are on the horizon, now the American taxpayer is being asked--not asked, forced to pony up at minimum $700 billion of new taxes; which, ironically, $700 billion is the exact amount of money that you, in essence, Mr. Speaker, the American people, have been taxed by these artificially high prices of gasoline. \n",
      "   There is no reason why gas prices would be $4 right now, no reason, if we would legalize American energy production. So had we been legalizing American energy production and we had prices low for the American people to pay, whether it's through heating oil or whether it's through natural gas that they pay or through electricity or at the pump, we wouldn't have been enriching all of these foreign countries. We would have had that much more money in our economy, and we may not have seen the meltdown because people would have had the wherewithal to pay their mortgages, to have high-paying jobs, and we may not have seen the subprime mess. \n",

      "   It seems that our energy policy right now is being determined by bureaucracy and by socialistic tendencies, not by the free market. It's imperative that people have the ability to choose the energy needs that they have. \n",
      "   Here in the State of Minnesota, the people that I represent, they're all very soon going to be turning their thermostats up. Some homes are heated by natural gas, some by fuel oil. And we're going to be looking potentially at dramatic spikes in costs for people on their fuel oil and home energy heating. \n",
      "   People in Minnesota don't have a choice. They have to turn on their fuel.  As the gentleman had stated, people right now are making choices about whether or not they could even afford to go to work if they're travelling 50 miles to be able to get to work. \n",
      "   I represent people in the great city of Saint Cloud, Minnesota. I toured a nursing home recently. One thing I was told by the administrators was a lot of the people that they have doing some of the basic work in the nursing homes are making not a high level of income and they don't see also that it's worth it for them to go to work. This is not a good situation that they're being put in. And again, this is artificial because we don't need to be in this situation. \n",
      "   Again, it's because, unfortunately, the Democrat-controlled Congress has maintained a prohibition-era mentality with American energy production. They're just saying, ``No way, no how.'' I don't understand that, Representative Latta. I absolutely don't understand the mindset that says when you're sitting on your own solution, why in the world wouldn't you legalize and open the door to American energy production so we can create jobs and people can pay a lower cost, and so we aren't sending $700 billion overseas. \n",
      "   Here is something I'm very concerned about, Representative Latta. It is Sharia Law, because many of the Islamic nations are now wanting to do business under Sharia Law, Islamic law. This is happening now in the United Kingdom, and this is very concerning. All of the equity, all of the liquidity, the dollars that are available to do business now are in the hands of the people of the Middle East. It makes sense. We just sent them $700 billion of American money---- \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. In one year at the gas pump. \n",
      "   So just think about this now: $700 billion has left American pockets, has gone overseas to the Middle East, to OPEC nations that don't like us very much, they're sitting on $700 billion worth of capital. Guess what Americans are starved for right now? Capital. Money. We have to go somewhere. Our banks right now are starved for money. We're in a credit crunch right now. But Middle Eastern nations are saying, ``Hey, you want to do business with us? You need to come under Sharia, Islamic law.'' \n",

      "   What was that whole exercise for? Did they not realize that for 21 months that gas prices have gone up 76 percent? This is shocking. This is the only thing my constituents have been talking about is the dramatic escalation in the price of energy. Everyone else seems to get it, but unfortunately, the Democrat-controlled Congress sat on its hands for 21 months, and just as the clock is striking midnight now on the 110th Congress, they pass a cruel hoax of a bill last week that won't go anywhere. It's dead on arrival in the Senate. The President will veto it. And here we are, looking at this huge crisis. And what do the American people have to look forward to? A reduction in energy prices? Not on your life. \n",

Because international investors in oil commodities see, hey, the Democrat-controlled Congress, they're not going to do anything about bringing down the price of oil, and guess what, the clock is timing out now on the 110th Congress; I guess we can go ahead and increase the price of oil. That's speculators. \n",
      "   What speculators do is set a pricing function, and they do it based upon information. And the information that this Democrat-controlled Congress has sent out to the world markets is don't worry, we're not going to do anything to increase American energy production; we're going to keep it exactly as it is. And what that does is guarantee  that the poor, beleaguered American taxpayer, the forgotten man in all of this, is doomed to pay even higher prices of energy. \n",

      "   I want to thank Ranking Member Regula for the hard work that he has done on this bill, and also to the chairman for the work that he has done as well. \n",
      "   I have to say that I hope that my ears deceive me in the remarks that I just heard from the chairman. It almost sounded as though the chairman was calling the President of the United States a liar in his remarks. I certainly hope that that wasn't true. If so, I would call on him to take down his remarks, and I trust that that is not the intention of the chairman in his previous remarks. \n",
      "   Mr. Chairman, what I would like to say in the course of my moments before this body is that I believe that all of us are trying to do the best that we can for regular Americans. What the gentlelady from Colorado is trying to do is exceptional. \n",
      "   We had an amendment that was offered previously by Mr. Jordan of Ohio, an excellent amendment that called to have spending at 2007 levels. That makes perfect sense for most of the people in this country, because many people, many businesses, don't have that opportunity to be able to increase their budget at all, let alone to this level of 9.9 percent. \n",
      "   In fact, I will tell you, just in my home State of Minnesota, we have Northwest Airlines, a wonderful, marvelous employer that's had to deal with unbelievable problems since 9/11. \n",
      "   With all of the events that have occurred, that have happened to airlines, their employees have had to endure incredible cuts in their salary. The pilots union, the mechanics union, the stewardesses union, all of them have had to endure cuts. They haven't even been able to stay the same at previous years' levels on their wages, much less increase by 9.9 percent their wages, or, as our colleague, Dr. Price, wanted to cut that increase by 1 percent, 9.9, back to 8.9. Now the gentlelady from Colorado wants to back it off just one-half a percent. \n",
      "   Surely this body should see the wisdom in the gentlelady's amendment. All she wants to do is just have a modicum of economy in her amendment. Surely we should be able to see the wisdom in that. \n",
      "   I have a businessman who has a legacy industry that feeds into the auto industry. He has a business in Minnesota, and he has had to cut costs so dramatically that their business will literally almost go by the wayside if they can't turn things around. \n",
      "   Again, what we are seeing, with businesses, with family, especially in my home State of Minnesota, businesses not only can't increase their expenses by 9.9 percent. They can't increase it by 9.5, 8.9 percent, they can't increase at all. They have to cut back. That's called productivity. That's what America is about. That's one thing Americans do so well. They find more economical ways to produce more with less. \n",
      "   Usually in the course of that, when businessmen are involved in that sort of an adventure, they are somehow able to pay their employees a little bit more by being more productive. They can't always do that, but sometimes that can occur. \n",
      "   Here in this situation, the gentlelady from Colorado just has a very simple goal, and that is just to decrease by 0.5 percent the amount that's being proposed. \n",
      "   The budget is all about people. At the end of the day, it's the people in my district and your district that are paying this big spending spree, almost 10 percent increase in spending over the last year. It's almost as though the people in Congress believe that if at the end of your name you have a comma, and the letters I-n-c period, that this body believes that there is an unending checkbook that this body can dive into and pull a wallet out of a business and say, you've got more.  \n",
      "   So we year after year after year go back to the same well. We go back to the American taxpayer. We go back to American business, and we continue to put burdens on them such that we dig into their wallet and think there is more where that came from. \n",
      "   There is not more where that came from. We looked at the budget battle earlier in this year. In the budget that the majority proposed, there wasn't one attempt to address the problem that we have with unfunded net liabilities that are coming across this Congress in future years, unfunded net liabilities with Social Security, unfunded net liabilities with Medicare. These are very real costs that we are going to have to deal with. This majority in Congress didn't look at that in its bill. \n",
      "   So it's almost as though this Congress is saying we are going to see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. We are making a conscious decision, it seems, to just ignore the very real threat of economic, unfunded net liabilities that are facing this Congress. \n",
      "   I submit again to this body that what the gentlelady is trying to do in her very forward-looking amendment is wise. She is saying let's just pull back a little bit on this grand spending spree and be kind to Americans. Let's be kind to American industry, kind to the American taxpayer and say we understand your plight. We understand that you do more with less, and we are going to do the same. \n",
      "   I would say let's not have the largest tax increase in American history that our friends across the aisle are proposing. Let's not have the largest spending increase in American history. Let's do what Americans do so beautifully, and that's let's be productive. Let's increase productivity, not by government spending more, but by making sure that we return more money to the American taxpayer and say, you know what? We can do what New Zealand did just very recently.     \n",
      "   We can take reform. We can actually do something completely revolutionary, and it would be that we would look at every government program and say, justify what you're doing is right. Justify that what you're doing is helping the American consumer; you're achieving objectives. Instead of the other way around, which is continuing to add more money, in this case, 10 percent, almost 10 percent more increase in a program, without first causing those programs to justify that they're helping the American people. \n",
      "   And that's why I'm so proud of the gentlelady from Colorado (Mrs. Musgrave). She's just trying to bring a very commonsense rationalization to the spending that's being proposed by this body. \n",
      "   If we can't do what Mr. Jordan suggested which, in itself, was very wise, go with 2007 level of spending, which for a lot of American companies, they'd love to be able to have 2007 level of spending. They can't do that. They've got to cut back even more just to stay afloat. \n",
      "   Or do what was proposed by Dr. Price, which is cut back 1 percent of spending. We can't even cut back, as the gentlelady from Colorado proposes, by one-half a percent? \n",
      "   We can do better than that. In my short time here in Congress, one thing I've seen is that, no matter if it's on the Republican side of the aisle or the Democrat side of the aisle, there's a lot of really smart people in this chamber. And I believe that we can do better, Mr. Chairman. And I believe that the gentlelady has a very wise, very commonsense approach, and I would think that the majority body could certainly accede to the fact that we can cut back by one-half a percent, so that we're now going to be spending, then, about 9.4 percent increase. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you, Ms. Foxx. I appreciate that. \n",
      "   Minneapolis/St. Paul is a very nice area. Minnesota is the ``Land of Minnesota Nice,'' and we really do love  people. So y'all come back, if we can borrow that from you. Y'all come back. \n",
      "   My name is Michelle Bachmann. I do represent Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District, and I tell you what I am so pleased about is the fact that the United States, we have the answer to our energy problem. \n",
      "   We have, as Representative Dent of Pennsylvania said, we have an abundance of coal. We're the leader in the world. Twenty-seven percent of the world's supply of coal lies here in the United States of America. \n",
      "   We're the Saudi Arabia of oil in three States alone: Utah, Colorado, Wisconsin. We have more oil than all of Saudi Arabia contained in shale oil. \n",
      "   We have an abundance of natural gas. We have over 420 trillion cubic square feet of natural gas, and that's just in the Gulf of Mexico. \n",
      "   We have so much oil and we haven't even begun to tap what we have in terms of nuclear power, what we can do with wind, what we can do with solar, with all of the inventions that are yet to come out of brilliant young entrepreneurs. All we need to do is unleash it. \n",
      "   But right now, you're looking, Mr. Speaker, at the problem for this, for the energy crisis. It isn't lack of resources. It certainly isn't lack of technology. What it is is lack of will on the part of the United States Congress. Mr. Speaker, the Democrat-controlled United States Congress is the problem for America's energy crisis. Look no further. The Democrat-controlled Congress, under their leadership, their auspicious leadership, has led to an increase of 76 percent in the price of gasoline at the pump.     \n",
      "   Seventy-six percent increase. I've only been here 20 months, and we've seen gas prices go up 76 percent under Democrat-controlled leadership. \n",
      "   Minority leader John Boehner made a decision late in the month of July. He decided to lead 10 Republicans to go up to Alaska to visit the ANWR region that has been so vilified, that we've been told that we absolutely cannot drill up in ANWR, that somehow the world will come to an end if we drill in ANWR. Well, John Boehner, with his leadership, took 10 Republicans--and I was blessed enough to be one of those Republicans to go not only to Colorado to visit the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, but also up to Alaska to ANWR. \n",
      "   And there is one little story that I want to tell the American people before I hand this over to my colleagues to continue, and it's this: While we were up in Alaska visiting our oil-rich region where we were able to go to the North Slope--here is the North Slope of Alaska. Thirty-one years ago, the North Slope of Alaska was the largest producing oil field in the United States. Sadly, 31 years later, this is still the largest producing oil region. Why? Because we have a Prohibition-era mentality when it comes to production of American energy legislation. Because this Congress has made a decision: No more energy production here; if we're going to have energy, we've got to buy it offshore. Well, that is ridiculous; it's why we're in the situation we're in. \n",
      "   But here in the North Slope 31 years ago, when we began building this energy lifeline which is our North Slope Trans-Alaska Pipeline which extends 800 miles from Prudhoe Bay down to Valdez, when we built that 31 years ago we were producing 2.1 million barrels of oil a day. Do you know where we're at now? Seven hundred thousand barrels a day. Within 10 years we will be down to $300,000 barrels a day. You know what happens, Mr. Speaker, when we get down to 300,000 barrels a day? When we get to that point, this energy lifeline that feeds the lower 48, it's going to shut down. And, I mean, when it shuts down, you can't add another oil field and bring it back up into production. And do you know, Mr. Speaker, what it costs us to replace this energy lifeline? Fifteen billion dollars. And it isn't just the $15 billion, it would take several years to rebuild this because this pipeline is made out of stainless steel, and stainless steel doesn't come cheap anymore. \n",
      "   We are in trouble. Because if, as the Democrat nominee, Barack Obama, has said, he doesn't plan to do any more drilling, and Speaker Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat-controlled House, has said she really doesn't plan any more drilling, or as Harry Reid has told us, he really doesn't believe in more drilling, if the Democrats have their way, there won't be more drilling. And so we will have this energy pipeline that has served our interests for over 31 years, it's going to shut down within 10 years time. Shut down. So if we thought $4 a gallon was a lot to pay for energy, we're going to think that's a cheap date because it's going to be $6, $8, $10 a gallon because the Democrat-controlled Congress has said, no how, no way, not on their watch are we ever going to start drilling. It's not going to happen. And it's not going to happen under Barack Obama. \n",
      "   There is a very real choice that the voters have to make come this November, and it's this: Do you want to pay $2 a gallon for gas under a President McCain and a Vice President Palin--who will drill, by the way, for new energy--or do you want to pay $6, $8 or $10 a gallon for gasoline very soon under a Barack Obama and a Democrat-controlled Congress who said no way, no how, never under their watch will they begin the drilling process? It's that simple: $2 a gallon, or $6, $8 or $10 a gallon? That's what the American people will be asking themselves. \n",
      "   And I'll tell you one thing, under a Republican-controlled Congress, if we can get there this fall, this November, there will be a change. There will be drilling in ANWR. There will be drilling in the oil shale region. There will be drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. There will be expansion of clean coal technology. There will be building of 45 new nuclear power plants. Instead of being the world's greatest dependent on foreign energy importation, we will become the world's leading exporter of energy. \n",
      "   Can you imagine? Millions of jobs, high-paying jobs. And I will end with this. As a matter of fact, up in Alaska, what I was told is that entry-level jobs on the North Slope pay over $100,000 a year plus benefits. There's a lot of people from the great State of Minnesota that would go up to take those jobs. \n",
      "   We have the answer. We have got the ticket. We don't have to be mired under $4 a gallon gas or $6 or $8 or $10. Under a Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Speaker, the American people will get back to paying $2 a gallon or less. This is real, and it can happen very quickly. And that's why I'm so grateful to the gentlelady from North Carolina for bringing this important discussion and reminding the American people that under a Democrat-controlled Congress we've seen gasoline prices increase 76 percent. And that can take a nosedive if we see real change at the ballot box this November. \n",

It is wrong if it is against employees, and it is wrong if it is against employers. This bill may very well be seen as discrimination against honest American employers, job creators, because it has a seemingly unending period to file a lawsuit. \n",
      "   With that, women may very well experience real discrimination in that they may find that future employers are reluctant to hire them in the first place for fear of a lawsuit 5, 10, 20, maybe even 40 years down the road. Let's face it, memories fade, people die, they move away, and it becomes difficult, if not downright impossible, for a job creator to defend themselves. \n",

And the topic tonight will be on the topic that's on the minds of Americans all across this country. It's the high price of energy and the impact that that is having on the middle class, on families, on individuals, on farmers and on businessmen. \n",
      "   There is nothing that is shocking us more now, Mr. Speaker, than the high cost of energy and the impact that that is having directly on people all across the country. \n",
      "   When I came into Washington, D.C. this week from my home in Minnesota, I had the privilege of representing the great people in the Sixth Congressional District in Minnesota. And I was reading the newspaper. And I was reading a few things. And I just wanted to bring a couple of headlines to the attention of the American people. \n",
      "   Here is one of the headlines that I read this week when I came in. It was on Tuesday of this week. This headline in USA Today said ``will gas prices plateau after hitting another record?'' It seems like every morning when we wake up and the clock radio goes off next to our bed, we hear about a new increase in the price in gasoline. And we're shocked. And it's like our day already starts out on the wrong foot because we hear about yet one more shocking increase. And we wonder what will we have to give up next? What will we have to give up? What will we have to yield out of our lives? It's a lot of bad news that has been coming this way with the American people. \n",
      "   Let me read this. It says ``$4 plus cost cuts demand even as supply is rising.'' It began, The price of gasoline set another record Monday where the average is going up now again. And this is something that the people are worried about.     \n",
      "   This is something that the people are worried about, the record prices that are going up. As a matter of fact, the price of gasoline today is $4.07 and we will talk a little bit more about that as we go on during the course of the hour that we have together to talk about this very important issue. \n",
      "   Here is another headline that was in USA Today, and this is Tuesday's paper again, and it says, ``Prepare to pay if you don't gas up your car rental.'' If you can believe this, rental car companies are having to charge $8 a gallon when someone who is renting a car returns it to an airport with a less than full tank. Usually we try to guess as well as we can and fill that tank up before we return it to the car rental place because we know the price at the pump for the car rental will be higher. \n",
      "   Well, guess what, that price is now a whooping $8 to $10 a gallon that car rental companies are forced to charge their customers now when cars are returned to the car rental company with a less-than-full tank. \n",
      "   These are numbers, I believe, Mr. Speaker, that none of us ever thought in our wildest dreams that we would ever imagine that we could be paying. This is a lot of bad news that the American people are having to take, along with the flooding, the terrible, terrible conditions that people in Iowa are facing right now, in Arkansas and Missouri, with all of the impact of the weather. \n",
      "   We hear yet more negative reports about how our crops will be impacted. In Iowa, nearly all of the counties are devastated. I was born in the State of Iowa in Waterloo, Cedar Falls, where the Cedar River came up over its banks and flooded that downtown area, displacing hundreds and thousands of people from their homes, and people from their businesses. \n",
      "   And Iowa, as I know from my experience, is a leading corn producer and soybean producer, and so now we see that the price of corn will also probably be going up. \n",
      "   Well, I didn't ask for this hour, to manage this hour just to talk about gloom and doom and the negative. The reason why I started out with these comments, Mr. Speaker, is to identify with all of the American people at home right now who are experiencing this pain, who are experiencing this suffering that they never imagined they would be experiencing with the high cost of energy. \n",
      "   But I am here tonight because I want to talk about the great news, and the great news is this: we are privileged to stand right now on the answer to the problem that is plaguing us, the high cost of energy. And the great news is that we have a key. We have an answer. The American people, the American middle class don't need to suffer any longer. It is unnecessary because we have a key that can be the answer to our problem. And here it is. We can get back to our goal which is $2 a gallon gasoline. This isn't fantasy, this is reality. We can once again see America paying $2 a gallon gasoline. \n",
      "   Are you kidding? How is that going to happen, you ask. Well, easy. This is how we can do it. We need to start to explore here in America. Because the truth be told, America does not have a famine of energy, absolutely not. Just the opposite. We are sitting on the cusp of one of the greatest industries that can be developed in this century and on into the future, one that will deliver millions of high-paying jobs for Americans all across this country. In fact, in every State in this country America could become the leading exporter of energy. You heard me right. America could be the world's leading exporter of energy and create some of the highest-paying jobs known in the world because right here in America we are standing on a veritable treasure trove of energy. So we need to start here, start in America, to access these wonderful resources and we need to do it now in order to get back to $2 a gallon gasoline. In order to be able to get off of foreign dependence on energy, we need to explore here and we need to explore now because then the American people can start to pay less, and that paying less would get us back to $2 a gallon gasoline. \n",
      "   You say how is that possible? How is it possible that once again we could be paying $2 a gallon gasoline? Well, just think, it took us 25 years in this country to go from $1 a gallon gasoline to $2 a gallon gasoline; 25 years to go from $1 to $2. \n",
      "   How long did it take us to go from $2 a gallon gasoline to $4 a gallon gasoline and even more a gallon gasoline? It took us less than 2 years to go from $2 to $4. \n",
      "   Well, what changed? There are a few things that came into the mix. One is the American dollar came into a weakened position. And when the American dollar became weakened, the United States unfortunately found itself very dependent on foreign sources of energy that we were dependent on. \n",
      "   Do you know that from 2007 to 2008 the United States has become 7 percent more dependent on the OPEC nations for our energy, going exactly in the wrong direction. \n",
      "   I don't know of anyone right now, Mr. Speaker, who believes that America should become more dependent on foreign oil. In fact, what I hear from my constituents is can't we get less dependent. \n",
      "   Absolutely. We can be less dependent on foreign oil. In fact, we can become independent of foreign oil and we can become a leading exporter of energy to the world and we can become the head, and not the tail. \n",
      "   Right now America is busy becoming part of the tail when it comes to energy. But we can turn this around. We can become the leading producer and exporter. Well, you ask, how is that possible? I will tell you how it is possible. Take a look at the situation we are in right now. Here is the key to our answer, and now it is up to Congress to unlock that key, unleash this energy and bring the price of gasoline back down to $2 a gallon. It is Congress that has been the bad guy in this scenario. And it is Congress that can be the hero in this scenario. Congress. \n",
      "   Right now Congress has made it illegal, virtually illegal to be able to access this gift of energy. How did we do that? Congress has made it illegal to access the energy that is in the Arctic energy slope up in Alaska. \n",
      "   Do you realize that we already have the Alaskan transatlantic pipeline that was built in the mid-1970s from Prudhoe Bay and has been piping oil from Alaska down into the lower 48. That pipeline is already up in existence, and it is only half of capacity flowing. With a very little effort, we could tap into the Arctic energy slope and begin accessing that over 10 billion barrels of oil that are available to us in the Arctic energy slope. \n",
      "   Do you realize that if we accessed this wonderful source of energy, we will increase American energy production by 50 percent, access to American resources by 50 percent. Also, we have the Outer Continental Shelf that is available to us for deep sea energy reserves. \n",
      "   Now get this, if you thought 10 billion barrels was a lot, just listen, this is 86 billion barrels of oil. You heard me, 86 billion barrels that are available to us to access of deep sea energy reserves that we could tap, get up online, and we could have access to and supply the American people and American industry so that energy would become one of the cheapest costs of doing business rather than one of the most expensive. \n",
      "   Let me give you one little story that I heard yesterday. Northwest Airlines is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We are proud to have this airline in our State. As you know, airlines have come under hard times. I was told yesterday that Northwest Airlines had paid about a billion and a half dollars for fuel last year. Do you know what they had to budget this year, an additional $2 billion to pay for the price of energy. \n",
      "   So Northwest Airlines, instead of spending about a billion and a half on energy, will have to spend this year $3.5 billion on energy. Can you imagine, if that's your industry and that cost, you have to somehow absorb, you just can't absorb it without passing that cost on to your consumer, to your customer, who will be purchasing your product. And those are people who fly on airplanes. That is why we see the price of airline tickets have gone through the roof and why airlines have had to park planes and reduce the number of seats and reduce capacity. Don't fool yourself, America is changing, and we are changing because we don't have energy. \n",
      "   Not only that, we have a gift of natural gas. In the gulf coast region in the Gulf of Mexico, we have what may be  the largest reserves of natural gas, 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas exists right here in the gulf coast region. Do you know that natural gas can be used to fire up electric power plants. With modifications to cars and buses, we could run cars and buses on natural gas. Almost the world's largest supply right here in our backyard, illegal, off-limits. And 85 percent of our Outer Continental Shelf, illegal, off-limits. The Arctic energy slope, illegal, off-limits. And also shale. Do you realize that the Saudi Arabia of oil in the United States is this wonderful ring of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, containing 1.3 trillion, yes, you heard me right, 1.3 trillion barrels of shale oil. This is one of the most exciting finds. We have one of the world's largest supplies of shale oil right here in our backyard. But guess what, it is off-limits. We are handcuffed. We can't access it. Who made all of this off-limits? \n",

      "   We have the key right here, and I have other Members who are with me right now who would also like to weigh in, who are leaders on this issue, passionate about this issue, people who are speaking out and advocating for you, the American people, who want you to be able to again get up in the morning with a happy, light heart realizing you can afford to go to the gas station because you can be paying $2 a gallon gas again. You can see your grocery bills go down. You can see your consumables go down. You can see the price that you are going to be paying for air conditioning this summer and your electric bill go down. This fall in Minnesota when all the furnaces kick back in again, to be able to see your heat bill go back down, this is all to be, all possible. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate that. \n",
      "   I'm sure everyone tonight, Mr. Speaker, can hear the passion in the voices of the people who are speaking in this Special Order hour. It's because we understand from our constituents back home how real this is for them. This is an issue where the American people are way ahead of people in Congress. They get it, how difficult this is, and that's why we have been repeatedly asking our constituents back home in our districts ``Why don't you go ahead and show us how painful this is, how difficult this is, how real this is. Take your receipts from your car when you go and fill up your tank or, if you are a trucker, when you fill up your truck. Take those receipts. Fill them up. Send them to us. Send them to your Member of Congress. We want to be able to have them here so we can demonstrate what tremendous agony this is for Americans.'' \n",
      "   I believe that we should have bushel baskets full of receipts from people when they fill up their gas tanks so we can show people how real this is, the pain at the pump, because that represents money that every person is paying today, money that would be needless, that we don't have to pay because we know we can get back to $2 a gallon. How do we know that? \n",
      "   We know that rather than paying $4.07, which is today's national average for gasoline--it still shocks me when I see that number up on a billboard. We know we've got our answer. This is our answer: Our natural gift from God that he has given to the United States. God has given us these natural resources, and it is our obligation to be good stewards of what we have and to take dominion over this, to take dominion and to cultivate what we have in a safe, sound and environmentally sensitive way so we can take care of the needs of our people and yet also be good stewards of the land. \n",
      "   We have two very different philosophies that we're looking at. For those of us who are speaking now in the Special Order, we're saying explore America; do it now so that Americans can pay less. There is a completely different philosophy that has also been talked about in recent weeks, and that plan is to pay more and to drive less. That's really what it comes down to. Pay more and drive less. But is that what we want for Americans? Is that what we want for this generation and for the next generation? I don't, because this is what I'm concerned about: Whoever controls fuel will control our freedom. Think about that. Whoever controls our energy will control our freedom and will control the future. \n",
      "   Congressman Steve King of Iowa was talking a little bit about climate control legislation, and it's also called a cap-and-trade system. Now, I don't call it ``cap and trade.'' I call it ``tax and spend'' because that's really what it is, in a nutshell, if you want to know what ``cap and trade'' is. \n",
      "   Before I hand this off to Representative Phil Gingrey from Georgia, who has some comments he would like to make, I just want to say a little bit about cap and trade, or what I call ``tax and spend.'' \n",
      "   This proposal that has been coming from people who want you to pay more and drive less, that's their answer regarding this energy crisis. You pay more and you drive less. As a matter of fact, we heard from the nominee of one of the major political parties that his concern was not the high price that Americans are paying for gasoline but how quickly that price is rising. \n",
      "   Well, I think, for those of us who are speaking tonight in this special hour, our real concern is that high price of gasoline because we see not only is it impacting people personally in their pocketbooks, not only is it having a devastating impact on the economy, but it's also impacting our national security because, as we are more dependent on foreign oil and as we're paying ever-increasing prices and sending billions--and now it will soon be $1 trillion--off to other countries that don't like us very much, we are seeing that negative impact here at home. \n",
      "   Let me just say a few words about cap and trade, or tax and spend. Tax and spend works like this: \n",
      "   If you think you're already paying a high price for energy, now what your Federal Government wants to do is to force you to pay for the right to buy that energy. As if it isn't punishing enough to just buy the energy in the first place, you're going to have to pay for the right to buy energy. Now, think of that madness. You're going to have to buy a permit if you're a business. If you're an individual, you're going to be paying indirectly for that permit. \n",
      "   By the way, the Federal Government created the problem. Congress created these high prices. Now, if they haven't mucked it up already, Congress wants to charge you for the right to purchase overly inflated prices of energy. Think of that. By the year 2025, Congress in one bill wants to tax you $6.7 trillion. They want you to pay $6.7 trillion in this tax for the right to purchase very expensive energy. Think of what that is going to do to our economy. \n",
      "   If you do that and if we comply with what all of these grandiose schemes are, guess what the bottom line result will be out of this cap-and-trade or, what I call, tax-and-spend legislation? By the way, the brain trusts who have come up with this scheme have already spent this $6.7 trillion. They have already decided how they're going to spend this money. \n",
      "   But guess what the final result will be. If everything goes perfectly, according to plan, they will only reduce the Earth's temperature, according to their models, by seven one hundredths of a percent. Just think. Are we really willing to devastate the United States' economy? For what? To cool the Earth? Maybe. At seven one hundredths of a percent? \n",
      "   We need to think about this really carefully and have a debate right here, a genuine debate, where you see a few more Members of Congress in the room who are debating this very serious issue. This is serious enough that we are here tonight because we want the American people to know that there are answers, and we don't have to go along with all of this folderol, the tax and spend and all of the nonsense that goes on. \n",
      "   Let me tell you one of the first bills that we voted on this week. We voted to make it illegal to transport monkeys across State lines. I'm not making this up. This is absolutely the truth. We all got on planes that emit a lot of carbon. We came from all corners of the United States so that we could have the right--you heard me--to vote to make it illegal to transport monkeys across State lines. That was the most pressing thing that this body had to do this week while you were busy getting out of bed in the morning, paying $4.07 a gallon, thinking, ``Now what am I going to do? Now what am I going to have to give up so I can pay $4.07 a gallon?'' But don't worry. In the United States Congress, we made it illegal to transport monkeys across State lines. \n",
      "   If you don't think that's bad enough, do you know what we did a couple of weeks ago? It is absolutely true, and it happened right here on this floor. We voted to send your money--I did not vote for it, but enough people in this body voted for it. We voted to send \n",
      "   $25 million of your money to foreign countries in foreign aid to pay for foreign cats and foreign dogs, not even American cats and dogs in foreign countries. We spent your money, $25 million, and sent it to foreign countries to pay for foreign cats and foreign dogs. \n",
      "   As if that were not bad enough, the next day, we sent more millions to foreign countries to pay for foreign birds. Well, at least we didn't do that for foreign monkeys. All we did is make it illegal to transport monkeys across State lines. This is what your United States Congress has been doing while you've been busy spending $4.07 a gallon. That's a travesty. \n",
      "   That's why we're here tonight to tell you don't give up hope yet. We're saying let's explore America. Let's explore  now so that you can pay less because, otherwise, we'll have to go with their answer. Remember what their answer is: Pay more. Drive less. I don't think that's what we want to do. \n",
      "   That's why I want you to hear from my distinguished colleague from Georgia's 11th District. His name is Dr. Phil Gingrey. I'd like you to give him some attention so that he can talk to you about what he knows to be true about energy. \n",

      "   Mr. Speaker, that's one philosophy that the American people could embrace, but I don't think that's the American way. I don't think that's the ``can do'' spirit. I don't think that's what the founders of this Nation bled and died for. \n",

      "   We haven't talked an awful lot about nuclear power tonight. That's something that we can look at as well. We've talked about exploring the Arctic energy slope, Representative Steve King spoke about that and what the landscape looks like and the fact that we can do this in a wonderfully clean, environmentally sensitive way. It's entirely possible. \n",
      "   We can explore our deep sea reserves which contain over 86 billion barrels of oil, perhaps even more. We can access those. \n",
      "   Also, our natural gas that's available to us in the Gulf of Mexico area, and also the shale energy reserves where we are the Saudi Arabia of oil in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. \n",
      "   Nuclear power, we know that France derives 80 percent of its energy from nuclear power. I'm grateful that there's a nuclear power plant in my district in Monticello, Minnesota. It's such a wonderfully reliable source of energy, clean, and has zero emissions. \n",
      "   And also tax incentives for alternative energy. Can you believe that we would let these incentives expire, Mr.  Speaker, these incentives for alternative energies, whether it's wind, solar or biofuels? We shouldn't let these expire, we should extend these. \n",
      "   Because what we are saying on the Republican side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, is let's get a big table, like a big table like we have here in the well this evening, and let's take every answer that America has, put it on the table, let's develop that resource. Let's have dominion over that resource. Let's open it up, cultivate it, use it in a wise way. \n",
      "   You know, Mr. Speaker, the United States is one of the only countries in the world that actually saw a reduction in its emissions over this last year. We didn't sign the Kyoto Treaty, yet nations all across the world that signed the Kyoto Treaty, they saw their emissions go up. Europe, the EU countries have signed a cap and trade system, or what we call the tax and spend system because that describes it more accurately. Europe has actually seen an increase in its emissions. Think of that. \n",
      "   I think it's good for us, I'm glad that Europe decided to go that route before the United States made the mistake of going down that road. It's important, Mr. Speaker, that we know what we're getting into before we take that plunge. \n",
      "   I just wanted to give a couple of statistics before I hand the next few moments over to my distinguished colleague from the great State of Michigan, Representative Tim Walberg, and it's this: It's the facts. All we have to do is look at the facts. This isn't junk science. These are facts, Mr. Speaker. And if you look at the facts of voting patterns over the last 15 years, I'm not talking about the last 15 days, the last 15 months, but if you look at the voting patterns of this Congress over the last 15 years, Mr. Speaker, this is what you'll find out. Over 90 percent of the time, House Republicans voted to increase production of American-made oil and gas. You heard me right. Over 91 percent of the time Republicans voted to explore in America, to explore now for American oil and gas. The Republicans have not been the obstacles. The Republicans haven't been perfect by a long shot. There's a lot of missed opportunities the Republicans have made. But over 91 percent of the time you've been able to count, Mr. Speaker, the American people have been able to count on the Republicans to vote to explore for American oil and American gas now. \n",
      "   Let's take a look at the other statistic. Almost 90 percent of the time, 86 percent of the time, to be exact, that's the percentage of time that the House Democrats, over the last 15 years, have voted against increasing the production of American-made oil and gas. Those numbers are almost flipped. And I have no joy in giving those numbers, because my preference, and my heart is to see Republicans and Democrats come together. Now we're in a crisis. We can't be partisan right now. We have to be about America right now because now is about solutions and answers so we can get to our goal, $2 a gallon gasoline. And it's real, and it's possible, and we can get there sooner if we start now. \n",
      "   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to hand over the next few moments to my distinguished colleague from the great State of Michigan, Representative Tim Walberg, who has tremendous passion, and who also has stood on this floor and managed an hour on energy so that he can also get his passion to the American people for the answers that he knows are available to make all of our lives better, Mr. Speaker, so we can get back to $2 a gallon gasoline. \n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise as the chief cosponsor of H.R. 4008 to support this important bill, and I want to associate myself strongly with the remarks from the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mahoney) and thank him for the important work that he brought to bear on this bill, also Ms. Bean for her work on the bill and also for Mrs. Biggert, as well, for working with me to help protect American business and consumers from frivolous lawsuits. \n",
      "   Millions of consumers across America will experience a little extra pain in the pocketbook unless Congress passes The Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act and businesses across America, both large and small, from Main Street to Wall Street will be hurt as well. \n",
      "   They are watching Congress this week to see if we care; and, second, to see if we are paying attention to them. They are watching us to see if we can work across the aisle, which I am happy to say we are working across the aisle, to pass a simple but critical update to The Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act, otherwise known as FACTA. In an effort to prevent theft and fraud, Congress required through FACTA that businesses print, as was stated earlier in our testimony, only the last five digits or less of a person's credit card or just the expiration date on transaction receipts. \n",
      "   Many companies made sure that they printed no more than five digits of the receipt, but they also printed the expiration date. Many simply just weren't clear on the new requirement. \n",
      "   Unfortunately, trial lawyers in America saw opportunity knocking, and they found a way to take advantage of this situation. Lawyers' eyes lit up with dollar signs, and they began filing suits against companies across the United States. Any company that kept printing the expiration date, along with a few of the cards' digits, instead of just one or the other, became a potential litigation target. \n",
      "   However, identity theft prevention experts say that five digits of a credit card, plus an expiration date printed out on a receipt, are not enough to steal someone's account. All of these people, however, are being sued on a technicality that poses no threat to people's credit or their debit accounts. \n",
      "   Take, for example, in my district, the Rockler Companies, Inc., one of the many family-owned businesses in my district. Rockler sells and distributes products to the woodworking community, and, unfortunately, they became a fallen victim to just such a frivolous lawsuit. Unfortunately, they have already had to pay out over $30,000 in legal expenses for this wonderful small business in Minnesota, not because they did anything wrong, but because Congress, because this body, accidently left open a legal loophole. That's $30,000, something that can mean life or death for one of America's small businesses. \n",
      "   This bill on the floor today is very important. It may not seem like much, but H.R. 4008, The Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act, closes that loophole. It liberates American businesses, usually small businesses, from frivolous lawsuits. \n",
      "   They still have to update their receipts. They still have to comply with FACTA, but they can't be dragged through years of lawsuits because they printed a credit card expiration date. \n",
      "   If they print enough information to give thieves a toe-hold, they still can be sued. If they print over five digits of the card number, they still can be sued. If they do anything that puts customers' accounts in real jeopardy, they can be sued. They cannot be sued for this remote congressional technicality. That's only right. \n",
      "   With H.R. 4008, consumers will be protected on both ends of the transaction. After all, who will pay the real price for this? Businesses across America will have to offset the cost of these lawsuits by raising their prices, if they can, and American consumers will be left holding the short end of the stick, or the business will suffer. \n",
      "   At a time when Americans are already squeezed by the rising cost of living, by outrageous prices of gasoline at the pump, this is the last thing we need right now in our American economy. I am so happy that we are working together hand-in-hand across the aisle to show the American people that Congress is actually listening to them today, listening to their concerns and acting wisely on their behalf. \n",
      "   The Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act is pretty simple, it's no nonsense, it's fair, it's necessary, and it's bipartisan. That is good for businesses, it's good for consumers, and I thank and urge all of my colleagues in the House and ask them to join both Congressman Mahoney and myself in supporting this wonderful bill. \n",

      "   Today, there are over 500,000 children, that's over a half million children, in foster care across the United States of America, many of whom come from troubled homes and many of whom have been moved from family to family several times. My husband and I have been privileged to have 23 foster children live in our home, and we know from experience that these wonderful organizations that work with our foster children played a critical role in ensuring that they were matched with loving families and they grew up to achieve successful lives. These organizations are to be commended, Mr. Speaker. \n",
      "   Dedicated to changing public policy and also to raising awareness related to the very special and individual needs of foster children, these groups sponsor research, they develop best practices, and they offer assistance to youth who are transitioning out of the system to ensure that they receive adequate support as they reach adulthood. They provide invaluable resources to foster families as well as to teachers, to counselors, physicians, clergy and other people who work closely with children who are being helped by the foster care system. \n",
      "   These men and women and agencies are striving to consider the best interests of every child, and they work to keep families together whenever possible. Today, more Americans are beginning to understand the very real and very special needs of foster care children due to their dedicated public awareness efforts, and I am proud to honor these organizations that have touched the lives of so many of America's children and improved their lives and put them steadily on a path to success. \n",
      "   To complement this resolution, it is my hope that the House will soon have the opportunity to consider H.R. 4311, the School Choice for Foster Kids Act, because this Act will allow foster children of all ages to stay at the school that they've grown comfortable with, even when they change foster homes, which all too frequently seems to happen in the lives of foster children. It will provide them with some stability in their own tumultuous lives. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Well, I think the gentleman already knows the answer before he is asking the question, because it has been now hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of days since the majority said to the American people that they had a commonsense plan, they had a commonsense plan for reducing the price of gasoline. And as of today, the average price of gasoline across America is now a whopping $3.51. \n",
      "   I went with our family this weekend, we went to visit my father-in-law. It was his 84th birthday on Sunday. So we had my daughter's car, because it had the best gas mileage of any car that we had in our family, so we took her car. On the way back, we were in Baldwin, Wisconsin. We pulled up to a gas station. We put gas in. I could not believe it. It was $45 that I put in her little gas tank. Just a few years ago, that is what we spent on our big conversion van, our high-top conversion van. We are not alone. We are here as Members of Congress, but we hear this every day from people back home. \n",
      "   Let me give you just one example. You remember Art Linkletter and the show that he had years ago called House Party? He had a little segment called ``Kids Say the Darndest Things.'' I loved that segment. \n",
      "   I thought about that, because just recently I went to speak to Minnesota Pheasants Forever. It is a wonderful outdoor heritage group. I love to do that. That is one marvelous thing about being a Member of Congress, you can go to speak to great groups about things. \n",
      "   So I went to go speak to them. So I laid my notes, Congressman Walberg, on the island in our kitchen, and it said ``Minnesota Pheasants Forever.'' Our little daughter Caroline came, and she picked up the notes and she said, ``Mom, what is Minnesota peasants forever?'' And I said, ``Well, Caroline, that would be the taxpayers of the State of Minnesota.'' \n",
      "   The reason I say that is because tomorrow will be Tax Freedom Day, and in Minnesota, we are a little bit worse off. Our Tax Freedom Day won't occur until next Sunday. \n",
      "   What that means for people across America that might be listening to our repartee as we go back and forth tonight, Tax Freedom Day is the first day the American people stop working for Uncle Sam and start working for themselves. When you average all your Federal, State and local taxes together, the American taxpayer spends the first 113 days of the year as a Federal employee. Basically, that is what it comes down to. We are all Federal employees because we are working for the man. We are not working for ourselves. \n",

They were willing to give up everything, just to throw off a stamp tax. My goodness, we do that just in the morning before we have even gotten to lunch yet around here. I can't believe the level of tax increases we have seen, can you? \n",
      "   Weren't you floored coming here as a new Member of Congress? I know if there is one thing that I have learned, Congressman Walberg, in the time I have been in Congress, what has been now maybe 15 or 16 months, it has been how easy it is to spend somebody else's money. How easy it is. I know it isn't for me. It is really hard for me to spend my own money, and it is really hard for me to spend other people's money. I am not there yet. I haven't drank that Kool-Aid. But I am floored when I see how easy it is for Members of this body to spend other people's money. What is your reaction to that? \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. If the gentleman will yield further, that has been my impression as well. It strikes me to think that the serfs in the Middle Ages paid over about 25 percent of what they earned in the year to a nobleman. We could only wish, many of us, that 25 percent was our total tax burden. We haven't seen that in this country for many, many years. It is almost unthinkable that the serfs in the Middle Ages would be better off from a tax point of view than the average American taxpayer today. We are far beyond 25 percent of our income. \n",
      "   As a matter of fact, don't you agree, Congressman, that it would be I think very enlightening for most Americans to learn that they spend more on their tax bill, they pay more on their tax bill, than they do for food, clothing and housing combined? \n",
      "   The average American works 108 days to pay for their food, their clothing and their housing. They work on average 113 days to pay their tax bill. Just think of that. Those are necessities that Americans can't do without. You have to have food, you have to have clothing, you have to have housing. But the one thing that will happen is that you will go to jail if you don't pay your tax bill. \n",
      "   I am a former Federal tax litigation attorney. I tried a lot of cases in Federal Tax Court. The reason why people showed up when it was time for their court date was because if they didn't show up, the judgment may be that they go to jail. Because in this country if you don't pay your tax bill, you have the potential of going to jail. So that is the first bill you have to pay, because if you don't pay it, you may end up in a place you don't want to be, so a lot of sacrifices have to be made by a lot of people. \n",
      "   I will tell you one thing, and I think you would agree as well, Congressman. You have probably seen a lot of waste, a lot of fraud and a lot of abuse in legislation that has gone through this body. We will be taking up legislation tomorrow that is trying to squeeze waste, fraud and abuse out of the Medicare system. \n",
      "   Don't you agree, Congressman, that is something that the American people have been looking for for a long time? I know you are a reformer. I know you came here because you did not want to be part of the status quo. You are an outsider, and you came here because you wanted to change the way that Washington does business. I feel the  same way. I know that Congressman Sali shares that opinion and Congressman Davis shares that opinion. We are not about continuing the levels of waste, fraud and abuse. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. That is right. And if the gentleman would yield, I would absolutely agree. And that is why it is important and imperative, I believe, that we shout it from the rooftops. This is not a hypothetical we are talking about, this is reality that we are talking about tonight, the fact that these tax cuts right now are on automatic pilot. They are going away. They are the engines that have propelled the growth in this economy, both with the cuts on capital gains and on dividends, that has provided the jobs, the growth, the unparalleled level of prosperity that we have enjoyed. It is all going away if we don't stop that. \n",
      "   That is why I thank you again, Congressman Walberg, for being willing to sponsor this important legislation. It is why I am on it, it is why Congressman Davis and so many of our colleagues are on it. As a matter of fact, there is a piece of legislation that I believe you signed on recently as well as I signed on; this is one that our colleague John Campbell came up with, and that is putting a spending ceiling on what Congress can spend. Because I think that Congressman Davis said it very well earlier: We have a spending problem. That is what leads to our taxing program. And John Campbell came forward, the Congressman from California, and he said, let's put a ceiling on government spending, and let's make sure it is not more than one-fifth of GDP. \n",
      "   What is GDP? Gross domestic product. Well, what is that? That is basically everything that we produce in this country every year. Just think of that. Government eats up one-fifth, almost one-fifth, 20 percent, of everything that is produced in this country just to run the machine. Sometimes I think that government is just a big money eating machine, and we are all the people that are working to stoke that furnace to keep it going. But this legislation that we signed says that there is a limit. We are going to draw a line in the sand, and no more. And that is what your great legislation does as well, the Tax Increase Prevention Act, it draws a line in the sand and it says we are going to keep this prosperity going, and the way we do it is by cutting those taxes. \n",

      "   But when Americans go to the pump tomorrow, I just want to remind them, Congressman Walberg, when they go to the pump and they put $1 worth of gasoline in their vehicle, over 60 cents of that dollar will go to taxes in one form or another. Just think about that. We hear a lot about oil companies and about profits, but when you have $1 of gasoline, over 60 cents of that dollar goes to taxes. That is something we really need to think about here in Congress. We need to consider it. It is just a microcosm, just a picture of the heavy tax burden every day that impacts the average American. I can't thank you enough for putting this together this evening. \n",

      "   Since declaring its independence on May 14, 1948, Israel has been the shining symbol of freedom and democracy in an area historically rampant with violence and oppression. In just 60 short years, Israel has become the economic leader of the Middle East by proving to its people the rewards of capitalism, while also leading the region in other facets of a free society, including human rights and freedom of the press. \n",

When tyranny raises its fist and liberty is threatened, the citizen-soldier answers the call to ease the suffering. For this, our Nation is forever grateful. \n",

In my home State of Minnesota, historic Fort Snelling is the proud home to the 88th Regional Readiness Command, comprised of Reserve units from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. America's greatness lies in her people, and the American soldier is the embodiment of hard work, patriotism and service, the finest of America's principles. \n",

It is they who lay down their lives to defend those who cannot defend themselves. It is they who lay down their lives to protect the rights of those who disrespect our flag and our Nation. And it is they who lay down their lives so that true freedom will never know extinction. As April 23 approaches, let us remember and be forever grateful for the Army Reserve's 100 years of noble service and sacrifice to our Nation.  \n",

Mr. Speaker, there are so many great Americans in this country, especially unsung heroes and Americans who rise up to be a part of the solution of the greatness of this country. In Minnesota, we have so many people like that, and it is such an honor, Mr. Speaker, to be able to talk about one unsung hero.

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership on this issue, which is perhaps the most important vote that Members will take during their entire congressional career. I know for me, this is my first term in Congress. This is the pivotal vote that I will be taking. And my heart has been breaking. I have been despairing over this vote that is coming before us not because I am afraid to take the vote but because I am despairing over what could be the outcome because I grieve over the fact that we may reject, for the first time in the history of our country, in a wholesale manner, free markets, free answers and free capitalism. \n",
      "   And what that means is freedom. And there is nothing more important in this country than freedom. It's why a mom would put her 5-year-old in an inner tube in Havana and brave the shark-infested waters for 90 miles to get to Florida so that she could see her son enjoy something she never knew. And that is a concept called ``freedom.'' \n",
      "   And what does that have to do with the bailout? It has everything to do with the bailout because what this bailout represents is the wholesale leap downward towards socialism, towards saying that we can never have failure again. Nobody can ever have a bad day. Congress has to jump in and make it right every time, because government has to take up risk and back up everybody's risk. \n",
      "   I wrote something earlier this week that I would like to share in the course of my remarks this evening. When Bear Stearns hit bottom in March of this year in 2008, the credit crisis claimed the first big Wall Street victim. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said, we had to bail out this bleeding financial giant at the cost to the taxpayers of $29 billion. Even for Washington that is a lot of money. Secretary Paulson said that would stabilize the markets. But it didn't. \n",
      "   Next, Treasury Paulson said that we had to bail out mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. All roads in this big fat mess go through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It is a monster of ugly proportions created by the government. That should be our first lesson. Government should never create a private business. But it created this private monstrosity and then decided it would back up with a wink and a nod any risky, hare-brained loan or mortgage-backed security that Fannie and Freddie came up with. \n",
      "   The starting price of that bailout was $200 billion and climbing. And that is on top of $300 billion that was passed by Congress only a month or so earlier in another massive housing bailout bill. We were told then that this would surely calm the markets. But it didn't. \n",
      "   Treasury Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke then siphoned $85 billion from taxpayer coffers to save another private company known as AIG from bankruptcy, and again with the stated purpose of stabilizing the markets. Did it do the trick this time? No. Things appear only to have gotten worse. \n",
      "   More than $600 billion into these market-calming bailouts, the market turmoil has only ramped up. And it's continuing. In fact, it has now grown to such an incredible crescendo that here we are tonight, and the Treasury Secretary and the Federal Reserve Chair has told Congress, in no uncertain terms by the way, that we must spend another $700 billion in taxpayer funds. We are told we must do this now, without delay, without deliberation, as Congressman Garrett has said, without answers to most of our questions. \n",
      "   This would bring the bailout tally to well over $1 trillion, now that is real money, even for Washington, approaching half the size of America's entire budget. \n",
      "   In other words, every American who has played it safe and has played it smart to avoid being in debt is now being asked to spend the rest of his or her life paying off the debts of Washington and the debts of some miscreants on Wall Street. We are well on our way to privatizing profit but socializing risk. And we are well on our way to eliminating moral hazard from economics altogether. This is antithetical not only to the free-market basis of the United States economy, but also to the rich heritage of liberty, that is called freedom, that we've long enjoyed. It runs counter to the American Dream, to what we hold dear, unless you're a fat cat that is rolling the dice with taxpayers' money. Then who cares? \n",
      "   American taxpayers are chumps here in this equation because American taxpayers are being asked to clean up a mess that the American taxpayer didn't create. Congress must not rush to judgment on this matter. We can't do that. It's a complicated issue. That is true. This isn't easy for any of us to sort out. All Members of Congress, I think, are going through a crash course in a Ph.D. in high finance all within less than 1 week's time. And the consequences could threaten generations with lack of prosperity. \n",
      "   We can't just stick a $1 trillion Band-aid on that problem. We don't have that kind of money in our back pocket, because after all, when Uncle Sam opens his cash box this week, there are no greenbacks in there. There are only feathers flying out that cash box. \n",
      "   We have to examine the root causes of this problem. And we have to seek to address the core issues. It's real simple. Government got involved where it shouldn't get involved. We spent more money than what we had. It's not too tough to figure out. Otherwise it's only a matter of time before we find ourselves right back where we were. \n",
      "   The recklessness of government is the primary culprit here. Once again, just like on energy, it is Congress that created this problem. For years Congress has been pushing banks to make risky subprime loans. You heard me right. It wasn't the lenders on their own. Congress passed laws that said we're going to fine you and we're going to file lawsuits against you lenders if you don't make risky loans. And using the authority of the Community Reinvestment Act, the big push for subprime mortgages began in earnest during the Clinton administration. Republicans aren't completely lily-white here with hands. The Clinton administration however ramped this up. And banks that didn't play ball were subjected to serious fines and lawsuits, and regulatory obstacles were placed in their way. \n",
      "   Expanding access to the American Dream is a worthy goal. We all agree with that. But by blindly pursuing that goal and allowing the end to justify means, we put millions of Americans today at financial risk. Although we question what that risk might be. \n",
      "   Because many of these home loans are backed by mammoth government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and the Freddie Mac, kind of like your weird uncle and weird aunt, Wall Street was more than happy to trade on these egregious loans. The assumption, which was proven right, was that Uncle Sam would guarantee them. Fannie and Freddie quickly grew too big. And all calls to regulate them, made even in fact by this administration, more closely to reform their structures were ignored, ignored I would say by the current Chair of the House Financial Services Committee of which I'm privileged to serve on. \n",
      "   In fact, leaders in Congress such as Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, resisted reforming Fannie and Freddie at every turn. When former Treasury Secretary John Snow pleaded before Chairman Frank before his committee for Fannie and Freddie reform, the chairman responded, ``Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not in a crisis. I think we see entities that are fundamentally sound financially.'' O, that Barney Frank were right. But Treasury Secretary Snow was right. \n",
      "   And millions of homes and a mountain of wealth were built on a foundation of sand. And when the housing bubble burst, it all began to collapse. And suddenly, the homeowners who took out loans that they couldn't afford had homes that were worth less than when they bought them. And stalwart financial giants were left holding on to billions in securities that they just couldn't cash, what are called ``illiquid assets'' that you read about in your morning paper. And without liquidity and without the free flow of credit, the market ground to a halt, and companies began to buckle. \n",
      "   Endless government bailouts will not prevent this crisis from repeating itself. We need to remember that. It will further cement the precedent that got us here in the first place. There are other options to bringing much-needed liquidity to the market, including infusing the market with new capital by suspending the business tax and the capital gains tax. \n",
      "   Also Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac need to be dismantled and quick. Now that the implicit taxpayer guarantee that they enjoyed for years has been made permanent, we have to make a clean break with them. \n",
      "   Accounting that artificially devalued securities and other assets could be temporarily suspended. And before Congress jumps to a full trillion dollar plus bailout, it should explore these and other market reforms. Congress should look for the best way to provide the greatest stabilization in the markets with the least taxpayer exposure. \n",
      "   And that is where House Republicans come in. We do not want the American taxpayer to bail out this $700 billion tab. It isn't about Wall Street. It's about this street, Washington, D.C. The Congress created this problem. For 2 years, the Democrat-controlled Congress, while this head of steam has been building, has failed to dismantle Freddie and Fannie. They have failed to dismantle the Community Reinvestment Act. \n",
      "   But the real issue here is the forgotten man. That is the issue. It's the forgotten man. It's the poor, beleaguered American taxpayer. Who is going to be left to bail him out? \n",

      "   The people of Israel have been victims of violence and hatred for far too long. Not only are these peace-loving individuals targets of rocket attacks and terrorist actions, they are also victims of government-censored, hateful press. It is far too common for Arab media markets to condemn Israel and promote actions which foster violence and hinder the peace process in the region. Israeli reporters and journalists have been harassed and intimidated by Middle East government officials who have placed harsh legal restrictions on what news can and cannot be reported. \n",
      "   I strongly believe that the universal right of all persons to peacefully express themselves in a nonviolent way should be upheld in the Middle East. It is the responsibility of the United States and the global community to condemn this lack of freedom and work to promote an environment which fosters the license of nonviolent speech and press and peace.  \n",

      "   Ms. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 6307, the Fostering Connections to Success Act. This vital piece of bipartisan legislation was designed to make much needed improvements to the child welfare system, focused on some of the most vulnerable among us--foster children. \n",
      "   There are more than 500,000 children in foster care nationwide today, many of whom come from troubled homes and have been moved from family to family several times. My husband and I have cared for 23 foster children, and I understand full well the struggles these children face on a daily basis. This bill goes a long way in alleviating some of the roadblocks standing in their way. \n",
      "   The main focus of this bill is to improve the accessibility foster youth have to essential services, their family, health care, and education. However, this legislation makes considerations for those not only actually in foster care, but for those who ``age out'' of the system--a group of young men and women who are often overlooked. \n",
      "   A key component of this bill is the extension of federal foster care payments up to the age of 21. We are considered adults at the age of 18 in this society, but reaching 18 does not automatically mean that an individual is financially independent. As these young men and women pursue a degree of higher learning, or whether they choose to start working, this bill will give them the financial help they desperately need. Too often their troubled past and unstable family background have not provided them the foundation of support to do it on their own. \n",
      "   Along with providing--for the first time--federal financial support for relatives who assume legal guardianship of foster children, this bill also expands coverage of federal funds for the training of child welfare workers to include private agency and non-profit workers who provide foster care and adoption services on behalf of the state. When combined, all of the components of this bill offer the overhaul our foster care system so sorely needs. \n",
      "   Today, I stand proud knowing that Congress is on the cusp of passing such a crucial piece of bipartisan legislation for America's youth. As a foster mother myself, I thank Congress for giving this matter the serious time and consideration it deserves.  \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to offer a motion which will ensure that parents of children in residential treatment facilities have control over any medication being prescribed to their child. While the bill as currently written would require a parent or a legal guardian to disclose to the facility any prescription drugs that their child is currently taking, the facility would not be required to receive parental consent for the child to be issued a prescription for any new medications. \n",
      "   As a mother and also as a foster mother, I strongly believe in the importance of the role of the parent or the legal guardian in a child's life. This is especially true, Mr. Speaker, when it comes to matters as serious as the health and well-being of a child. \n",
      "   Prescription drugs, such as medication to treat psychiatric conditions, can have a major impact on the mind and the body of an adult, let alone on the young mind and the young body of a child. Such a critical decision should only be made by a qualified medical doctor with the expressed consent of a parent or legal guardian. This is only common sense, Mr. Speaker. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today would allow residential treatment facilities to impose their will on children without affording those children the protection and guidance of their closest family. Whether the parent, whose intimate relationship and familiarity with their child is critical in choosing a treatment path, feels that it is in their child's best interest or not, any medication could be prescribed. For example, in its present form, this bill would allow a treatment facility to prescribe contraception to a child, who when properly informed and guided by a parent may have chosen to carry the baby to term, either raising it as their own or contacting an adoption agency, not terminating its life. \n",
      "   The purpose of this amendment is to protect children who are in a very vulnerable situation away from their families in a residential treatment facility where they are supposed to be receiving help for a very difficult problem. The parents and the guardians who have raised and cared for these children, who know and understand their children and their medical histories best, should know about any new or changed medications to exercise their role as primary medical decision makers for their children. The right of consent should be explicitly stated in this legislation meant to protect these vulnerable youth.     \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, one thing that I saw firsthand as a foster mother, there were too many children of color, minority children, who were overly prescribed for prescription drugs at a younger and younger age. This is a very disturbing issue and expressly underscores why parents or their guardians should have a say to actually give consent whether these children are given prescription drugs. \n",
      "   That being said, my motion, Mr. Speaker, does not infringe in any way on the role of the medical facility at a treatment facility. The expertise of the staff and the physicians would still be fully utilized in the diagnosis and, upon parental consent, the dispensing of prescription medication. \n",
      "   Moreover, my motion would not require parental notification for nonprescription drugs. A child in a residential treatment facility would not be hindered in obtaining any over-the-counter medication, such as aspirin. Only prescription drugs, which can have such far-reaching effects on a patient, would be applicable to the terms of this motion. \n",
      "   The prescription drugs often used in these facilities, especially the mental  health drugs, have very serious, and sometimes fatal side effects. This is no laughing matter, Mr. Speaker. These side effects for children, for children, Mr. Speaker, include suicide, homicide, psychosis, heart problems, tics, movement disorders, diabetes, even obesity. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, a parent is one of the most powerful influences in a child's life. I think this body agrees on that. In the case of a child in a residential treatment facility, with a very small voice and no ability to protect himself or herself, it is imperative that a parent or a legal guardian be given proper authority over the course of the treatment recommended by the treatment facility.  \n",

As a mother and a foster mother who has cared for children in similar situations, I strongly believe in the importance of the role of the parent or legal guardian in a child's life. This is especially true when it comes to matters as serious as the health and well-being of that child. Prescription drugs, such as medication to treat psychiatric conditions can have a major impact on the mind and body of an adult, let alone the young mind and body of a child. Our professionals deal with this on a regular basis in mental health facilities all across the nation. Especially tragic is the statistically high number of children of color who are placed on prescription psychotropic drugs, often with severe misgivings from parents or guardians. Such a critical decision should only be made by a qualified medical doctor and only after the expressed consent of a parent or legal guardian is given. \n",

Whether the parent, whose intimate relationship and familiarity with their child is critical in choosing a treatment path, feels it is in their child's best interest or not, any medication could be prescribed. \n",
      "   That is a historic leap in loss of parental rights over their children. Parents remain legally and financially liable for their children's mental and physical welfare yet this bill has government stripping parents of their right to consent to medical treatment via prescription drugs for their children. This bill says parents are good enough to pay the bill, but they can't be trusted to make decisions regarding their child's health. That is insulting, demeaning, and wrong. \n",

Our people witnessed an event so unlikely, the sudden and complete collapse of nearly 2,000 feet of eight lanes of highway, propelling nearly 50 cars in midair for a horrific 60-foot plunge into the currents of the Mississippi River. An event so unlikely that we in Minnesota collectively remain shocked and filled with sorrow, knowing the inevitable sad news that is yet to come once our heroic first responders have freed our fellow Americans who even now as we stand here remain trapped underwater. \n",
      "   Minnesota needs the help and the prayers of all Americans and we appreciate the overwhelming support in our time of need. I know I speak for my husband Marcus and myself. We offer our deepest sympathies, as does everyone in our delegation, to the family and the friends of those who were killed. \n",

We will have help until the job is done. Because Congress understands, Republicans, Democrats, we're all Americans in this and we understand that this is not just an emergency for a day or for a week. We will provide the support and the work that is necessary to rebuild the lives and the communities that were damaged until this tragedy is over. And that is what makes America so great. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank Representative Latta. I appreciate your leadership on the issue of energy, and although you are a brand new Member of Congress--you haven't been here for a long time--you've shown just extraordinary leadership on the issue that's probably facing more Americans today than any other, and that's the dramatic increase in the price of energy, and I know how passionate you've been on this issue. You've worked tirelessly in your district, and the people of your district in Ohio are fortunate to have you as their representative. Thank you so much for working so hard on this issue. \n",
      "   It's one, Mr. Speaker, that I believe probably every Member of this body is hearing from their constituents over and over and over again. I know that I have as well. I had conducted a meeting with several members of my community who own gas stations, independent owners of gas stations. And one thing that they told me that broke my heart, they told me that they are seeing 30 percent fewer sales at the pump, and they're also seeing 30 percent fewer sales inside their store, and they're hurting. \n",
      "   One gentleman told me that normally he would spend $10,000 to purchase the gasoline that would go into the ground in the holding tanks, $10,000, and that's money that's out of his pocket, sitting there in inventory until it can be sold. And he said, now, I pay $40,000 to have that inventory in the ground, and now sales are 30 percent less. And so he has more money in the ground, not producing for him, at a higher and higher price level, and he said this is eating up my entire profit margin. There are people going out of business. \n",
      "   And so what he told me is we've got to do something to get gasoline back down from its $4 a gallon, and that's what we're about here tonight to say there's very good news on the horizon. \n",
      "   It's doom and gloom when you wake up in the morning and you see and you hear on the radio and you see when you drive to the gas station what the price at the pump is. But the good news is, there is an answer, and America can go back to $2 a gallon gasoline or less. It's entirely possible. \n",
      "   Why? Because we have the answer right here in our country. We are standing on our own solution. We have energy that's available to us, 86 billion barrels, that's according to our own United States department, 86 billion barrels of energy right now that's available to us in the form of oil in the Outer Continental Shelf area. \n",
      "   We have over 10 billion barrels of oil that's fully recoverable up in the arctic energy slope. This is an area of land that Congress originally set aside specifically for the purpose of accessing that energy through drilling to bring back down to the United States. I had the privilege back in the mid-1970s of working two summers up on the Aleutian Chain in Alaska. That's when the Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, trans-Alaska oil pipeline was built. That oil pipeline is currently up. It's running, but it is only half full. \n",
      "   With very little effort, we could actually tap into that oil pipeline, the 10 billion barrels that we know are already in Alaska, and we could fill that pipeline. Rather than having it half empty, we could fill it and bring down another million barrels of oil a day. \n",
      "   And Mr. Speaker, 1 million barrels of oil a day translates into 27 million gallons of gasoline, and that would mean a 50 percent increase in American reserves than we're already tapping today. That's just those 10 billion barrels. That doesn't include the 85 billion barrels that are also available in the Outer Continental Shelf in the deep sea energy reserves that America only has. \n",
      "   But Mr. Speaker, I think most Americans aren't even aware that America is the only country in the world that has voluntarily made it illegal to access its own energy. That's right, Mr. Speaker, we are the only country in the world that's made it illegal to access our own energy. \n",
      "   Congress caused this problem. The problem is not OPEC and the problem is not speculators. The problem is the United States Congress. I believe part of the reason why we are seeing Congress's approval ratings at an astoundingly low 12 percent is because Congress has chosen to make it illegal to access the answer that we need, and that's our own energy resources. \n",
      "   Here's another great fact. In the gulf coast region, we have what is probably the world's largest reserve of natural gas. We have 420 trillion, 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that's available to us right now off the shore in the Gulf of Mexico. We can access this, and we can bring natural gas into our country, use it to fire up our electrical grid, and also, we could even change our cars and buses, run them on natural gas as well.     \n",
      "   America also is home to 25 percent of the Earth's supply of coal right here in the United States, almost an unlimited supply. We have clean coal technology today that's available to us that can process coal and transmit that almost unlimited supply of energy all across the United States. \n",
      "   And as well, nuclear energy. I have a nuclear energy facility in my home district in the Sixth Congressional District of Minnesota, Mr. Speaker. And I'm so grateful we have that because nuclear power supplies almost 20, 25 percent of Minnesota's energy needs. It's a clean, safe, reliable form of energy, and it has zero emissions. I am so excited about this wonderful technology, but unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, again, Congress has made it illegal for us to be able to tap into this wonderful source of energy. \n",
      "   Whether it's nuclear, whether it's coal, whether it's natural gas, whether it's the oil reserves that we have, America has the answer. In fact, this is the industry that we can tap into right now. We don't need to find a magic bullet or a magic alternative. This is energy that we have available to us today that we could tap into today so we can see the American people very soon get back to paying $2 a gallon. \n",
      "   One thing that happened not too long ago was this body, the United States Congress, sent out stimulus checks to Americans all across the country. Why, Mr. Speaker? Because people in the United States Congress were worried about the economy, so we went to the United States Treasury and we wrote checks that are still being sent out to Americans all across this country. Why? We wanted to encourage Americans to spend money to stimulate the economy. \n",
      "   Do you know what I believe the greatest stimulus would be to Americans? It would be to get gasoline back to $2 a gallon. And it's so possible. It  was just about 18 months ago that the Democrat majority took over in this body. And when they took over, gasoline, on average, at the national level was $2.33 a gallon. Mr. Speaker, that average today is about $4.07 a gallon. That's a dramatic increase in the price of gasoline, unheard of increase in the price of gasoline. It took us 25 years in the United States for gasoline to go from $1 a gallon to $2 a gallon. And just in the time that the Democrats have held the gavel they have taken this country from $2.33 to $4.08 a gallon. \n",
      "   I was listening to the previous discussion that occurred, and I heard some suggestions about why the price of gasoline has gone up so dramatically. And I find it interesting, because if you look at the votes from 1994 until today, this Congress has already voted on whether or not we should explore in ANWR. We voted on it. In fact, the Congress, back in 1995, sent a bill to President Bill Clinton to say that we should be drilling in ANWR. The House passed that bill, the Senate passed that bill. Unfortunately, it was President Bill Clinton that vetoed that bill; otherwise, we would have already been drilling in ANWR. We wouldn't be in the pickle that we're in today. \n",
      "   But this is the vote and these are the facts. I'm not trying to be partisan because we need to come together, as Democrats and Republicans, and solve this problem now because Americans are feeling real pain and the economy is reeling over energy prices. But here's the facts, Mr. Speaker. This is a fact. Any American can go and find out what the voting has been on ANWR exploration, of bringing energy down from Alaska. \n",
      "   Ninety-one percent of Republicans have voted to explore in ANWR and drill for oil in ANWR, 91 percent; 86 percent of Democrats have opposed drilling. And that hasn't changed today because we already know what the Democrat plan is for energy, they've made it abundantly clear. It is very simple. Their plan has been, let's have the United States Government--that created this problem--take over the oil industry and nationalize oil refineries. That's what they said last week at a press conference, let's nationalize oil refineries. Well, that's not a new idea, but it's not an American idea. And that's not an idea that the American public wants us to embrace. They don't want us to embrace socialism. But that's what we heard Democrats say last week. \n",
      "   Here's the other part of their plan: It is, drive less and pay more. Drive less and pay more. That's not what the American people want. But Senator Obama, the nominee of the Democrat party, just recently said it isn't the high price of gasoline that has him worried, it's how quickly that price went up. Well, I'll tell you one thing, Congressman Bob Latta, Congressman Paul Broun and also Congressman Rob Wittman, who was on the floor tonight, it's the high price of gasoline that's bothering us. \n",
      "   Republicans don't want to see gas at $4.08 a gallon, or $5 or $6--or whatever that price could be by the end of summer. We don't want it that price because we know for a fact we can get gasoline back down to $2 a gallon or less very simply if all we do is explore what we already know we have. We've got the resources, we've got the technology. We can do this thing, we're Americans. We're Americans, and we can do this, just like Congressman Wittman said, like we did with the Apollo 13. We can do this, and it's exciting. \n",
      "   We don't have to go with the Democrat agenda, which is, nationalize the oil industry, take over the oil refineries. We think the United States Government--who didn't do such a great job at Walter Reed Hospital--is going to be brilliant and bring down the price of gas by taking over oil refineries? I don't think so. I don't think that's who I want to trust, not with the American people saying that we have a 12 percent approval rating; I don't think they would trust us either. \n",
      "   And I don't think the American people want us to drive less and pay more. I think what the American people want is what the Republicans are offering. And that's why I'm so grateful to Congressman Latta tonight for sponsoring this important hour on energy. Because what Congressman Latta is trying to let the American people know is that we can get back down to $2 a gallon of gas or less if we open up the key to our own answer, which is, open up America's supplies and do it in a clean, safe, environmentally sensitive way, which we've already done. \n",
      "   How do I know that to be true? Because the United States was one of the only countries in the world last year that actually reduced its emissions. That's right, Mr. Speaker, the United States is one of the only countries in the world that reduced its emissions. All these other countries that signed onto the Kyoto Treaty, the EU, that signed onto this elaborate, bureaucratic-driven cap and trade system, their emissions all went up, ours went down. What's the difference? \n",
      "   We, in this country, believe in freedom. We believe in freedom and we believe in free markets to solve our problems. And they do, free markets solve the problems. It's not socializing our oil industry like the Democrats have suggested. It's not sitting home, putting a sweater on, turning our thermostat down, that's not going to solve the problem. It's not going to be paying more at the pump; that's not going to solve the problem. It is unleashing American ingenuity and finding these new sources of supply, which we already have, with technology that we already have, and bring the supplies in so we can make it happen. \n",
      "   I am so excited about what Congressman Latta is \n",
      "   doing. And I just want to end now with these other statistics, and they're very simple. House Republicans voted 97 percent of the time to have coal-to-liquid technology, to give us more oil at cheaper prices. Democrats opposed it 78 percent of the time. \n",
      "   Oil shale exploration. The United States is the Saudi Arabia of oil. We have more oil just in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming than all of Saudi Arabia, over 1.3 trillion barrels of oil. Republicans said yes, let's explore that oil 90 percent of the time. Democrats opposed exploring that oil 86 percent of the time. \n",
      "   Outer Continental Shelf, where we have 86 billion barrels of oil. House Republicans voted 81 percent of the time, let's explore, let's access that energy. Democrats, almost the flip, 83 percent opposed exploration. \n",
      "   On refinery increase. Because, you know, we had over 300 refineries not too long ago in this country, we're now down to somewhere near 150 refineries. The Republicans voted 97 percent to increase the number of refineries, Democrats opposed it 96 percent. \n",
      "   I don't take any glory in reading those numbers, but if you average them all together, over 90 percent of the time, Mr. Speaker, Republicans have voted to explore American energy, explore it now so that Americans can pay less. That's our answer. We're not new to this dance. This has been the answer that Republicans have been giving since 1994. That's the answer we want to have. Democrats, since 1994, almost 90 percent have said no, let's not access American resources; in fact, let's make it illegal to access these resources. Well, that's not what the American people say. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, over 70 percent of the American people have had it up to here. They're seeing their lives change; they're seeing jobs lost, jobs sent overseas. They want us to explore here, explore now, so they can pay less. \n",
      "   And, Mr. Speaker, we agree with the American people. And Congressman Latta is leading the charge tonight to let the American people know that we're with them, we're in their corner. We don't think they are the problem. We think the American people are way out in front on this solution. \n",
      "   So I yield back, Congressman Latta. I yield back because I can't wait to hear what more you have to say on this issue. And thank you for that opportunity. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you, Congressman Latta. I want to address a point that was brought up by Congressman Broun and really the absurdity of the remark regarding the oil leases that oil companies have taken up. These lands are owned by the American people and they are leased out to oil companies or natural gas companies. These oil and gas companies have to pay for these leases. They aren't just given to them free of charge. They have to pay for the right to search for the oil.  \n",
      "   They take all the risk, and they find the natural resource and they access that natural resource. It doesn't make any sense economically for a company to lease something and waste money on leases that they aren't going to use. It's already in law that if the companies that lease this land, if they are not productive, it's already a law they have to turn the leases back. They can't just lease them forever, get them for free, not pay for that right to lease the land. They have to already turn them back if they aren't productive, because the companies know if there's oil on the land, or if there's gas on the land, they already know if it's there. \n",
      "   Just because they have leased land doesn't mean that there's oil on it or that there's gas on it. It just doesn't make sense someone is going to waste money if they are in a private company. That takes away from profit, and you need to have profits to be able to go forward. \n",
      "   Again, this is the 75th anniversary of the New Deal, and it reminds me of Solomon, who said in Ecclesiastes, ``There is nothing new under the sun.'' And there is nothing new under the sun with a lot of these suggestions we have seen. As a matter of fact, the plan we have seen so far from the Democrats has been this, and it's pretty simple, it is: Drive less, pay more. That is pretty much the plan that we have seen. Oh, yeah, also, let's increase taxes on the domestic production of American energy. That doesn't take too much for the American people to figure out. \n",
      "   If Congress would decide we are going to start taxing food, do you think food would cost more? Of course it would. What about if Congress decided, Let's add taxes to health care, as if that wasn't expensive enough. Would that cost more? Of course it would. \n",
      "   This is not the way the American people want us to go. They don't want us to jack up taxes on American production of oil. They don't want to drive less, they don't want to pay more. They don't want to have America socializing and taking over oil refineries. What the American people want, pure and simple, is freedom. They want freedom, they want the free market, and they want to see energy prices get back down to $2 a gallon or less. \n",
      "   I know it's possible, I know it can happen, and that is why I am so thankful for your brilliant leadership tonight, Congressman Latta, and also for Congressman Paul Brown, and also for Congressman Wittman, who was here earlier this evening speaking, because here's an answer. Here's an answer. \n",
      "   It's here, it's ours, it's for the taking. We can be environmentally sensitive. We can explore here in America now, and we can have Americans pay less. I yield back. \n",

Eliminating or cutting funding for our men and women who wear the uniform of the United States is not a recipe for ensuring stability in the Middle East; in fact, it is a recipe for demoralization, and it is irresponsible in its proposal.

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for that designation of hour, and the purpose for being here this evening is to focus on the number one issue that many of us are hearing from our constituents back home, and that's the pain that they're feeling over the increase in energy prices. \n",
      "   There are a number of us here that are serving in the United States House of Representatives that are hearing the American people, Mr. Speaker, and we are crying out, as our constituents are crying out, to make sure that something can be done. \n",
      "   And the reason why we're bringing this discussion here before this body, the most magnificent body on the planet, the floor of the United States Congress, where freedom reigns, we're bringing this up here because the United States Congress is the entity that caused the current problem that we're under, and let me explain why. \n",
      "   The United States Congress has made it virtually illegal to access America's rich storehouse of energy resources. I know it's hard to believe, Mr. Speaker. It's almost impossible to believe. Why would any group of people, especially in a country where there's freedom, want to restrict access to energy resources? It doesn't make any sense. \n",
      "   So a number of us are here this evening because we want to talk about the possibilities that there are to have energy independence in the United States and to reach the very possible goal of getting back to having Americans pay $2 a gallon or less. \n",
      "   So, to start off this evening, I'd like to call on my colleague and I'd like to defer to him, Mr. Patrick McHenry from the great State of North Carolina. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentleman. I appreciate, Congressman McHenry, your passion, your work on the issue, particularly the work that you are doing offering that spectacular prize. \n",
      "   One thing that we do understand and know in the depth of our bones is that American innovation has never died, it has always been alive and well. And when you hold that tremendous carrot out there, we know the American people can deliver, Mr. Speaker. That has been proved generation after generation. Every generation has been presented with a crisis. \n",
      "   Today, in the United States, this Special Order hour and the speakers who will be speaking now during this time are addressing the number one challenge of our age. And the great thing is the fact that we have an answer. It's entirely possible to solve this crisis. And we know the formula: It's explore here in America. Do it now so that the American people can get back to paying $2 a gallon for gas or less. It's entirely possible, and it can be done. \n",
      "   That's why so many of us are excited. This coming weekend the Republican leader, JOHN BOEHNER, will be hosting a trip with about 10 freshmen, and we will be doing an American energy tour. On that tour, we will have a chance to go to Golden, Colorado to take a look at the national alternative energy laboratories, where we can find some of the ideas of the next generation, innovation that is yet to come on energy use and independence. And from there we will go up to Alaska, to ANWR, where there are proven reserves. \n",
      "   To speak out more on ANWR tonight, I've asked, and he has accepted, the Representative from western Iowa, Representative STEVE KING, who has been to the ANWR region of Alaska, who has been there, who knows the value of energy independence. \n",
      "   Before I yield to my brother, I want to just highlight today in the Financial Services Committee--of which I am a member and of which Congressman McHenry, who was here speaking before myself, is also a member--we had the occasion to have the Federal Reserve Chairman, Mr. Ben Bernanke, in front of the committee today. And for all of us this was an enlightening moment because the Federal Reserve Chair stated without blinking an eye today in committee, he said, ``A 1 percent increase in supply of energy''--American energy--``could lower prices by as much as 10 percent.'' \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, this is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who told  our Committee on Financial Services that if you increase the source of American supply by even 1 percent, you can lower the price at the pump by 10 percent. Well, Mr. Speaker, the Republicans in the United States House of Representatives want to increase American supply vastly more than by 1 percent. We can do that, and we can get back to $2 a gallon of gasoline. \n",
      "   So now I would like to take the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to yield to my colleague, the esteemed Representative STEVE KING from western Iowa, on the issue of ANWR. \n",

      "   We are excited about being able to go up there this coming weekend. And just think, here we are at the end of July. The end of July. And when we had our briefing this afternoon, what we were told is that essentially we should be taking with us a waterproof down parka. So this is not necessarily an area where we are going to find tourists lying on a beach. There probably couldn't be a better square footage area on the planet to drill than the ANWR area. And I know the freshmen that are going look forward to having another Special Order when we come back, Mr. Speaker, so we can report to the American people on our findings. \n",
      "   Before I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio, I just wanted to mention that one argument that we have been hearing a lot from the Democrats who are in charge of Congress--the Democrats control the agenda both in the House and in the Senate. And it's really mind bending to think that the Democrats have taken virtually no initiative whatsoever to add even one new drop of oil into the American pipeline nor one new watt of electricity. It's absolutely true. There has been complete inertia on the part of increasing America's energy supply. \n",
      "   What have we heard from the Democrats? We have heard for a catcall from them that 68 million acres that are leased out right now to companies that want to produce energy in America that apparently, according to Democrats, they're just sitting on that land. \n",
      "   Well, now, first of all, that doesn't make sense. My husband and I are business owners. One thing business owners don't do because there's not a lot of margin, there's not a lot of fluff or paddling left in your business budget, you don't just buy assets and leave them to not produce. It's a nonsensical argument from the Democrats. When they're saying that there are 68 million acres that are being leased, recognize, as the people, and your Federal Government, Mr. Speaker, deal with onshore and offshore leases, they told me this: They said, Representative Bach\u001c",
      "mann, every single acre is leased, and every single acre is in the current range of exploration. It takes so long to permit. And then the Federal Government allows 11 different points in the permitting process where lawsuits can be filed against the people who want to produce energy. So these energy producing wannabes are in a very difficult position of putting their capital on the table, their money on the table to try to drill for energy, and at the same time they have to wait for these artificial timelines to expire for a permitting process and they have to deal with these nonstop lawsuits. It's amazing anyone wants to go into the business. And yet, unfortunately, this is the only thing that our colleagues on the other side, the Democrats, have come up with as an excuse on drilling. It doesn't make any sense to me. I'm  sure, Mr. Speaker, it makes no sense to the people who are watching tonight. \n",

Reclaiming my time, I had the Minnesota turkey producers in my office just a few days ago, and they told me that their energy prices have tripled this year in three different ways: One is in the area of feed. Another is the climate control that they have to have in the turkey houses. In Minnesota it gets hot and it gets cold. And then the third is on the transporting of the birds both to and from being produced. So they said they're getting hit on every single level.

So if we haven't seen increases in groceries, and I know in Minnesota we have seen increases in groceries, we are going to continue to see them if we don't solve this problem. We can get back to $2 a gallon gasoline. It's entirely possible because we have the resources. \n",

Just like the Republican-controlled Congress passed measures before in previous years to drill in ANWR. Unfortunately, when those measures made it to the Senate, they weren't passed. The one year when both the House and the Senate passed a bill to begin drilling in ANWR, which was in 1995, unfortunately, President Bill Clinton chose to veto that legislation. We would have had all of that oil online and swooshing down the pipeline from Alaska down to the lower 48 so that we could have had that available.     \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, today Congress is about to embark upon another corporate bailout--this time for Detroit's Big Three automakers--without any assurances to the taxpayers that it won't be back for more. In fact, from all news reports, while this bailout comes with a starting price of $15 billion, Congressional leadership negotiating the deal fully expects that this is just the beginning and that taxpayers will be hit up again in the new year. \n",
      "   Though the already-passed $700-billion Wall Street bailout has had little to no success, Congress is about to go down this same road again. And, it appears that it does so with few qualms about the impact of its actions on hard-pressed taxpayers. \n",
      "   We hear promises of strict oversight and accountability measures--but who does the Congress think it's kidding? \n",
      "   Already two nonpartisan, independent panels have lambasted Treasury for its execution of the current bailout scheme. The Government Accountability Office's (GAO) scathing report about the Federal Government's poor oversight says it all in the title: Additional Actions Needed to Better Ensure Integrity, Accountability, and Transparency. \n",
      "   Why should taxpayers expect the government's oversight of this bailout be any different? \n",

      "   They don't want Ford, GM and Chrysler to reorganize under the protection of the bankruptcy courts, even if it would save them without a taxpayer bailout, because it means that they would actually make structural changes and renegotiate labor contracts without the threat of outside lawsuits. \n",

      "   It's so important that we're taking up this topic and devoting this time, because what all Americans share in common is that we, generally speaking, all are working for a living. And the one thing that we're finding is that more and more of our time is being spent working on behalf of political subdivisions. Whether it's the Federal Government, whether it's State government, whether it's local government, quite often our taxes are taking up perhaps as much time as from when we get up on January 1 and go to work, or if it's January 2, until perhaps in May or June, almost everything that we make during that time period is going to government. \n",
      "   I know that's hard to believe. But when you add up all the money that we're paying in taxes, about that much of our time is going to earn money that will, in turn, be handed over to government to spend our money. That's what's happening, and that's what we're yielding in terms of our sovereignty, is the amount of time that we are spending working to provide for our families; that much time is being spent going to government, because someone is going to spend the money that we earn. \n",
      "   The question is, will we have the power over being able to make those choices over spending, or will political subdivisions, whether it is the Federal, State or local, have the ability to make those choices? \n",
      "   I want to show you now a chart that we have up here. This talks about how much the budget that has just been passed, which the majority, the Democrat majority has the largest spending increases in American history for the budget and the largest tax increases in American history. \n",
      "   Take a look at the numbers. On every State, from Alabama to Wyoming, there's an increase in taxes for every American across the board, on average, from Alabama to Wyoming. And these aren't small increases. This is over and above what the average American is already paying. \n",
      "   But take a look at these increases. If you're in the State of Alabama, it's over a $2,500 increase in taxes beyond what you're paying now. If you're in the State of Wyoming, it's over a $3,100 tax increase. \n",
      "   I represent great people, great people from the State of Minnesota in the Sixth Congressional District. In Minnesota, the average taxpayer in Minnesota will pay over $3,000 more in taxes than what they're paying now. \n",
      "   Well, take a look at what your grocery bill has been doing. It's been going sky high lately. \n",
      "   And take a look at what we're paying at the gas pump. I was in St. Cloud, Minnesota last week. The price of diesel gasoline was $3.81. The price of regular gasoline was $3.14. When I took office and was sworn in for the first time as a brand new freshman Member of Congress, I thought gasoline was too high then, and it was about $2.25 a gallon. \n",
      "   Well, what has this Congress yielded, the 110th Congress? \n",

      "   And as the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), and as Representative Steve King has said, from Iowa, and also the gentleman from Georgia, Representative Kingston has said, this Congress has failed to do anything to reform Social Security and Medicare. Every American should take pause right now and realize how sobering that is, because the United States Government has made a promise to the senior citizens of this country, has made a promise. I'm worried that this Congress will have difficulty keeping that promise with our senior citizens if we don't reform these important programs. We can't do that if we are raising the average American's taxes. \n",
      "   And I will yield back to the gentlewoman from Tennessee after I make this important point, and it's this: In the Budget Committee markup of Fiscal Year 2009 there was a unanimous vote to increase the marginal tax rates. \n",
      "   What does this mean? \n",
      "   Whether you are a low-income American, a middle-income American, or a high-income American, guess what? Your taxes are going up. That will impact you in an already weak economy. \n",
      "   Unanimously, unfortunately, the Democrats voted to cut the $1,000 child tax credit in half. That really hurts. My husband and I have five kids. We raised 23 foster kids. Do you know how important a $1,000 child tax credit is to the average family? That's really important. Well, they voted unanimously, unfortunately, the Democrats, to cut the $1,000 child tax credit in half. That will impact average Americans.  \n",
      "   They also voted to eliminate the marriage penalty tax relief. Why would we do that? Why would we want to take away tax credits for people who are married? Married people are raising the next generation of Americans. We want to help them, not hurt them. \n",
      "   They also voted to eliminate the capital gains and dividends relief. This was the big driver. From 2000 until 2008, this has driven our economy forward. This has been a good thing. \n",
      "   And also, unfortunately, to bring back the death tax. \n",
      "   This is not the direction we want to go. The direction we want to go is one, a budget that the Republicans have put forward, and that's a growth budget, a budget to cut your taxes, cut wasteful spending, and put in place the mechanisms that will provide growth for this economy so that you can keep more of your income and start working for you, rather than working for the government. \n",
      "   And that's why I commend the gentlelady from Tennessee. As the dean of our budget school, she has been letting the American people know, in the plainest possible language, that we are here because we want to work for you. We hear you. We hear the difficulties that you're laboring under. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, as the author of an amendment that was not made in order under this rule, I rise in opposition to this rule. My amendment would have prohibited taxpayer funds authorized by this bill from being used to purchase mercury-laden compact fluorescent light bulbs, also known as the CFL. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to take the choice away from public schools as to how to meet their lighting needs. In fact, I believe that Congress already makes, too often, decisions for our citizens. But it is Congress' single-minded dangerous pursuit of this environmental fad that has gotten us all to this point of silliness today. \n",
      "   Congress must ensure that mercury-laden light bulbs are safe before we encourage their use in our child's classrooms. There are very serious health concerns about these light bulbs that are filled with mercury. They pose problems to humans precisely because of their high mercury content, and we must be sure of their safety before we force them on our public school children through this ill-conceived law. \n",
      "   When mercury light bulbs break, let's remember, extensive cleanup is needed. That's what these regulations show us. This is very highly selective and very detailed clean-up regulations. \n",
      "   What does this mean for school children that could be exposed to light bulbs of the broken mercury latent light bulbs? On the EPA's own Web site  are these eight pages of instructions about how to deal with a mercury spill, specifically including spills due to broken mercury light bulbs. \n",
      "   Let me run you through just some of the steps for cleaning up just one broken mercury light bulb. \n",
      "   Before the clean-up ever begins, people must leave the room for 15 minutes as the room airs out putting a halt to the learning that's taking place in the classroom. The school then is told to shut off their central air-conditioning system, or, in Minnesota's case, central heating system, and then they're told not to use a broom to sweep up the broken light bulb as they could come in contact with mercury at a later time. \n",
      "   This should give Congress pause to think about this next rule that says if clothing comes in contact with a broken light bulb and the mercury, it must be disposed of immediately. Imagine that. Children or teachers or the janitorial staff would have to remove their clothing immediately, and we're told that you are not allowed to wash your clothes. That's what the EPA rules say. You're not allowed to wash your clothes. That won't do the trick because mercury fragments in the clothing might contaminate the washing machine and also pollute sewage. \n",
      "   Let's get this straight. Congress is worried about harming sewage and yet we're rushing to place these mercury light bulbs in our classrooms next to our children. That step alone should be a warning to the dangers of mercury-laden light bulbs. \n",

      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. But the kicker of them all is the disposal process. Immediately a person must place all of the clean-up materials in an outdoor trash can or protected area for normal trash pickup. But make sure that you check with your local government. \n",
      "   In Minnesota, my home State, it does not allow for normal trash disposal for mercury. Instead, they require that broken and unbroken mercury bulbs be taken to a local recycling center. \n",
      "   There are so many rules that are contained on the EPA Web site that I don't have time to address them all, but while these clean-up guidelines are important and should be followed, the harm that just one broken light bulb can have on a child, senior citizen, or an animal is very real, which is why Congress should not embark on these fads. \n",
      "   I hope none of us will have to respond to the news story of a girl or a boy or a senior citizen or an animal who is poisoned by a broken mercury-ladened light bulb. That would be horrible. \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, the morning of September 11, 2001, I was a Minnesota State senator meeting  with a group of local educators at a Perkins Restaurant in Woodbury, Minnesota. Because you can't find a babysitter at 7 o'clock in the morning, I had my three daughters with me at the restaurant when I learned of the attacks. After that meeting, I dropped our girls off at school and then, together with millions of Americans, in horror I watched my television as the terror unfolded. Thousands of innocent Americans were targeted for death that morning by an evil regime of radical jihadists. Then came the challenge of explaining to our children the magnitude of the tragedy that had just befallen our Nation. As a mother, I can tell you it was one the most difficult conversations that I have ever had. \n",
      "   September 11 galvanized Americans. We knew without a doubt that we had an enemy, but America fought back, united. We were attacked on September 11, but the radical Islamic jihadists declared war on innocent Americans long before that morning and, chillingly, that war continues even today. Their brand of evil chooses to kill the greatest number of innocent civilians. They are a cruel enemy. They are unwavering in their resolve to seek the total annihilation of the United States of America and of our freedoms, and of our Western allies especially. They seek to destroy our friend, the State of Israel. \n",
      "   Today, Iraq is the central front in this war, and that is according to the radical Islamists themselves. Some in this Chamber may want to deny that fact. However, it is the jihadists who chose Iraq as the central front in the war on terror. It wasn't the United States. And we fight them on their turf. Al-Zawahiri has said many times that Iraq is one of the crucial fields in the Islamist war. The radical Islamists know that they cannot beat us with guns and with bullets alone. They can only beat us in one way, and that is if they crumple the resolve of America to fight and to win this war. \n",
      "   To American soldiers, I want to say to you specifically tonight, know that many of us here in the United States Congress support you and your mission. We pray for you. We love you. We appreciate you and your sacrifices on behalf of our freedoms. It is because of your bravery that we will defeat the radical jihadists. Surrender is not an option, not if our goal is the maintenance of freedom. \n",
      "   It is very telling, I think, that the resolution that we are debating this evening only states what those on the other side of the aisle oppose. After all these hours of debate, the American people have yet to hear a plan from the Democrats for victory in this war against terror. \n",
      "   I believe, and you, our troops, know that victory against the evil people who want to kill Americans transcends politics. Victory in this war means that no mother will have to explain to their children the death of thousands of innocent Americans. \n",
      "   American soldiers, please know that many of us in this Congress stand strong in our resolve to support you and our fight to preserve America's freedoms. On my watch, I pledge to you during this, my term in Congress, that I will stand for you, and I will vote to preserve America's freedom. \n",
      "   And I want to say to you this evening that it is American soldiers, Minnesotans, who are in the National Guard. It is members of the Minnesota National Guard who make up over 10 percent of this increase in troops. Minnesota is supplying over 10 percent of those troops. \n",
      "   I had the brigadier general of the Minnesota Guard in my office yesterday, and I asked him, What is the morale? What is the message that these troops want me to know? And he said, They want you to know that they stand ready to fight, and their morale is high. \n",
      "   I say thank you to the Minnesota National Guard. Thank you for your sacrifice. Thank you for your bravery. I will stand with you. Just as the Minnesotans who stood first in line in the battle to fight for our Union, it is Minnesota who is standing strong in this battle to fight. It is the battle of our time, the balance of our generation, and I stand with you. \n",

      "   I think I have seen a tenderness here this evening, a softness and an eloquence that he speaks, the foundational nature of the issue that we are grappling tonight. There is a sweet sorrow, if you will, regarding this subject because we are talking about something that is dealing with the foundational nature of this country and yet of all humanity, and that is life and what we will do with life. \n",
      "   And I jotted down just a few words before I came up to manage this hour. And I wrote down that every generation, Mr. Speaker, seems to grapple with an issue that transcends all others. That issue for 31 years has been whether government will protect from destruction life, innocent human life. \n",
      "   Our American landscape has changed so dramatically over these last 31 years. I was in high school when the Roe v. Wade decision came down. I hate to admit I was so ignorant when I was a junior in high school, I didn't even know what abortion meant. I didn't even know what it was. What innocence that time was in the early seventies here in the United States. \n",
      "   In that time, Mr. Speaker, we have lost 50 million fellow Americans, and now we've lost the children, some of whom those 50 million would have borne. There are 50 million women whose bodies were violated by the horrific violence that we call here in this chamber abortion. There are 50 million men who have lost out on the tremendous privilege and joy of fatherhood, and our Nation today is poorer because we're missing, Mr. Speaker, 50 million fellow Americans, so sadly. \n",
      "   An inordinate number of these 50 million Americans are children of color. We needed those children of color in our Nation. We needed those African American babies, those Latino babies, those Asian babies. We need them, Mr. Speaker, in our Nation. \n",
      "   And we mourn together the loss of these priceless treasures that would have woven a beautiful tapestry of humanity even here in our midst. Yes, we mourn with a great sadness, but we also rejoice, and we also take great joy in the fact that today, even now, we're making a down payment because today is a new day. \n",
      "   It's a new day for a future of change, and it's my hope and my prayer that it is today, Mr. Speaker, that the words that are spoken on this floor would captivate the attention of young women and young men across our Nation, young people who may have had the chance to turn this show this evening on television, who would choose to respect their bodies and would choose to respect their sexuality and choose to respect their fertility because fertility is a gift. It's not a given. It's a gift. \n",
      "   Ask those people who can't have children. Ask women with love who would love to bear a child but can't, young people who will choose to be givers in this Nation, givers to one another in love, givers to themselves, givers to our Nation and givers to the next generation of Americans. \n",
      "   Today, earlier, I had the great privilege of being in my home State of Minnesota. I went up to the steps of our State capitol. Thousands of Minnesotans had gathered. You think it's cold in Washington, DC? There is nothing like a March For Life rally in the State of Minnesota. It was sub-zero. I wasn't wearing boots. I had a wool overcoat on, and in a moment, my feet were tingling, freezing cold. There were thousands that were there that had braved sub-zero freezing temperatures, holding signs, from cities across the State of Minnesota because they wanted to be there to choose life, Mr. Speaker, and march for the greatest gift that any of us have ever had, the gift of life. \n",
      "   I want to take these few minutes right now to thank the Americans and the people across the globe who have chosen to adopt children. There is no such thing in this country as an unwanted child. There is no such thing. There is a line a mile long of men and women who would give anything tonight to adopt a child. Yes, even the less than a perfect child there's a mile long group of people who would say me, let me, just like Mother Theresa \n",
      "   of India who said give them to me and I will take these children. \n",
      "   Thank you to those who have chosen to give life, and whether you kept that child or blessed another family with a child, thank you for choosing life tonight. \n",
      "   I want to thank parents who have chosen to be foster parents, who have taken children in less than ideal situations, or parents that couldn't cope  with a child who was difficult. I thank the foster parents who have opened your hearts, opened your arms, opened your homes, who've inconvenienced yourselves, but yet, you have chosen a better way, to give life in a different sort of way to children in foster homes. \n",
      "   I also want to thank the women who have chosen life and the parents who have encouraged their young daughters or their sons to be supportive of women in a situation where they didn't know if they would choose life or if they would choose to take life. I thank the parents. \n",
      "   It's easy when your child is suffering with an unplanned pregnancy to say it's okay, I'll support you, I'll take you to that abortion clinic, I will pay for that abortion. But they don't always recognize that there is a price that that young woman will pay for the rest of her life in her emotion because her arms will be forever empty, and she'll know that there is a baby that could have been hers and yet was not, or a young man who knows he could have been a father to that baby. \n",
      "   Parents, think again. Taking the easy way isn't always the easy way, Mr. Speaker, and for boyfriends who just heard the news that their girlfriend is pregnant, oh, my gosh, of course I will pay for the abortion you say, let's do that. You don't need this; I don't need this. We've got a whole life in front of us. Who needs this? We can do this. I will borrow the money from my parents, the boyfriend might say, Mr. Speaker, or yet he might say I'll drop you if you don't have this abortion. I'll leave you. I'll walk out on you. \n",
      "   There's another way. There's another choice. There's a choice called life, and it may be inconvenient and it may be embarrassing and it may be expensive, and yes, it will change your life and there may be pain, but there will be joy when you hear that first cry, when you hold that hand that literally covers your finger. And when you look in those eyes and you stroke that silky hair, there is nothing like that baby that you will see, and it will change your life as a young man. It will change your life as a young woman. \n",
      "   That baby has the power to change America. Every baby has the power to change this country. They are America's greatest natural resource. \n",
      "   I thank my parents, David and Jean, who gave me life. I thank my husband who stood by me with our five babies and who stood by me when we lost a baby. I thank you for standing by me when we didn't know if we could go on anymore, and I thank you for stepping up to the plate, for being willing to bring 23 foster children into our home so we could offer an alternative for those children and hopefully give them a down payment on a future and on a hope. \n",
      "   These remarks that we gave here tonight are not about condemning anyone. Who could? Who could? I couldn't condemn anyone. Who could? But it's about lifting up people. We're here to lift up people. These remarks tonight weren't given to judge anyone. Who could? We're here to heal and offer a healing alternative. \n",
      "   That's why recently I introduced a bill, and it's a bipartisan bill. Democrats are on this bill. Republicans are on this bill. This is not partisan. This is about life, and this is about humanity and choosing the best that are among us, and in the Positive Alternatives Act, we just say something very simply. It says that today there are tax dollars that go to Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of abortion in the United States. Tax dollars go to Planned Parenthood. \n",
      "   There are not tax dollars that go to life care centers in this country, and we want to change that. We want to level the playing field.     \n",
      "   And we want to give a positive alternative all across this great country so that there is a chance for men and women to say, let me think about this. Maybe I don't want to choose death. Maybe I want to choose something else. Maybe there's someone out there who can help me through a difficult time, who could help me with my medical needs, who could help me to get a job, who could help me get some education, who could help me get clothes on my back, who could help me if I want to keep this baby, who could help me if I want to give this baby to a family who maybe doesn't have a baby. It's just common decency to allow for an alternative that leads to life and not lead to guilt and to death, and perhaps remorse that even a lifetime could never erase. \n",
      "   We are such a great country, Mr. Speaker. I know you feel that way, I know you do. And we're a blessed country. Let's choose life. Let's choose the better way. It's the American way.  \n",

They weren't a part of this very bad equation, but now they're being asked to come in, to have their taxes raised to bail out irresponsible lenders, and yes, even some irresponsible borrowers. \n",

Will they be assured that this affordable housing slush fund that will finance millions of dollars for political groups like ACORN, groups that are currently under investigation in States for voter fraud, that they won't be getting more tax money? No. Are they assured that Fannie and Freddie will never again become too big to fail? No. Fannie and Freddie will become even bigger. Are they assured of a clear path out of this explicit Federal backdrop? No. It's not going to happen. In fact, it's the opposite. The banks are going to rid their balance sheets of the worst performing loans--what we used to call ``dogs'' in the industry--and it will encourage them to serve up on a silver platter for hardworking Americans a huge tax increase for them to pay. \n",

      "   I rise today to recognize Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on its 100th anniversary. On this important centennial, I would like to commemorate the men and women who have served and continue to serve in the shipyard. In their honor, we have introduced H. Res. 1139. \n",
      "   The Congress established the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on May 13, 1908, and it has grown from a coaling and repair station to being known in Hawaiian as the ``No Ka Oi Shipyard''--``No Ka Oi'' meaning the best--and is a national treasure that is strategically important to our Nation and equally vital to Hawaii. \n",
      "   During World War II, shipyard workers earned the motto, ``We keep them fit to fight,'' by resurrecting the United States Pacific Fleet from the bottom of Pearl Harbor, helping to turn the tide of war at Midway, and maintaining the ships that would ultimately win victory at sea and sail triumphantly into Tokyo Bay. \n",
      "   Throughout the decades, the shipyard has demonstrated its diverse capabilities by supporting America's space exploration, Antarctic expeditions, and national missile defense. It continues to support the United States Pacific Fleet as the largest ship repair facility between the West Coast of the United States and the Far East, providing full-service maintenance for Pacific Fleet ships and submarines throughout the Asia Pacific theater. \n",
      "   The shipyard has become the largest single industrial employer in Hawaii and is the largest fully integrated military-civilian workforce involved in full service shipyard work in the United States. The shipyard has a direct annual economic impact of more than $600 million in Hawaii, and through its apprentice, engineer co-op, and other student hire programs, provides extraordinary training, employment, and career opportunities for residents. \n",
      "   Moreover, the shipyard has earned multiple national awards for its dedicated environmental stewardship and excellent safety programs, such as the prestigious Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Star Award in May of 2007. \n",
      "   I want to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and congratulate the men and women who provide exceptional service to our military and indeed keep the Pacific Fleet ``fit to fight.'' \n",

      "   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, I want to compliment Mr. Wittman and I want to thank him. It is perhaps by coincidence, but a happy coincidence, that the gentleman, of course, is from Virginia. And with Virginia and Hawaii, we represent the east coast and the far west coast, I guess--really west--in Hawaii. \n",
      "   And I want to thank him as well for his excellent statement. Part of the reason being that he has outlined very, very well, I think, one of the most important issues that we face and one that does not always receive the kind of attention that I think it warrants, namely, our shipyards as a resource, and meeting the strategic interests of the United States. \n",
      "   Our shipyards, both public and private, are crucial, vital and necessary not only to the defense of the United States, but to seeing to it that, should  we be called upon to exert military activity anywhere in the world, the backbone, the foundation of any naval presence in any such contingency is dependent on the professionalism, dedication and perseverance of shipyards in this Nation. \n",
      "   He also mentioned, of course, the Virginia Class submarines, the nuclear submarines. And having observed the maintenance facilities in Hawaii at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, I can assure you and Mr. Wittman that those Virginia Class submarines will be welcomed there, and that the repair and maintenance will be handled by people at the height of their professional capacity. \n",
      "   The military's counsel there, the Pearl Harbor supervisors--some of whom I believe are in the gallery today observing what we're carrying out today in terms of the resolution--understand that we're going through more than just simply a ritual undertaking. I think that perhaps sometimes these resolutions get put into that category in the sense that it appears sometimes that we're going through the motions. But I'm sure you know, Madam Speaker, that one of the advantages of ritual in our society and among our species is that ritual is the great conservator of value. It is a measurement of our sense of ourselves, where we've been, where we're going, and what we have as the basis for the future. \n",
      "   And so, yes, we're commemorating the 100th anniversary today of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, but in doing so, we remind ourselves of its historic legacy and we remind ourselves as well as to what the future may require of us here in the United States. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard stands ready to do its duty. Yes, Madam Speaker, I can tell you Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard will see that our naval forces are ``fit to fight.'' \n",
      "   Madam Speaker, at this time, I have no further requests for time. I am prepared to close after my colleague has yielded back his time. And I will continue to reserve my time pending that happy occasion. \n",

I know that in order to have tourists, you have to have people with jobs that have sufficient discretionary income to be able to come and spend their money.

You want to have a hybrid car, you're going to have natural gas. You have to have natural gas as the base. You want to have ethanol to be able to do it? You have to have natural gas for the fertilizer that's going to grow the feedstocks in order to create the ethanol. \n",

It's happening right now, and there has been references to it already. Europe and Russia are now making a deal to promote natural gas exploration and extrication from Russia to the European economy, to the European Union in the hundreds of billions of gallons in order to be able to compete with us. It's not just mythology that the Chinese, using inferior technology, will be some 45 miles off of Florida right now exploring natural gas, as the Canadians are already doing on the other side of the Great Lakes. \n",

I went into the Resources Committee fully prepared to not only sustain the moratorium that's here, but to vote against Mr. Peterson when he first brought up the idea of drilling for natural gas. But when I listened to him and I read all the facts involved, I decided that I had the wrong position. And what's required of us now is to become energy independent. We have to produce the energy in this country that is going to allow us to be independent, sufficient to be able to back up that Defense Department that we're talking about. The Air Force right now is spending an enormous amount of money on fuel that we have to import. If we can take the natural gas base for the Air Force right now, we stand a chance of producing fuel that can sustain ourselves. \n",
      "   We have to be energy independent in this country. And that means those of who us who have blindly supported, what were supposedly the right environmental proposals in the past have  to take an honest look at where we are today and what we can do to produce clean energy. \n",

The government paid for both the wrong computers and the replacements. The contractor collected a fee for each, thanks to a cost-plus contract. \n",
      "   Halliburton had drivers driving empty trucks between bases in Iraq, unnecessarily exposing the drivers to danger, because the company was paid by the trip, not by the amount of materiel hauled or a flat fee; $186 million was spent over 2 years to build 142 health care centers, yet only 15 have been completed and only eight are open. According to testimony, the contractor lacked qualified engineers, hired incompetent subcontractors, failed to supervise construction work, and failed to enforce quality control. \n",
      "   A large U.S. construction company was paid tens of millions of dollars to repair Iraq's schools. Many of the schools were never touched, and several that were repaired, and I say that in quotes, were left in shambles, one filled with unflushed sewage. \n",
      "   At least 10 companies with billions of dollars in contracts have already been forced to pay up to $300 million in penalties to resolve allegations of bid-rigging, fraud, gross overcharging, delivery of faulty military parts and environmental damage, $300 million in penalties. Some of these same companies have faced such allegations during past military operations in other countries, but have had no problem receiving new contracts in Iraq. \n",
      "   Despite millions of dollars in payments to U.S. companies, key pieces of Iraq's infrastructure, power plants, telephone exchanges, sewage and sanitation systems, have either not been repaired or have been fixed so poorly that they still don't function. \n",
      "   How has this been allowed to happen? The United States Government directly and through the late Coalition Provisional Authority have outsourced the war in Iraq like no other in our history, spending more than $50 billion on private contractors to provide food, water, gasoline and other supplies, guard bases, drive trucks, and many other activities in support of our troops. \n",
      "   But consistent with the administration's overall attitude toward spending public money with private companies, little or no thought was given to contract oversight or accountability. As a result, some of these contractors have declared the U.S. occupation of Iraq open season on the taxpayer. Cleaning up this mess has been hampered by the fact that while anti-fraud laws protect against the waste or theft of U.S. taxpayers in the United States, there have been no statutes prohibiting sleazy business practices by American companies overseas. \n",
      "   As we have learned in the investigation of the Blackwater USA contract, the Coalition Provisional Authority issued order number 17, which specifically exempted U.S. contractors from Iraqi law. \n",
      "   In fact, one contractor was found guilty of 37 counts of fraud, including false billing, and was ordered to pay more than $10 million in damages, but the decision was overturned because the contracts were let through the Coalition Provisional Authority, and it was found that U.S. laws against fraud did not apply. \n",
      "   Despite the fact that the Coalition Provisional Authority was created by the Bush administration under the Department of Defense; despite the fact  that L. Paul Bremer, the overseer in Iraq, subsequent to the initial attack on Iraq, had an office literally across the hall from Secretary Rumsfeld, the Coalition Provisional Authority was not considered part of the U.S. Government, and, therefore, U.S. laws were unenforceable. \n",
      "   These practices are a flagrant abuse of the public's trust and the public's money during a time of war and cannot be allowed to continue. H.R. 400, the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007, will, one, criminalize war profiteering defined as contract fraud or overcharging for goods and services in connection with the mission of the United States Government overseas; two, violations of law will be a felony and punishable up to 20 years in prison and fines up to $1 million or twice the illegal profits of the crime; three, jurisdiction for such cases, no matter where the alleged crimes are committed, will be in the United States Federal court. \n",
      "   H.R. 400 was heard and considered by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security and ordered reported to the full Judiciary Committee by a voice vote on August 1. Among the many significant consequences of the decision to invade and occupy Iraq marked by a complete dismissal of the need for intelligent planning and stunning incompetence in the conduct of the war, this problem has received too little attention from the news media, the public, and the Congress.     \n",
      "   Most of the cases of fraud, questionable business practices and outright corruption have been uncovered and investigated through the efforts of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, Mr. Stuart Bowen, Jr. Mr. Bowen and his super staff both here in the U.S. and on the ground in Iraq have provided oversight and insight under the most difficult conditions imaginable for billions of American taxpayer dollars intended to rebuild Iraq and support our troops in combat. They deserve our gratitude. They deserve the gratitude of the Congress and the Nation for a tough job well done. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, this bill, together with H.R. 2740, legislation passed by this House last week to expand the reach of the Uniform Code of Military Justice to private civilian security operatives in the region are two important steps this Congress is taking to clean up the mess in Iraq. \n",

      "   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I find it very unfortunate that my good friend from Virginia has taken a position that the bill in any way encourages the whims of prosecutors. As Mr. Scott has pointed out, the standard is very high and applies to any contract, whether it's in the United States or overseas. There is nothing applied to the contracts overseas that is not applied to a contract here in the United States when it comes to the question of fraud or overcharging or deliberate deception with regard to the contract. That standard has to be met in any court and has to come before any judge meeting such a standard. There is no differentiation whatsoever. \n",
      "   The reason the bill is here, and the reason we're bringing the legislation, is the courts have ruled that there is, at best, an ambiguous situation, if not an outright gap between the capacity for prosecution of such a crime, should the standard for the crime be sustained by a prosecutorial investigation, and what is possible in Iraq. It can't be prosecuted in Iraq, and the courts found that it wasn't. We did not have legislation sufficiently clear in the United States in order to prosecute it. Thus, far from arbitrary or capricious prosecution, we have the opportunity for arbitrary defrauding of the United States taxpayer with no consequences. That's why the legislation is here. \n",

Mr. Speaker, I am hoping that some of the misconceptions or misperceptions that might be out there can be alleviated, because I don't believe that this should be considered a controversial bill in any way. There are some issues with respect to questions about favoritism or reverse discrimination, et cetera. Some of these issues have been raised in other contexts. \n",

      "   Let me make very, very clear what we are talking about. It reauthorizes a Native Hawaiian housing block grant through 2012. Now, these funds are used for infrastructure development and homeownership assistance under a program that is administered by the State of Hawaii as the result of Federal legislation in the last century. The bill that is on the floor today did not originate with Representative Hirono or myself, but is as a result of the request of the Hawaiian Homes Commission and its chairman, under the leadership of Governor Lingle, Governor Linda Lingle, who is a Republican. \n",
      "   The reason I bring that up is not to cite that for special consideration, but rather that this is not a Democrat and Republican issue. This is an institutional issue that whoever is Governor, and whoever are the commissioners, in this instance happen to be Republican, appointed by a Republican Governor. Those folks are obligated institutionally to bring these issues to the Congress for final adjudication because of the unique status, the unique legal status of the Hawaiian Home Lands. \n",
      "   The Hawaiian Home Lands were created by the Congress as a result of legislation put forward by the original delegate from the Hawaiian Islands to the Congress, Prince Kuhio, Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana'ole, for whom the Federal building is named where I have my offices in Honolulu, the PJKK. Mr. Renzi may refer to the PJKK Federal Building. He was a Republican at the time, and as a result of his presentation, the original Hawaiian Home Lands were created. \n",
      "   It enables Hawaiian families on Hawaiian Home Lands under this unique legal status to be able to acquire private financing they otherwise can't get because they are under this legal admonition to go through the Hawaiian Homes Commission. So it allows the Hawaiian Home Lands, the Department, to be eligible for loan guarantees to borrow, issue bonded debt, enabling servicing up to five times their annual allocation. \n",
      "   This allows the Department to service low-income families without a large increase in Federal appropriations. That's the whole idea of it. It allows low-income Hawaiians to get their refinancing in addition to construction. It reduces the cost of homeownership, and it reduced risk by lowering monthly mortgage payments. That is what this is about. It's no special consideration. It is fulfilling the law as it exists. \n",

I am grateful also to Mr. Cole of Oklahoma for his participation and for his leadership in again helping us to discern issues that are of distinct advantage, not just to our particular constituents in Hawaii, but on the whole issue of how we are able to help people achieve homeownership, achieve an opportunity not to be dependent on government, but rather to be able to participate in the American Dream, the overall American Dream in a way that has genuine meaning for them and their families. \n",

      "   This act was established by the Congress, and every single dollar and every single item associated with that has been set forth by the Congress over time. The President of the United States, Republican or Democrat, including this President, has put these funds in the budget in order to meet the obligations of the contract. \n",
      "   Again, Mr. Chairman, I am not familiar with how the gentleman from the Eighth District of Georgia handles contracts, but we honor them where I come from. \n",
      "   There is 200,000 acres set aside, and the original legislation states as follows, section 1065-569, I commend to the gentleman's attention: ``Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians because of their race, but because of their unique status as the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom the United States has established a trust relationship.'' \n",
      "   The Admissions Act that brought us into the Union as the 50th State says specifically that, with regard to these lands, the Hawaiian Homes Lands, that they are to be administered by the State of Hawaii and the United States ``for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians as defined under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920.'' And it goes on from there to cite what is involved. \n",
      "   Now, the block grant program provides funds for infrastructure to help Native Hawaiians obtain mortgages on lands set aside for them from Congress. Because of the conditions set out by the Congress, ordinary financing is not available to them. This is why we have to do it. If the gentleman had had the courtesy to sit down for 2 minutes with us, we could have explained what this was about. \n",
      "   A decision has to be made here. Of course we have to come and defend our programs. Everybody does. I am quite content to do that.     \n",
      "   But this is the first time ever in my experience, my legislative experience of more than 33 years, that this kind of thing has taken place. \n",
      "   Now, I know you folks over there. I'm looking at friends of mine right here. You would never have, me or Ms. Hirono would never do this kind of thing to you. If you have a disagreement about it, come and see us. Let's sit down and talk about it. And if you still disagree with what we're doing and why we're doing it, by all means bring it to our attention on the floor. But these kinds of attacks are unworthy of this House. It's unworthy of us to have relationships with one another like this. I don't understand it. I've never experienced it before. \n",
      "   Now, we can do this in 5-minute segments if we want to, but that's not the way to handle this. I appeal to you, if this is going to be a continuing onslaught, let's sit down and talk it over. \n",
      "   This legislation, the Department of Hawaiian Homelands is one of the most effective housing efforts that we have in order to try and meet the conditions that were set forth by the Congress and administered faithfully by the State of Hawaii since our entrance to the Union in 1959. \n",
      "   The House supported reauthorization of this program; 272 Members, including 45 Republicans, voted for it. It is not a partisan issue. \n",
      "   And I'll finish with this, Mr. Chairman. The Republican Governor and the Republican Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate in Hawaii, as well as the Democrats, support this program. It is not a partisan issue. \n",
      "   And so I ask, out of courtesy for Members, that if we're going to have a discussion about this, at least let's have it on the merits of what the issue is before us. And if we're going to do this kind of thing, at least have the courtesy, the common courtesy that should be extended to any Member of House, to let us know that it's happening so perhaps, Mr. Chairman, we could resolve the issue beforehand. \n",

      "   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as this is a discussion on the rule and not necessarily on the bill itself, I would like to confine my remarks, at least in this initial phase of dealing with the issue, on some of the points raised by my good friend and colleague Mr. Hastings. I am appreciative of the points that he raised, because I think they are in need of not so much refutation but perhaps clarification. \n",
      "   It is easy to understand why those who are not necessarily familiar, and I am not speaking about Mr. Hastings personally, I am talking about the references that he cited in his commentary, it is easy to understand why people who are not familiar with a little bit of the history of Hawaii could come to some of the conclusions or make some of the observations that they have. Absent the context within which this bill is coming forward, it is understandable. That context then is what I want to establish, so that it becomes clear. \n",
      "   I certainly don't want to get in an argument with the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal either, and they are making some quotations there about complete territorial independence. \n",
      "   Well, I think what is being referred to there, and what the likelihood of the reference is, is that there was in fact not territorial in the sense of annexation of territory, like the Philippines or Hawaii or Puerto Rico or that kind of thing that occurred during the kind of ``imperial phase'' of the United States, but there was in fact territorial independence, because Hawaii was a kingdom. It is one of the things that kind of gets lost in the shuffle, and that is one of the reasons we are here today, Mr. Speaker. \n",
      "   The United States of America has in fact had, over a 175-year period leading up to the overthrow of the kingdom in 1893, a series of treaties and conventions; 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, 1887, dealing with commerce, dealing with trade, dealing with various recognitions. The Kingdom of Hawaii had treaties and conventions with other nations, as well as the United States. \n",
      "   So as a result of that history, we have a succession of land claims and assets that have come from the time of the kingdom to the shotgun republic that occurred after the overthrow of the kingdom and the annexation of the United States into the territory, and into finally becoming a State, as was indicated, in 1959. We are in fact the last State to enter the Union, along with Alaska in 1959. \n",
      "   I bring this up simply to point out that far from subdividing the American people, as was cited by my good friend, quite the contrary; it incorporates the politics as well as the historical reality of this land secession and the assets associated with it, because this land generates income. \n",
      "   Basically what this is about, Mr. Speaker, is land and other assets, including money, and who controls it. When this land came in, it wasn't worth anything. The Wall Street Journal did not comment, I am certain, on the ceded lands. They are called ``ceded lands'' because they were ceded from the kingdom to the succeeding governmental entities. They could care less,  the Wall Street Journal, about these lands when they were worth nothing, when they were not seen to be able to be marketed. \n",
      "   But let me explain now, and I ask my good friend as I look at him now with a smile on my face, we are talking about land in Hawaii? You are talking big bucks. You are talking money here. That is what this is about is land and money and who controls it. And this land has, from the time of the kingdom, resided with the Native Hawaiians. That is who is to be the beneficiary. \n",
      "   That takes me to the point, Mr. Speaker, of the entry into the Union. The Admissions Act requires us, requires us, the Admissions Act of 1959 requires us to utilize those lands and assets for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. That is in the Admissions Act.     \n",
      "   We are not here on the floor today because we didn't have anything better to do in Hawaii than to try to bring this to the Federal Government. On the contrary, the Admissions Act requires us to make certain that these lands are utilized for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. The reason we have the bill here is that in order to accomplish that, we need to get a governing entity that can come to the Department of the Interior for approval in order to be able to conduct the affairs, similarly to, parallel to what now happens with Native Americans in the so-called lower 48 in the mainland of the United States and with various Alaska Natives and corporations and other entities that have been set up in Alaska. \n",
      "   This is a history of indigenous people. They are different from other indigenous people because they were a kingdom, and we would not have the 2 million acres we are talking about had those acres not been associated with an indigenous people. They are not imaginary, they are real. \n",
      "   Finally, let me say with Rice v. Cayetano, Governor Cayetano, the first Filipino American to be elected Governor, that issue was settled on a question of voting procedures and had nothing whatsoever to do with programs for Native Hawaiians. \n",

      "   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I'm very grateful and thank you. I want to thank Mr. Bishop for his kind remarks. It exemplifies, I think, the kind of relationship we have on the Resources Committee. And I want to repeat that for those who are in their offices, maybe are not here on the floor but in their offices and may be tuning in. I want to emphasize that the tenor of his remarks and the courtesy with which he put it forward, including his sense of humor, which is well recognized in the committee and appreciated, reflects that this legislation is not only bipartisan, it's nonpartisan. That is to say, it's not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue and has never been presented on this floor, through all the different sections of the Congress, from its introduction over the past 7 years and as it has moved through the Congress over past sessions, it has never ever been presented as a partisan issue, Republican or Democrat. And I say ``nonpartisan'' because the committee reflects the full spectrum of the left of the Democratic Party and the right of the Republican Party. Whether you are characterized as a progressive or a conservative, this issue transcends that precisely for what Mr. Bishop so rightly pointed out. \n",
      "   This bill directly affects and only affects the ceded lands and the Hawaiian homelands and the assets associated with Native Hawaiians in Hawaii. Everybody who's on the Resources Committee and everybody who has dealt with issues that have come before the body as a whole coming out of the Resources Committee understands that there are particular and peculiar instances associated with each Member's district, whether it's salmon runs in the Northwest or whether it's water issues based on treaty obligations in the Southwest, whether it's indigenous people in Alaska or indigenous people in Hawaii. Each area has particular contexts and situations that need to be addressed legislatively. And so what the committee tries to do in a nonpartisan way is address those issues in a very specific manner so that they can be resolved without impinging on any other aspect of constitutional consideration. \n",
      "   Let me point out practically how that happens. For those of you who have visited Hawaii, when you land at the airport, you're landing on what's called ceded land. That ceded land produces revenue. Now, obviously the airport didn't exist back when the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown in 1893, and it didn't exist when the United States annexed the Kingdom of Hawaii as a territory of the United States, and that airport as it is configured today did not exist with the advent of statehood. And so what we have now is very, very valuable land producing revenue. And that's what this is all about, 1.8 million acres of ceded land coming in a continuum from the time of the overthrow of the kingdom down to the State of Hawaii today where the ownership of the land, and the benefit's very clearly recognized, including in the Admissions Act of Hawaii to the State of the Union: Public Law 8-3, March 18, 1959, which specifically requires us to address questions of benefiting Native Hawaiians through the lands that have been ceded to them or which were created for them by the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920. That's what we're dealing with here today. \n",
      "   So we are asking that deference be given to the committee's work, which has been nonpartisan, which has no ideological difficulties associated with it, that deference be given and understanding to what the Admissions Act requires of us. \n",
      "   And I find it ironic that support comes from Mr. Young, Mr. DON YOUNG, as it came from other Republican chairmen. In fact, this was first introduced under Republican chairmen, passed under Republican chairmen. Mr. Hansen of Utah and Mr. Pombo of California and Mr. Young of Alaska, as well as Mr. Miller and Mr. Rahall, all have supported this act, as have the committees. Mr. Young is now in Alaska speaking to the Federation of Natives, of Alaskan Natives, because we recognize that there are indigenous people who were not a party to the Constitution when it was formed and first passed but have activities, and in the contemporary context, their lives' affected by how we deal with them. The Constitution requires us as a Member of Congress to be able to do that. \n",
      "   So what is at stake here very, very simply for the Members is that this is enabling legislation. That's all it is. This creates the opportunity for Native Hawaiians to take responsibility for their own actions with regard to the control and administration of their own assets. That is not in dispute. The land boundaries are there. The amount of money that's coming in is not in dispute. What's in dispute is who's going to control those assets. That's what this is about. This gives the opportunity to Native Hawaiians to organize themselves to come back to the Secretary of the Interior, whoever that may be, and to ask the Secretary of the Interior to recognize that governing entity over these assets. If the Secretary of the Interior disagrees with it, they have to go back to the drawing board. This is enabling legislation, and it's enabling legislation that has been put together responsibly by responsible members of the Resources Committee in consultation with one another and with various administrations, and we would ask for your favorable consideration on the floor today. \n",

      "   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. I want to thank my friend, Mr. Westmoreland, for his kind compliments that came my way. I knew something would follow on that, and of course it was his reservations about the bill. \n",
      "   But he cited a poll which seemed to indicate, I believe he said, that people were obviously against race-based legislation and so on. I don't blame them; I would think they would be. I'm surprised it wasn't 100 percent. But let me read what the question was. He didn't read us the question. Here's the question: ``If 505 would allow Native Hawaiians to create their own government not subject to all the same laws, regulations and taxes that apply to other citizens of Hawaii, do you want Congress to approve this bill?'' Well, I'm dumbfounded they couldn't get 100 percent against that question. And, of course, 505 doesn't do any of that; quite the opposite. As Mr. Rahall indicated, we specifically address those issues, and taxes, of course, are going to be paid. \n",
      "   Let me give you the Ward Research Poll, done this year, that is a real poll, and I will tell you the question: ``Have you heard of the bill, the Akaka bill?'' Yes, 84 percent. ``Do you think Hawaiians should be recognized by the U.S. as an indigenous group similar to recognition given American Indians and Native Alaskans?'' Yes, 70 percent. ``Do you believe Hawaiians have a right to make these decisions?'' Yes, 87 percent. ``Do you believe programs that have been passed by the Congress for Native Hawaiians should continue?'' Yes, 83 percent. This goes on and on at that kind of level in Hawaii. \n",
      "   So, I appreciate my good friend bringing up the question of polling, but I think it's useful for us to know that when the people of Hawaii are polled on an objective basis, there is overwhelming support, Republican and Democrat and independent, for resolving this issue in the manner in which 505 addresses. \n",

      "   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Rather than having a motion to recommit, because I would ask you not to do that for the reasons already enumerated, this deserves our specific attention. And we both know, I think, what happens on a motion to recommit: people come to the floor; they see superficially what's involved. Who can argue about everybody wanting to have civil rights? \n",
      "   And I don't want to have to get into a debate with you about the question of recommittal. Here is what section 7 says of the bill, if you would allow me: ``Prior to conferring Federal recognition on a reorganized governing entity, the Secretary of the Interior must certify that the organic governing documents provide for the protection of the civil rights of the citizens of the entity, as well as all other persons affected by the exercise of the entity's governmental powers and authorities. In addition, the organic governing documents must be consistent with applicable Federal law. If the Secretary finds that the organic governing documents, or any part of these documents, do not meet these requirements, the organic governing documents will not be certified.''     \n",
      "   This has to be certified by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting every Federal responsibility. Now, up until this time, and I am sure you agree, if the Speaker will just grant me a little more time and if you will, this bill has never been subject to partisan rhetoric or activity in the committee or elsewhere. From a realistic point of view, motions to recommit really have to do with who is in charge and who is not in charge and that kind of thing. I am not disputing that your question isn't real. But the motion to recommit essentially is repeating, in some fashion, without my quite knowing what the real consequences of that language would be, whereas the language that I am citing to you from section 7 has been vetted again and again and again by minority staff, majority staff, legal staff all over to fit exactly what the gentleman seeks to succeed with. \n",
      "   So I am asking you not to make a motion to recommit on the basis that what I have read to you, in good faith, is language that has been put forward in good faith within the existing bill. And if you conclude that it is not adequate, I pledge to you that I will certainly sit down with you as will Mr. Kildee and anyone else who is interested in it to try and see what we can do to make the language work as the bill moves along. But I don't want to get trapped in a recommital action which may then put language into the bill, the consequences of which I have no idea. Nor, I think, does the gentleman. \n",
      "   Your intentions are good. I have complete faith and say so publicly in your intentions and your desire to make this a better bill. So I ask you on the basis of a collegial respect for each other and on the basis of our friendship to let the bill go without a recommital based on section 7 and my promise to you that we will address any and all issues that may still be on the table once you have had a chance to examine the consequences of the language you might otherwise propose. \n",

      "   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. My difficulty is, and I'll conclude with this. Mr. Bishop, I am very appreciative of your indulgence in this and the other Members. Obviously it is very, very important to all of us and important on a fundamental constitutional basis as well. The difficulty for me in doing that is that I am seeing it right now for the first time. The language in the bill has been gone over and over and over again with a legal fine tooth comb so that I have confidence in that. \n",
      "   My problem is that your intention and my intention may not be what the consequences legally would be when somebody reads it as written on the paper. My friend and mentor on the Armed Services Committee, the chairman, IKE SKELTON, who usually characterizes himself as a country lawyer, which should put everybody on edge and make them wary when he says it, has a saying that he admonishes us with on the Armed Services Committee all the time: Read it. What he means by that is the words on the paper are what will be referred to when legal recourse is taken. And what my fear is, is that not knowing the consequences of the language, despite the gentleman's intention, if I accepted such a thing, I am doing it on blind faith. Not on blind faith in you. I have faith in your good intentions. But I am doing it on blind faith as to what the safe harbor would be or not be or what the consequences would be.

I take second to none my regard for Mr. Flake and recitation once again of our personal regard for one another; however, I am afraid that the reason I have to oppose this motion to recommit is for precisely the reasons I mentioned during our previous dialog. \n",
      "   I am pleased that he actually read what the motion to recommit says because the part here, and you may recall in my previous commentary where I said we can't be sure what the consequences might be unless we have had a chance to vet them. The bill itself has been vetted again and again by counsel on both sides of the aisle and by groups that have an interest in the bill. This is the consensus that this meets all relevant legal technicalities. \n",
      "   Here, look what it says: ``The Native Hawaiian governing entity shall be subject to the United States Constitution's Bill of Rights and other protections in the same manner and to the same extent as a State or local government of the United States.'' That is an invitation to an avalanche of litigation. How are you going to define ``same manner'' and ``same extent'' of a State or local government? \n",
      "   The indigenous people, whether they are Native Americans in tribes, whether they are Alaska Natives in corporations, Native Hawaiians trying to put together a government, and they are not a State, they are not a local government, and to say in a motion to recommit that we are going to require them to exactly replicate State and local governments, which is subject to litigation all the time, you would have to have a trust fund set up to handle the litigation, I think, that would result from that. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, I don't think that that is Mr. Flake's intent. In fact, I would stipulate that that is not his intent. Our problem is we haven't had a chance to sit down and go over this to see whether we can cover any of these contingencies. I wish he had accepted my plea, my offer, and I wish he would stand up now and say, I have seen the light and I am going to withdraw my motion to recommit. Because if you go to number (i), applicability of Federal civil rights laws, it says the same thing with respect to civil rights and antidiscrimination laws in the same manner and to the same extent as a State or local government of the United States. \n",
      "   My friends, my colleagues, I agree that Mr. Flake has brought this not for political reasons but because of his sincere belief that this needs to be addressed. I can assure you that if anything is political, this is political by default. Far from saying simply that it is a simple explication of his point of view, it is an absolute wellspring of complication to try and figure out what the same extent of State and local government laws are with regard to civil rights, antidiscrimination or Bill of Rights and other protections. ``Other protections,'' what does that mean? That will be litigated to death. \n",
      "   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask Mr. Flake, now that I have analyzed his simple language for him, if he would reconsider withdrawing the motion to recommit. If he does not, I pledge to him now that if we are able to defeat the motion to recommit, which I think should be defeated by anybody who's worked on this bill. I make this final plea in all seriousness, Mr. Speaker. We have worked too hard, come too far on a nonpartisan basis, Republican and Democrat alike, to come to this conclusion and throw ourselves into the briar patch of State and government applicability of laws as recommended in the recommittal. The bill itself deals with all these issues on civil rights. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, I ask that the motion to recommit be defeated and that we move to a vote, an overwhelming vote on the underlying bill, H.R. 505, which is an exemplary product, a singular stalwart example of what bipartisan work can do in this House of Representatives. \n",

I am going to risk hurting people's feelings if I don't name everybody. But I have got to say Dan Burton or he will yell at me. So many folks. Jeff Miller, so many. Nick Lampson, he is down there tonight. \n",
      "   The reason I bring all those names up is that we are productive with H.R. 6709 I think because we got away from lobbyists coming in or corporations coming, advocacy groups, and we got away from the leadership clash, if you will, over who is going to get the House or who might not. \n",
      "   In all honesty, I want to move this bill tonight. I agree, by the way, with Don Young, I agree with what John just said, what Thelma said, all the folks over here on sharing the revenues. I think we didn't have enough information coming from the CBO on that. It looks now like we can put royalties in and it won't create a pay-as-you-go problem. \n",
      "   There are a lot of things that can be done, if we can move the bill along. That is what I am asking, just move this bill along. It is like Jim Costa said earlier, a work in progress. Come on, there are very few rookies here, very few rookies legislatively, even if you are just new in the body. We have got four or five different shots at this in order to perfect a bill. \n",
      "   I wouldn't vote for this bill if it came back now and this was conference bill. I wouldn't vote for it. But this gives us an opportunity to move this along. That is all I am looking for. And, believe me, the Republicans can claim they forced the Democrats to take it up and they made their point, and the Democrats will claim that they went for the bigger national interest and acted in a nonpartisan way.     \n",
      "   Everybody can make their political claims. But let's keep this moving. We have been talking to Saxby Chambliss, come on, a lot of us served with him here in the House; and Lindsey Graham, he is our friend; Ben Nelson, Mary Landrieu. I told Mary, left a message, said, look, don't say it's dead on arrival. We are for the revenue sharing. We can work this out. \n",
      "   The American people will blame all of us. The American people will not say the Democrats have showed up the Republicans, or the Republicans sure showed the Democrats. They are going to blame the Congress, because they want energy independence. We have to have it. \n",
      "   My plea to you is that we take this bill and move it along and get it into the Senate. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain in terms of energy independence, number one; and, number two, preventing the exporting of needed American dollars from investment in this country to import energy. That's the reason that we need to do this. \n",
      "   We have got to get away from, I see there is something from the National Wildlife Federation, comes in today, a lot of praise for the bill, but they don't like the oil shale provision, where it's an opt-in from the State, so they still  kill the whole bill, kill everything because there is something in it they don't like. We urge you to oppose it and the motion to recommit too. So we end up with nothing. \n",
      "   Other people, we have been using words like ``hoax,'' despite claims to the contrary, this is not a drilling bill. Believe me, when the Speaker came around on this, and it's one of the reasons I feel we should move forward with the bill, the Speaker doesn't want this bill, believe me. But she is not the leader of the California delegation, she is the Speaker of the House, and she feels that something has to move along, even if she doesn't approve of most of the provisions that are in here, if she had her own personal way. What I am asking is let's rise above the arguments. Let's rise above the clash with one another. \n",
      "   I don't say that for altruistic reasons, I say it for practical reasons, practical legislative reasons. We will not be forgiven by the people of this Nation if we are not able to move an energy bill to the Senate so we have a fighting chance to try and work the legislative process here. Let's not have the kids that come to visit us every day, the people who come to our office sincerely asking us for our help, look at us and say they couldn't do the job that they were sent here to do. \n",

We said that we were going to put this bill in good faith on the floor and move it along despite everybody saying that they had other contentions they would like to be in there, and that where H.R. 6709 is concerned on the recommittal is that it should have been offered from the beginning as a working document, but that the first part--okay.

I have heard talk already down here today about taxes being paid. You don't think taxes are being paid in Alaska or in Hawaii or elsewhere? \n",

      "   Now, I respect every Member of this floor, and I expect to receive the same in return. When the State of Hawaii came into the Union, one of the protocols of the Admissions Act is the requirement that we recognize and take care of our Hawaiian children. We have programs that are geared towards that. We have Historically Black Colleges in this country. We have established over the past few decades studies in various backgrounds, ethnically, culturally, racially. We have caucuses in this Congress that recognize the various backgrounds from which our people come. \n",
      "   Hawaii, I can tell you, just as Alaska is, because I have visited Alaska and have had an opportunity to speak with the teachers and schoolchildren in Alaska, we are a multi-cultural, multi-racial, multi-ethnic country. We are a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-background, rainbow state in Hawaii, and we recognize those backgrounds and we try to take care of it in our educational processes. \n",
      "   All we are asking for is the opportunity here to help fund local programs that have local assistance as well. That is done in program after program after program. \n",
      "   Now, if the gentleman does not care to have the Federal Government fund anything for education in the United States, that is his prerogative. I recognize that and respect that. I don't approve of it, and I hope the Congress won't approve of it. But to have any Member come into another State without any notice to anybody that they are going to do it, by the way, a courtesy that I would extend to anybody in here, I have to find out about it by osmosis that this is being done, it is shameful and it needs to be stopped and it needs to have an end put to it. \n",
      "   Now, if the gentleman has specific objections to anything being done in Alaska, he should have taken it up with the gentleman from Alaska. That is minimum courtesy in this body. But to come on the floor and make the kind of accusations that are made today is an insult to the gentleman from Alaska and an insult to the Appropriations Committee and an insult to the House of Representatives. \n",
      "   If there are objections to anything in the next one that comes up, I hope that whoever offers that amendment with Hawaii would have had the courtesy to sit down with me and with Representative Hirono and specifically state what  their objections were, so that we might be able to accommodate them, had they legitimacy and foundation. That is the minimum we can expect from one another. \n",
      "   This is a shameful process. I hadn't realized until right now that we could solve the educational problems in this country if we could just keep those Alaskan kids from getting a dime for any program that has been put together by Representative Young and the local educators in Alaska. \n",

      "   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. I rise in support of the Spratt amendment. A reasoned and objective approach is needed for analyzing and assessing the serious issues surrounding the potential for nuclear weapons proliferation in Iran. The current bill language couples military readiness and contingency response planning with report elements that are inherently intelligence-related and dependent on the full spectrum of intelligence sources and methods. \n",
      "   The amendment appropriately shifts the burden of assessment regarding Iran's nuclear weapons capacity and/or intentions from the Secretary of Defense to the Director of National Intelligence. Why reinvent the wheel? Precedent and institutional knowledge specific to the issue already exist. The appropriate vehicle for perpetuating objective analysis of the situation is an updated NIE, with further updates regularly to follow, not an independent and parallel effort on the part of the DOD. \n",
      "   Renewing demand for products of the proven method of consolidating analysis through a centralized NIE process also discourages the temptation for some to ``forum shop,'' I assure you, among national security agencies for favorable or dissenting views, depending on the circumstance. We are all well aware of the Douglas Feith-led, Dick Cheney-originated cabal that was a major instigator of the war in Iraq. \n",
      "   A disassociated DOD effort would undermine a widely considered and properly vetted approach to nuclear proliferation and other high priority national security issues. \n",
      "   The amendment substantially reflects many of the points of inquiry from the report elements in the bill's existing language, but it centers the focus on an updated NIE analysis on the near and mid-term implications rather than on the speculative far-term projections, and does not rush to associate U.S. military response as a presupposition. \n",

The 5 percent reduction in the program that this amendment seeks to roll back has been reallocated. We reallocated funds for serious equipment shortfalls in the Army, National Guard, and Reserve. The equipment readiness needs of the Army, Guard, and Reserve take priority over corporate overhead any day. Understand, to pay for this amendment, you cut military pay, benefits, health care, and equipment for the National Guard and Reserve in multiple deployments. \n",

      "   In this particular instance, Mr. Chairman, I bring to your attention and the Members' attention the Admission Act that brought Hawaii into the Union. The Admission Act requires that we address questions such as those in the present bill that is before us. \n",

If someone is opposed, and I invite once again the Members here who have this amendment, why attack us? Why attack our people for trying to implement the law? Attack the law. Change the law if that is what you want to do, if that is what you think is necessary. \n",

But I don't think here on the floor in any bill that is a consequence of trying to fulfill our obligations constitutionally is the way to go about it. Take it to court.

I want to indicate to him, perhaps he misunderstood my intention in citing just a couple of instances where the vote was taken by himself and others with regard to minorities, with regard to Native Alaskans and tribal members and Native Hawaiians. \n",
      "   The reason that I cited it was not because I was trying to look for something for them that they did not deserve or would not prove useful to them, but let me explain why I cited them, because I thought it was undermining the principles that were cited by our friend from Georgia and our friend from Iowa, initiative, working yourself up the economic and social ladder of success. \n",

If you go into the bill itself, what it is is to try to assist in the areas where minorities are at issue, with trying to increase their capacity to do business, to increase their abilities to deal with wireless technology, digital technology today, as the keystone to economic opportunity and economic success. It's to give people the opportunity to increase their ability to pay their taxes to participate in the American foundation of American economic opportunity so that they could actually increase their capacity to succeed economically. \n",
      "   The same with the other bill, which is why I cited it. I thought that these were the kinds of things that we could all get behind, improve and expand the small business development centers. I know, out in Hawaii, for a fact the small business development centers have been crucial to getting small businesses under way to aiding and assist people who need not just a handout but a hand up, and to give them the technical skills not ordinarily available to them, to give them some of the institutional references that they need to make in order to be able to apply for loans to succeed in achieving, getting the loans to get started, particularly microloans and so on. \n",

The resolution also calls for the Chinese Government to enter into a substantive dialogue with His Holiness the Dalai Lama to find a negotiated solution that respects the distinctive language, culture, religious identity, and fundamental freedoms of all Tibetans. \n",
      "   The Dalai Lama has stated his willingness to accept cultural autonomy for Tibet under the Chinese Constitution. He has also been willing to negotiate with Beijing and has advanced a number of very moderate proposals regarding Tibet's future status. The Communist regime, however, has only met this attempt at accommodation with stiff opposition, and is currently instigating yet another crackdown in the lead up to the Beijing Olympics. \n",
      "   To date, Congress has stood strongly by the Tibetan people as they bravely struggle for their rights: \n",
      "   In 1991, Congress passed a resolution stating that Tibet is an occupied country. \n",
      "   In September of 2007, Representative Rohrabacher introduced House Resolution 610, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States Government should take immediate steps to boycott the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing in August 2008 unless the Chinese regime stops engaging in serious human rights abuses against its citizens and stops supporting serious human rights abuses by the Governments of Sudan, Burma, and North Korea against their citizens. I wholeheartedly support and cosponsor this measure. \n",
      "   Congressman Dana Rohrabacher and I recently formed the Tibet Caucus and already have 8 new members. \n",

Congress must continue to stand by the Tibetan people and uphold their rights as human beings. I urge every Member of Congress to join the Tibetan Caucus, vote ``yes'' for House Resolution 1077, and urge the President of the United States to issue an executive order boycotting the Beijing Olympics and uphold the rights of the Tibetan people to ensure their voice is not silenced. \n",

      "   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Chairman, let's go over what this does do and why it's here. \n",
      "   This amendment places a 1-year ban on flag and general officers in the Armed Services from receiving compensation from any company that does greater than $50 million in business with the Department of Defense. The rationale is very, very straightforward. It assures that large corporations, relying on DOD business, do not take advantage of loopholes in the post-employment ethics laws right now. That's what this is addressing, what exists right now. \n",
      "   Current laws govern conduct-based actions. Conduct-based actions and restrictions that are in there now are meaningless because there's what's called behind-the-scenes and in-house provisions. I didn't make this up. This is what's going on right now. If I'm going to get lectured on ethics, let's talk about ethics. Former flag and general officers cannot overtly attempt to influence government officials. We know that. The $50 million ensures that small businesses seeking access to the DOD market are protected and people can go to work for them.     \n",
      "   It does not impact officers pay grade O-6 and below. We are talking about the top people up here making the top money making the top decisions with Department of Defense organizations. \n",
      "   The amendment protects senior officers from large DOD prime contractors seeking to gain undue influence during their time in service. You think you walk out the door of the Pentagon and down the stairs and by immaculate conception can go to work for one of these DOD corporations and not have tried to influence that job beforehand or negotiate that job before you walk out the door? \n",
      "   Take public universities. From the publication that just came out in March of 2007, of all the universities in the country, only two universities in the country are doing more than $50 million worth of business. So that is open that you can go to. \n",
      "   Dwight Eisenhower, more than 40 years ago, way back in 1961, warned us about the military industrial complex that was emerging in our country. And I am quoting: ``Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.'' \n",
      "   I think President Eisenhower's words speak for themselves. The amendment speaks for itself. This is an implementation of an ethics rule that should apply to the Pentagon, and I would think that people of goodwill would want to embrace it. \n",

      "   Current laws governing conduct-based actions and restrictions are meaningless because of ``behind-the-scenes'' or ``in-house'' provisions where former flag/general officers cannot overtly attempt to influence government officials, but can provide an unfair business advantage by providing their new colleagues in the private sector with valuable knowledge immediately after leaving the Department of Defense. \n",
      "   The $50 million ceiling ensures small businesses seeking access to the DoD market are not restricted from hiring former general or flag officers as employees or consultants. Moreover, this does not impact officers paygrade O-6 and below. \n",

The ``prime'' contractors in the DoD industry are so pervasive and ingrained that they have been referred to as ``quasi-agencies'' in the media. One private company received over $24 billion in DoD contracts, an amount equal to the budget request for the Department of Justice for Fiscal Year 2008 budget request totals $24.02 billion. \n",

      "   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6331, the ``Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008.'' This bill makes some important changes in the Medicare program that help assure access for our seniors to quality medical care. \n",
      "   The bill defers the 10.6% cut in physician reimbursements mandated by the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) that would go into effect on July 1, 2008. Instead, the bill continues the present reimbursement rate for 18 months and then increases it by 1.1%. \n",
      "   The bill also provides important improvements for our senior citizens, increasing the allowable income and asset maximums for premium assistance. The co-payments for mental health services are reduced from 50% to 20%, the same as any other doctor visit. \n",
      "   The legislation addresses problems within Medicare to pay for these benefits, reforming the system that overpays to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, private plans that operate within Medicare, which cost the government on average 12% more than traditional services. The bill will also require that any delinquent taxes owed by Medicare providers be deducted from their Medicare reimbursements. \n",
      "   In addition to improving Medicare services, the legislation also makes important changes to Medicaid, including a provision that is particularly vital for the people of Hawaii: Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments. \n",
      "   Following an oversight in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, only Hawaii and Tennessee have not received DSH payments in Medicaid, which provide additional support to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients. This bill provides a temporary remedy, which will help keep these hospitals open. \n",
      "   I have been working with Senator Daniel Akaka, the Hawaii Delegation and my colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Commerce to ensure that Hawaii and Tennessee receive equal treatment in the matter of DSH payments from the Federal Government. H.R. 6631 extends DSH payments for Hawaii and Tennessee through December 31, 2009, and provides an additional $15 million for Hawaii. This extension authorizes the submission by the State of Hawaii of a State plan amendment covering a DSH payment methodology to hospitals which is consistent with the requirements of existing law. The purpose of providing a DSH allotment for Hawaii is to provide additional funding to the State of Hawaii to permit a greater contribution toward the uncompensated costs of hospitals that are providing indigent care. It is not meant to alter existing arrangements between the State of Hawaii and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) or to reduce in any way the level of Federal funding for Hawaii's QUEST program. \n",
      "   I will continue to work toward a permanent solution to the DSH matter, but until then, I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It is not an earmark, but merely provides Hawaii and Tennessee equity with everyone else. \n",

      "   Many of the first settlers faced a harsh and difficult life. But the patients who were sent to Kalaupapa eventually built a community that allowed them to endure a life cut off from parents, children, brothers, sisters and friends. Even after medication was developed to control Hansen's disease, many patient residents chose to continue living in Kalaupapa. \n",
      "   The site became a national park in 1980 and is dedicated to preserving the memories and lessons of the past. Kalaupapa is a living memorial to a community that once lived in extreme isolation. It now serves as a place of education, contemplation and quiet beauty. Unfortunately, many of the residents who finished their life in Kalaupapa do not have recognizable graves or grave markers. The memorial established by this bill would serve as a permanent marker and reminder of all 8,000 residents who lived on Kalaupapa. \n",
      "   A little more than 20 patients remain in Kalaupapa. As time passes, the number of former residents of Kalaupapa gets smaller, as do the number of people who remember this part of Hawaii's history.

      "   The United States has always had a unique relationship to the Pacific Islands. Not only do they help play a key role in the fight against terrorism, but these governments also aid the U.S. in its overall security. Furthermore, both the U.S. and the Pacific Islands rely on the vast resources of the Pacific basin; these resources while enormous are not unlimited, and management requires cooperation across all of our governments. These islands also work closely with the U.S. on an important environmental and security concern, global climate change, which has the potential to drastically affect all who depend on the Pacific for their livelihood. Furthermore, trade, tourism, and other economic ties further reveal the interdependence between the Pacific Islands and the U.S. The resolution before us recognizes these factors. \n",
      "   As we mark Asian Pacific American (APA) Heritage month, we would also be remiss to not point out that Americans of Pacific Island decent are a rapidly growing ethnic group within the U.S. They add strength to our communities with their diversity and values, and they make important contributions to the U.S. as a whole. The resolution also mentions this important fact. \n",
      "   Furthermore, the resolution discusses the importance of the East-West Center, which runs the Conference of Leaders. Congress established the East-West Center, which is based in my district, in 1960. The East-West Center seeks to establish a dialogue between the peoples and nations of Asia, the Pacific, and the U.S. The East-West Center provides a home for academics who perform vital research that helps all parties better understand each other's history and culture. The Center's Education and Outreach sphere helps disseminate what researchers learn to the broader public and to policymakers. Finally, the Center provides important dialogue programs. Under the effective leadership of Dr. Charles Morrison, the East-West Center continues to address the challenges of the Asian-Pacific 21st Century. \n",

It seeks to bring together leaders from the region to discuss many of the issues I mentioned earlier. In the era of growing interdependence between the U.S. and Pacific Island governments, both the work of the Center and the Conference of Leaders becomes more important. \n",

H.R. 1595, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act, would honor the residents of Guam for their loyalty and compensate them for the atrocities they suffered during the Japanese occupation of Guam. \n",
      "   During World War II, Guam was invaded, seized and occupied by Imperial Japanese forces for nearly three years. The war destroyed much of Guam, including housing, public buildings, utilities and infrastructure. In addition, the people of Guam suffered many deaths and an untold number of acts of brutality. This ruthless brutality has left a lasting impact on the survivors of the war and the descendants of victims. \n",
      "   In 1947, the Secretary of the Navy commissioned a civilian committee on the Naval Administration of Guam and American Samoa to prepare a report with specific recommendations. The report became known as the Hopkins Report and was submitted to the Secretary of the Navy in 1947. Among other things, the report addressed deficiencies in the war claims process for Guam immediately after the war ended. In the cover letter submitted with the report, the committee stated, ``Only so can justice be done to a valiant group of Americans who at great cost to themselves remained steadfastly loyal during the war ..... in so special a case this government could well be very generous in method of distributing its relief as well as generous in amount awarded. It has been neither.'' \n",
      "   Many decades later, the 107th Congress authorized the Guam War Claims Review Commission to determine if the people of Guam received parity in claims as compared to other Americans who experienced losses and damages during the war. In 2004, the Commission submitted their final report to Congress and found that Guam's residents were inequitably treated. \n",
      "   There has been legislation to address this inequitable treatment in every Congress since 1985. Two hearings have been held, one in the 108th Congress and one on in the 109th Congress.

      "   I indicated last night, and I think it was agreed to by Mr. Bachus of Alabama and others, by way of material that has been entered into the Record, like Mr. Renzi of Arizona, that this should not be a partisan fight. In fact, ``fight'' probably is the wrong word, but, I mean, even a disagreement here. \n",
      "   The reason that this bill passed overwhelmingly last week, with significant support from the Republican side of the aisle, was that it was supported in committee by Republicans and Democrats. The bill is here before the Congress as a result of a request by Hawaii's Republican Governor, and the former Chair of the Hawaii Republican Party, who is now the head of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. \n",
      "   We have always had legislation in this area based on the underlying law, which was passed in 1921, by the Congress, setting aside certain lands for Hawaiians. The issue before us is about refinancing of home mortgages. This is not about whether the original law, under which the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands was established, it is constitutional. \n",
      "   On the contrary, that issue has been raised, and it perhaps should be raised in another context; namely, if someone wants to change the underlying law. But we should not punish my constituents or anybody's constituents for the fact that they appear before us in the form of a bill trying to carry forward on the admonitions required of them, in this instance, by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in order to get their mortgages refinanced. \n",
      "   Let me say, just as recently as February 9 of this year, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against a group of individuals who came before the court, saying that funding for programs that benefit Hawaiians, in this instance, of this bill, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, constitutes an unconstitutional discrimination against non-Hawaiians. \n",
      "   The Federal appeals court ruled that was not the case. In fact, they returned it to the U.S. District Court to see if the plaintiffs were eligible ``in any  other capacity.'' That is to say, other than whether it was constitutional. \n",
      "   So we have, as recently as the last 30 days, appeals court admonitions that the constitutionality of having programs for Hawaiians is, in fact, constitutional. \n",
      "   If someone wants to argue that, please let's argue it on the basis of a bill that addresses that itself, rather than the bill which is before us, which has to do with the refinancing of mortgages.

The court in Rice specifically declined to rule on the status of Native Hawaiians and Native Hawaiian programs created by Congress. \n",
      "   Moreover, this bill and these programs have never been a partisan issue in the past. This reauthorization and improvements were requested by Hawaii's Republican administration and Governor Linda Lingle. The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands is chaired by the former head of Hawaii's State Republican Party. This bill was introduced last year by Congressman Bob Ney and was reported out of the Financial Services Committee by voice vote and without amendment. Last Congress's Republican chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mike Oxley, cosponsored this bill. \n",
      "   I mention these pieces of background information to illustrate the wide support for the program and the fact that it has been both Democratic and Republican. Last week, when this bill was up for consideration in the House under a suspension of the rules, the GOP leadership issued a statement just hours before the vote, calling the bill ``unconstitutional'' and charged that it would ``confer on Native Hawaiian an arrangement like that between the federal government and American Indian tribes.'' Despite these charges, the bill was able to garner 34 Republican votes. \n",
      "   The status of Native Hawaiians needs to be debated and should be debated in the House. However, this is the wrong venue for that. I have another bill pending in the House of Representatives that would establish a process for the Federal recognition of Native Hawaiians. I hope to have this legislation considered by the House Natural Resources Committee and will gladly debate these issues at that time. \n",
      "   This measure is about helping low-income Native Hawaiians own their own home. The programs reauthorized by H.R. 835 simply provide funds for infrastructure, helps Native Hawaiians obtain mortgages and allows for refinancing to lower the cost of homeownership. This bill is about assisting Native Hawaiians to reach the American dream of owning their own home. \n",
      "   I believe this bill can, and should, pass with overwhelming bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to vote for final passage of this bill and support efforts to get more low-income people into their own homes.  \n",

      "   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 406, celebrating the accomplishments of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, also known as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, and recognizing the need to continue pursuing the goal of educational opportunities for women and girls. \n",
      "   Title IX changed the way the United States educates its women and girls. It states that, ``No person in the United States, shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.'' This monumental legislation has had far-reaching effects on the women in this country. Title IX may be best known for its changes in athletics, but the academic world has been significantly changed as well. Since 1981, women have received more bachelor's degrees than men, and since 1986, women have received more master's degrees than men. None of this would have been possible without the hard work of Patsy Mink and Edith Green. Generations of women have and will benefit from the work of these women. \n",
      "   I had the honor of serving with Patsy Mink for 12 years, representing the State of Hawaii  in the U.S. House of Representatives. She strove to ensure equality and fairness for all Americans. Through her work on title IX, she was able to accomplish just that for every American woman. The renaming of title IX to the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act honors her work and reminds us all of her dedication to equality. \n",
      "   We should take this time to reflect on where we have come from and the progress we have made. Millions of women have access to the education to make their dreams come true, and that access was guaranteed 35 years ago by a woman who believed that we should all be able to better our lives. \n",

      "   Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee on Air and Land Forces, my overriding concern on every issue that comes before us is whether and how it supports our men and women in uniform. \n",
      "   Every decision about equipment, procurement, training, end strength or budget authorization must meet this test: Does it support our troops? The question before us today, increasing U.S. forces in Iraq by some 21,000 combat troops and somewhere between 3 and 28,000 support personnel fails this test in every respect. \n",
      "   Both the immediate and long-term effects of the war in Iraq on our Nation's military preparedness are evident and drastic. Extended deployments, premature redeployments, and sustained combat under unbelievably harsh conditions have taken a terrible toll on our forces and their equipment. \n",
      "   The results are an overstretched U.S. Army and Marine Corps with no fully mission-capable Reserve forces, and an urgent need for billions of dollars to repair or replace worn and damaged helicopters, tanks, other armored vehicles, including up-armored Humvees and other equipment. \n",
      "   I recently returned from an inspection of two of the Army's busiest repair depots in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Anniston, Alabama. What we saw there were skilled and dedicated employees working feverishly to make sure that our men and women in uniform, particularly those in Iraq and Afghanistan, have every piece of equipment they need to do their jobs and keep themselves safe from harm. \n",
      "   What we saw were the results of an administration's abject failure to mobilize this country's industrial base for this war of choice. Only now are we ramping up America's manufacturing capacity to fully support our troops at home and overseas. \n",
      "   Smugly self-righteous in its belief that U.S. troops would be targeted with nothing more lethal than rose petals, this administration has been complacent in leaving the burden of the war on the men and women of our Armed Forces, active, Reserve and National Guard. The impact of this attitude hit home for me in Corpus Christi when I read recently about the death in Iraq of a 48-year-old Army sergeant with five children. \n",
      "   Newspaper Columnist Dan Thomasson asked: What in the world was a 48-year-old man with five children doing in the military in Iraq? The answer is obvious, he was a member either of the National Guard or the Reserve. The Guard and Reserve are being used in a way never contemplated. Their repeated and sustained deployments turn lives upside down, sometimes permanently, and have a profound impact on families, businesses and whole communities. \n",
      "   Why have they been so misused? Because there is not anyone else. Because our active duty force is too small to sustain our engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan. To have acted to ensure the burden of this war would be more broadly shared, that the industrial sector would be mobilized, and the military equipment, supply and maintenance and repair systems put on a war-time footing would have been expensive and an admission of a reality the Bush administration did not want to confront. \n",
      "   The real and immediate concern is that forces now being deployed as part of this surge will not have the equipment they need when they get there. They will have to borrow it. We are not fully prepared to respond effectively. \n",
      "   The House then is considering an expression of support or opposition to another failure of leadership. Nearly 23 years ago, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, outlined in a speech entitled ``The Uses of Military Power,'' six tests that need to be applied whenever combat forces are contemplated. \n",
      "   One: never commit forces unless the particular situation is vital to our national interest or that of our allies. Two: if we are willing to commit the force or resources necessary to win, we should commit them all. \n",
      "   Three: we should have clearly defined political and military objectives. Four: the relationship between the objectives and forces, size, composition, disposition, must be continually reassessed and adjusted. \n",
      "   Five: we must have the support of the American people and their elected representatives in Congress. Six: the commitment of U.S. troops to combat should be a last resort. President Bush's policies have failed every one of then-Secretary Weinberger's tests. \n",
      "   What then are the consequences of this failure? Our troops are in peril. Our credibility is shattered and the lessons of the past are submerged in empty rhetoric and political dribble.     \n",
      "   Make no mistake, we are engaged in a war of choice, a catastrophe conceived in ideological zeal, cloaked in misinformation and administered with breathtaking incompetence. \n",
      "   It is an outrage that we have not had a single policy in Iraq worthy of our men and women in uniform. This surge is yet another misstep in this tragic journey to disaster. We need to end it and end it now. \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of Congressman Space's amendment, which is of course funding for the ARC, Appalachian Regional Commission, in this year's Energy and Water appropriations bill. \n",
      "   Many Americans may not be aware that this was a program that was established back in 1965. ARC was created to address the persistent poverty and the growing economic despair of the Appalachian region, which is an area that extends from southern New York to northeast Mississippi. At that time in 1965, one out of every three Appalachians lived in poverty. Per capita income was 23 percent lower than the U.S. average, and high unemployment and harsh living conditions had, in the 1950s, forced more than 2 million people in that area to leave their homes and seek work in other regions. \n",
      "   Even today, ongoing changes in declining sectors of the economy, such as  manufacturing and textiles, exacerbated by globalization, changes in technology, and the recent downturn in the economy have hit this region very, very hard. It has threatened to reverse a lot of the economic gains that were made in these communities over the past several years. For an area that has suffered economically for so long, we can't allow this to happen. \n",
      "   By funding the ARC at least at last year's level, $65 million, we will ensure that the people and the businesses of Appalachia have the knowledge, have the skills and the access to telecommunications and the technology to compete in a technology-based economy. \n",
      "   As has been mentioned here by Congressman Space, this restoration of funds will be offset by $30 million for the Department of Energy's administrative account. ARC has been a responsible steward for the Federal funds that it has received over the past several years. For example, in fiscal year 2006, across all investment areas each dollar of ARC funding was matched by $3.14 in non-ARC public project funding, and each ARC dollar invested leveraged $11.55 in private investment in ARC projects over time. \n",
      "   The 410-county region still faces a complex set of issues. However, this program has made a difference, and we are seeing results. \n",
      "   Over the last 10 years, funding for the ARC has remained level at $65 million. And the region continues to receive less Federal assistance per capita than the rest of the country. Additionally, in the past, the House of Representatives has voted to authorize the ARC levels at the higher level of $65 million. \n",
      "   I would like to thank Congressman Space for his assistance in this program, and also Chairman Visclosky for his attention to this matter. \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member for their support of this piece of legislation. And of course as it has been said, we're here today to honor Ola Lee Mize by naming the veterans clinic in Gadsden, Alabama after him. Col. Mize was a soldier in the United States Army during the Korean war. And as has already been mentioned, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on June 10 and 11, 1953. \n",
      "   Most people may be surprised to learn that just over 100 recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor are alive today. And only one of them lives in Alabama. And I'm honored that Ola Lee Mize resides in the district I represent, which is the Fourth District of Alabama. \n",
      "   Ola Lee Mize was the son of an Alabama sharecropper. He dropped out of school in 1946 after the ninth grade. And he did that so that he could take care of his mother, his brothers and his sisters. A few years later he decided he could do better. So he left a job that was paying $15 a week and then enlisted in the United States Army. \n",
      "   However, when he went to apply to the Army, he was rejected because he weighed only 120 pounds. But he was persistent, and recruiters finally let him enlist. Mize's military career  would see him courageously rise to the high ranking position of colonel after the humble beginnings of a young high school drop-out who was once rejected by the Army. \n",
      "   Col. Mize's story is a great example to all Americans who aspire to great things in the face of challenges. The Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States Government. It is bestowed on a member of the United States Armed Forces who risk their life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States. Col. Mize exemplifies this. And I think it is appropriate and fitting that he be honored again by the naming of this clinic in Gadsden, Alabama. \n",
      "   Colonel Ola Mize earned his Medal of Honor when he was a sergeant for the U.S. Army with Company K of the 15th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division. \n",
      "   During one particular battle in the Korean war, his company was committed to the defense of an outpost in the southern region of what is now South Korea. And at the time, the Chinese were under heavy attack of the area.     \n",
      "   With all the company's officers dead or wounded, Mize worked to establish a defensive position while dragging wounded into the shelters made by timbers pulled from American bunkers destroyed by enemy fire. Over the next several hours, he assembled an impromptu patrol that went from bunker to bunker firing out of the open spaces in an effort to make the Chinese believe that they were still opposed by a vigorous force. \n",
      "   American counterattack forces reached Mize's position about noon on the 11th day of June, and after helping to resecure the outpost, Mize got permission to take his wounded men back to American lines. Upon reaching friendly territory, Mize, the regimental commander and the division commander, were all standing together. The two commanders did not recognize Mize, whose uniform at the time was in tatters, his flight jacket smoking, and his face badly swollen from burns. ``Who are you,'' demanded the regimental commanders? ``Sergeant Mize,'' he answered. ``You're not Mize,'' the commander responded. ``He's dead.'' \n",
      "   His Medal of Honor citation states that Sergeant Mize's valorous conduct and unflinching courage reflect lasting glory upon himself and upon the noble traditions of military service. \n",
      "   Several months later, informed that he would receive the Medal of Honor, Mize told the commanding officers that he didn't want it because it really should go to the entire platoon. Reluctantly, he was flown back to the United States so he could attend a ceremony in Denver, Colorado. He was decorated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on September 7, 1954. In the early 1960s, Ola Mize joined the Special Forces and did three tours in Vietnam. He retired as colonel in 1981. \n",
      "   Ola Mize is a great soldier that has served our country with bravery and class, and it is my pleasure today to offer this resolution in his honor. \n",

      "   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank my colleagues for taking time to call attention to this topic that we have been discussing tonight. And certainly from the very beginning of our history in this Nation, religious expression and faith was the norm amongst conversations that our Founding Fathers had. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes) along with several of my colleagues tonight pointed out that as we stand here tonight in this Chamber that as we look around the room and we see the reliefs under the ceiling of the Chamber, and we see the 23 different lawgivers that are depicted above the gallery doorways, the most prominent relief, of course, has been noted is that of Moses who handed down the Ten Commandments. And of course those Ten Commandments were handed down to the children of Israel from God Himself. \n",
      "   Furthermore, it has been noted here tonight that ``In God We Trust'' is above the Speaker's chair, as it is our national motto. And of course let's not forget that as we started the legislative day today, before we voted on the legislation just a couple of hours ago, a chaplain said a prayer that began the legislative day. And of course that has been the custom dating back to the days of our Founding Fathers. \n",
      "   The Founding Fathers no doubt believed that God had His Almighty hand in the founding and the building of this Nation. George Washington himself believed that America's independence from Britain ultimately depended on God and not man. I find it interesting that it is not unusual for the Founding Fathers when they dated documents at that time they would use the phrase ``in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ 1776'' of what the date may have been. \n",
      "   A few months ago, I was walking down the stairways just outside of the House Chamber, and one of the paintings that is above the stairways is the ``Signing of the Constitution.'' And I have passed by that painting hundreds of times. Of course, most Americans are very familiar with that famous painting. But for some reason, one thing caught my eye that was not usually the case, and I noticed there was an open book there near where the presiding officer was over the signers of the Constitution. And I took a closer look and noticed that it was an open book. And at the top it said ``Saint Matthew.'' And certainly I don't think it is any coincidence that that book was open on that particular day. \n",
      "   One may ask why our Founding Fathers were so concerned about this issue. And one reason I believe that they were so focused on this issue and thought it was so important is because they had this radical belief that we are all endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. And this was indeed a radical concept in the time, because in England your rights were granted to you by the king. Therefore, if the king or the queen granted your rights, or if man granted your rights, then the king or the queen or the man could take those rights away. However, if God granted those rights, no person, be he king or queen, could take them away. They were a gift of God. \n",
      "   So when one asks the importance of religious history and faith in America, one can point to many reasons. And one reason that we can point back to is that in the United States of America, rights are granted by God and not by man. \n",

      "   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I would like to reference two positive programs within this Homeland Security Appropriations bill that are making a difference in the 4th District of Alabama. \n",
      "   For several years, Congress has included funding in this bill for local Assistance to Firefighters Grants. The purpose of this grant program is to award grants directly to fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical service organizations. These awards aim to enhance our first responder's ability to protect the health and safety of the public, as well as that of first-responder personnel, with respect to fire-related hazards. Using a competitive process overseen by fire service subject matter experts, DHS awards grants to applicants whose requests best address the priorities of the program. \n",
      "   This is especially important in the district that I represent in North Alabama. \n",
      "   As a rural area, North Alabama is home to many volunteer fire departments and rescue squads. These people work hard to protect their communities and provide first rate care of their neighbors. Unfortunately in too many instances they are forced to do so with older equipment that doesn't provide the proper safety or performance that they need to do their jobs. This problem isn't for lack of care; it's in large measure due to a lack of funding. The Fire Grant program has proven to be a tremendous asset that has helped meet the needs of the fire departments and EMS organizations that I represent. \n",
      "   I am pleased that this important program has received increased funding this year. That means that more organizations will be able to participate and upgrade equipment and training that they might otherwise have been unable to do. As a result they will be better prepared to save lives, protect homes and businesses and continue to serve their communities in a meaningful way. \n",
      "   I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for their support of another important program within Homeland Security, textile transshipment enforcement. As a district with a heavy textile manufacturing presence, I am very aware of the problems faced by this important industry. \n",
      "   Today foreign manufacturers are utilizing unnatural and unfair business practices that are hurting U.S. textile manufacturers. One such scheme involves the transshipment of goods to evade duty or quotas on textiles being brought into the country. Over the last several years, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, CBP, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have been very successful in stopping many of these illegal textile transshipments. \n",
      "   In 2006, Customs announced that they seized more than $100 million in wearing apparel and textile goods that were misrepresented, smuggled or illegally transshipped in an effort to circumvent U.S. textile trade laws and regulations. Of that amount, $3 million worth of socks were confiscated. This program is making a difference and giving U.S. textile manufacturers an opportunity to compete. I fully support this funding and am pleased that this Congress continues to recognize its importance. \n",

      "   Born on December 6, 1935, to Ruby and Jesse Clifton, he grew up in Winston County, Alabama, and graduated from Haleyville High School in 1954. He pursued his undergraduate degree at Birmingham-Southern College. Thereafter, he attended the Cumberland School of Law in Lebanon, Tennessee, and obtained his law degree from the University of Alabama School of Law. \n",
      "   As a young attorney, he joined the faculty at the Cumberland School of Law, which by that time had moved from Lebanon, Tennessee, to Birmingham, Alabama, which is known today as Samford University. It was during this time that he authored, along with Professor Sam B. Gilreath, Caruther's ``History of a Lawsuit,'' eighth edition. \n",
      "   In 1958, he married his high school sweetheart, Mary Frances Brown, and they have been married for over 48 years. They have one son, who is married to the former Caroline McDonald and, two grandchildren, Mary Elliott and Robert Hayes. \n",
      "   In 1962, he began serving as judge of the Court of Law and Equity in Winston County and served there until 1973. Then in 1977, he took office as one of two judges serving the 25th Judicial Circuit in the Alabama court system and has remained on the bench for 30 years. \n",
      "   He has served the public for more than 40 years and has presided over each case that has come before him with integrity and with impartiality. He is someone who has a brilliant legal mind; but most important, he has compassion for all individuals, regardless of their background or their social standing. \n",
      "   He is a man of faith, prayer, and integrity, who has a great love for his family, his country and his God. He has taken his job seriously from the first day he stepped up to the bench to preside. In addition to his responsibilities on the bench, he has been a businessman and has pastored Fairview Congregational Church in Hackleburg, Alabama, for over 40 years. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, I know all these things to be true about this individual and his character and his reputation because I personally observed him. Many times Members don't always have that kind of perspective when they come to the floor. I can say these things in all truthfulness as I stand here on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives because this man, the judge I am talking about, Bobby Aderholt, is my dad. \n",

      "   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call attention to this, the first Thursday in May, as the National Day of Prayer. The 56th annual National Day of Prayer is being recognized today, May 3, across our great Nation in tens of thousands of ceremonies and services nationwide. \n",
      "   The National Day of Prayer traces its history back to 1775, when the Continental Congress asked the colonies to pray for wisdom in forming a Nation. In 1952, a joint resolution of Congress was signed into law by President Truman. In 1988, President Reagan signed a law permanently marking the first Thursday of every May as the National Day of Prayer. \n",
      "   As in previous years, President George W. Bush signed a proclamation regarding the 2007 observance. He specifically asked that the Nation remember in their prayers the members of our Armed Forces, their families, as well as the students and families affected by the recent tragedy at Virginia Tech. \n",
      "   Chairman Shirley Dobson and Vice Chairman Brian Toon have done an outstanding job in coordinating these events that will take place across this land. Dr. Charles Swindoll will serve as Honorary Chairman. \n",
      "   Mr. Speaker, across the street, here on Capitol Hill in the Cannon House Office Building at noon is when the events will begin. However, whether you're in Washington, D.C., you're in Alabama, North Dakota, I encourage the American people to come together in the spirit of Jesus and take a few minutes to thank God for the blessings upon this Nation, and ask Him to guide and protect us in the days to come. \n",

      "<TEXT>\n",
      "   Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, today is a day that we will look back on and know that fundamental decisions regarding our Nation's history were made. \n",
      "   The discussions that we are engaged in will go a long way in determining our future in the ongoing global war on terror and Iraq's role in that fight. When this vote is cast on the non-binding, Democratic resolution, we will be sending a message to the world. The only question remaining is what message will we send? \n",
      "   Will we say that America remains steadfast against the rising tide of hate and intolerance offered by militant Islamists? Will we say that we don't have the stomach to finish the fight against terrorists who actively seek to kill us and destroy our way of life? \n",
      "   The war in Iraq has become such a flashpoint that we struggle to separate the politics of the situation from the reality. The politics attacks the intelligence that led us to war, questions our Nation's elected leadership, and condemns the decisions made along the way. It leads to the resolution that we now have before us. The reality recognizes that we are at war now and our troops are putting their lives on the line each and every day. It says that if this is a fight that we believe in, a fight against global terrorism, we must do everything possible to support the men and women who are carrying it out on our behalf and never giving a hint to the contrary. \n",
      "   Unfortunately we are at a point today where some have forgotten exactly who and what we are fighting. \n",
      "   Prior to 9/11, we failed to understand the hate of people like Osama bin Laden and what could result from it despite all evidence to the contrary. In 1979, 66 American diplomats were held hostage in Iran for 444 days; in 1983, 241 Marines were killed in Beirut when their barracks was attacked; militant Islamic terrorists bombed the World Trade Center in 1993; 225 people were killed in attacks  on U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998; and, in 2000, 17 American sailors were killed when al-Qaeda attacked the U.S.S. Cole. \n",
      "   Today we are at a historic crossroads: we either boldly tackle the issue of militant Islam that exists on the Iraqi front and is part of this world-wide struggle, applying the lessons we have learned from the years leading up to 9/11, or we approach the issue as we naively demonstrated before 9/11 and expect more attacks and more American deaths. \n",
      "   The war in Iraq has gone on longer than any of us would have wished. We've seen too many funerals for too many sons and daughters, husbands and wives. To all those who have lost a friend or loved one, our hearts go out to you. \n",
      "   It should be noted that mistakes have been made, of that there can be no doubt. We must know without question what led us to this point, and that time will come. But now is not that time. Not while we still have American service men and women in harm's way. History will play its part, teaching us our mistakes and urging us not to repeat them. But we don't have the luxury of waiting on history to pass its judgment. \n",
      "   Without resolve, it is certain we will fail in Iraq and there will be far-reaching consequences for our Nation, the region and ultimately the world. Since September 11, there have been major terrorist attacks in Karachi, Bali, Moscow, Casablanca, Riyadh, Istanbul, Madrid, London and Amman. If we allow the terrorists present in Iraq to win, we can expect more of the same. We can expect to see another Afghanistan--a puppet government established to support and back the aims of their terrorist masters. This is totally unacceptable. \n",
      "   Victory in Iraq is our only option. It is the only path through which we can hope for peace. Without victory, our terrorist enemies gain confidence in their opposition to the United States and their ability to defeat us militarily. We embolden them and offer them the opportunity to further their attacks against American men, women and children. \n",
      "   The resolution that we are debating will send a message to the world. What will that message be? My fervent hope and prayer is that it will be a message of resolve, a message of strength, a message of victory. \n",
      "   Now is the time to support our troops in the field unequivocally and vote against this nonbinding resolution. We don't want anyone to construe our action here today as not fully supporting our men and women who serve us in Iraq. \n",

I have been in meetings with them for many hours, so I appreciate their work. \n",

      "   This year's process has been anything but bipartisan. I think it would be fair to say that the political rancor in the debate that has occurred over the last several months has surpassed anything that most of us have seen while we have been in Congress. But it is time to move forward and it is time that we remember what is important in this whole process, and that is the children that need health care in America, that are simply the poor in this country. \n",
      "   In my home State of Alabama, SCHIP has been a tremendous success and has helped a new generation of children live happier and healthier lives.     \n",

      "   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the Chairman's support for this legislation to be brought to the floor. I also want to say that I appreciate Congressman Coble, his lending his support for this legislation and making sure that it gets to the floor today. And as Chairman Conyers noted, Congressman Davis of Alabama and Congressman Braley of Iowa have been very helpful in this effort as well. So I'm glad to have their support. \n",
      "   One other person that has been very supportive that actually called this to my attention initially was a friend of mine from Alabama, Mike Turner, some time ago brought this issue to my attention, and so I'm glad that we can work on this and try to get this resolved here on the floor of the House and through the United States Congress. \n",
      "   I'm pleased to have been able to work together with the committee of jurisdiction to find a satisfactory solution to this issue dealing with recognition across State lines. During the hearing that was held during the 109th Congress, which has already been mentioned, by the Subcommittee on the Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property, then Ranking Member HOWARD BERMAN pointed out that though the topic of notary recognition between the States is not necessarily the most exciting issue, it is an extremely practical one. And to my colleague who, of course, now chairs that subcommittee, I would have to agree with him on both points. \n",
      "   During the hearing, which was held back in March of 2006, we heard from several witnesses who all agree that this is an ongoing and a difficult problem for interstate commerce. To businesses and individuals engaged in businesses across State lines, this is a matter long overdue that is being resolved. \n",
      "   H.R. 1979, the bill today, will eliminate confusion that arises when States refuse to acknowledge the integrity of documents from another State. This act preserves the right of States to set standards and regulate notaries, while reducing the burden on the average citizen who has to use the Court system. \n",
      "   It will streamline the interstate, commercial, and legal transaction consistent with the guarantees of the State's rights that are called for in the Full Faith in Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. \n",
      "   Currently, as the law is today, each State is responsible for regulating its notaries. Typically, an individual will pay a fee, will submit an application, takes an oath of office. Some States require the applicants to enroll in educational courses, pass exams and even to obtain a notary bond. Nothing in this legislation will change these steps. We are not trying to mandate how States regulate notaries which they appoint. \n",
      "   In addition, the bill will also not preclude the challenge of notarized documents such as a will contest. \n",
      "   During the subcommittee hearings on this bill that were held back in the 109th Congress, Tim Reineger, who serves as the executive director of the National Notary Association stated, ``We like this bill because it is talking about a standard for the legal effects of the material act, the admissibility of it, not at all interfering with the State requirements for education and regulation of the notaries themselves.'' \n",
      "   This is an issue that has really lagged on for many, many years. When I was first elected to Congress back in 1997, this was an issue that I was first made aware of, and here we are in 2007, and this issue is still not resolved. And this is an issue that people who deal with notaries on a daily basis deal with, to a lot of frustration. \n",
      "   And simply, this legislation that we have before the House today and that will be going before the United States Senate, hopefully in a very short period of time, will address this problem. It will try to expedite interstate commerce so that court documents and so that when notaries are in one State or the other, they will be fully recognized. \n",
      "   And again, I think it must be stressed that it is in no way trying to mandate what a State should do or should not do. It simply allows there to be more free flow of commerce between the States and particularly when you're talking about the regulation of notaries themselves. \n",
      "   Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your support, Congressman Coble for your support of this legislation, and allowing it to be able to move forward today. And I would urge my colleagues that when this bill comes for a vote, that they would support it under the suspension of the rules.  \n",

It would never be considered proper within the United States and it isn't proper that taxpayers' money be spent for this purpose overseas. \n",

There are a number of alternatives to abortion which do not rise to the level of concern that this proposal engenders. This is only anti-family planning if one considers abortion to be a method of family planning. I reject this way of thinking and urge the adoption of this amendment. \n",

       "3  Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute.    Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about.    This problem has been under study for years.

       "4  Ms. BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today because of my grave concerns over what is surely one of the largest bailouts in American history.    I recognize that this is the product of compromise and therefore imperfect; but the serious problems with this bill make it impossible for me to support.    Make no mistake; a vote for this bailout is a vote to ratify business as usual in Washington. This compromise was crafted by the same people who brought you this mess, except this time they are putting a gun to your head and saying give me more.    This isn't legislation; this is extortion. We could actually call it the in-out plan, as the FBI is going in, we are bailing out. That's not what the taxpayers want.    My greatest concern is that this bill creates yet another opportunity for the Federal Government to meddle in the economy. The scope and size of this bill, however, means that the bailout will come at greater harm to equity holders, businesses, and homeowners.    ...  "
