   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you, Congressman Latta. I appreciate your yielding to me for some comments. 
   We had a thrill to go on this trip this past weekend. It was the American energy tour. Leader John Boehner led that tour. We were so grateful that we were extended an invitation to join him. Representative Latta was there, and I was there representing the people from the Sixth District. So here we are, knowing we have very little time left before Congress takes a break in August when we are back in our districts, and we will be there for 5 weeks through Labor Day, we are here right now with a chance to talk to the American people. But more importantly, we have a chance to be here on the floor tonight and solve this energy issue. 
   One thing that we learned on this energy tour is that the problem is not a lack of natural resources that are available here in the United States, it isn't a lack of energy in the United States. The lack of energy is the inertia in the United States Congress, the Democrat-controlled United States Congress. That's where we lack energy. 
   The one thing that we found on this tour is that the problem is Congress. The problem isn't lack of resources. The problem isn't degradation to our environment. The problem is the fact that Congress has literally locked up and made illegal access to American energy. 
   Congressman Latta referenced the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge area up in Alaska. I would like to speak about that, but before that, I would like to talk about the areas that are off-limits. I mentioned that Congress is the problem, and Congress can be the answer. Congress has made it virtually illegal to access American energy. Where? Well, the first place is up in Alaska where Congressman Latta and I were, with fellow freshmen, and that is where there are over 10 billion barrels of oil. 
   I spoke with somebody who just read the recently released geological study which stated that there are over 90 billion barrels of oil in the Arctic region, and over 10 billion of which are in ANWR. This is a big story. 
   Let me go back now to the ANWR map. As Congressman Latta said, ANWR is all of 19 million acres and is the size of South Carolina. The size of the area that would be drilled upon is 2,000 acres of that 19 million acres. In other words, if you think of a football field, think of putting a little postage stamp on a football field. That is the size of the area that would be drilled upon. 
   Here is the Brooks Range up in northern Alaska. Here is the Arctic Ocean. You can't get any farther north than this. The area that we were in, the 1002 area where we are looking at drilling, and also President Carter set aside this area specifically for the purpose of drilling, this area is in direct proximity to the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline System. This is one of the modern marvels of human engineering. It really should be one of the seven wonders of the world. It is over 800 miles of pipeline. This is America's energy lifeline. 
   Do you know that the largest energy field in the United States is the Prudhoe Bay oil field that was discovered? We have had a living laboratory over the last 31 years. We have had a demonstration project for 31 years in Prudhoe Bay showing you in an environmentally safe and clean way, you can not only drill for oil but also transport oil and get it down to the lower 48. 
   One thing that Congressman Latta and I learned when we were there is that 31 years ago when drilling began, the flow was 2.1 million barrels a day that traveled through this pipeline. Today that oil flow is down to 700,000 barrels a day. And the reason for that is because no more oil fields have been opened for exploration. 
   Well, what happens when we get down to 300,000 barrels a day flowing through this pipeline? The pipeline stops. It doesn't work any more, and we are not able to get it back up online. It hurts that pipeline and we can't use it. 
   This wonderful gift of a pipeline will be actually gone. You want to talk about use it or lose it, that's the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. We have to use it. 
   Here is the great story, and here is the great answer, Mr. Speaker. The fact is in the 1002 area, the 2,000 acres in ANWR where we believe there is over 10 billion barrels of oil, this is just 74 miles away from the pipeline. It's the exact same terrain, completely frozen ground. Nine months of the year it is under snow and ice, 3 months of the year complete darkness. All we do is we build 74 miles of pipeline, and we have access to over 10 billion barrels of oil. Overnight we increase American reserves by over 50 percent. That's an answer, Congressman Latta.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. That is what is absolutely amazing that we saw, is that no roads are built to get into ANWR to do the drilling. The roads that do go to put in the oil rig are ice roads. Those roads go in the dark of winter when it is freezing. Bulldozers build ice roads out to where the rig is going to be set. The oil rig is set, and as Congressman Latta said, what formerly used to take 20 acres of a pad site to put a drill down, now because of technological advances has been reduced down to 6 acres of land. But if you look at underneath the earth with the directional drilling that is able to be accomplished now, literally we can go out 8 miles. 
   It is absolutely phenomenal what we are able to accomplish now, what the oil industry is able to accomplish now, to be able to give us American energy independence. Let's not forget what we are talking about, American energy independence. 
   We are looking at $4 a gallon gasoline right now. 
   This is incredible. This Chamber should be filled with Members of Congress. Unfortunately, and I don't know what the camera shows, but the Chamber is completely empty. Except for you and I, Congressman Latta, we are  the only Members of Congress, as well as the Speaker. No offense extended to the Speaker. There is no more important issue right now for the American people. 
   When we are at $4 a gallon gas, and when we have the capability of being at $2 a gallon gas, it is criminal to not allow the American people to be there. 
   How do I know it is possible? We know from the seismic studies that have been done that there are over 10.5 billion barrels in the ANWR region in very close proximity to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. 
   Also, I sit on the Committee on Financial Services. Last week Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman said to us regarding gas prices, he said that a 1 percent increase in supply could lower prices by as much as 10 percent. 
   Now what was the figure that we were told when drilling first started out in Prudhoe Bay, it was 2.1 million barrels per day. We are down to 700,000 barrels a day. We are able to increase another 1.4 million barrels a day. That's the capacity that we could increase, well over a 1 percent increase. 
   So instead of seeing prices fall by as much as 10 percent, we could be looking at a price fall by as much as 20 percent. Perhaps, Congressman Latta, what we should do is talk about the timeline. There have been a lot of fallacies stated, false information stating that there are 68 million acres of land that is being leased that is idle that the oil companies are currently not using under use-it-or-lose-it policies. That is a fact that we found out on this fact-finding mission, the fact that that is a completely false statement. It is an urban legend. 
   There is not one acre of land, Mr. Speaker, that has been leased that is currently not in the production or exploration stage because Congress again is at fault here. It is not companies, it is not consumers that are consuming too much oil, it is Congress. Congress created 10 years of an artificial delay period in the permitting, and they created in that 10-year period 11 different points of entries when nuisance lawsuits can be filed to stop the production of oil. 
   Do you remember the length of time that one lawsuit languished in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals?

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Also the native Alaskans as well, the native Alaskans that live up in the little villages. There is one little village up in ANWR that has less than 300 people. The native Alaskans that live in that village that are subsistence people. They live off of whale, they eat the caribou that they hunt, they want the drilling to start as well. 
   Why? Because they want to become greedy and wealthy? No, because they have seen, to their neighbors just to the immediate west of them in the Prudhoe Bay region, that this drilling that has occurred has been done in an environmentally safe and sensitive way. In fact, so much so, remember when we were going along up in Prudhoe Bay, we saw trucks, and we asked, what is that little plastic, it looks like a little plastic Barbie doll swimming pool that's underneath the trucks. 
   And we were told so strict are the environmental regulations in Alaska, the strictest environmental regulations in the entire country, they are so strict, that if a truck travels from point A to point B, as soon as the truck stops, the driver has to get out and take what's called a duck pond or a diaper. He slips this underneath the truck so in case even 1 drop of oil comes out of a crank case, they are so careful, that they don't want even one drop of oil to touch the tundra. That's how careful they are. 
   You don't see industrial waste. You don't see pools of oil. You don't see refuse lying about. You don't see excessive humans walking around with the pipelines. You see a very tiny footprint, and that's in the old area of oil drilling. With a new area of oil drilling, it is very difficult to even spot from the air a new pipeline, because a rig comes up out of the ground and a green house is literally, a little tiny casing, is put over that pipeline. There is very, very little impact on that region. 
   As Congressman Latta stated accurately, we did not see wildlife. We were 2 hours in the air flying over the National Petroleum Reserve, flying over Prudhoe Bay and then flying over the ANWR region. In that 2-hour time span, we did not see wildlife over in the ANWR area. We were straining to find Dall sheep, straining to see musk ox, straining to see caribou, looking for wildlife. Where did we see the wildlife? Just as Congressman Latta said, we saw it at mile marker zero, where the most activity was. 
   You know, it's interesting, caribou must be a lot like people. They like to be where the action is. We like to be where the action is. The caribou wanted to be where the action was. It was a great story.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. The polar bear. We were told polar bears like to be around the buildings. For one thing they like to eat people. They are very aggressive creatures. We were told they had spotted a polar bear that had gone underneath the buildings, because the buildings don't have a regular foundation the way that houses do in the lower 48, because, again, it's all permafrost. It is consistently frozen land up there. 
   As a matter of fact, I am a hardy Minnesotan girl. Even as a hardy Minnesotan, this is the warmest time of the year. I took my down parka with me with Gore-Tex, and I was grateful that I had forgotten my mittens that I stuffed in my parka last winter. 
   I put my mittens on, I had my woolly parka on. I had my socks on, and I was happy to have it. This was the warmest time of the year. 
   You couldn't find a more perfect piece of territory to drill upon. To think that we have this gift in a very compact area next to the pipeline that's already built, and we can so quickly, if we would fast track all the permitting process, we could literally, within 3 years, have the oil pumping and in the pipeline down here in the lower 48, and we would increase American energy reserves by 50 percent. That's a deal that I don't know why we would turn it down.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Oh, there were no trees up there. I worked for my uncle up in Alaska when I was in college. I was in the Aleutian chain, which is in the southern part of Alaska. There were no trees there. 
   We were here north of the Arctic circle. We touched other little toes up here actually in the Arctic Ocean. There are no trees up there, the mountain ranges that you see, as Congressman Latta said, the Brooks Range, it is, it was all granite. There were no trees. 
   But the area we were in was the coastal plain, the perfect area for drilling. So we have the National Petroleum Reserve, Prudhoe Bay, the Arctic refuge, this has been a gift for our country. 
   Remember, we cannot forget that this is a key to making America energy independent, not dependent upon OPEC for oil, not dependent on Huge Chavez for oil. We don't want to continue to send all of our American dollars and wealth overseas to make dictators happy and rich. 
   What do we need? What could we do? We could keep that money here. 
   Do you remember when we talked about jobs? I know your area in Ohio has suffered terribly from job loss. There is job loss in the State of Michigan. Many areas of the country right now are suffering with job loss. 
   Do you know what we heard up here in Prudhoe Bay where the oil drilling is occurring, that workers make over six figures, over $100,000 a year. No one actually lives in Prudhoe Bay, they come in for 2 weeks at a time, and then they leave and they go home for 2 weeks at a time. They have health care benefits. They make over $100,000 a year. They work 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off. 
   We were told that if we would open up this ANWR region for drilling, and if we would also be looking at Colorado to open that area up, we would be looking at over 750,000 jobs, American jobs, where the American economy would be stimulated, Americans could be making over $100,000 a year. 
   Why in the world, why in the world would anyone possibly not want to open up for the American people, not only energy reserves that could bring the price of energy down to less than $2 of a gallon of gas, but also to provide jobs. Wouldn't people in Ohio, in the great State of Ohio, want jobs at over $100,000?

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Well the Governor of Alaska says let's tap into that natural gas. We have the oil pipeline that's currently under way. But you can't put natural gas into a crude oil pipeline. They need to build a natural-gas pipeline that would run fairly parallel. 
   Every day, I believe it's well over 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas is extracted from the earth when the oil comes up. The great thing that the companies have been able to do is to take that natural gas and pump it back into the earth. The compression, I believe, from the natural gas, has forced more oil up. That's part of the reason why we have seen so much more yield from the Prudhoe Bay. 
   Without that advance in technology, we wouldn't have the tremendous abundance that we have had. This is really sobering news. Again, remember, when Prudhoe Bay was first opened up 31 years ago, it was the largest oil field in the United States. Oil fields don't get larger, they only deplete. After 31 years, it is still the largest oil field in the United States. 
   Knowing that, we have adjacent to this field the Arctic refuge, or the ANWR region 1002 which, again, president Jimmy Carter set aside specifically for the purpose of drilling for this oil and getting it back down for the American people, the American economy, and America's national security. Because whoever controls fuel controls your freedom. 
   If Hugo Chavez and Middle East dictators and OPEC control America's fuel, then Hugo Chavez and OPEC dictators control America's freedom. I know that you don't want to have dictators controlling America's freedom. I don't. I don't want that for the people of Minnesota.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. A much larger footprint over here, a much larger environmental impact. The one thing we do know, the southern part of the petroleum reserve, there is about 2 percent of oil down there. About 2 percent of the area in the Southern part of the National Petroleum Reserve holds oil. 
   So, again, the lie that we hear from other quarters state that, well, we just have land that's idle, that the oil companies aren't exploring on. Well, would you explore somewhere where there is no oil? I mean, just think of that. 
   Where do young boys go to look for chicks? They go where the chicks are. You know, you go where you can have your best yield. Oil companies go where they can find their best yield.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. The other key point that we don't want to fail to remember is that when we went on our American energy tour, the purpose was to talk to the American people about our all-of-the-above strategy, the fact that we believe in conservation. We need more conservation of energy in this country, and Congressman Latta had talked about the wonderful new designs at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory where buildings can be designed to literally use zero energy. 
   I know it's hard to believe, but if you reorient the building, and if you use solar panels, there are amazing things that can be done now where buildings can actually get to the point of using zero energy. These are all techniques and great new breakthrough technologies that America can use to become energy independent. 
   Conservation is real. We can embrace conservation. We can also embrace renewable energy. The breakthroughs right now that are happening with wind energy are overwhelming. 
   We also saw all of testing that is being done with solar energy. I was particularly intrigued by shingles that are on houses now, shingles that are actually solar collectors.     
   All of this work is being done at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. So renewables is one of the legs of our three-legged stool. Conservation is one of the legs on our three-legged stool. But we do not, a stool won't stand up without that third leg. Right now the third leg that is the most key that we need to focus on, we have to focus on all three at the same time, an abundance of increase in American energy supply. And we have got it. We have oil in the Outer Continental Shelf, over 88 billion barrels. We have over 10 billion barrels in the ANWR region. We have about 2 trillion barrels worth of oil in the oil shale region, and we have nuclear.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. And, Congressman Latta, we all know that school is going on come up. Kids don't like to talk about the fact that school is going to come because it is still July. But there was an article last week in Minnesota, I believe it was in the St. Paul Pioneer Press newspaper, and it said this. It said that parents are looking at ratcheting back, not buying backpacks, not buying back to school clothes, not buying new protractors, pencils, because they just feel that they can't afford it, and, in fact, can't afford it. 
   Now there is something wrong, Mr. Speaker, when the American people feel so squeezed that they don't feel they can buy their child a new backpack. This isn't funny anymore. This is a very serious issue. 
   And I will tell you what, in the State of Minnesota, you don't have an option not to turn your furnace on come October. You just don't have that option.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Why is it, Congressman Latta, we are the only country in the world that has made it illegal to access the answer to our problem, our own U.S. American energy supplies? Every day of the week we hear buy American, buy American. We are here saying buy American, buy American energy reserves. We have got them everywhere. Why aren't we buying American energy reserves? 
   But you know what really makes me mad? Congressman Latta, when I hear people say that Democrats don't have an energy plan. That makes me mad, because they have an energy plan and it is loud and clear and they stated it themselves just a week ago. Do you remember what it was?

   Mrs. BACHMANN. We have colleges in my State now that are revamping their schedules to cut off one more day of class time for kids. And we have local public schools, K through 12, that have decided they are going to cut off a school day because they need to reduce the energy consumption for school districts. Can you imagine that? The parents that have enough of a burden with their own energy prices that are going up, now they may have little children that will be sitting at home all day. Mom has to go to work, Dad has to go to work. 
   These kids are going to be sitting home all day. Think of that. Think of the implication when this is a problem that has been created by Congress. And it is all inertia here. Again, lack of energy in the United States Congress because unfortunately, the Democratic-controlled Congress has decided we are all supposed to put wind sails on top of our small cars and somehow that is going to get us to where we need to go for American energy independence. 
   Not the people of the Sixth District of Minnesota, no way, no how. Because they are smarter than that there. The people in the Sixth District of Minnesota are pretty bright people, and they realize that we are a ``can do'' country, and it is time we do some ``can doing'' around in place and increase American energy reserves.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. And what are we supposed to do with the airline industry? Put solar panels on the outside of airplanes and hope for the best, hope that a cloud doesn't come, hope that the sun doesn't go down? We have got to figure out some way to fly airplanes. 
   I had employees from Northwest Airlines in my office because Northwest has to layoff--it is a great airline in Minnesota. And, Mr. Speaker, these Northwest employees told me 2,500 employees will be laid off, 2,500 employees. Think of what that is going to mean for the economy in the State of Minnesota. 
   And then look at the airline announcement with United Airlines, with American Airlines, with Delta Airlines. We are, the United States Congress is personally responsible, I believe. Because of the negligent policies that this Congress has made to make it illegal to access American energy, they are responsible for spiking up the cost of energy so much that Congress, the Democrat-controlled Congress is responsible for seeing these airline companies go belly up. 
   2,500 employees losing their jobs in the State of Minnesota. Where is this going to end? 
   If we don't increase American energy supply, if we won't build new refineries, if we won't find new natural gas to liquid, where are we going to go to fly our airplanes to keep our economy going?

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Can you imagine a hospital, for instance? People that are in hospitals who require that 24-hour round the clock care, hospitals routinely have generators as back ups. But you know, generators have to run on something too. They need usually oil or they need some sort of a product that they run on. 
   If we can't produce more energy and also, if the electric grid, this is another very serious issue that we have seen brownouts and blackouts that have occurred across the United States. 
   We are not increasing transmission lines. We have taken--it is almost hard for me to believe how the United States Congress has taken a none of the above strategy. And the one thing that I saw on our American energy tour last weekend, Congressman Latta, is that the House Republicans had embraced an all of the above. We want all energy from wherever it comes from, we want to site new transmission lines, new pipelines, open up American energy production. We want all of the above. And all we have seen out of Congress is none of the above.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Congressman Latta, what was gas when you and I took office? For me it was $2 and change. What has happened? Seventy-six percent increase just in the last year and a half. What happened? 
   The signal was sent to the American people that absolutely nothing will be done. In fact, unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi said herself she has no intention to allow a vote to drill, no intention. Their intention is pretty clear. They are not going to drill. 
   That is not what I heard from the Republican conference. I heard the Republican conference say all of the above. Not only do we want to drill, we want wind, we want solar, we want bio fuels, we want renewables, we want to have a conservation. We want it all because America needs it all.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. What good is it going to do, Congressman Latta, if people don't have jobs? Because company after company, this is no joke.  Companies are facing very severe complications on their bottom line because they can't afford the energy. They can't do it. And buying a carbon credit isn't going to solve this. We have got to have more real energy to power the real needs America needs to have. We never would have had the American prosperity that we enjoy today without affordable, accessible, reliable energy. Energy is a good thing. Oil, gas, coal, these aren't evils. These have been building blocks that have given us this greater country that the world has ever known. To take away these energy building blocks is to take away freedom and to take away prosperity, to take away the greatness of our Nation.     
   We need this not just for our generation. We need this for the next generation--for my five kids, for your kids. This is very important. What kind of a country are we going to hand off to our kids? Sorry. We're turning the lights off. You're on your own.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, too often we heard about the negatives of America's teenagers, but today I rise to congratulate the work of a wonderful young accomplished woman from my district, the Sixth District in Minnesota. Her name, Mr. Speaker, is Ann Miron of Hugo, Minnesota. She is a very accomplished young woman, representing the next generation of American dairy farmers, being an American dairy farmer herself at age 19. 
   She descends from a long line of Minnesota dairy farmers, living on a country dairy farm, and she was just recently crowned Princess Kay of the Milky Way. In Minnesota, this is a pretty big deal at the county fair. She was crowned Princess Kay, and Ann Miron will begin a year of speaking and promoting Minnesota area dairy farms. 
   I am privileged to represent the area with the largest number of dairy farms in the State of Minnesota, and even more privileged to have married a dairy farmer myself. 
   Ann, I join your great parents, Mayor Fran Miron of Hugo, Minnesota, Mary Ann Miron, and the people of Minnesota to wish you a wonderful year promoting dairy farming in the State of Minnesota.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (REPUBLICAN FRESHMEN THIRD QUARTERLY REPORT TO THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the great State of California, Congressman McCarthy. What a wonderful leadership role he is playing with our freshmen class. 
   It is true, Mr. Speaker, we are so grateful, as freshmen Members, to be here with new ideas and a new perspective. Part of that perspective is a positive outlook on life and a positive outlook on our country. One thing about Americans, Mr. Speaker, is we tend to be happy people, go-getter people, people that have ideas, innovation. We are entrepreneurs. We always look over the next hill. We always look for the next goal. We are forward-looking people. 
   One thing that I have been a little dismayed about in my time here in the Congress is I have heard so much negativity on the floor. As a matter of fact, in the previous Special Order, I was amazed at the level of negativity that I heard. That is not representative of the American people. It certainly is not representative of the people of the Sixth District of the State of Minnesota. They are positive people that are looking, as we Republican freshmen are looking, at new ideas, at fresh perspectives. 
   I was so intrigued this weekend when I was home in my district, I had the chance to read the Sunday paper. I found an article in that paper that talked about the incredible progress we have made in recent years. So much of that has to do, Mr. Speaker, with a lot of the very good decisions that were made in the previous Congresses, particularly, Mr. Speaker, the tax cuts that were passed in 2001, 2003. I say that because I am a Federal tax litigation attorney. I hate high taxation. If you speak with most Americans, they also detest high levels of taxation. One thing that the Congress did so well was to reduce that level in 2001 and in 2003. The one thing we don't want to see happen is to have the country take a dramatic turn now under the Democrat controlled House of Representatives and embrace tax increases. This really concerns us because what we have seen so far is the Democrats are now embracing what, you know, the argument is, will it be the largest or the second largest tax increase in American history? Whatever, it is a very large tax increase. But what the other formula for success has brought about, Mr. Speaker, is prosperity.     
   Prosperity not just for those who are the high income earners, not even just the middle income earners. We have seen tremendous levels of prosperity, even for those who we would consider the poor among us, who government considers the poor among us, and if there is anyone who deserves help up, a hand up, it is the poorest among us. 
   In this article I read this weekend, it is really a scorecard of sorts on the Republicans and the great tax cuts that they put through this Congress, and it is very good news. 
   If you dig into the numbers, as this author writes, his name is Jason Lewis, he is a writer from the Twin Cities, and I want to quote from this article, he writes, ``We now have a record number of Americans with health insurance.'' 
   I will tell you what. You would never know that, listening to people speak on the floor of this House. You would think everyone is destitute and no one has health insurance. We are at an all-time high in this country with the number of people that have health insurance. 
   The doom-and-gloom focus says that most of those people who do not have health insurance currently live in households with incomes that are in excess of $50,000 a year. So even the people who don't have health insurance in the United States are making over $50,000 a year. In fact, many of them  today are eligible for government healthcare programs. They have just simply decided or elected not to enroll in those programs. 
   The median household income, more good news is that adjusted for inflation, the median household income today has risen in 2006 to over $48,451 nationwide, and in the Twin Cities in Minnesota, median household income today is at a robust $62,223. 
   This is great news. We should be talking about this great news. And how did we get to this level of prosperity? It is because of the tax cuts that came in 2001 and 2003, and that great investment is now paying off. 
   Surprisingly, in August, the figures show the first significant drop in poverty in a decade. This is great news. Shout it from the housetop, which we are. This is the ``big House.'' We are shouting it. The official rate declined from 12.6 percent in 2005 down to 12.3 percent. That is great. We want to reduce the level of poverty in the United States. 
   The Federal tax cuts of 2003 gave us an economy that added $1.3 trillion in real output. We have grown more than 3 percent annually, according to Investors Business Daily. 
   Business spending, way up, adding 8 million new jobs to this economy. Real labor compensation per hour has rebounded, because now wages have advanced 3.9 percent from a year ago. 
   Those are statistics. But it really means things for American families. As a woman, as a wife, as a mother of five children, we have raised over 23 foster children, I will tell you what: When your wage goes up, that means you can afford to pay the light bill at the end of the month. You can afford to have groceries. You can take your kids and buy them the clothes that they need for school. You can pay for the field trips they have to go on. And you can pay for all the sports activities that they love to do after school. 
   These are real benefits, when government doesn't have that money, when normal real people have this money. That is what we want, to have all households have that money, and the poorest families are the ones that need to benefit even the most. 
   Mr. Speaker, even with the slight decline in job creation in August, the Nation's unemployment rate remained in record low territory of 4.6 percent. Great news. Great news for today. 
   Robert Rector also just came out for the Heritage Foundation, and he told us among the households considered poor in our country, of those households that we call poor, 46 percent of those households in America, almost half actually own their own home. That is something that we don't always understand, that almost half of all poor people in this country own a home. If you own a home, Mr. Speaker, that is your greatest down payment on the next generation and on wealth creation. 
   Most people that are considered poor by our government own a car. In fact, of people considered poor, 31 percent of poor households own two or more cars. That is great, and we want to keep prosperity going for the poor. 
   Seventy-eight percent of those who are considered poor by the government have a DVD player or have a VCR player. In fact, 62 percent have cable or satellite TV. One-third of poor households have both cell phones and land line phones. And a stunning 80 percent have air conditioning. This is really good news, significant, because as recently as 1970, and I remember this, only 36 percent of all American households had air conditioning. 
   My family wasn't one of those. So I am grateful that today 80 percent of the people that even the government considers poor today have air conditioning. This is great news that we have. 
   In fact, the study said that 89 percent of poor families themselves, and this is very important, say that they have enough food. Boy, if there is any measure of poor, it is, are you hungry? No one wants to see one child, one older person, anyone go hungry in this country. Eight-nine percent of people who themselves are categorized as poor say that that they have enough food. Only 2 percent of that category say that they don't. 
   That isn't to say, Mr. Speaker, that there are not serious problems for those who live below the poverty line. Trust me. The foster children that we took into our home, they were categorized in this category. There are needs aplenty for those who are below the poverty line. We need to address those needs. 
   That being said, there is good news out there. Let's celebrate the fact that Census Bureau figures don't even include when they categorize people that are poor the value of non-cash benefits. So if you are poor, the government doesn't even include the fact of the amount of money you receive in food stamps. They don't include the amount you receive in housing subsidies, in Medicaid, or even the Earned Income Tax Credit. That is to say, and this again is good news, that the gap between the poor and average households is even smaller than sometimes what it is stated to be. 
   That being said, we are now at a juncture, Mr. Speaker, when we are looking at a turn. I know my colleagues that are also going to be speaking in the freshman class are going to be talking about this turn. 
   I will end on this note, because I gave a lot of great news. The negative news that we are looking at is that so far in this Congress, the Democrat majority in the House has passed their budget, and their budget included, again, the largest, or however you want to parse it, the second largest tax increase in American history. I just want to say that for the people of my district and the people for your district, they will probably have to be paying an additional $3,000 a year for every average American family, and that will negatively impact the poorest among us the most. 
   So we have two choices in front of us: Do we want to continue with lower taxes and prosperity, where the poorest among us have seen actually tangible benefits? Or do we want to take the route that the Democrats have proposed, and increase taxes knowingly $3,000 a year on my family, on your family, on families in our districts? I can't abide by that, especially for the low-income families in my district. 
   With that, I say let's do what our founders would want us to do, and that is to embrace hope, prosperity, new ideas and a fresh perspective. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield back to the kind gentleman from California, Congressman McCarthy.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON S. 294, PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank my colleague from Nevada (Mr. Heller) for his leadership on buying American, especially as it relates to American energy sources. 
   I also thank the Speaker, as well, for this 5 minutes. It is important, Madam Speaker, that we do buy American, especially American energy. 
   Part of the problem that we have had for the last 31 years is that the United States, specifically the United States Congress, has almost made it a decided decision not to purchase American energy. 
   How do I say this? 
   I have a voting record in front of me, Madam Speaker, and it says this: When the votes have come on this floor to purchase American energy, this is how the votes have gone over purchasing oil and exploring for oil up in the ANWR region, where Mr. Heller and myself were this weekend. Republicans voted over 90 percent of the time to buy American, yes, American energy in the ANWR region. Democrats, unfortunately, Madam Speaker, voted ``no'' to buy American 85 percent of the time. 
   When you look at purchasing American energy, Madam Speaker, through the coal-to-liquid program, Americans voted almost 100 percent of the time to buy American. Democrats voted ``no'' almost 80 percent of the time to buy American on coal-to-liquid fuels. 
   On oil shale exploration, purchasing American energy through this tremendous resource of oil shale exploration of which America is the Saudi Arabia of the world in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, Republicans voted ``yes'' 90 percent of the time, while Democrats voted ``no'' to buying American 85 percent of the time.     
   Sounds like we're on a roll. Sounds like we're on a trend. 
   Well, unfortunately, Madam Speaker, the Outer Continental Shelf exploration, Republicans also voted ``yes'' to buy American oil and American natural gas over 80 percent of the time while our Democratic colleagues across the aisle voted ``no'' 80 percent of the time to buy American energy. 
   To purchase American energy, Madam Speaker, to increase refinery capacity--this is a crucial issue in our energy capacity--Republicans voted ``yes'' to buy American energy from refineries almost 100 percent of the time while Democrats voted ``no'' on increasing energy capacity with refineries 95 percent of the time. 
   I know it's hard to believe and hard to understand, but there has really been a very clear divide over energy policy in our country over the last 30 years. And unfortunately, our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle have made a very clear and distinct decision, and it has been this: No new energy exploration in the United States. They have been very clear about this. They don't want to increase energy exploration in the United States. We need to. 
   And we aren't choosing just oil, just natural gas, just coal; we want to say ``yes'' to wind, to solar, to biofuels, to nuclear power, to all of the above. We have to say ``yes'' to all of the above or America will find itself at an energy deficit. 
   I know the people that I serve, Madam Speaker, in the Sixth Congressional District in Minnesota are feeling that squeeze right now. I checked today in Minnesota, the average price of regular unleaded gas is $3.86 a gallon. It's something more than that nationally. But I will tell you the people in Minnesota, especially the people who are living on the margins, are feeling the pain right now of these price increases. 
   But a wonderful story that Congressman Heller and I learned when we were on the all-of-the-above exploratory tool is that we have great answers here in the United States. The good news, Madam Speaker, is that we do not have an energy deficit in the United States. We do not suffer from a lack of resources. We have 27 percent of all of the world's coal in the United States. We have 2 trillion barrels of oil just in the United States. We have 88 billion barrels, conservatively speaking, in the Outer Continental Shelf, over 10 billion barrels in ANWR, and also 10 billion barrels near my home State in the Bakken Oil Reserve. We have energy in abundance in the United States. The problem is that Congress has said ``no.'' 
   So what is standing between $2 gasoline and the American people, Madam Speaker, especially American-made energy? It's the United States Congress. It isn't the companies that have been bad guys or that the American people have been bad guys for using too much energy; it's the United States Congress, and unfortunately, the Democrat-controlled United States Congress that it's made a clear decision that they don't want to increase American energy. This is nonsense. 
   Both Congressman Heller and I learned together this weekend that we have the resources, we have them available, which is why we need to buy American energy now.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON S. 294, PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank my colleague, Mr. Heller. 
   I am so grateful that the majority brought this issue up of use-it-or-lose-it because this is something that the American people have been subjected to now for the last couple of weeks, this canard, that there are 68 million acres, and they somehow want the American people to believe that companies are risking their capital on leases that they're not using. 
   And what I challenge the majority to do is produce even one lease, even one lease in the U.S. where there is an acre of land that has been leased that is not in some stage of production or exploration. Not one. We haven't seen proof of even one lease where a company has bid for that lease and that lease is not in some stage of either production or exploration. 
   Again, let's look at Congress and Congress' complicity in this area because Congress has set artificial timelines, delayed timelines, for permitting. The leases are 10 years' long, and there are no less than 11 different stop points in that 10-year lease period where private parties can file lawsuits to stop the drilling. So, if a lawsuit is filed, for instance, by Friends of the Earth, by Sierra Club, by Earth Justice, the oil company, or whatever business it is, has to respond to the lawsuit. The lawsuit will end up in Federal district court. Then it may get kicked up to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. There's one case where a decision wasn't rendered for 2 years. Well, who made that scenario? The United States Congress. 
   The companies have bid on these leases. They've put money down on the barrel head to actually lease the land. They've got a 10-year timeline that Congress has given them, and there are artificial delays built in for the permitting and also 11 different points for private lawsuits to be filed. So those delays, again, are ones that Congress has allowed to occur. 
   There aren't companies that are sitting or dallying on a lease. I challenge this majority to produce even one, even one lease on even just 1 acre, where a company has a lease and they're not in some stage that Congress created of either producing or exploring on the land. Let alone defying any common sense of any businessman or -woman who puts their money on the line, their capital, they're not going to dissipate capital. 
   But you will hear the Democrat majority, Madam Speaker, rant and rail that there're somehow dilatory companies out there that are sitting on leases. They haven't produced one, they haven't shown one example that they can parade around this Chamber where a company is not producing on the land. It's just a patently false statement and, in fact, one that shouldn't be used. 
   I tell you, the real use-it-or-lose-it, Madam Speaker, it's this. When Congressman Heller and I were recently up in ANWR this weekend, we learned a very sobering fact, and the sobering fact is this. Thirty-one years ago, the largest oil field in the United States was up in the North Slope of Alaska, Prudhoe Bay. Today, the largest oil field in the United States remains up in Prudhoe Bay. 
   This Congress has made a decision not to increase its oil fields. When the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was built in Alaska in the mid seventies, when oil production first began, 2.1 million barrels a day was flowing through that 800 miles of pipeline, 2.1 million barrels a day. Do you know what that is today, Madam Speaker? We are now down to 700,000 barrels a day flowing through that pipeline, 700,000 barrels a day. We have diminished by more than half the amount of oil that we are sending down to the lower 48 from that wonderful energy lifeline in Alaska. 
   Here's the sobering news, Madam Speaker. We learned this weekend that once we get down to 300,000 barrels a day flowing through that pipeline, the pipeline won't work anymore. This pipeline is a marvel of modern human engineering, a marvel. It's an incredibly valuable asset. I was told this weekend, Madam Speaker, that if we had to rebuild that pipeline today, we could be looking at a $15 billion investment. 
   What's the window of opportunity that we have? If we don't open up new oil fields, potentially within 10 years' time, that pipeline will be of no use to us because what we were told is, if you don't use it, you lose it.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank my colleague for that additional minute. 
   I just want to conclude by saying this. If you want to talk about a real use-it-or-lose-it, Madam Speaker, you're talking about one of the most valuable resources we have. It is the American energy lifeline that runs through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline that brings the valuable oil down to the lower 48. If we lose this pipeline, and if we lose it on this Democrat-controlled Congress' watch, we will lose our lifeline for any future oil development, which is all the more reason why we need to begin drilling here in the United States so we can buy American energy and buy it now. 
   If we fast track the permitting, if we pull out all of the unnecessary lawsuits, we could literally within just a few years' time build a 74-mile spur into ANWR, get that oil down to the United States, and increase American energy reserves by 50 percent. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding that time.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for a happy occasion to congratulate the St. Cloud Cathedral High School Crusaders for winning the Class 2A High School Baseball Tournament Championship in Minnesota. 
   This was a thrill, Mr. Speaker, when the Crusaders came from behind in the final inning, in a most dramatic 7-6 victory over the great students from Glencoe-Silver Lake. It doesn't get much better than this in Minnesota, Mr. Speaker. 
   The championship is a long tradition of success for the Cathedral students. And over the course of 13 State appearances, the Crusaders have come a way with six State titles. 
   This continued success of the program for the Cathedral Crusaders is no doubt due to the steady leadership of the head coach, Mr. Bob Karn who, in his 37 seasons of coaching the Crusaders, brought his team once more to a great victory. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that this body would join me in congratulating Coach Karn and the Cathedral Crusaders on their Class 2A State Baseball Championship.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentleman from Indiana for yielding, and I hear the frustration that is in your voice, because you are echoing the frustration that the American people are feeling all over this country. Right now, they are taking their pencils and breaking them, they are taking their shoe and throwing it across the room, because they can't believe that for the 21 months that the Democrats have held the gavel in this Chamber, they have only now tonight, for the first time in 21 months, had the guts to put on this floor their ``commonsense energy plan.'' 
   From what we know of this bill so far, this ``commonsense energy plan'' doesn't have a lot of energy in it. If you take about 80 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf and make it illegal, permanently off limits to energy production, how can you with a straight face before the American people say that you want to get serious about solving this problem? 
   This isn't a bill. As our colleague Representative Shadegg said, this is a charade purported upon the American people. So what we are saying is, whose side are you on? Whose side are you on? Do you want a pro-American energy bill? That is what we want. We want to be truly energy independent. 
   I want to piggyback back on what Representative Shadegg said. He talked about the lawsuits that have been filed. Every single lease that has come up for sale has had a lawsuit filed. 
   I just want you to know, in my district we have the longest-running unfinished bridge project in the history of the United States of America. Why? Because we have lawsuits filed by the Sierra Club. We still don't have a bridge coming on line, because the Sierra Club now has run up the tab so that people in my district will be paying over $400 million to build a bridge because we have lawsuits filed against this bridge. 
   Why do we even allow lawsuits at all? If the United States Government certifies that land is available for leasing, shouldn't the United States Government certify that this land should be truly available for leasing? We don't need these outside groups to come in and file these lawsuits, because, after all, if there is a problem with the environment, if there is a problem with laws being violated, don't we have the Minerals Management Service that could issue a fine, that could issue a temporary restraining order, that could prohibit that company from drilling at all and pull that lease back? Certainly they could. 
   Why do we allow these leases at all? We are in a serious situation in this country. We just saw financial firms, Bear Stearns has had a problem. They have needed a government bailout. We have seen Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac. They needed the Federal government to come in and take them over. Just this week, Lehman Brothers is filing bankruptcy. We are seeing Morgan Stanley being 
   bought out by Bank of America. 
   What are the American people worried about tonight, Mr. Speaker? They are worried about if they are going to have a job tomorrow morning. They are worried if they will have enough money in their bank account to put gas in the tank so they can go to their job. This is serious, Mr. Speaker. This is no joke. That is why I think this is an insult to the American people. 
   This is 290-some pages, as the gentleman from Indiana said. But this is a joke on the American people. If this won't produce one drop of oil, then why are we wasting our time? 
   Let's face it: We have got now nine days before adjournment, nine days before the end of the year. Nine days. So we are going to, what, dance around a little bit and have a charade a little bit? We don't even know if we can file an amendment on this bill. We don't even know what we will be allowed to do. 
   But the one thing I guarantee, Mr. Speaker, is we will not remain silent. For the next nine days, the Republicans in the House on this floor will not remain silent before the American people, because we are going to tell the truth. We are going to tell the truth that under the last 21 months of Democrat-controlled Congress, we have seen post offices renamed. We have seen Federal buildings renamed. In fact, we have seen monkeys saved from being transported across State lines. We have even seen $25 million of American taxpayer money go to foreign countries in the form of foreign aid to pay for foreign cats and foreign dogs. We have seen this come off of the floor of this body. 
   But only tonight, at a quarter to 10, did we see an energy bill come before this body, which we believe will not produce one drop of energy, while the American people tonight are paying $4 a gallon for gasoline. If we don't get serious and really produce energy, come this November, the American people are going to have a choice: Do they want to pay $2 a gallon for gasoline under a commonsense Republican plan, or do they want to pay $6 or $8 or $10 a gallon for gasoline? That will be the reality, because under a President Obama, we won't have drilling, and under a Democrat-controlled Congress, we know we won't have drilling. That is the choice before the American people, Mr. Speaker: $2 a gallon for gasoline, or $6 or $8 or $10. 
   That is why I am so grateful to the gentleman from Indiana tonight, because he has pegged it. He has pegged it. He has said that this bill is nothing more than an insult to the American people. And that is why we are here tonight, as the precursor for the debate that will occur tomorrow.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, I want to bring before the body this morning an issue that needs more attention, not less, and that is the issue of the huge blob that ate the American Dream called the alternative minimum tax. One thing that we are seeing is that the alternative minimum tax, Madam Speaker, is set to rise at a level so unprecedented that the American economy has not experienced anything like this in the last 40 years. 
   Right now, the tax burden for the average American and to the economy is about 18.5 percent of GDP. If we don't scale back on the alternative minimum tax, we are looking at the tax burden of GDP being almost 24 percent by mid-century. We have never seen this level of taxation in our GDP. This means this money will come out of the pockets of the American taxpayer and will go into the coffers of the Federal Government. 
   This is a big concern, Madam Speaker, one that I am very concerned about, as I know most of the Members in this Chamber are as well. 
   In 1969, when the alternative minimum tax came in, it was 155 people. I will close with the fact that this year we are looking at 23 million Americans impacted.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (DEMOCRATS RAISE TAXES AFTER ONLY TWO WEEKS IN POWER -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, on the first day that Republicans took control of the Congress in 1995, one of their very first actions was to establish a rule that required a supermajority, or three-fifths vote, to raise taxes. This was a good thing, Madam Speaker. On the very first day of Congress in 2007, however, the Democrats established new rules in this Chamber to make it easier to raise taxes with a simple majority vote. 
   And now, after just 2 weeks in power, the Democrats, our colleagues, have already passed legislation today to raise taxes. What is worse, the taxes that are collected under this new bill will not be going toward deficit reduction or toward paying down the Federal debt. The money is going to be set aside in a special account for more spending. 
   In Minnesota, we had a phrase when we were in session. We said, hold on to your wallets. And we can say that to the American people right now. 
   As a Federal tax litigation attorney myself, as a small business owner with my husband Marcus, and as a mother to Lucas, Harrison, Elisa, Caroline, and Sophia, and our 23 foster children, I can tell you as a parent the best way to grow an economy, the best way to raise more jobs is not to raise taxes but to let people, families, keep more of their hard-earned money. 
   In 2003, tax relief was passed, and the great thing is that 7.2 million jobs were created. In fact, our economy has been adding jobs for 40 straight months. The unemployment rate is incredibly low, at 4.5 percent, well below the average of the last 40 years. 
   Nowhere are the results more evident, Madam Speaker, than in my home State of Minnesota, which has closed out the calendar year with 54,000 more jobs than at the end of 2005, the strongest job growth since 1999. Our State's annual job growth rate of 2 percent has outpaced the national rate of 1.4 percent. Our unemployment rate is the envy of the Nation, phenomenally low at 4.2 percent. 
   Meanwhile, tax revenues are absolutely surging into the Treasury. Guess what? Federal receipts rose 14 percent in 2005, 11 percent in 2006, and they kept rising by 9 percent the first 2 months of 2007. These are the highest consecutive revenue increases in the past 25 years. 
   America, did you hear that? The highest revenue increases in the past 25 years. They come on the heels of the largest tax relief measures in American history.     
   And the budget deficit, in turn, has fallen $165 billion over 2 years. And just as the economy is gaining tremendous momentum, now, unfortunately, my Democrat colleagues are saying, this is the time to raise taxes. 
   Madam Speaker, I have learned very quickly in the few days I have been here in Washington, D.C., that facts don't always get in the way of people's opinions here in this fair city. But it is hard to dispute 3 years of unparalleled prosperity. 
   It is important that we recognize what tax relief does for the average American. It gives us money, a chance to grow a business, a chance to raise our kids while growing the economy and raising a lot more jobs in the process. 
   I urge my colleagues here in this Chamber, my esteemed colleagues who I have come to respect, to reject new taxes. Instead, let's do this. Let's work to make the tax reduction rates permanent now, while we can, and continue to reduce the overall tax burden. 
   The American people deserve our best, and the colleagues here are the best from across the country. Let's do that for the American people.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 838, welcoming His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI on his first apostolic visit to the United States. For centuries, Popes have provided inspiration and a strong foundation of faith for millions of Catholics around the world and many non-Catholics as well. As spiritual leader of the Roman Catholic Church, the Pope serves as the impassioned defender of Catholic doctrine and values, a role this Pope has taken to new heights. 
   On April 19, 2005, Catholics everywhere were introduced to Pope Benedict XVI, and in just 3 years, the Pope has emerged as a vocal and effective advocate, combating what many see as the world's sloping trend towards secularism. Rather than steering the Catholic Church towards a more moderate and relaxed approach to worship, Pope Benedict XVI has demonstrated the benefit and need of returning to fundamental Christian values. Certainly, it is not easy for a leader to take such a bold stand that bucks popular trends and culture, but it is an example of pure conviction and true leadership that inspires millions of Catholic believers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to welcome Pope Benedict XVI to America as he continues to spread his message of faith, love, and service in Christ. Millions are inspired by his presence; and his passionate convictions cast a light that all Catholics strive to follow. Your Holiness, it is my honor to join in welcoming you to the United States.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (NO CHILD LEFT INSIDE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Chairman, today, the House will consider H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act. I rise in strong opposition to this legislation. 
   First of all, H.R. 3036 continues our Nation down the ill-fated road of shifting control of school curricula away from the parents and teachers and local school boards who best know what their children need into the hands of Federal Government and its one-size-fits-all approach. To best serve our children's educational needs, local school boards need flexibility to target resources where they are needed most--from school construction and class size reduction efforts to higher teacher salaries and technology in the classroom. The needs of individual school districts are dynamic and complex. They are not homogenous and are most certainly not best understood by bureaucrats in Washington. 
   I fervently believe that parents and teachers and local school boards know best how to educate our children, and it is time for Congress to stop removing them further and further from the equation. Congress must move back down the path to control, accountability, and authority at a local level for education. H.R. 3036 leads us away from this crucial goal. 
   Furthermore, while I agree it is important to promote conservation and environmental literacy, especially as America faces a crippling energy crisis, I do not agree that public school is the place to do it. H.R. 3036 would simply add another layer of bureaucracy and Federal mandates to our Nation's already overburdened schools, displacing important educational building blocks with questionable environmental education programs. At a time when American test scores continue to lag behind our global counterparts, can we honestly say that we need less time for the fundamentals of reading, writing, arithmetic? Church groups, scouting, extracurricular organizations, and the family promote conservation, love of and respect for the outdoors, and environmental messages daily. Let the teachers teach; let parents instill values. 
   Finally, let us not forget that Congress has already allotted funds for environmental literacy through an Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, grant program. Since 1992, that program has allocated over $40 million, or roughly $2.5 million per year. H.R. 3036 would spend an additional $14 million to create an additional grant program administered by a whole new executive branch agency, the Department of Education. Can there be any question that this represents an expansion of the Federal bureaucracy, a duplication of efforts, and a wholly irresponsible distribution of taxpayer dollars? 
   The No Child Left Inside Act represents a step in the wrong direction, adding the weight of increased Federal bureaucracy to an already sinking educational outlook. Forcing local school districts to direct scarce resources away from core curricula to serve a political agenda will only further suppress the academic performance of America's next generation. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (FOURTH QUARTERLY REPORT OF THE FRESHMEN REPUBLICANS -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you, Representative. What an honor to be able to be here. What an illustrious class we have, and I appreciate the gentleman from California so much for his fine direction, for his leadership and for our class. He is doing a wonderful and able job. He is telling the story that the American people want to hear, and that is where we are in this particular quarter, what is happening with our finances, because that is what we do, after all, when we come here to the United States Congress. We come here for a very simple purpose. We have to deal with 11 spending bills covering various subjects, and we have to take care of those. We have to make sure that we fully fund the priorities that we believe in and make sure that we  are keeping faith with the American people and doing so in a way that respects their property, their private property. 
   Because after all, what is it that each one of us has? We have our time. We have our livelihood. And when we go out to work every day, the money that we bring home for our families, the money that we bring home that we hope that some day will buy us a home, put our children through college, maybe have enough to offer us a secure retirement, that is the result of our labor that we take every day. 
   And where are we at now in this country with the amount of money that the government is consuming out of our paychecks? It seems every year those days go a little bit longer and longer when Congress is consuming more money. That is a real concern for a lot of Americans. I know it is a concern for me. It is a concern for our family and for the people that I represent back in Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District. And I know as I have spoken with our fellow freshmen, and many will follow me up here when I conclude my remarks, they will tell you the same thing.     
   They are very concerned about how the people back home are going to be able to hold on to the fruits of their labor, the private property that they have been able to amass and accumulate for the benefit of their family. 
   Well, here's just one topic that I want to take tonight, just one little piece, and spend a very few moments on it, and it's a concept called the alternative minimum tax. Now, this is something that came about in the Tax Code back in 1969. Back in 1969, there was a hue and cry because there were about 155 multimillionaires who didn't pay taxes that year, and rightly so. There were a lot of middle-income Americans, lower-income Americans that were pretty upset about this. They were paying taxes, but they saw that wealthier people, through legitimate loopholes, you might say, or legitimate provisions in the Tax Code, were able to completely escape taxation. 
   Well, this created, as you can imagine, a hue and cry right here in this body. So the Congress decided to create a bill called the alternative minimum tax. What this would do, essentially, is a person would have to figure their tax once. If they didn't have a tax liability, under the alternative minimum tax they figured their tax a second time, and whichever tax liability was higher, that is the tax that we get paid. In other words, whichever way that Uncle Sam did better, that would be the final outcome of a person's tax return. So the American citizen never was able to pay the lower amount of tax; they always had to pay the higher amount of tax. 
   Well, the alternative minimum tax kind of turned into something that you might equate with one of those 1950 science fiction movies called, maybe, ``The Blob that Ate New York City,'' because that is what has happened with the alternative minimum tax. It has become kind of like ``the blob that ate New York City.'' 
   Now, remember back in 1969, 155 Americans were impacted by the alternative minimum tax; in other words, they had to pay a higher tax. That is what that means; 155 Americans. Well, guess what Congress forgot to do? They forgot to index this tax for inflation. So, guess what? Every year more and more Americans had to pay this tax, and more and more Americans were reclassified as being wealthy or rich. 
   Well, guess what? Last year, 3.5 million Americans had to pay the alternative minimum tax. One hundred fifty-five, 3.5 million. Guess where we are today? As of today, this Congress has done nothing, absolutely nothing to eradicate the alternative minimum tax. You know what will happen? Twenty-three million Americans will be impacted by this measure. That is redefining what rich means in this country. 
   So, do you know what the new definition of rich will be? It will be a police officer married to a teacher. Now, think of that, a police officer married to a teacher. We don't usually think of people in those income tax categories as being redefined as rich. But now, under the so-called wisdom of this Congress, that is exactly what has happened 
   Now this is a problem. We cannot allow this higher level of taxation to seep down into the middle class where people are working hard. They aren't rich by any stretch of the imagination. They are just hardworking, decent people, trying to make a go of it; not what this tax was intended to impact. That is something we need to consider. There actually can be a conclusion. Sometimes the curtain needs to come down on ill-advised measures; and if there ever was an ill-advised measure, it's the alternative minimum tax. 
   I just want to give you a figure here. Historically, over the last 40 years, and we are standing here, it's a beautiful December evening in Washington, D.C., the year 2007. For the last 40 years in this country, the Federal Government has consumed about 18.2 percent of gross domestic product. That is pretty much the money that is created and generated in this country every year, gross domestic product. Well, guess what? The Federal Government has consumed about 18.2 percent. 
   If this Congress continues to do nothing, and unfortunately, that is a lot of what we have seen this year is a lot of do nothing, if Congress continues to do nothing with the alternative minimum tax, instead of 18.2 percent of all the money that is created in this country, that number will rise to 24 percent. Almost one-fourth of everything that is created, the income that is created in this country will come where, to your pocket? Are you kidding? It will come here to the United States Government. That is not what we want to see happen. 
   This is kind of a dream come true for politicians that love big government, because they don't have to vote for this tax increase. It's just on automatic overdrive. It's going to continue to grow. Just like I said, ``the blob that ate New York City,'' that is the alternative minimum tax. 
   That is not what those of us who are standing up here to talk to you about tonight, with fiscal responsibility, that is not what we are about. That is not what we want. What we are after is a clean, straight repeal. We want this ill-advised tax to go away. People think that a tax is here forever, that you will never get rid of it. You never get rid of death, you never get rid of taxes. Well, it is possible to do it. It's possible to do it if we have the will. 
   I believe collectively the American people would want us to get rid of this ``blob that ate New York City,'' the alternative minimum tax, because why should the government continue to profit from a bad law so that you will have to continue to spend more and more and more of your income. And pretty soon, everybody's going to be redefined as rich, everybody will be, and pay a higher level of taxation. This is absolutely ridiculous. There is no reason why we should continue a law like this, and I fully believe that we need to do something about this bill, and do it soon. 
   Now, here's one aspect that is being debated even this evening. There are those on the other side of the aisle that think that we have to ``pay'' for this tax. In other words, you need to continue to be taxed more. 
   Here's how they plan to do it. They plan to create a bank account, if you will. And what the other side across the aisle is planning to do, you know what they are going to put in that bank account? They want to put tax increases in that account. They want to have a 1-year tax or 1-year patch, or fix. So instead of 23 million people paying that tax this year, they just want it to be 3.5 million people. Still too many. It's 3.5 million too many people, if you ask me. 
   But what they want to do is create a bank account and put tax increases in it. And what they are going to do, just ``take it to the bank,'' as they say. The American people are going to be stuck with a bill of $50 billion in tax increases that you're going to have to pay, maybe not next year, but the year after. That bill is going to be stuck to the American taxpayer. 
   We can do so much better. Do you know that we have more revenues coming in this year into the Treasury than any other time in the history of this country? Revenues are not the problem. We don't need all this additional revenue. What we need is some fiscal discipline, some fiscal responsibility. We need to get our sense about us and realize we just can't be all things to all  people. We set our priorities. We do what you do every day at home in your home and in your business. You just realize you need to spend within your means. 
   So we need to get right on this. We need to not create any phony bank accounts where we don't put money in, we put IOUs in that you the American public are going to have to pay. We are going to get rid of that. 
   We want to just do a clean repeal, do away with the alternative minimum tax, be fiscally responsible, be good and kind to the American people. That is a Christmas present that we need to pass and send out to the American people tonight. That Christmas present needs to say that we respect you, we respect your work, we understand how hard you work, we understand that your family means the world to you, your children mean the world to you, your parents mean the world to you, your business could use a little bit more capital investment too. We trust you, and we know that you can put that money to work far better than any of us collectively ever could hope to do. There are essentials that government has to fund, but what we don't need to do is have a blob that eats not only New York City, but the rest of the United States. 
   So I for one, Representative McCarthy, believe with you that we need to do right by the American people, trust their judgment, be sensitive to their family needs, and do away with the alternative minimum tax.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (PANIC AND THE ENERGY CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, we are at what I think is a very refreshing moment of clarity on the national energy debate that is occurring right now in hamlets and towns and villages all across the United States. We have captured people's attention because we really are at a crisis point because, at least in my district, the Sixth District of Minnesota, people are paying close to $4 for a gallon of gas. I know that the national average is at about $4.11 a gallon. It's at historic highs and people are frantic. 
   When I was home over the break, I had met with people from all aspects of dealing with the energy issue. In particular, I met with some car dealers and they told me that people come into the dealership, this was Morrie Wagner Chevrolet, and they told me that they have people literally coming into the store with panicked looks on their faces saying, Take my truck, take my SUV. It's a new car. Take my minivan. It's new. We still owe quite a bit of money on it but we can't afford to drive this thing. Sheer panic and trying to find anything else because they just don't know how much higher prices are going.     
   But I say that we are at a refreshing point in this debate for this reason: We have clarity right now on the debate that we have never had before. Frankly, I have been baffled; baffled by how are we going to be able to get us back to $2 a gallon gasoline or less? And I mean that sincerely. I know that we can be at $2 a gallon again. 
   It wasn't that long ago when I took office, 18 months ago. I am a first-termer in Congress, Mr. Speaker. When I came in, gas was $2 and change a gallon. Think of that. Eighteen months ago, gas was $2 and change, and here we are topping out at over $4 a gallon gasoline. 
   What happened in that amount of time, when we have seen a 76 percent rise in the price of gasoline? What happened? We have seen worldwide demand go up and up and up, so that worldwide demand exceeds the amount of supply. That has fed into the price going up and up and up. 
   Well, what do we do to deal with that? We need to get more supply so we can get the price down. Why isn't that happening? It is really clear to me now. And I was baffled about this. I couldn't believe it, but it is absolutely true. 
   The Democrats' position so far, Mr. Speaker, has been drive less, pay more. That is where they are coming from. I find that really hard to believe. I grew up a Democrat in a Democrat home, and I thought that just can't be. It defies commonsense. Drive less, pay more? That is your plan? 
   Well, that isn't just some Republican saying that. That is the Democrats' own words. There was just an aide of the Democrat leadership that just came out and said, ``This is what our plan is: It is drive small cars and wait for the wind.'' That is actually true. This was not a tongue in cheek remark. It is ``drive small cars and wait for the wind.'' Well, I don't know about you, but I think Members of Congress are going to be gone with the wind if we don't do something about the price of gasoline to bring it down again. 
   Not only that, I was reading on the Hill from Roll Call newspaper and another Democrat leadership aide had this to say: They said that the majority is confident they would be able to defeat the offshore drilling amendment. 
   Now, just think of that for a moment, Mr. Speaker. The Democrats are confident they would be able to defeat the offshore drilling amendment, which means what are we supposed to do for energy? We have got to go get it. We have got to drill for it. They want to kill being able to drill offshore to bring on line the energy that we need so we  can get the American people back to $2 a gallon and so we can get the economy back on track. But they are confident that they can kill this bill. 
   They have no intention of bringing more energy supplies on line. In fact, this aide was quoted as saying, ``We have defeated that amendment before, and we will defeat it again.'' They are proud of it. They admitted, at least I give them credit for that, yes, it is true, the Democrats are responsible for defeating drilling to get the energy that we need, and they are confident they are going to defeat it again. 
   It is almost unbelievable to me, because, as this chart says, what we need to do is bring it on. If we are short on energy, we need to bring it on. We need to bring the onshore oil on line, we need to bring the offshore oil on line, and the new refineries on line, because we are the Saudi Arabia of oil. We have more oil in three States, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, we have more oil in those three States than all of Saudi Arabia. We have 25 percent of the world's coal in this country. We can be the Saudi Arabia of coal. We have more natural gas. We have 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico, and we can't get it. 
   Now, why is that? It is because of Congress. Congress created this problem. We are about the only country in the world that has made it illegal to access our own energy. Congress created this problem. Congress can solve this problem by making it legal to access our own energy reserves. 
   Well, that can't be done. We hear, Mr. Speaker, from the Democrat presidential nominee, Senator Obama, it will take 20 years before we can get any of this energy on line. Are you kidding? That is balderdash, so-to-speak. Of course, we can. 
   I have a bill that I am introducing this week that will fast track the permitting so we can have the Secretary of the Interior start immediately to get it online. We need to do this, the American people want us to do this, and we can get back to $2 a gallon gas.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (ABORTION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. Congressman. 
   I'll be referring to an article that came out. It's a shocking article that many of us in this Congress read just a few weeks ago, and I commend the American people to pick this up on the Internet or go find it at your local library. June 23, 2008, the Wall Street Journal newspaper, it's on page 1. It's an article by Stephanie Simon called ``Abortion Provider Goes Upscale. Aid For Poor Questioned.'' And here is the bottom line of this article. 
   It exposes the fact that Planned Parenthood, a 501(c)3 organization, which is a nonprofit organization--in other words, Planned Parenthood pays no taxes. They don't have to pay taxes because they're considered a nonprofit. This nonprofit is big business. It was started back in 1916 by Margaret Sangar, a woman who promoted eugenics, and this organization has now become a big box retailer, big abortion, in other words. It is a big retailer. And it brought in, get this, $1 billion in revenues--$1 billion in revenues. 
   Not only does this organization not pay taxes like other businesses do, but they receive in that $1 billion, almost one-third of what they receive comes in the form of your tax money, Federal tax money, State tax money. But get this: they receive almost $1 billion, according to this article, in annual revenue, one-third of that coming from Federal and State grants to care for women. The nonprofit ended the year with a surplus of a $115 million. 
   So they had your money, your money that you're paying in taxes. They had an extra $115 million cash on hand at the year end. A $1 billion budget, and they had that much cash on hand, about 11 percent of its revenue, net assets of $952 million, almost a billion dollars in net assets. 
   So the article asks, Why are we giving them so much money? That's exactly right. Why are they receiving, as Congressman MIKE PENCE asked, why are we giving them so much tax money? They have 882 clinics State-wide, and they quietly dropped their statement that said no matter what a person's income, we're going to be helping those people. 
   Well, let me tell you, they've made a decision, Planned Parenthood, that they are going to go after the affluent. How do I know that? It's happening in my district, and it was detailed in this article. It said three express centers in wealthy Minnesota suburbs and shopping centers and malls, places where women are already doing their grocery shopping, picking up their Starbucks, living their daily lives. 
   Do we understand what this is? This is to promote women, to promote that woman intentionally take the lives of their unborn children. We are asking God-fearing Americans to subsidize this brutal and bloody procedure on a regular business in upscale shopping malls all across the United States. 
   Not only are they not paying taxes, but we are giving them over $330 million a year to do this dastardly deed. And when they do this, do you realize they could take this money and they can use it for political functions? I don't know how this works. What a game. Who wouldn't want to get in on this? 
   And all across the country, we have very poor, struggling life care centers, organizations that are trying to give positive alternatives to women. They don't get these grants. They don't get them. They get local donations to try to help women make a decision about saving lives and choosing life. 
   I just want to end with the fact that if we can agree on nothing else, it should be that the United States taxpayer shouldn't have to pay taxes to an organization that uses your money to  politicize, yes, in upcoming elections candidates who give them more of your tax money. This is unconscionable. 
   And I look so forward to hearing what our colleagues are going to have to say to the American people about this gross injustice. You bet we should defund Planned Parenthood. We should take away their tax fund and we should defund.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. You absolutely do. That's exactly what the article says. In fact, it goes on to say that it's the Federal tax law that has caused this tragedy. 
   I'm a former Federal tax litigation attorney, and this is absolutely true. This is what our tax code allows. In fact, Planned Parenthood, who plans to raise the $10 million, as the gentleman from Texas said correctly, they can take that money that we taxpayers are giving them to mobilize voters and advocate on issues such as abortion rights and sex education in schools. 
   Life care centers don't get that advantage, but people who advocate for the destruction of innocent human life get this money.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. I just wanted to end, Madam Speaker, by saying Steve Trombly is a top executive director of Planned Parenthood in Illinois, and he said, ``I would like to think of Planned Parenthood as the Lens Crafters of family planning.'' If you've got 882 clinics, you have $1 billion a year in annual revenue and $330 million of that comes from taxpayer funding, I think that shows pretty clearly they are big business. They are the Wal-Mart of big abortion. They're the big box retailer. 
   It is time to end their tax exempt status. It's a fraud. And it's time to stop the public financing of Planned Parenthood. It's the right thing to do. 
   I yield back to my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey, the stalwart of prolife, Representative Chris Smith.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I actually think that we're at a refreshing point of clarity in the energy debate, because the one thing that we have learned is the only thing standing between the American people and lower energy prices at the pump is the Democrat-controlled Congress. 
   They've made their position very clear. It is drive less and pay more. Or, as we heard yesterday, drive small cars and wait for the wind. Or, the other suggestion we've heard is the Congress has done such a wonderful job running a railroad, now let's have Congress take over the energy industry and we can run that, too. 
   It's only been in the last 18 months that we have seen energy prices increase a dramatic 76 percent. At 9 percent approval rating, I don't think we're hearing a clamoring from the American people for Congress to take over and run anything. 
   The Republican Party now has become the party of the little guy. We want to open up energy exploration, permit expediting so that we can get this online. We don't have to wait 20 years. That's Congress that caused those barriers. Congress can unlock those barriers and bring clarity back to the issue.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, today we are debating a bill which addresses an issue that is near and dear to my heart: helping those with mental health disorders. 
   As the wife of a clinical therapist, I have seen the many challenges that people who have mental health disorders face day after day. 
   These are very real impairments--but through counseling and appropriate treatments, real breakthroughs can be made. 
   We can help those individuals who suffer, as well as their families and our overall society. 
   But I have serious concerns about the scope of this legislation and the impact it will have on the affordability of health insurance for all Americans. 
   By mandating that group health plans offer the same financial benefit structure for both mental and physical disorders, the cost of insurance will increase across the board--and with accessibility of health care services and the affordability of health care coverage so paramount a concern for families across the country. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost of these mandates in the private insurance market will total $3 billion annually by 2012. 
   This will inevitably set up a cycle of increasing costs on employers offering health insurance and thus increasing costs for employees seeking to obtain coverage. 
   These mandates may even have an adverse affect on access to mental health coverage at all. 
   My colleagues in support of the bill have stressed that it does nothing to require employers to offer coverage of mental health services--it only mandates what this coverage must include on those who choose to offer mental health coverage. 
   But it is not hard to imagine that many employers who are frustrated with the increased costs the bill will impose on them will simply drop mental health coverage altogether. 
   That, of course, would be counterproductive to the intent of the bill. 
   In fact, it would hurt the very people the bill purports to help. 
   Mr. Speaker, the cost of health care is at perhaps an all time high. 
   Between 2000 and 2006, premiums for family coverage have increased by 87 percent, making the average premium families' paid last year $12,106. 
   This is not the time to make coverage less affordable. 
   Though I appreciate my colleagues' good intentions, the negative impact this bill would have on our overall health care market is too serious to ignore and I must oppose it.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, today, over 5 million Americans rely on the National Flood Insurance Program to protect their homes and businesses in the event of a flood. 
   But since January of last year, there have been over 77 declared disasters involving flooding. And just this August, in our home State of southeastern Minnesota, we experienced severe flooding that caused distress to over 1,500 homes. 
   According to FEMA, and according to the Minnesota Homeland Security and the Emergency Management, the Federal Government has disbursed at this point nearly $31 million in Federal recovery funds to over 4,200 people. And currently, there are over 8,000 people, specifically, there are 8,434 national flood insurance policies in effect in my home State of Minnesota. 
   But, unfortunately, as floods continue to occur across our great Nation, the National Flood Insurance Program is in trouble. It's not good news. It's bad news. And the program today, unfortunately, is $18 billion in debt. That's today, as it stands, and it's required to pay that debt back with interest over time. This debt will be paid back with the premiums that are charged to those families who are relying on this flood insurance program. 
   The base bill that's before us is a good one because it attempts to help solve some of the fiscal problems today that are facing the National Flood Insurance Program. We agree with that, Mr. Speaker. 
   But, yet, there is one provision in this bill that has the potential to undo the very positive reform that is before us, and that is to send the flood insurance program into even further fiscal disarray and result in premium increases for homeowners all across America, something that no one in this body would want to do. 
   The proposal, Mr. Speaker, that's included in this bill is to expand the National Flood Insurance Program by creating a brand-new insurance program for wind damage. That's something that has never existed before, and it's akin to a homeowner who, upon discovering that his foundation is rotting, decides to ignore that problem and instead adds a second story on to that rotting house. And he shouldn't be surprised then when the whole house collapses around him. 
   I have a very simple amendment, Mr. Speaker, and it says this: it does not strike the brand-new wind insurance program. What it does is this: it stipulates that before the program can go into effect, three things have to occur. This is something that we can all agree on: 
   Number one, there has to be a certification that the existing National Flood Insurance Program, in fact, is actuarially sound, and this certification would provide all of us with the assurance that this program is correctly pricing its policies and has adequate reserves on hand to handle large flood events. We've seen that there's been a problem with this in some of the State reserve accounts. 
   Today, right now, both the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Budget Office have reported that the National Flood Insurance Program is likely to not be actuarially sound. 
   Second, there has to be a certification that premiums for people in the existing flood insurance program will not be increased to subsidize this brand-new insurance program. People all over America are wondering if that's going to happen to them as well as the insurance companies. 
   And then third, of this simple amendment, it says there has to be a certification that the new wind insurance program will, itself, be fiscally sound. Who can argue with that? 
   So, Mr. Speaker, the 8,434 people of the State of Minnesota and the 5 million Americans who today rely on our National Flood Insurance Program, they need to serve as a lifeline in the event of a major storm, that they would not have that program in endangered, that their premiums would not, in fact, be increased in order to help create, in fact, this new expansion of an expansion of a wind program. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (HONORING THE CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS, FIRST RESPONDERS, AND THE CITIZENS OF MINNESOTA FOR THEIR VALIANT EFFORTS IN RESPONDING TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE INTERSTATE ROUTE 35W MISSISSIPPI RIVER BRIDGE -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, I thank my dear colleague for allowing me this moment to address the body. 
   I, too, offer my condolences and sympathy to the Members and families of our Minnesota community who endured one of the most horrific losses that anyone can imagine. When it's a beautiful, wonderful evening in Minnesota in August, August 1, when people are on their way to the Twins game and home from work, their minds are on the BBQ and what they're going to do when they go home, what they're going to say to their husband, what they're going to say to their wife, going to their child's T-ball game or their soccer game, those were the kind of things that were on the minds of Minnesotans when all of a sudden, inexplicably, this bridge that is the most traveled bridge in the State of Minnesota went down. Something no one would ever imagine could happen happened. 
   The Saturday after the bridge collapse occurred, I had the opportunity to go back and meet with some of the first responders, as my colleagues did as well. And I think to a person we can say what we saw that day was nothing short of just the joy and the grief, all of the emotions mixed together on the faces of the firemen, faces of the policemen, faces of the health care professionals as well who were there, who saw that horror firsthand and did what we expect that they would do, be first responders. Seems like an ordinary thing that they should do their job, but it's never an ordinary thing to lay down your life for your fellow man. That's what a police officer does every day when they put on that uniform. That's what a fireman does every day when they put on that uniform. And that day they were called upon to do that duty, make that sacrifice. They did it. And I'll tell you what, I could not be more proud of those first responders. 
   And it was wonderful, too, Madam Speaker, to see how in this body this wasn't a Republican or Democrat issue, this was about being human, this was about loving our fellow man. And I can't say enough about the effort of the two parties to come together and unanimously making the right decision, and that is, authorizing the  money for this bridge to get it up and built again, and then hopefully now appropriate that money to get it up again. 
   I commend Congressman Ellison, Congressman Walz, I commend Congresswoman McCollum and everyone in our delegation who came together to get behind this bridge. But more importantly, it's the first responders who came together and laid down their lives. 
   One of the people who did that was a constituent of mine. I just want to mention him a little bit. His name is Gary Babineau, 24 years old, lives up in Blaine. He is a construction worker. Gary was coming home from work that night, like most Minnesotans, thinking about what he was going to do. His wife is due with their first baby 2 weeks later. And that's what he was thinking about, that new little baby that was about to come 2 weeks from now, when all of a sudden he was right across from that yellow school bus that we all saw on the news. And Gary's truck was on the bridge, and he felt the bridge go down. And in a moment of time, his black pickup truck fell 30 feet down to the bottom. He never thought he would wake up again. He never thought he would open his eyes again, but he did. And he couldn't believe it, he could move. His back was severely hurt, but he could move. He got out of that truck and he went and he helped person after person get out of their vehicle, carried people to safety. And then Gary remarkably, here in the midst of having a severely injured back, he jumped off the bridge, got onto the ground, got back on the bridge, not knowing that the bridge would be stable, got on that bridge and went immediately to that yellow school bus. And he then assisted those 50 children getting off that bus. And as a matter of fact, it was reported in the paper it said, Gary Babineau said, ``I could see the whole bridge going down, and I was going down, too,'' he said. ``I have a baby coming in 2 weeks and that's all I could think about. We hit bottom, and I couldn't believe that I could open my eyes, I couldn't believe that I could move.'' 
   Gary Babineau was an ordinary man, but he became a first responder and he helped save lives. At the moment that he was needed he did it. We kind of expect that that's what Americans would do. We're just good people, we help each other in time of need. And here in this tragedy, as we have seen other tragedies that have befallen our Nation, when things didn't go exactly right in the recovery effort, here in Minnesota we saw that things were right. It happened right. And the reason why it happened right was because of first responders, official first responders, nonofficial first responders. But they did what was right because they acted out of love, out of a heart of love for their fellow man. 
   So I thank those first responders, the firemen, the policemen, the average Joes, the Gary Babineaus in their truck. And I thank the Federal officials, our President, our Members of Congress. I thank the county officials, the city officials, the State officials. Everybody did what was right. 
   But thank you, Congressman Ellison. This was the right resolution to bring forward today to honor these selfless individuals who none of us could live without. Thank you, first responders. I encourage my colleagues to give us a unanimous vote to this wonderful resolution.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great American and a woman from my district, Mrs. Vera Werner, on the occasion of her 105th birthday. It is a goal to which we all aspire but very few of us ever achieve. 
   Vera was born in 1902 in Melrose, Minnesota, on May 31, a great day. She is an unassuming Minnesotan, Mr. Speaker. She married, and 2 years later she moved to the big city of St. Cloud, Minnesota. During her time there, she touched many people's lives. Like so many Americans, she had numerous friends. She was on a bowling league for 40 years and she worked in the local department store. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, Vera Werner accomplished the most important work of any American: She was a mother to four children, she was a grandmother to 21, a great-grandmother to more than 40, and she has so many great-great-grandchildren that people can't keep count. There is no more important function as an American, Mr. Speaker, than to be a good mother or a good father. 
   Today, Vera, our Nation salutes you, and we wish you happy 105th birthday.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I also want to thank the Speaker of the House for making the case why so many Republicans are unwilling at this point to sign on to this legislation that's before us. However, I do believe also, Madam Speaker, that Democrats and Republicans are both committed to finding a way out of this financial challenge, and we think we have one. But the answer we believe needn't cost taxpayers $700 billion. 
   The problem is a lack of credit for creditworthy people, people who are fully capable of paying that credit back. Why is there a lack of credit? It's because the SEC has mandated accounting rules that have forced banks to value assets well below their actual economic value. 
   So what does this mean? It means that if a bank has $1 worth of deposits, they can make $10 in loans. But if accounting rules are forcing banks to devalue assets, $500 billion, then that means that banks are prohibited from making $5 trillion worth of loans. And that's why we have a credit crunch. 
   Unfortunately, the bill that we have before us today doesn't even address this credit crisis. 
   Let's first direct the SEC to suspend mark-to-market accounting rules for assets for which there is no market. That only makes sense. Second, stop naked short selling. Then the FDIC can issue net asset certificates that saved banks during the S&L crisis and the FDIC can write a letter to United States banks telling them in the absence of fraud that the FDIC will fully back all deposits for first-tier creditors. 
   Let's try these practical solutions before we pull the trigger on a $700 billion bailout that doesn't even address the underlying program. 
   Today, Madam Speaker, Republicans and Democrats agree. It's time for a rest. It's time for a break. Let's embrace a practical solution before we tie a $700 billion bailout around the neck of the American people.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for her wonderful amendment this evening. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am new to this body, and one thing I found is that in Minnesota, we have a little bit different definition of ``transparency.'' 
   ``Transparency'' in Minnesota means an individual stands on one side of a divide, and they can look through to see something on the other. Here in the case of this bill, you have the taxpayer and you have Members of Congress trying to look through a divide, and what they see on the other side is a very interesting definition of ``transparency.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, the first thing that they see is a slush fund for earmarks. And this is something I don't quite understand; the Democrat majority, they are leaving lump sums of money without a specified purpose in legislation being considered by this House and then later authorizing those funds for earmarks in a closed-door conference committee. It is just a real interesting definition of transparency, because the Democrats have created now, Mr. Chairman, a slush fund for earmarks which will be funded by the largest tax increase in American history. This is just so interesting to me, this new definition of ``transparency.'' 
   Also a part of this definition is that earmarks will no longer be allowed to be challenged here on this House floor because under the Democrats' rules, Members will be prohibited from challenging individual earmarks in bills on the floor or debating their merit as long as there is a list of earmarks in the bill. 
   But what is interesting, Mr. Chairman, is that it won't matter if this list is flat-out wrong, if it is incomplete, or whether the earmark which is one that a Member would like to debate is missing from the list. It is just a real interesting definition of ``transparency.''  
   The ``truth in labeling'' that we are seeing in this bill is also interesting, Mr. Chairman, because earmark-laden bills can now be certified as earmark-free. Real interesting. I guess it depends on what the meaning of ``free'' is. 
   Democrats will be allowing their bills to be certified by the majority as earmark-free even if they contain earmarks. So as long as you take a magic wand, Mr. Chairman, and wave it over the bill, you can just say, ``Voila, it is now earmark-free.'' It is kind of like having fat-free french fries. It is something we would all love to have, but it just isn't possible. As long as any bill is certified by Chairman Obey as earmark-free, then, under the House rules, it is earmark-free. 
   This rule was exploited earlier in February, Mr. Chairman, by the House Democrats when they passed their continuing resolution that contained hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded, hidden earmarks, kind of like those fat-free french fries. 
   The largest tax increase in history, Mr. Chairman, is in the budget that was passed by the House Democrats, and that will likely be the story. Even though the majority likes to claim otherwise, they will raise taxes by at least $217 billion, Mr. Chairman, in all likelihood most likely $392 billion, and will raise marginal rates, except for the 10 percent rate, and capital gains rates and dividend rates and prevent a full repeal of the death tax, items the American public have indicated they are not for. 
   Speaker of the House Pelosi had said earlier that the budget should be ``a statement of our National values.'' Well, not only is this budget, Mr. Chairman, the largest in American history, it will sanction the largest tax increase in history upon more American families, because people in Minnesota, Mr. Chairman, my home State, will be paying an average of more than $3,000 a year more to this town, Washington, D.C. Again, a very interesting definition of ``transparency.'' 
   The budget is going to trigger more tax hikes, and it will greatly increase domestic spending. It will increase nondefense appropriations by $23 billion above what we spent in 2007. That is in addition, Mr. Chairman, to the $6 billion that the Democrats have already added to the omnibus bill and more than $20 billion in the war supplemental. 
   The American people, Mr. Chairman, are very concerned as well about the unlimited emergency spending, because the Democrat budget is going to abandon the emergency set-aside that was established in last year's budget resolution and change what Congress can call an emergency, unlimited exemption, exempting the Senate spending bill from any limits. 
   This is really, Mr. Chairman, putting the next election above the next generation, something that none of us should want to do. The Democrats in this bill, unfortunately, have ignored the warnings of the entitlement crisis. Let's not forget, we have heard from the Comptroller General David Walker.

   This is our upcoming economic tsunami, Mr. Chairman. Their budget has turned a blind eye to the impending crisis that is coming upon this next generation. Who among us can look in the eyes of the next generation, knowing what we know of the bill that will be handed to them for the party that we are all having today? Unfunded net liabilities. And yet we can stand here and do nothing to address the concerns and put off any major reform for at least 5 years? 
   Now is the time, Mr. Chairman, to have true transparency, and I am sad to say that this bill does none of that.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (RECOGNIZING THE STATE OF MINNESOTA'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY. -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for yielding to me. 
   This is a wonderful, delightful resolution to be able to speak on this afternoon. It is the State of Minnesota's 150th birthday. We have had a big party all year, we are going to continue to have a big party all year, and it is my honor to be able to present this resolution before our distinguished body and also to let the American people know the entire Minnesota delegation has joined me on this resolution. All Democrats, all Republicans, we are united in this great party of celebrating Minnesota's 150th birthday.  
   Mr. Speaker, as this resolution's author, I rise to support House Resolution 923. As Minnesota turns a very proud 150 years old, we are no worse for the wear as a State, and I am very honored to recognize the contributions that Minnesota has made to the United States economy and to our great heritage of freedom and prosperity. 
   On March 3rd, 1849, Minnesota was established as a United States territory as part of the Northwest Territory, and later we became the 32nd State in this great country, on May 11, 1858. 
   Minnesota is now home to over 5 million very lucky people. Minnesota is renowned for our welcoming communities, our high quality schools and our valuable natural resources. Minnesotans take advantage of those resources every weekend that we can, our beautiful lakes, our forests, our prairies. ``Minnesota Nice'' is more than a saying for us; it is our way of life, and we welcome you to come and enjoy our hospitality any time you get to our great State of Minnesota. 
   We are also known as the Gopher State. We are also known as the North Star State and the Land of 10,000 Lakes. But, truth be told, we actually have over 15,000 lakes in our great State. Our name comes from the Dakota word ``minesota,'' which means ``water that reflects the sky,'' in other words, sky blue waters. And it is that, and more. 
   Native Americans continue to play an extremely important role in Minnesota and a defining role in our very proud heritage. The influence of the Native Americans can be seen not only in the names of our local towns, our local lakes and our natural landmarks, but also in the enduring culture of conservation of the land and the great love that every Minnesotan shares and our bond with the outdoors. 
   It was in 1889 that the Saint Mary's Hospital, now known as the world famous Mayo Clinic, opened its doors to patients in Rochester, Minnesota. They are now known worldwide for their cutting-edge care, and quite often in the news we will hear of yet one more world leader who makes their way to little Rochester, Minnesota, to receive what we know in Minnesota is the finest health care system in the United States. 
   Minnesota also houses, Mr. Speaker, over 30 institutions of higher education. Education is a very strong value in the State of Minnesota, including the world renowned University of Minnesota, a world class research university of which we are all extremely proud and where the Nation's and world's first open heart surgery was performed and also the first bone marrow transplant was performed in the United States. 
   Minnesota continues to be a leader in innovation. In fact, Minnesota is currently home to more than 35 Fortune 500 companies. Yes, we are the State, Mr. Speaker, that gave you SPAM, and we are the State that gave you the Post-it note. 
   But our rise in corporate and technological prominence has not compromised our agricultural background. Farmland spans over half of Minnesota's 54 million acres. My father was born on a farm and grew up on a farm, and farming is a way of life for many of our Minnesota people. The ag industry is a jewel in Minnesota and it is Minnesota's second largest job market, employing nearly 80,000 farmers that serve to feed the world. 
   At a time when energy costs and production are dominating the headlines, Minnesota is a national leader in the protection and use of renewable energy. We are very proud of this fact, and it helps our Nation reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
   For 150 years, Mr. Speaker, Minnesota has attracted a very special caliber of people, marked by our spirit and by our character. The citizens of the State of Minnesota are dedicated to our families. Families are very important. Faith is very important in our State, our communities, and also in our Nation. We are people of faith. We are people of charity. We are people of hope and dedication, love and compassion. We have a very high rate of giving in the State of Minnesota. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope you and my fellow colleagues will join me in recognizing the rich history and the substantial contributions that Minnesota and Minnesotans have made to this great Nation. We have a lot to be proud of, Mr. Speaker, and this legislation marks yet one more happy milestone in Minnesota's long history of success.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, over the weekend Secretary Paulson asked taxpayers to pony up an astonishing $700 billion to buy financial services sector debt on top of the existing bailouts that are already implemented this year. All told, that amounts to an astonishing $1.5 trillion. 
   Spending at this proportion doesn't just impact a fiscal year, it will impact generations of prosperity. We are told that the consequences of inaction, even of deliberative action, will be severe, but I am concerned that the consequences of hasty action could be just as dire. I have had hundreds of constituents call my office, as have my colleagues, over the last 2 days, asking this question. They are all expressing skepticism for this plan. 
   They remain unconvinced, as I remain unconvinced, that they will get much result for their investment. We should not be in the habit of writing blank checks. We should not rush to take action in a week when the consequences could last several lifetimes, because the forgotten man in all of this is the everyday American taxpayer. 
   It's with them in mind that we should fully focus on our responsibilities and not rush to judgment because of an artificial deadline.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. For 21 months the Democrat-controlled Congress watched as gas prices increased over 76 percent on the American people. For 21 months they sat in idleness as the American people became 70 percent dependent on foreign oil. They knew the American people paid an effective tax of $700 billion to foreign countries. 
   For 21 months the Democrats presided while watching one-sixth of our economy, money and jobs going overseas. For 21 months the solution was obvious to anyone who was looking to win the energy battle for the American people, and it was this: Legalize American energy production, all of it, legalize it and have Congress get out of the way. Whether it's clean coal, natural gas, oil production, nuclear, alternative, conservation, the Democrats could have done every bit of this 21 months ago and been the heroes of the American people. They could have because they have been in charge. But they willingly, intentionally, with eyes wide open, chose not to. 
   The Democrats defied the will of the American people, and now as the clock strikes midnight on the 110th Congress, with this sad chameleon they call an energy bill, the Democrats continue to defy the American people. But the truth is clear, this bill won't reduce the price of gasoline at the pump. The American people will suffer, as they have suffered under Democrat inaction. 
   But let's throw the American people a lifeline. We can, because in November Americans can have their say, finally, and under Republicans and John McCain, they will be able to choose $2 a gallon or less for gasoline, or they can choose Senator Obama and the no-drill Democrats, and they can see gas climb to the heights of 5 or $6 gallon or more.

   This morning, Republicans were so outraged when they heard what the Democrat Congress had done, that 150 of our Members planned to be on the floor to talk about the outrage of this bill. When the Speaker heard that, she decided to limit us to 30 people being able to speak this morning. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, one thing that will not be put under a bushel will be the outrage of the American people over this perceived and actual hoax of a bill, this charade we are going to vote on today. 
   I have in my hand amendments that I had hoped to offer to give Americans some real energy production. Not only will they not be allowed, but the voices of the American people will not be heard on this floor this morning, because the Speaker of the House has decided it will not be.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud support of this legislation which commends Minnesota's First Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry Division for their completion of the longest continuous deployment of any United States military unit during Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   This extraordinary group of men and women, also known as the Red Bulls, is comprised of about 3,700 dedicated Minnesotans and some 1,300 more soldiers from other Midwestern States. Recently, more than 1,000 of our courageous Red Bulls returned home from a 22-month deployment to Iraq. 
   During their time in the Middle East, the First Brigade Combat Team protected lives and helped to preserve the blessings of liberty here at home. They discovered 462 improvised explosive devices, IEDs, before they were able to wreak havoc on the innocent. By finding these IEDs prior to detonation, the First Brigade Combat Team surely saved the lives of countless fellow soldiers and Iraqi citizens. They also captured over 400 suspected insurgents and completed 137 reconstruction projects. In addition, the First Brigade Combat Team successfully processed over 1.5 million vehicles and 400,000 Iraqis into entry control points without any insurgent penetrations. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor the First Brigade Combat Team, whose bravery and commitment to serving our country is as apparent today as it has been in wars long past. These soldiers have returned with an outstanding record of achievement and have earned hundreds of awards including: one Silver Star, 151 Bronze Stars, 32 Purple Hearts, 771 Army Commendation Medals, 136 Combat Infantry Badges, 302 Combat Action Badges and 14 Combat Medical Badges. 
   The important measure before us today recognizes the service of our Red Bull soldiers, and reminds us of the price of our freedom, and those who have freely chosen to honor it. 
   To our Red Bulls, and all of the men and women that defend this Nation, my colleagues and I continue to stand in awe of you. 
   Thank you, and may God bless you and your families.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (SAFETEA-LU TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, today the House is considering H.R. 1195, a bill to make technical corrections to the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). Included in this bill is an important technical correction to a previously authorized high-priority project (HPP) which would increase vehicle crossing capacity over the Mississippi River and provide congestion relief for many of my constituents in Anoka County. 
   Development associated with population growth in the northwestern portion of the Twin Cities metro region has significantly increased traffic volume along the Highway 101, Highway 169, and 1-94 corridors. These increases currently cause significant delays at corridor crossings over the Mississippi River during the rush hours. Congestion experienced along these existing corridors will increase markedly as the area continues to grow. 
   Unfortunately, H.R. 1195 includes an error in the language referring to this project, mislabeling US 169 as US 160. In the past, typo mistakes have held up funding previously authorized by the House. I hope that my statement will serve to clarify this typo now and in the future as this important project moves forward.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (NATIONAL HOMELESS YOUTH AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding, and I honor and commend both the gentleman from Illinois and his counterpart for this important legislation. 
   And the gentleman is correct. My husband and I were privileged to be involved with raising 23 foster children. I am happy to report that each of them graduated from high school. They are launched into the world, and they are leading their lives. And, again, it was a privilege for me and my husband and also for our five biological children to be a part of their success story. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is why I rise today in support of this very important bill because it recognizes the month of November as ``National Homeless Youth Awareness Month.'' The problem of homelessness here in this country is a tragic one and we hope a preventable one, but the issue of homeless youth is especially devastating. 
   More than 2 million children and youth, Mr. Speaker, in our country are homeless for at least one night every year. It is almost impossible for many, not only just Minnesotans but for many Americans, to get their arms around that figure. 
   Many of these children have suffered various forms of abuse, which is also difficult to understand, or maybe were just thrown out on the street by their families. While others have spent years moving from home to home to home in various foster care systems. 
   In our own personal situation, we took in teenagers. We didn't take babies. And we were the last stop in a kid's life. Once they were placed in our home, that was it. We were their last stop. And it was our joy to be able to then launch them off into the world. I have a special interest in these latter cases because of our experience and because of the joys that we had in learning from these wonderful human beings. 
   These children often came from unstable families. And once they are placed, unfortunately, we saw firsthand they tend to get lost in the shuffle of a new home. It is difficult when you are a foster child and you are placed in a new home. You are not sure what your place is. You are not sure how you belong. And especially when you are in a new school, you kind of sometimes feel like you are second class even if your foster parents love you and don't want you to feel that way.     
   Students often begin to feel as though no one really cares about them. And you know, Mr. Speaker, that's one thing my husband always said; we have to show these children that there is at least one adult in their life that's crazy about them. And if we can offer them that much, maybe that can be our part in their world. 
   In some of the worst cases, these children may even experience more abuse in what should be a safe place in foster homes. Not all foster homes are perfect, unfortunately. And even in the best cases, once a foster child turns 18, which is true for all of our children, except one, they're removed from the system, removed from the foster home, and they are made to live on their own, even though many of them aren't ready. As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, many children, I would say just from an anecdotal point of view, are less prepared than children who come from a biological home to be able to make it on their own when they're age 18. 
   And so unfortunately, as a result, 25 percent of foster children leaving care experience homelessness within 4 years of leaving their foster home. Just think, 25 percent, one-fourth of all foster children, when they leave that foster home, become homeless. Regardless of their backgrounds, once they become homeless, many youth find then that they are unable to lift themselves out of that situation. 
   While we can all kind of vaguely imagine what homelessness is like, I recently had the opportunity to hear the testimonies of two people who experienced homelessness, including a very courageous statement by the singer Jewel, absolutely lovely young woman, and her story was heartwrenching. She described how she had to wash her hair in a fast-food bathroom and what it was like for her to watch people as they looked down on her as a homeless teenager. She described her inability to find adequate shelter or food, as well as the feeling of hopelessness that she felt while fending for herself on the streets. 
   Despite these foster children's best efforts, continuing to go to school or finding a way to be able to hold a job becomes near close to impossible because they face a constant threat of illness, of violence, even worse things.  
   What struck me the most about children who experience homelessness is that through everything they experienced, all they wanted is to just not be written off by people who saw them only as homeless kids and not as the people, the human beings that they really are and the potential that they had. They're good kids, Mr. Speaker, as I'm sure you would agree; they just have been dealt a bad hand. 
   A child never deserves to be left in the street. Congress has to ensure that those who have been cast out will be cared for and will be given the chance to grow into successful adults. It's time that we shed light on the problem of homeless youth and children. 
   This is an important bill. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Chairman, the proposed amendment that I'm bringing before the body today removes $106 million from Amtrak funding, restoring it back to the fiscal year 2007 level, and it adds that amount to the Homeless Assistance Grants. 
   Madam Chairman, Amtrak has run a deficit for over $1 billion every year. It is now funded at $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2008 in the Democrats' THUD bill, an increase of $106 million over the fiscal year 2007 levels. It's $600 million over the President's request. 
   Much of this deficit stems from Amtrak's long-distance routes, which carry only 15 percent of Amtrak's passengers, but that creates 80 percent of its cash operating losses. 
   Although Congress has made several attempts at getting Amtrak to reform itself, these attempts have resulted in very little improvement, I'm afraid, and tax dollars are continuing to be wasted on a service that is used by only a very small fraction of our American population. 
   It just seems to me that rather than pouring money into this colossally losing investment, we should stop pouring good money after bad, and Congress ought to be funding programs that are proven to help people that are in need and deliver results. We need to help poor people. We shouldn't help poor programs. I think we should be saying no, Madam Chairman, to poor programs because we should not be saying no to poor, homeless people just to continue to prop up a bloated government bureaucracy. 
   One such program is the Homeless Assistance Grants program. It has been awarding competitive grants to cities, to counties, to nonprofits, to housing authorities to provide transitional and permanent housing for the homeless. 
   In Minnesota, we have some great programs. Grants have gone to Lutheran Social Services in Minnesota, the Amherst H. Wilder Foundation, the Tubman Family Alliance, great groups. These have proven themselves to be very successful in housing programs in Minnesota. 
   The problem with Amtrak is not that rail is bad, but this program again has been running in the red. It's been bleeding, it's been hemorrhaging, and it needs transfusion, a big transfusion of over $1 billion in tax money every year. It's running in the red. We do not want to be owners of a loser of a program. It requires Federal assistance to cover these losses and the losses from their capital investment. Clearly, for all the years it's been in existence, Amtrak would not survive without this Federal funding. 
   In Minnesota, we have an old Lakota Indian proverb, and it says, if your horse is dead, get off. And the wisdom of our Native American is pretty clear, and I think that we should follow our Lakota elders when they have enough sense to dismount. 
   This bill would fund Amtrak again at $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2008. That's $106 million more than the 2007 level, $600 million over the President's request. $1 billion is worth a lot. If you fraction it out, it it's $1,000 a day every day, including Sundays, for 2,440 years. Even for government, that's a lot of money, and still after 35 years, Amtrak hasn't been able to get it right, Madam Chairman. 
   The Federal Government has provided $30 billion to Amtrak. On average, that's a Federal subsidy of over $210 per passenger per thousand miles that are traveled. It seems that the Federal Government can't even get people to ride Amtrak, so we almost pay them to ride the line. In fact, in 2005, the Sunset Limited route connected L.A. with Orlando. That route required a subsidy of $433 per passenger each way. That's on top of the round-trip fare of about $950 that each passenger paid. That's more than enough to buy a plane ticket for each passenger and save them a trip lasting 68 hours, but that's only if the trains run on time, and only 41 percent of the time do the trains run on time. 
   It gets worse, though, Madam Chairman. The passengers on sleeper cars are the most heavily subsidized. The average passenger in a sleeper car gets an additional $206 subsidy. That reaches an extra $358 per passenger depending on the route. So that means that the highest government subsidies go to passengers sitting in first class. We could be giving this money to homeless people, and that's our priority.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (CREDIT CARDHOLDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentleman from California for his leadership, for what he's doing on this bill. He's a remarkable talent, and we're well served by Mr. Campbell. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill that's before this body. Given the current instability in our credit markets and, Madam Speaker, given the pressing need for this United States Congress to focus on the financial services bailout that is now before us, this bill is simply not what the United States Congress should be debating today. In fact, this bill is just another example of how this Congress far too often charges ahead without full contemplation of the consequences of its actions. 
   In today's global marketplace, Madam Speaker, consumers are paying for products and services more and more with credit and debit cards, rather than with cash payments. It's a completely different way today that we have of doing business. In fact, electronic payments now account for more than half of all consumer purchases here in the United States. 
   With the increasing role that credit cards play in the everyday lives of most Americans, it's both timely, and appropriate that we update and improve standards to protect those American consumers from unfair and deceptive credit card practices. 
   I also believe, Madam Speaker, that it's imperative that we improve access to useful, understandable and complete disclosure about the terms and conditions that govern credit card use here in our country.     
   The Federal Reserve Board has made a proposal. They proposed a rule known as Regulation Z which prescribes uniform methods for computing the cost of credit for disclosing credit terms and for resolving errors on certain types of credit accounts. This proposed rule is virtually identical to H.R. 5244, the Credit Card Holder's Bill of Rights Act of 2008. 
   While both Regulation Z and this bill are offered with the best of intentions, both could have very serious unintended consequences, and they could pose potentially significant, unnecessary costs on consumers and the United States economy. Goodness knows we don't need that right now. 
   Madam Speaker, Congress should absolutely allow the Federal Reserve Board's rulemaking process to play out before we rush to codify this proposed rule into law. The public comment periods, the public notice both serve a very important role that I think we all agree that will ensure that this government carefully considers every angle before we jump to regulatory change. 
   I'm very actually sorry to see the House Financial Service Committee hastily move to implement H.R. 5244 before the rulemaking process even had time to play out. It seems like that's the game now in Washington, DC: rush to judgment. Quick, hasty moves before the public even has time to weigh in. That's not democracy at its best, Madam Speaker, because this action shut out the comments of consumers. It shut out nonprofit organizations. It shut out industry representatives. It's certainly not in the best interests of credit card holders. 
   We all know that when Congress moves too quickly and bypasses important parts of the process, that it often does more harm than good. Take a look at this week. Take a look at what we're about to do: put the American consumer on the hook for almost another trillion dollars in bad debt. 
   This Congress has a responsibility to the people that we serve and to businesses to analyze this proposal's overall effectiveness and the effect on the cost of credit and market liquidity. Let's remember, the underlying, underpinning of this current crisis is the lack of liquidity. In other words, money into the marketplace. And that's very true today. 
   Ironically, the premise of this new $700 billion bailout is to restore that form of liquidity.

Should we not hear from those who are impacted most from these stressful times? We are imprudent, to say the least, if we do not allow for that comment. 
   I could not support this bill, Madam Speaker, when it moved out of committee because it was imprudent to jump ahead; and given this new instability that's broke out in the last 2 weeks, I absolutely in good conscience cannot support this measure now. Congress should exercise prudence--wouldn't that be a novel idea?--and allow the Federal Reserve Board to finalize this proposal before we codify it with a vote of Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin, who is doing a wonderful job presenting this today on the budget. 
   Mr. Chairman, it was about this time last year that we came to the House floor, I was a brand new freshman, and I have to say my jaw dropped when I looked at the budget proposal. Being a mom of five kids, 23 foster kids, just an average family, we know what it is to balance a budget just in our own home. And I saw the Democrats lay out their budget proposal which was the largest tax increase in American history. 
   And here we are, it's deja vu all over again because we see the Democrats are now having a tax increase that's even higher than last year, $683 billion. It's hard to count that high, Mr. Chairman, $683 billion in tax increases, hitting Americans at the most inauspicious time when we're in an uncertain economy, when families clearly across the Nation are paying more for health care, for education, certainly for gas, certainly for groceries.     
   And in Minnesota in particular, this means an average individual tax increase of $3,088. 
   Yes, Minnesotans, this means an average tax increase for you of $3,088. I know you have many other places where you could use $3,088. 
   And it's an average loss in income for people in my district, Mr. Chairman, of $1,609. 
   Unfortunately, it gets worse. It means over 2,665 fewer jobs for people in Minnesota, $292 million less in our local economy. 
   Those are real people's lives that are impacted by those figures. They aren't just numbers. They're real people's lives. And it's pain and it's suffering that this Congress does not have to deliver to normal average American taxpayers. In total, this budget increases our Federal tax burden, unbelievably, from 18 percent of GDP to over 20 percent of GDP in 2013.

This rule could create a place where potentially artificially manufactured scandal could be given a show trial by partisan inquisitors for the purpose of creating doubt about the character of Members of this Congress, all under the color of respectability, credibility, and authority. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is ingenious because partisans remove themselves as the original accusers. Incredibly, after a 90-day period of show trials, the unreformed Ethics Committee in Congress will again take up the case, returning us to where we were before all this started, with no reform. 
   In effect, the bill creates a bureaucracy of smear and witch hunt. It institutionalizes the politics of personal destruction with a potential of creating show trials with a public expense account.

   It was over 140 days ago that this Congress passed a veterans funding bill. It was a good bill. So why hasn't this bill made its way to the President's desk? The President has said he will sign this bill. Our veterans need this funding. They deserve this funding that the bill would provide. 
   Instead, the Democrats are preempting Thanksgiving holiday by serving up a turkey of a funding bill, a turkey that is filled with pork-based stuffing. 
   The business of national defense and the business of taking care of the very real needs of our veterans is just too important just to satisfy the urge to spend extra money that we just don't have in order to fund pet projects. 
   I want to say thank you to America's veterans, to those veterans who go to our veterans health care center in St. Cloud, Minnesota. I want to thank you for what you have done, for your sacrifice for this country.

   Citizens who are in compliance with the law should not have those rights taken away, including those who live in public housing. Yet, public housing authorities, including the one right here in our Nation's Capital, are telling residents that in order to be a resident of public housing, you must give up your second amendment rights. You must give up your right to own a firearm for sport or for hunting or, most importantly, to protect yourself or your family. 
   Let me quote from the January 2008 dwelling lease agreement for D.C.: ``Lessee and all Others are required to comply with the following use restrictions and requirements ..... To refrain from storing, maintaining, using, distributing, purchasing or selling any type of firearms or ammunition on the Leased Premises or the Development, whether registered or unregistered.'' 
   In other words, Madam Speaker, e ven if you comply with all the laws of the District of Columbia related to gun ownership, you are prohibited from owning a gun if you are a resident of public housing. 
   We are talking about law-abiding citizens, not criminals. Criminals are already largely prohibited from residing in public housing. Residents of public housing share the same legal rights to possess lawful property and to take measures to defend their lives as do homeowners who control their estate.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you to Congressman BOB LATTA. Thank you so much for your leadership on this issue and also for the fact that you've been willing to take on interest group after interest group on this issue, because one thing that I have learned, being a freshman Member of Congress, is that there are interest groups who are speaking loud and clear, and they aren't speaking on behalf of the American people who need to get gas prices back down to $2 a gallon or less, what they were just months ago. It wasn't that long ago that gas prices were $2.32 cents a gallon. And I'm sure that our colleague from Georgia, Mr. Gingrey, remembers. When we took office in January of 2007, gas prices were $2.32 a gallon. What are we being told now? That'll never happen again. We can never get gas prices back down to that level. 
   Well, we can't if the special interests that are now running this town stay in charge. They're exactly right. We never  can get it down. But we can get it down to $2.32 a gallon if we do what the American people called us to do when we came here, because as Congressman Latta knows, this is a congressionally created problem. This is not a problem of lack of energy resources in this country. This is not a problem of lack of technology for accessing these resources. 
   The problem is the United States Congress that has made it virtually illegal to access the answer to our problem that's contained right here underground, whether it's 27 percent of all the world's coal supplies, as I heard Congressman Gingrey state in his remarks, or whether it's the fact that we are the ``Saudi Arabia of Oil'' with three States, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, that have more oil than all of Saudi Arabia contained in shale oil. Or whether the answer is in natural gas, which we have over 420 trillion cubic square feet in the Gulf Coast region, or whether it's wind or solar or conservation. We've got it all. And again, the United States Congress is the problem. 
   What's that led to? 
   That's led to the largest wealth transfer in American history. Over $700 billion has gone out of our pockets directly overseas to people who don't like us to purchase energy. $700 billion. 
   Isn't it interesting that what we are hearing right now in this financial crisis is that the American people are being asked to pony up $700 billion to bail out private companies out of a financial mess that they've gotten themselves into. So just think about that for a moment. 
   Had we been drilling here in our own country, rather than going overseas to purchase foreign sources of energy, we would have had $700 billion worth of American dollars staying here within our own borders. 
   Now, Congressman Latta, I'm sure that you would agree with me that we would far prefer to see $700 billion worth of investment stay in the United States, because that would mean $700 billion worth of jobs that could have been created in the United States.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. What that means is $700 billion translates to one-sixth of the American economy. Eighteen percent of the American economy was transferred from your pocket at the pump overseas to people who don't like us very much. Now those countries are enriched with $700 billion worth of American money that could have stayed here. 
   You mentioned that you had the largest washing machine plant in the United States. I have the largest window manufacturer in my district. Well, we all know what's happened with the mortgage industry and with the housing industry. Imagine the impact that that's made on this company in my district for manufacturing windows. This is tremendously important. This is real. This is real pain that the American people are feeling, and it is fueling this crisis that we're seeing, both on Main Street and on Wall Street. 
   I don't know about you, but I've gotten an earful when I'm home talking to my constituents, and they want to know that, they are incredulous that the Democrat-controlled Congress, because, again, Republicans have not controlled Congress for almost 2 years. The Democrats have controlled Congress. 
   And under Democrat control, in 2 years we have seen gas prices escalate 76 percent. That's right. Gas prices have escalated 76 percent, and we have seen the largest wealth transfer in American history go out of your pocket over to countries that don't like us very much. 
   How can we reverse that? 
   Congressman Latta, what would be the solution that we can reverse that so that we could keep American money right here in the economy and start buying those American-made washing machines that are in your district and American-made windows that are in my district?

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. And if the gentleman would yield on that point, I just wanted to mention regarding jobs once more. Both yourself and I, together with eight of our colleagues, went up to Alaska 2 months ago. And while we were up in Alaska looking at the ANWR region, which, by the way is the most perfect place on the planet to drill for oil, absolutely perfect place. It's perfectly sited. Without any environmental degradation, we could increase American energy supplies by over 50 percent if we would bring on line just oil production in ANWR alone.  
   But one thing we heard when we were up there from the people who were giving us tours, the Mineral Management Service, the Bureau of Land Management told us that just bringing on line oil production in Colorado and Alaska would add over 750,000 jobs.     
   Over 750,000, three-quarters of a million American jobs, and the jobs in Alaska, we were told, start out with an astounding starting-level salary of $100,000 a year. Now, imagine that. How many Americans wouldn't be willing to go and work where they could be making $100,000 a year? Rather than being one of the largest importers of energy, America could turn around our economy by being one of the largest exporters of energy and one of the largest job creators of energy. 
   One thing I wanted to add, if I could just take a moment to a talk a little bit about the current economy and the current meltdown in the financial markets. 
   I have the privilege of sitting on the Financial Services Committee. And one thing that's important to remember, just as this energy crisis was created by the United States Congress because Congress made it illegal to access American energy and has put into law a Prohibition-era mentality on American-made energy production, so, too, Congress created this financial services mess. You ask how. Let me just briefly explain and just in a nutshell how this occurred. 
   Back in the 1930s, Congress created private companies to back mortgages. So when you go to buy a house from your bank, the bank doesn't keep that mortgage. The bank sells it to an organization called Freddie or Fannie. They're private companies. But the problem is, government implied, with a wink and a nod, that government would back up those mortgages from Freddie and Fannie. So these are private companies, but they can take any bloomin' risk they want because Uncle Sam said you're going to foot the bill in case those mortgages went sour. 
   Well, fast forward to the late 1970s. In 1977, the Credit Reinvestment Act was passed, and in the early 1990s, there were amendments made to the Credit Reinvestment Act. What did that do? It suspended, for the first time in American history, 200 years' worth of sound financial loan making. 
   So before when you and your wife, Congressman Latta, if you went to get a loan to buy a house or my husband and I got a loan to buy a house, we had to show that we were credit-worthy risks. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, the banks were ordered under penalty of fine and lawsuit, ``You don't make loans anymore to people who are creditworthy. Now you're forced to make loans to people who are not creditworthy.'' It turned the world upside down. 
   So the world of banking became like ``Alice in Wonderland'' where banking rules were turned topsy-turvy on their heads and banks were fined or threatened with lawsuits if they did not make loans, a certain quota of loans to people who weren't creditworthy. Guess what? That's when a new product called subprime loans started to be made. And unfortunately, now we all know what subprime loans are. They were made to people who weren't creditworthy, who, in other words, had no means to pay those loans back. 
   So what is happening today? Today the markets have melted down, and now the American taxpayer is being told, you, Mr. Speaker, and the American people, are being told that they have to pay for what private companies agreed to in contracts. So the beleaguered taxpayer is the forgotten man in this equation. 
   The American taxpayer didn't ask to be a part of these subprime contracts. They didn't receive any of the benefits. They didn't receive any of the profits when profits were being made. But now that losses are on the horizon, now the American taxpayer is being asked--not asked, forced to pony up at minimum $700 billion of new taxes; which, ironically, $700 billion is the exact amount of money that you, in essence, Mr. Speaker, the American people, have been taxed by these artificially high prices of gasoline. 
   There is no reason why gas prices would be $4 right now, no reason, if we would legalize American energy production. So had we been legalizing American energy production and we had prices low for the American people to pay, whether it's through heating oil or whether it's through natural gas that they pay or through electricity or at the pump, we wouldn't have been enriching all of these foreign countries. We would have had that much more money in our economy, and we may not have seen the meltdown because people would have had the wherewithal to pay their mortgages, to have high-paying jobs, and we may not have seen the subprime mess.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. It's a crisis, and if the gentleman would yield. 
   It seems that our energy policy right now is being determined by bureaucracy and by socialistic tendencies, not by the free market. It's imperative that people have the ability to choose the energy needs that they have. 
   Here in the State of Minnesota, the people that I represent, they're all very soon going to be turning their thermostats up. Some homes are heated by natural gas, some by fuel oil. And we're going to be looking potentially at dramatic spikes in costs for people on their fuel oil and home energy heating. 
   People in Minnesota don't have a choice. They have to turn on their fuel.  As the gentleman had stated, people right now are making choices about whether or not they could even afford to go to work if they're travelling 50 miles to be able to get to work. 
   I represent people in the great city of Saint Cloud, Minnesota. I toured a nursing home recently. One thing I was told by the administrators was a lot of the people that they have doing some of the basic work in the nursing homes are making not a high level of income and they don't see also that it's worth it for them to go to work. This is not a good situation that they're being put in. And again, this is artificial because we don't need to be in this situation. 
   Again, it's because, unfortunately, the Democrat-controlled Congress has maintained a prohibition-era mentality with American energy production. They're just saying, ``No way, no how.'' I don't understand that, Representative Latta. I absolutely don't understand the mindset that says when you're sitting on your own solution, why in the world wouldn't you legalize and open the door to American energy production so we can create jobs and people can pay a lower cost, and so we aren't sending $700 billion overseas. 
   Here is something I'm very concerned about, Representative Latta. It is Sharia Law, because many of the Islamic nations are now wanting to do business under Sharia Law, Islamic law. This is happening now in the United Kingdom, and this is very concerning. All of the equity, all of the liquidity, the dollars that are available to do business now are in the hands of the people of the Middle East. It makes sense. We just sent them $700 billion of American money----

   Mrs. BACHMANN. In one year at the gas pump. 
   So just think about this now: $700 billion has left American pockets, has gone overseas to the Middle East, to OPEC nations that don't like us very much, they're sitting on $700 billion worth of capital. Guess what Americans are starved for right now? Capital. Money. We have to go somewhere. Our banks right now are starved for money. We're in a credit crunch right now. But Middle Eastern nations are saying, ``Hey, you want to do business with us? You need to come under Sharia, Islamic law.'' 
   So now think of that. American companies would have to come under--not under American law, but under Sharia Law if they conduct business transactions, let alone the Chinese nation that is in the process of buying up United States' securities. 
   These are very sobering times for us in the United States Congress. We may make the most important decision and cast the most important vote of the 110th Congress this week. And that vote will be on how we handle this financial crisis. And would that the Democrat Congress last week had passed a real energy freedom bill so we could unlock American energy resources and create wealth here in the United States rather than taxing the American people yet one more time so we can continue to send more money over to OPEC and tax more money from people to put in Washington, D.C. 
   You don't want to send more money to the United States Congress that has proved themselves completely incapable of handling the American people's money. The Democrat-led Congress has proved itself completely incompetent in handling the American people's money.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. If the gentleman would yield, unfortunately, that's exactly what happened last week by the Democrat-controlled Congress. They kicked the can down the road to the next Congress, because the bill that they passed won't produce one new drop of oil or one new watt of electricity. 
   What was that whole exercise for? Did they not realize that for 21 months that gas prices have gone up 76 percent? This is shocking. This is the only thing my constituents have been talking about is the dramatic escalation in the price of energy. Everyone else seems to get it, but unfortunately, the Democrat-controlled Congress sat on its hands for 21 months, and just as the clock is striking midnight now on the 110th Congress, they pass a cruel hoax of a bill last week that won't go anywhere. It's dead on arrival in the Senate. The President will veto it. And here we are, looking at this huge crisis. And what do the American people have to look forward to? A reduction in energy prices? Not on your life. 
   Today, there was a dramatic increase in the price of oil. Why? Because international investors in oil commodities see, hey, the Democrat-controlled Congress, they're not going to do anything about bringing down the price of oil, and guess what, the clock is timing out now on the 110th Congress; I guess we can go ahead and increase the price of oil. That's speculators. 
   What speculators do is set a pricing function, and they do it based upon information. And the information that this Democrat-controlled Congress has sent out to the world markets is don't worry, we're not going to do anything to increase American energy production; we're going to keep it exactly as it is. And what that does is guarantee  that the poor, beleaguered American taxpayer, the forgotten man in all of this, is doomed to pay even higher prices of energy. 
   This is not good news, not good news at all.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. You're dead on when you talk about the hurricane, dealing with Hurricane Ike recently, and the devastation that ensued in the gulf coast region, and then also we look on the international front what's happening. 
   Russia invaded Georgia not too long ago, and of course, we know that a big part of that invasion had to do with controlling oil. I mean, it was only a few months ago that we saw newspaper accounts. It almost seemed humorous because there was a Russian-made submarine that traveled under the arctic region and planted a Russian flag at the bottom of the Arctic Sea and said, We take this Arctic Sea for Russia. 
   Well, as if the Americans hadn't been there years prior and had made claims, but it makes sense because just several weeks later the U.S. Geological Survey released a report that stated there's an estimated 90 billion, 90 billion barrels of oil that are under the Arctic Sea. There are tremendous international pressures right now and particularly with Russia making very aggressive incursions in the Arctic and also in Georgia. This makes the United States even more vulnerable. 
   But again, great news is on the horizon. We have the answer right here in our border. The problem has been the Democrat-controlled Congress has said ``no'' to American energy production.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I want to thank the gentlelady from Colorado for yielding to me and for bringing this important measure forward. 
   I want to thank Ranking Member Regula for the hard work that he has done on this bill, and also to the chairman for the work that he has done as well. 
   I have to say that I hope that my ears deceive me in the remarks that I just heard from the chairman. It almost sounded as though the chairman was calling the President of the United States a liar in his remarks. I certainly hope that that wasn't true. If so, I would call on him to take down his remarks, and I trust that that is not the intention of the chairman in his previous remarks. 
   Mr. Chairman, what I would like to say in the course of my moments before this body is that I believe that all of us are trying to do the best that we can for regular Americans. What the gentlelady from Colorado is trying to do is exceptional. 
   We had an amendment that was offered previously by Mr. Jordan of Ohio, an excellent amendment that called to have spending at 2007 levels. That makes perfect sense for most of the people in this country, because many people, many businesses, don't have that opportunity to be able to increase their budget at all, let alone to this level of 9.9 percent. 
   In fact, I will tell you, just in my home State of Minnesota, we have Northwest Airlines, a wonderful, marvelous employer that's had to deal with unbelievable problems since 9/11. 
   With all of the events that have occurred, that have happened to airlines, their employees have had to endure incredible cuts in their salary. The pilots union, the mechanics union, the stewardesses union, all of them have had to endure cuts. They haven't even been able to stay the same at previous years' levels on their wages, much less increase by 9.9 percent their wages, or, as our colleague, Dr. Price, wanted to cut that increase by 1 percent, 9.9, back to 8.9. Now the gentlelady from Colorado wants to back it off just one-half a percent. 
   Surely this body should see the wisdom in the gentlelady's amendment. All she wants to do is just have a modicum of economy in her amendment. Surely we should be able to see the wisdom in that. 
   I have a businessman who has a legacy industry that feeds into the auto industry. He has a business in Minnesota, and he has had to cut costs so dramatically that their business will literally almost go by the wayside if they can't turn things around. 
   Again, what we are seeing, with businesses, with family, especially in my home State of Minnesota, businesses not only can't increase their expenses by 9.9 percent. They can't increase it by 9.5, 8.9 percent, they can't increase at all. They have to cut back. That's called productivity. That's what America is about. That's one thing Americans do so well. They find more economical ways to produce more with less. 
   Usually in the course of that, when businessmen are involved in that sort of an adventure, they are somehow able to pay their employees a little bit more by being more productive. They can't always do that, but sometimes that can occur. 
   Here in this situation, the gentlelady from Colorado just has a very simple goal, and that is just to decrease by 0.5 percent the amount that's being proposed. 
   The budget is all about people. At the end of the day, it's the people in my district and your district that are paying this big spending spree, almost 10 percent increase in spending over the last year. It's almost as though the people in Congress believe that if at the end of your name you have a comma, and the letters I-n-c period, that this body believes that there is an unending checkbook that this body can dive into and pull a wallet out of a business and say, you've got more.  
   So we year after year after year go back to the same well. We go back to the American taxpayer. We go back to American business, and we continue to put burdens on them such that we dig into their wallet and think there is more where that came from. 
   There is not more where that came from. We looked at the budget battle earlier in this year. In the budget that the majority proposed, there wasn't one attempt to address the problem that we have with unfunded net liabilities that are coming across this Congress in future years, unfunded net liabilities with Social Security, unfunded net liabilities with Medicare. These are very real costs that we are going to have to deal with. This majority in Congress didn't look at that in its bill. 
   So it's almost as though this Congress is saying we are going to see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. We are making a conscious decision, it seems, to just ignore the very real threat of economic, unfunded net liabilities that are facing this Congress. 
   I submit again to this body that what the gentlelady is trying to do in her very forward-looking amendment is wise. She is saying let's just pull back a little bit on this grand spending spree and be kind to Americans. Let's be kind to American industry, kind to the American taxpayer and say we understand your plight. We understand that you do more with less, and we are going to do the same. 
   I would say let's not have the largest tax increase in American history that our friends across the aisle are proposing. Let's not have the largest spending increase in American history. Let's do what Americans do so beautifully, and that's let's be productive. Let's increase productivity, not by government spending more, but by making sure that we return more money to the American taxpayer and say, you know what? We can do what New Zealand did just very recently.     
   We can take reform. We can actually do something completely revolutionary, and it would be that we would look at every government program and say, justify what you're doing is right. Justify that what you're doing is helping the American consumer; you're achieving objectives. Instead of the other way around, which is continuing to add more money, in this case, 10 percent, almost 10 percent more increase in a program, without first causing those programs to justify that they're helping the American people. 
   And that's why I'm so proud of the gentlelady from Colorado (Mrs. Musgrave). She's just trying to bring a very commonsense rationalization to the spending that's being proposed by this body. 
   If we can't do what Mr. Jordan suggested which, in itself, was very wise, go with 2007 level of spending, which for a lot of American companies, they'd love to be able to have 2007 level of spending. They can't do that. They've got to cut back even more just to stay afloat. 
   Or do what was proposed by Dr. Price, which is cut back 1 percent of spending. We can't even cut back, as the gentlelady from Colorado proposes, by one-half a percent? 
   We can do better than that. In my short time here in Congress, one thing I've seen is that, no matter if it's on the Republican side of the aisle or the Democrat side of the aisle, there's a lot of really smart people in this chamber. And I believe that we can do better, Mr. Chairman. And I believe that the gentlelady has a very wise, very commonsense approach, and I would think that the majority body could certainly accede to the fact that we can cut back by one-half a percent, so that we're now going to be spending, then, about 9.4 percent increase.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (THE TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you, Ms. Foxx. I appreciate that. 
   Minneapolis/St. Paul is a very nice area. Minnesota is the ``Land of Minnesota Nice,'' and we really do love  people. So y'all come back, if we can borrow that from you. Y'all come back. 
   My name is Michelle Bachmann. I do represent Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District, and I tell you what I am so pleased about is the fact that the United States, we have the answer to our energy problem. 
   We have, as Representative Dent of Pennsylvania said, we have an abundance of coal. We're the leader in the world. Twenty-seven percent of the world's supply of coal lies here in the United States of America. 
   We're the Saudi Arabia of oil in three States alone: Utah, Colorado, Wisconsin. We have more oil than all of Saudi Arabia contained in shale oil. 
   We have an abundance of natural gas. We have over 420 trillion cubic square feet of natural gas, and that's just in the Gulf of Mexico. 
   We have so much oil and we haven't even begun to tap what we have in terms of nuclear power, what we can do with wind, what we can do with solar, with all of the inventions that are yet to come out of brilliant young entrepreneurs. All we need to do is unleash it. 
   But right now, you're looking, Mr. Speaker, at the problem for this, for the energy crisis. It isn't lack of resources. It certainly isn't lack of technology. What it is is lack of will on the part of the United States Congress. Mr. Speaker, the Democrat-controlled United States Congress is the problem for America's energy crisis. Look no further. The Democrat-controlled Congress, under their leadership, their auspicious leadership, has led to an increase of 76 percent in the price of gasoline at the pump.     
   Seventy-six percent increase. I've only been here 20 months, and we've seen gas prices go up 76 percent under Democrat-controlled leadership. 
   Minority leader John Boehner made a decision late in the month of July. He decided to lead 10 Republicans to go up to Alaska to visit the ANWR region that has been so vilified, that we've been told that we absolutely cannot drill up in ANWR, that somehow the world will come to an end if we drill in ANWR. Well, John Boehner, with his leadership, took 10 Republicans--and I was blessed enough to be one of those Republicans to go not only to Colorado to visit the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, but also up to Alaska to ANWR. 
   And there is one little story that I want to tell the American people before I hand this over to my colleagues to continue, and it's this: While we were up in Alaska visiting our oil-rich region where we were able to go to the North Slope--here is the North Slope of Alaska. Thirty-one years ago, the North Slope of Alaska was the largest producing oil field in the United States. Sadly, 31 years later, this is still the largest producing oil region. Why? Because we have a Prohibition-era mentality when it comes to production of American energy legislation. Because this Congress has made a decision: No more energy production here; if we're going to have energy, we've got to buy it offshore. Well, that is ridiculous; it's why we're in the situation we're in. 
   But here in the North Slope 31 years ago, when we began building this energy lifeline which is our North Slope Trans-Alaska Pipeline which extends 800 miles from Prudhoe Bay down to Valdez, when we built that 31 years ago we were producing 2.1 million barrels of oil a day. Do you know where we're at now? Seven hundred thousand barrels a day. Within 10 years we will be down to $300,000 barrels a day. You know what happens, Mr. Speaker, when we get down to 300,000 barrels a day? When we get to that point, this energy lifeline that feeds the lower 48, it's going to shut down. And, I mean, when it shuts down, you can't add another oil field and bring it back up into production. And do you know, Mr. Speaker, what it costs us to replace this energy lifeline? Fifteen billion dollars. And it isn't just the $15 billion, it would take several years to rebuild this because this pipeline is made out of stainless steel, and stainless steel doesn't come cheap anymore. 
   We are in trouble. Because if, as the Democrat nominee, Barack Obama, has said, he doesn't plan to do any more drilling, and Speaker Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat-controlled House, has said she really doesn't plan any more drilling, or as Harry Reid has told us, he really doesn't believe in more drilling, if the Democrats have their way, there won't be more drilling. And so we will have this energy pipeline that has served our interests for over 31 years, it's going to shut down within 10 years time. Shut down. So if we thought $4 a gallon was a lot to pay for energy, we're going to think that's a cheap date because it's going to be $6, $8, $10 a gallon because the Democrat-controlled Congress has said, no how, no way, not on their watch are we ever going to start drilling. It's not going to happen. And it's not going to happen under Barack Obama. 
   There is a very real choice that the voters have to make come this November, and it's this: Do you want to pay $2 a gallon for gas under a President McCain and a Vice President Palin--who will drill, by the way, for new energy--or do you want to pay $6, $8 or $10 a gallon for gasoline very soon under a Barack Obama and a Democrat-controlled Congress who said no way, no how, never under their watch will they begin the drilling process? It's that simple: $2 a gallon, or $6, $8 or $10 a gallon? That's what the American people will be asking themselves. 
   And I'll tell you one thing, under a Republican-controlled Congress, if we can get there this fall, this November, there will be a change. There will be drilling in ANWR. There will be drilling in the oil shale region. There will be drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. There will be expansion of clean coal technology. There will be building of 45 new nuclear power plants. Instead of being the world's greatest dependent on foreign energy importation, we will become the world's leading exporter of energy. 
   Can you imagine? Millions of jobs, high-paying jobs. And I will end with this. As a matter of fact, up in Alaska, what I was told is that entry-level jobs on the North Slope pay over $100,000 a year plus benefits. There's a lot of people from the great State of Minnesota that would go up to take those jobs. 
   We have the answer. We have got the ticket. We don't have to be mired under $4 a gallon gas or $6 or $8 or $10. Under a Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Speaker, the American people will get back to paying $2 a gallon or less. This is real, and it can happen very quickly. And that's why I'm so grateful to the gentlelady from North Carolina for bringing this important discussion and reminding the American people that under a Democrat-controlled Congress we've seen gasoline prices increase 76 percent. And that can take a nosedive if we see real change at the ballot box this November.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, in this debate tonight I think we can all stipulate that discrimination in the workforce is wrong. It is wrong if it is against employees, and it is wrong if it is against employers. This bill may very well be seen as discrimination against honest American employers, job creators, because it has a seemingly unending period to file a lawsuit. 
   With that, women may very well experience real discrimination in that they may find that future employers are reluctant to hire them in the first place for fear of a lawsuit 5, 10, 20, maybe even 40 years down the road. Let's face it, memories fade, people die, they move away, and it becomes difficult, if not downright impossible, for a job creator to defend themselves. 
   It is a very impractical bill that we are looking at and could likely result in even more paperwork and higher cost for employers, and ultimately less wages for all American employees. 
   Congress needs to stop discriminating against American companies that are just trying to provide decent jobs to great employees. Instead, I think Congress should focus on enhancing American competitiveness and American prosperity.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (PROMOTING NEW AMERICAN ENERGY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, as part of our action plan for energy, Republicans in the United States House of Representatives are asking that we push forward with an all-of-the-above energy plan to utilize every source of American energy to release us from our dependence on foreign oil. 
   That's why today I'm introducing, Mr. Speaker, the Promoting New American Energy Act which accelerates tax depreciation to 3 years for investments in newer, cleaner, more efficient technologies, including wind, solar, and geothermal, as well as others. 
   According to the nonprofit American Council for Capital Formation, American energy investments have less favorable tax depreciation rules in the United States compared to many other countries. This does not put America in a good position for alternatives. 
   My bill will bring America's tax depreciation schedule in line with those of our major trading partners overseas, which will put America on a better foot globally, and that means more jobs in the United States. 
   This will take us one step closer, Mr. Speaker, to increasing domestic energy production and making it more efficient. 
   As a member of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, I ask my colleagues to promote newer, cleaner, more efficient energy solutions.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX IS A LUMP OF COAL -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, 'tis the season to be jolly for Americans, unless, of course, you happen to be a tax planner or a taxpayer wondering if your finances are going to throw you into a sea of confusion when you file your tax return in April of 2008. Under the current tax filing mess, because the majority has failed to repeal the alternative minimum tax, the average tax increase for tens of millions of Americans will increase by over $2,000. 
   Children hope for candy or presents in their stocking and not a lump of coal. But since 1969, the alternative minimum tax has represented a lump of coal for millions of Americans. We should do right by the American people, Madam Speaker, and put an end to the alternative minimum tax once and for all. That's a Christmas present every American can use.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (FUNDING FOR OUR TROOPS -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, my message this morning is very simple, and it is this. Our troops in combat deserve to be sent the resources and the reinforcements that they deserve to succeed in their mission in Iraq without strings and without delay. 
   Putting in place a time line that allows for no flexibility and that culminates with a date certain for withdrawal just simply micromanages our commanders in the field and, unfortunately, will undermine the effort of our troops on the ground. 
   Today, General Petraeus has offered to meet with Members of Congress concerning the war effort, and I look forward to meeting with the general. I hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will be there as well. 
   Can we remember that this war is truly about defeating terrorists, and that it is our effort to come together now, as Americans, to fight for freedom that will ultimately lead to our peace.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (GSE REFORM -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, promoting homeownership, especially homeownership for low and moderate income families, is a high priority for Republicans in this United States Congress. The GSEs, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have played a very important part in that goal. We ought to preserve that system, Madam Speaker, we ought to protect that system. However, Congress also has a responsibility to limit the risks that the GSEs pose to the United States taxpayers and their burden to that market. 
   Many of my colleagues have been working for years to enact meaningful reform of the GSEs and their regulator. That's a good thing. But this year's bill goes far beyond improving the safety and the soundness of the GSEs by now taxing those portfolios to create an affordable housing fund. 
   I agree with the Congressional Budget Office, Madam Speaker. This new assessment on the GSEs will be passed along to customers in the form of higher fees. It will raise the cost of purchasing a home or refinancing a mortgage. That is exactly the opposite direction that we want to go. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this fund.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (THE HIGH PRICE OF ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the privilege of being able to address the House for this special order of 60 minutes. And the topic tonight will be on the topic that's on the minds of Americans all across this country. It's the high price of energy and the impact that that is having on the middle class, on families, on individuals, on farmers and on businessmen. 
   There is nothing that is shocking us more now, Mr. Speaker, than the high cost of energy and the impact that that is having directly on people all across the country. 
   When I came into Washington, D.C. this week from my home in Minnesota, I had the privilege of representing the great people in the Sixth Congressional District in Minnesota. And I was reading the newspaper. And I was reading a few things. And I just wanted to bring a couple of headlines to the attention of the American people. 
   Here is one of the headlines that I read this week when I came in. It was on Tuesday of this week. This headline in USA Today said ``will gas prices plateau after hitting another record?'' It seems like every morning when we wake up and the clock radio goes off next to our bed, we hear about a new increase in the price in gasoline. And we're shocked. And it's like our day already starts out on the wrong foot because we hear about yet one more shocking increase. And we wonder what will we have to give up next? What will we have to give up? What will we have to yield out of our lives? It's a lot of bad news that has been coming this way with the American people. 
   Let me read this. It says ``$4 plus cost cuts demand even as supply is rising.'' It began, The price of gasoline set another record Monday where the average is going up now again. And this is something that the people are worried about.     
   This is something that the people are worried about, the record prices that are going up. As a matter of fact, the price of gasoline today is $4.07 and we will talk a little bit more about that as we go on during the course of the hour that we have together to talk about this very important issue. 
   Here is another headline that was in USA Today, and this is Tuesday's paper again, and it says, ``Prepare to pay if you don't gas up your car rental.'' If you can believe this, rental car companies are having to charge $8 a gallon when someone who is renting a car returns it to an airport with a less than full tank. Usually we try to guess as well as we can and fill that tank up before we return it to the car rental place because we know the price at the pump for the car rental will be higher. 
   Well, guess what, that price is now a whooping $8 to $10 a gallon that car rental companies are forced to charge their customers now when cars are returned to the car rental company with a less-than-full tank. 
   These are numbers, I believe, Mr. Speaker, that none of us ever thought in our wildest dreams that we would ever imagine that we could be paying. This is a lot of bad news that the American people are having to take, along with the flooding, the terrible, terrible conditions that people in Iowa are facing right now, in Arkansas and Missouri, with all of the impact of the weather. 
   We hear yet more negative reports about how our crops will be impacted. In Iowa, nearly all of the counties are devastated. I was born in the State of Iowa in Waterloo, Cedar Falls, where the Cedar River came up over its banks and flooded that downtown area, displacing hundreds and thousands of people from their homes, and people from their businesses. 
   And Iowa, as I know from my experience, is a leading corn producer and soybean producer, and so now we see that the price of corn will also probably be going up. 
   Well, I didn't ask for this hour, to manage this hour just to talk about gloom and doom and the negative. The reason why I started out with these comments, Mr. Speaker, is to identify with all of the American people at home right now who are experiencing this pain, who are experiencing this suffering that they never imagined they would be experiencing with the high cost of energy. 
   But I am here tonight because I want to talk about the great news, and the great news is this: we are privileged to stand right now on the answer to the problem that is plaguing us, the high cost of energy. And the great news is that we have a key. We have an answer. The American people, the American middle class don't need to suffer any longer. It is unnecessary because we have a key that can be the answer to our problem. And here it is. We can get back to our goal which is $2 a gallon gasoline. This isn't fantasy, this is reality. We can once again see America paying $2 a gallon gasoline. 
   Are you kidding? How is that going to happen, you ask. Well, easy. This is how we can do it. We need to start to explore here in America. Because the truth be told, America does not have a famine of energy, absolutely not. Just the opposite. We are sitting on the cusp of one of the greatest industries that can be developed in this century and on into the future, one that will deliver millions of high-paying jobs for Americans all across this country. In fact, in every State in this country America could become the leading exporter of energy. You heard me right. America could be the world's leading exporter of energy and create some of the highest-paying jobs known in the world because right here in America we are standing on a veritable treasure trove of energy. So we need to start here, start in America, to access these wonderful resources and we need to do it now in order to get back to $2 a gallon gasoline. In order to be able to get off of foreign dependence on energy, we need to explore here and we need to explore now because then the American people can start to pay less, and that paying less would get us back to $2 a gallon gasoline. 
   You say how is that possible? How is it possible that once again we could be paying $2 a gallon gasoline? Well, just think, it took us 25 years in this country to go from $1 a gallon gasoline to $2 a gallon gasoline; 25 years to go from $1 to $2. 
   How long did it take us to go from $2 a gallon gasoline to $4 a gallon gasoline and even more a gallon gasoline? It took us less than 2 years to go from $2 to $4. 
   Well, what changed? There are a few things that came into the mix. One is the American dollar came into a weakened position. And when the American dollar became weakened, the United States unfortunately found itself very dependent on foreign sources of energy that we were dependent on. 
   Do you know that from 2007 to 2008 the United States has become 7 percent more dependent on the OPEC nations for our energy, going exactly in the wrong direction. 
   I don't know of anyone right now, Mr. Speaker, who believes that America should become more dependent on foreign oil. In fact, what I hear from my constituents is can't we get less dependent. 
   Absolutely. We can be less dependent on foreign oil. In fact, we can become independent of foreign oil and we can become a leading exporter of energy to the world and we can become the head, and not the tail. 
   Right now America is busy becoming part of the tail when it comes to energy. But we can turn this around. We can become the leading producer and exporter. Well, you ask, how is that possible? I will tell you how it is possible. Take a look at the situation we are in right now. Here is the key to our answer, and now it is up to Congress to unlock that key, unleash this energy and bring the price of gasoline back down to $2 a gallon. It is Congress that has been the bad guy in this scenario. And it is Congress that can be the hero in this scenario. Congress. 
   Right now Congress has made it illegal, virtually illegal to be able to access this gift of energy. How did we do that? Congress has made it illegal to access the energy that is in the Arctic energy slope up in Alaska. 
   Do you realize that we already have the Alaskan transatlantic pipeline that was built in the mid-1970s from Prudhoe Bay and has been piping oil from Alaska down into the lower 48. That pipeline is already up in existence, and it is only half of capacity flowing. With a very little effort, we could tap into the Arctic energy slope and begin accessing that over 10 billion barrels of oil that are available to us in the Arctic energy slope. 
   Do you realize that if we accessed this wonderful source of energy, we will increase American energy production by 50 percent, access to American resources by 50 percent. Also, we have the Outer Continental Shelf that is available to us for deep sea energy reserves. 
   Now get this, if you thought 10 billion barrels was a lot, just listen, this is 86 billion barrels of oil. You heard me, 86 billion barrels that are available to us to access of deep sea energy reserves that we could tap, get up online, and we could have access to and supply the American people and American industry so that energy would become one of the cheapest costs of doing business rather than one of the most expensive. 
   Let me give you one little story that I heard yesterday. Northwest Airlines is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We are proud to have this airline in our State. As you know, airlines have come under hard times. I was told yesterday that Northwest Airlines had paid about a billion and a half dollars for fuel last year. Do you know what they had to budget this year, an additional $2 billion to pay for the price of energy. 
   So Northwest Airlines, instead of spending about a billion and a half on energy, will have to spend this year $3.5 billion on energy. Can you imagine, if that's your industry and that cost, you have to somehow absorb, you just can't absorb it without passing that cost on to your consumer, to your customer, who will be purchasing your product. And those are people who fly on airplanes. That is why we see the price of airline tickets have gone through the roof and why airlines have had to park planes and reduce the number of seats and reduce capacity. Don't fool yourself, America is changing, and we are changing because we don't have energy. 
   Not only that, we have a gift of natural gas. In the gulf coast region in the Gulf of Mexico, we have what may be  the largest reserves of natural gas, 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas exists right here in the gulf coast region. Do you know that natural gas can be used to fire up electric power plants. With modifications to cars and buses, we could run cars and buses on natural gas. Almost the world's largest supply right here in our backyard, illegal, off-limits. And 85 percent of our Outer Continental Shelf, illegal, off-limits. The Arctic energy slope, illegal, off-limits. And also shale. Do you realize that the Saudi Arabia of oil in the United States is this wonderful ring of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, containing 1.3 trillion, yes, you heard me right, 1.3 trillion barrels of shale oil. This is one of the most exciting finds. We have one of the world's largest supplies of shale oil right here in our backyard. But guess what, it is off-limits. We are handcuffed. We can't access it. Who made all of this off-limits? 
   Do you realize the United States of America is one of the only countries in the world that has made it illegal to access the answer to our problem; made it illegal to access our own energy. We have this great gift waiting for us, great job producer waiting for us. And it is the United States Congress, your representatives, which have said no, no way, we are not going to access it. 
   When I talk to the American people about this back home, when I talk to average Minnesotans, they look at me and they say, Michele, what in the world is Congress thinking? Why in the world wouldn't they allow us? Don't they want us to have $2 a gallon gas? I wonder sometimes, too. 
   We have the key right here, and I have other Members who are with me right now who would also like to weigh in, who are leaders on this issue, passionate about this issue, people who are speaking out and advocating for you, the American people, who want you to be able to again get up in the morning with a happy, light heart realizing you can afford to go to the gas station because you can be paying $2 a gallon gas again. You can see your grocery bills go down. You can see your consumables go down. You can see the price that you are going to be paying for air conditioning this summer and your electric bill go down. This fall in Minnesota when all the furnaces kick back in again, to be able to see your heat bill go back down, this is all to be, all possible. 
   We have a great story to tell tonight, so I hope that you will listen for the next few minutes, and I would like to yield to the distinguished gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King). There is not a day that goes by that Representative Steve King is not here on the floor advocating for the good of the American people, to get back to paying $2 a gallon gasoline. 
   With that, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (THE HIGH PRICE OF ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate that. 
   I'm sure everyone tonight, Mr. Speaker, can hear the passion in the voices of the people who are speaking in this Special Order hour. It's because we understand from our constituents back home how real this is for them. This is an issue where the American people are way ahead of people in Congress. They get it, how difficult this is, and that's why we have been repeatedly asking our constituents back home in our districts ``Why don't you go ahead and show us how painful this is, how difficult this is, how real this is. Take your receipts from your car when you go and fill up your tank or, if you are a trucker, when you fill up your truck. Take those receipts. Fill them up. Send them to us. Send them to your Member of Congress. We want to be able to have them here so we can demonstrate what tremendous agony this is for Americans.'' 
   I believe that we should have bushel baskets full of receipts from people when they fill up their gas tanks so we can show people how real this is, the pain at the pump, because that represents money that every person is paying today, money that would be needless, that we don't have to pay because we know we can get back to $2 a gallon. How do we know that? 
   We know that rather than paying $4.07, which is today's national average for gasoline--it still shocks me when I see that number up on a billboard. We know we've got our answer. This is our answer: Our natural gift from God that he has given to the United States. God has given us these natural resources, and it is our obligation to be good stewards of what we have and to take dominion over this, to take dominion and to cultivate what we have in a safe, sound and environmentally sensitive way so we can take care of the needs of our people and yet also be good stewards of the land. 
   We have two very different philosophies that we're looking at. For those of us who are speaking now in the Special Order, we're saying explore America; do it now so that Americans can pay less. There is a completely different philosophy that has also been talked about in recent weeks, and that plan is to pay more and to drive less. That's really what it comes down to. Pay more and drive less. But is that what we want for Americans? Is that what we want for this generation and for the next generation? I don't, because this is what I'm concerned about: Whoever controls fuel will control our freedom. Think about that. Whoever controls our energy will control our freedom and will control the future. 
   Congressman Steve King of Iowa was talking a little bit about climate control legislation, and it's also called a cap-and-trade system. Now, I don't call it ``cap and trade.'' I call it ``tax and spend'' because that's really what it is, in a nutshell, if you want to know what ``cap and trade'' is. 
   Before I hand this off to Representative Phil Gingrey from Georgia, who has some comments he would like to make, I just want to say a little bit about cap and trade, or what I call ``tax and spend.'' 
   This proposal that has been coming from people who want you to pay more and drive less, that's their answer regarding this energy crisis. You pay more and you drive less. As a matter of fact, we heard from the nominee of one of the major political parties that his concern was not the high price that Americans are paying for gasoline but how quickly that price is rising. 
   Well, I think, for those of us who are speaking tonight in this special hour, our real concern is that high price of gasoline because we see not only is it impacting people personally in their pocketbooks, not only is it having a devastating impact on the economy, but it's also impacting our national security because, as we are more dependent on foreign oil and as we're paying ever-increasing prices and sending billions--and now it will soon be $1 trillion--off to other countries that don't like us very much, we are seeing that negative impact here at home. 
   Let me just say a few words about cap and trade, or tax and spend. Tax and spend works like this: 
   If you think you're already paying a high price for energy, now what your Federal Government wants to do is to force you to pay for the right to buy that energy. As if it isn't punishing enough to just buy the energy in the first place, you're going to have to pay for the right to buy energy. Now, think of that madness. You're going to have to buy a permit if you're a business. If you're an individual, you're going to be paying indirectly for that permit. 
   By the way, the Federal Government created the problem. Congress created these high prices. Now, if they haven't mucked it up already, Congress wants to charge you for the right to purchase overly inflated prices of energy. Think of that. By the year 2025, Congress in one bill wants to tax you $6.7 trillion. They want you to pay $6.7 trillion in this tax for the right to purchase very expensive energy. Think of what that is going to do to our economy. 
   If you do that and if we comply with what all of these grandiose schemes are, guess what the bottom line result will be out of this cap-and-trade or, what I call, tax-and-spend legislation? By the way, the brain trusts who have come up with this scheme have already spent this $6.7 trillion. They have already decided how they're going to spend this money. 
   But guess what the final result will be. If everything goes perfectly, according to plan, they will only reduce the Earth's temperature, according to their models, by seven one hundredths of a percent. Just think. Are we really willing to devastate the United States' economy? For what? To cool the Earth? Maybe. At seven one hundredths of a percent? 
   We need to think about this really carefully and have a debate right here, a genuine debate, where you see a few more Members of Congress in the room who are debating this very serious issue. This is serious enough that we are here tonight because we want the American people to know that there are answers, and we don't have to go along with all of this folderol, the tax and spend and all of the nonsense that goes on. 
   Let me tell you one of the first bills that we voted on this week. We voted to make it illegal to transport monkeys across State lines. I'm not making this up. This is absolutely the truth. We all got on planes that emit a lot of carbon. We came from all corners of the United States so that we could have the right--you heard me--to vote to make it illegal to transport monkeys across State lines. That was the most pressing thing that this body had to do this week while you were busy getting out of bed in the morning, paying $4.07 a gallon, thinking, ``Now what am I going to do? Now what am I going to have to give up so I can pay $4.07 a gallon?'' But don't worry. In the United States Congress, we made it illegal to transport monkeys across State lines. 
   If you don't think that's bad enough, do you know what we did a couple of weeks ago? It is absolutely true, and it happened right here on this floor. We voted to send your money--I did not vote for it, but enough people in this body voted for it. We voted to send 
   $25 million of your money to foreign countries in foreign aid to pay for foreign cats and foreign dogs, not even American cats and dogs in foreign countries. We spent your money, $25 million, and sent it to foreign countries to pay for foreign cats and foreign dogs. 
   As if that were not bad enough, the next day, we sent more millions to foreign countries to pay for foreign birds. Well, at least we didn't do that for foreign monkeys. All we did is make it illegal to transport monkeys across State lines. This is what your United States Congress has been doing while you've been busy spending $4.07 a gallon. That's a travesty. 
   That's why we're here tonight to tell you don't give up hope yet. We're saying let's explore America. Let's explore  now so that you can pay less because, otherwise, we'll have to go with their answer. Remember what their answer is: Pay more. Drive less. I don't think that's what we want to do. 
   That's why I want you to hear from my distinguished colleague from Georgia's 11th District. His name is Dr. Phil Gingrey. I'd like you to give him some attention so that he can talk to you about what he knows to be true about energy.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (THE HIGH PRICE OF ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey. Thank you for those important words. And again, I appreciate the expertise that you bring to bear on this wonderful debate tonight. 
   Remember, there's two ways that we can go about approaching this problem. We can go with the philosophy that says pay more, drive less, put on your sweater, lower your thermostat and sit home, give in to defeat, just think it's over, suck your thumb. 
   Mr. Speaker, that's one philosophy that the American people could embrace, but I don't think that's the American way. I don't think that's the ``can do'' spirit. I don't think that's what the founders of this Nation bled and died for. 
   I think if they were here right now, they'd be telling us, wake up, take a look at reality. We have got the answer right here in America. 
   We haven't talked an awful lot about nuclear power tonight. That's something that we can look at as well. We've talked about exploring the Arctic energy slope, Representative Steve King spoke about that and what the landscape looks like and the fact that we can do this in a wonderfully clean, environmentally sensitive way. It's entirely possible. 
   We can explore our deep sea reserves which contain over 86 billion barrels of oil, perhaps even more. We can access those. 
   Also, our natural gas that's available to us in the Gulf of Mexico area, and also the shale energy reserves where we are the Saudi Arabia of oil in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. 
   Nuclear power, we know that France derives 80 percent of its energy from nuclear power. I'm grateful that there's a nuclear power plant in my district in Monticello, Minnesota. It's such a wonderfully reliable source of energy, clean, and has zero emissions. 
   And also tax incentives for alternative energy. Can you believe that we would let these incentives expire, Mr.  Speaker, these incentives for alternative energies, whether it's wind, solar or biofuels? We shouldn't let these expire, we should extend these. 
   Because what we are saying on the Republican side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, is let's get a big table, like a big table like we have here in the well this evening, and let's take every answer that America has, put it on the table, let's develop that resource. Let's have dominion over that resource. Let's open it up, cultivate it, use it in a wise way. 
   You know, Mr. Speaker, the United States is one of the only countries in the world that actually saw a reduction in its emissions over this last year. We didn't sign the Kyoto Treaty, yet nations all across the world that signed the Kyoto Treaty, they saw their emissions go up. Europe, the EU countries have signed a cap and trade system, or what we call the tax and spend system because that describes it more accurately. Europe has actually seen an increase in its emissions. Think of that. 
   I think it's good for us, I'm glad that Europe decided to go that route before the United States made the mistake of going down that road. It's important, Mr. Speaker, that we know what we're getting into before we take that plunge. 
   I just wanted to give a couple of statistics before I hand the next few moments over to my distinguished colleague from the great State of Michigan, Representative Tim Walberg, and it's this: It's the facts. All we have to do is look at the facts. This isn't junk science. These are facts, Mr. Speaker. And if you look at the facts of voting patterns over the last 15 years, I'm not talking about the last 15 days, the last 15 months, but if you look at the voting patterns of this Congress over the last 15 years, Mr. Speaker, this is what you'll find out. Over 90 percent of the time, House Republicans voted to increase production of American-made oil and gas. You heard me right. Over 91 percent of the time Republicans voted to explore in America, to explore now for American oil and gas. The Republicans have not been the obstacles. The Republicans haven't been perfect by a long shot. There's a lot of missed opportunities the Republicans have made. But over 91 percent of the time you've been able to count, Mr. Speaker, the American people have been able to count on the Republicans to vote to explore for American oil and American gas now. 
   Let's take a look at the other statistic. Almost 90 percent of the time, 86 percent of the time, to be exact, that's the percentage of time that the House Democrats, over the last 15 years, have voted against increasing the production of American-made oil and gas. Those numbers are almost flipped. And I have no joy in giving those numbers, because my preference, and my heart is to see Republicans and Democrats come together. Now we're in a crisis. We can't be partisan right now. We have to be about America right now because now is about solutions and answers so we can get to our goal, $2 a gallon gasoline. And it's real, and it's possible, and we can get there sooner if we start now. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to hand over the next few moments to my distinguished colleague from the great State of Michigan, Representative Tim Walberg, who has tremendous passion, and who also has stood on this floor and managed an hour on energy so that he can also get his passion to the American people for the answers that he knows are available to make all of our lives better, Mr. Speaker, so we can get back to $2 a gallon gasoline.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you to the representative from Michigan, TIM WALBERG. I appreciate that. 
   We are a great country. I believe that we are the greatest country that the world has ever seen. And in this country, in the fields of Pennsylvania, over 100 years ago was discovered a resource called oil; and that resource literally changed the world, changed this Nation, and allowed us to grow and to prosper in a way that our forefathers never dreamed would even be a possibility. 
   We have that future yet in front of us again, Mr. Speaker. That future lies before us. It isn't time to throw in the towel for the American people. I know I'm not willing to have my generation be the last generation that sees growth. I don't want my children to live in the shadow of history in a declining Nation. 
   I don't think most American people want that. We want a future. We want a hope, and that's something that we can have, and we have to have energy in order to make that happen. 
   Now, remember, there's two choices that we talked about tonight. We can have one that is pay more, drive less, put on your sweater, lower your thermostat and sit at home. That's one philosophy. 
   And as Representative Walberg said, there were people on the opposite side of the aisle, Democrats yesterday who said, and I quote, we, the government, should own the refineries. Then we can control how much gets out into the market. 
   I stipulate, Mr. Speaker, that's exactly the wrong message for us. We, instead of having the Federal Government nationalizing industries, want to explore here, explore now, pay less. And I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD RECEIPT CLARIFICATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise as the chief cosponsor of H.R. 4008 to support this important bill, and I want to associate myself strongly with the remarks from the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mahoney) and thank him for the important work that he brought to bear on this bill, also Ms. Bean for her work on the bill and also for Mrs. Biggert, as well, for working with me to help protect American business and consumers from frivolous lawsuits. 
   Millions of consumers across America will experience a little extra pain in the pocketbook unless Congress passes The Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act and businesses across America, both large and small, from Main Street to Wall Street will be hurt as well. 
   They are watching Congress this week to see if we care; and, second, to see if we are paying attention to them. They are watching us to see if we can work across the aisle, which I am happy to say we are working across the aisle, to pass a simple but critical update to The Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act, otherwise known as FACTA. In an effort to prevent theft and fraud, Congress required through FACTA that businesses print, as was stated earlier in our testimony, only the last five digits or less of a person's credit card or just the expiration date on transaction receipts. 
   Many companies made sure that they printed no more than five digits of the receipt, but they also printed the expiration date. Many simply just weren't clear on the new requirement. 
   Unfortunately, trial lawyers in America saw opportunity knocking, and they found a way to take advantage of this situation. Lawyers' eyes lit up with dollar signs, and they began filing suits against companies across the United States. Any company that kept printing the expiration date, along with a few of the cards' digits, instead of just one or the other, became a potential litigation target. 
   However, identity theft prevention experts say that five digits of a credit card, plus an expiration date printed out on a receipt, are not enough to steal someone's account. All of these people, however, are being sued on a technicality that poses no threat to people's credit or their debit accounts. 
   Take, for example, in my district, the Rockler Companies, Inc., one of the many family-owned businesses in my district. Rockler sells and distributes products to the woodworking community, and, unfortunately, they became a fallen victim to just such a frivolous lawsuit. Unfortunately, they have already had to pay out over $30,000 in legal expenses for this wonderful small business in Minnesota, not because they did anything wrong, but because Congress, because this body, accidently left open a legal loophole. That's $30,000, something that can mean life or death for one of America's small businesses. 
   This bill on the floor today is very important. It may not seem like much, but H.R. 4008, The Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act, closes that loophole. It liberates American businesses, usually small businesses, from frivolous lawsuits. 
   They still have to update their receipts. They still have to comply with FACTA, but they can't be dragged through years of lawsuits because they printed a credit card expiration date. 
   If they print enough information to give thieves a toe-hold, they still can be sued. If they print over five digits of the card number, they still can be sued. If they do anything that puts customers' accounts in real jeopardy, they can be sued. They cannot be sued for this remote congressional technicality. That's only right. 
   With H.R. 4008, consumers will be protected on both ends of the transaction. After all, who will pay the real price for this? Businesses across America will have to offset the cost of these lawsuits by raising their prices, if they can, and American consumers will be left holding the short end of the stick, or the business will suffer. 
   At a time when Americans are already squeezed by the rising cost of living, by outrageous prices of gasoline at the pump, this is the last thing we need right now in our American economy. I am so happy that we are working together hand-in-hand across the aisle to show the American people that Congress is actually listening to them today, listening to their concerns and acting wisely on their behalf. 
   The Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act is pretty simple, it's no nonsense, it's fair, it's necessary, and it's bipartisan. That is good for businesses, it's good for consumers, and I thank and urge all of my colleagues in the House and ask them to join both Congressman Mahoney and myself in supporting this wonderful bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (HONORING PUBLIC CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as this resolution's author, I rise to support H. Res. 789. It is vital that the organizations that are committed to improving the lives of foster care children be commended for their hard work and for their sacrifices. 
   Today, there are over 500,000 children, that's over a half million children, in foster care across the United States of America, many of whom come from troubled homes and many of whom have been moved from family to family several times. My husband and I have been privileged to have 23 foster children live in our home, and we know from experience that these wonderful organizations that work with our foster children played a critical role in ensuring that they were matched with loving families and they grew up to achieve successful lives. These organizations are to be commended, Mr. Speaker. 
   Dedicated to changing public policy and also to raising awareness related to the very special and individual needs of foster children, these groups sponsor research, they develop best practices, and they offer assistance to youth who are transitioning out of the system to ensure that they receive adequate support as they reach adulthood. They provide invaluable resources to foster families as well as to teachers, to counselors, physicians, clergy and other people who work closely with children who are being helped by the foster care system. 
   These men and women and agencies are striving to consider the best interests of every child, and they work to keep families together whenever possible. Today, more Americans are beginning to understand the very real and very special needs of foster care children due to their dedicated public awareness efforts, and I am proud to honor these organizations that have touched the lives of so many of America's children and improved their lives and put them steadily on a path to success. 
   To complement this resolution, it is my hope that the House will soon have the opportunity to consider H.R. 4311, the School Choice for Foster Kids Act, because this Act will allow foster children of all ages to stay at the school that they've grown comfortable with, even when they change foster homes, which all too frequently seems to happen in the lives of foster children. It will provide them with some stability in their own tumultuous lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that you and our fellow colleagues will join us in honoring the contributions of all public child welfare agencies, nonprofit organizations and private entities who are sincerely dedicated to finding homes for foster children and to assisting foster families in securing the success of our future children.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Baca of California for sponsoring this legislation that is very important. Thank you for being so persistent in seeking 406 cosponsors of your legislation. And I also thank Mrs. Biggert, as well, for her timely remarks. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise with regard to H.R. 406 honoring the early suffragist Alice Paul who worked hard to provide better treatment for American women in our legal and in our political system. 
   As the congressional chairman of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Washington, D.C., Alice Paul performed a critical role in persuading Congress to pass the 19th amendment which guaranteed American women the right to vote. She later stated that her work in passing this amendment was ``the greatest thing I have I ever did.'' 
   Alice Paul is rightly venerated by American feminists. But few recall her work to also expose the effects of legalized abortion as ``the ultimate exploitation of women.'' 
   In fact, toward the end of her great career, Alice Paul grew frustrated with America's women's rights movement as it drifted away from its original mission of advocating for a better life for American women and in favor of legislation for abortion. Alice Paul was highly critical of this shift, and she harbored grave reservations about abortion on demand. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage you and my colleagues to join me in honoring this courageous women's career in its entirety. May this deliberative body take to heart her views on women's rights and its incompatibility with legalized abortion. 
   I thank both Mr. Baca and Mrs. Biggert for sponsoring this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (TAXPAYER FREEDOM DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Congressman Walberg, I want to thank you for your leadership during this special hour that we are enjoying this evening, talking to the American people about Tax Freedom Day. For a lot of people, they just can't believe it when they find out what the definition is. 
   I can't thank you enough for your leadership, not only for this special hour to talk about this very special day that is coming tomorrow with Tax Freedom Day eve, you might say this evening, but also with your leadership on the Tax Increase Prevention Act. I can't thank you enough for the work that you are doing, not just on behalf of the great constituents that you have in Michigan, but on behalf of all Americans, because the last thing Americans need right now is a tax increase. So we all thank you, and I thank you that I have had the opportunity to sign onto your legislation as well. 
   I couldn't help but think when Congressman Sali, our fellow freshman, was standing here earlier, he is a gentleman who fought for years in his own State assembly in Idaho for tax cuts and for fiscal sanity in Idaho. I think that is why the people in Idaho sent him here, because they knew they could trust Bill Sali. They could trust him to come to the floor and make the case for fiscal sanity in our country. 
   When we see tax increases around every corner, what was it, maybe 6 weeks ago we saw that the majority passed I believe it was a $683 billion tax increase for the budget, the largest tax increase in American history. I know I was flabbergasted when I saw that. Could it be possible that the Congress, in a time of a weakened economy, would come here to this Chamber, to this floor, and make a decision like that, that they would heap burden upon burden upon burden upon our constituents? I didn't think it would be possible. 
   Then when I listened to our fellow colleague, Congressman David Davis from the State of Tennessee, who has said so well so many times about the average American family, who sits  around their kitchen table wondering are they going to be able to fill up their gas tank tomorrow morning when they get up and go to work? What about buying that gallon of milk? You go to the grocery store and you see that grocery store prices have gone up 64 percent since the beginning of the year.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (TAXPAYER FREEDOM DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Well, I think the gentleman already knows the answer before he is asking the question, because it has been now hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of days since the majority said to the American people that they had a commonsense plan, they had a commonsense plan for reducing the price of gasoline. And as of today, the average price of gasoline across America is now a whopping $3.51. 
   I went with our family this weekend, we went to visit my father-in-law. It was his 84th birthday on Sunday. So we had my daughter's car, because it had the best gas mileage of any car that we had in our family, so we took her car. On the way back, we were in Baldwin, Wisconsin. We pulled up to a gas station. We put gas in. I could not believe it. It was $45 that I put in her little gas tank. Just a few years ago, that is what we spent on our big conversion van, our high-top conversion van. We are not alone. We are here as Members of Congress, but we hear this every day from people back home. 
   Let me give you just one example. You remember Art Linkletter and the show that he had years ago called House Party? He had a little segment called ``Kids Say the Darndest Things.'' I loved that segment. 
   I thought about that, because just recently I went to speak to Minnesota Pheasants Forever. It is a wonderful outdoor heritage group. I love to do that. That is one marvelous thing about being a Member of Congress, you can go to speak to great groups about things. 
   So I went to go speak to them. So I laid my notes, Congressman Walberg, on the island in our kitchen, and it said ``Minnesota Pheasants Forever.'' Our little daughter Caroline came, and she picked up the notes and she said, ``Mom, what is Minnesota peasants forever?'' And I said, ``Well, Caroline, that would be the taxpayers of the State of Minnesota.'' 
   The reason I say that is because tomorrow will be Tax Freedom Day, and in Minnesota, we are a little bit worse off. Our Tax Freedom Day won't occur until next Sunday. 
   What that means for people across America that might be listening to our repartee as we go back and forth tonight, Tax Freedom Day is the first day the American people stop working for Uncle Sam and start working for themselves. When you average all your Federal, State and local taxes together, the American taxpayer spends the first 113 days of the year as a Federal employee. Basically, that is what it comes down to. We are all Federal employees because we are working for the man. We are not working for ourselves.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. That is exactly right. You talked about Adams and Jefferson. We have the wonderful privilege, you and I and Congressman Davis, we have the wonderful privilege of being a part of that great cloud of witnesses that went before. They laid down the freedom. 
   Just think, it was a stamp tax that our founders were willing to lay down their lives for, their fortune, their sacred honor. They were willing to give up everything, just to throw off a stamp tax. My goodness, we do that just in the morning before we have even gotten to lunch yet around here. I can't believe the level of tax increases we have seen, can you? 
   Weren't you floored coming here as a new Member of Congress? I know if there is one thing that I have learned, Congressman Walberg, in the time I have been in Congress, what has been now maybe 15 or 16 months, it has been how easy it is to spend somebody else's money. How easy it is. I know it isn't for me. It is really hard for me to spend my own money, and it is really hard for me to spend other people's money. I am not there yet. I haven't drank that Kool-Aid. But I am floored when I see how easy it is for Members of this body to spend other people's money. What is your reaction to that?

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. If the gentleman will yield further, that has been my impression as well. It strikes me to think that the serfs in the Middle Ages paid over about 25 percent of what they earned in the year to a nobleman. We could only wish, many of us, that 25 percent was our total tax burden. We haven't seen that in this country for many, many years. It is almost unthinkable that the serfs in the Middle Ages would be better off from a tax point of view than the average American taxpayer today. We are far beyond 25 percent of our income. 
   As a matter of fact, don't you agree, Congressman, that it would be I think very enlightening for most Americans to learn that they spend more on their tax bill, they pay more on their tax bill, than they do for food, clothing and housing combined? 
   The average American works 108 days to pay for their food, their clothing and their housing. They work on average 113 days to pay their tax bill. Just think of that. Those are necessities that Americans can't do without. You have to have food, you have to have clothing, you have to have housing. But the one thing that will happen is that you will go to jail if you don't pay your tax bill. 
   I am a former Federal tax litigation attorney. I tried a lot of cases in Federal Tax Court. The reason why people showed up when it was time for their court date was because if they didn't show up, the judgment may be that they go to jail. Because in this country if you don't pay your tax bill, you have the potential of going to jail. So that is the first bill you have to pay, because if you don't pay it, you may end up in a place you don't want to be, so a lot of sacrifices have to be made by a lot of people. 
   I will tell you one thing, and I think you would agree as well, Congressman. You have probably seen a lot of waste, a lot of fraud and a lot of abuse in legislation that has gone through this body. We will be taking up legislation tomorrow that is trying to squeeze waste, fraud and abuse out of the Medicare system. 
   Don't you agree, Congressman, that is something that the American people have been looking for for a long time? I know you are a reformer. I know you came here because you did not want to be part of the status quo. You are an outsider, and you came here because you wanted to change the way that Washington does business. I feel the  same way. I know that Congressman Sali shares that opinion and Congressman Davis shares that opinion. We are not about continuing the levels of waste, fraud and abuse.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. That is right. And if the gentleman would yield, I would absolutely agree. And that is why it is important and imperative, I believe, that we shout it from the rooftops. This is not a hypothetical we are talking about, this is reality that we are talking about tonight, the fact that these tax cuts right now are on automatic pilot. They are going away. They are the engines that have propelled the growth in this economy, both with the cuts on capital gains and on dividends, that has provided the jobs, the growth, the unparalleled level of prosperity that we have enjoyed. It is all going away if we don't stop that. 
   That is why I thank you again, Congressman Walberg, for being willing to sponsor this important legislation. It is why I am on it, it is why Congressman Davis and so many of our colleagues are on it. As a matter of fact, there is a piece of legislation that I believe you signed on recently as well as I signed on; this is one that our colleague John Campbell came up with, and that is putting a spending ceiling on what Congress can spend. Because I think that Congressman Davis said it very well earlier: We have a spending problem. That is what leads to our taxing program. And John Campbell came forward, the Congressman from California, and he said, let's put a ceiling on government spending, and let's make sure it is not more than one-fifth of GDP. 
   What is GDP? Gross domestic product. Well, what is that? That is basically everything that we produce in this country every year. Just think of that. Government eats up one-fifth, almost one-fifth, 20 percent, of everything that is produced in this country just to run the machine. Sometimes I think that government is just a big money eating machine, and we are all the people that are working to stoke that furnace to keep it going. But this legislation that we signed says that there is a limit. We are going to draw a line in the sand, and no more. And that is what your great legislation does as well, the Tax Increase Prevention Act, it draws a line in the sand and it says we are going to keep this prosperity going, and the way we do it is by cutting those taxes.

   But when Americans go to the pump tomorrow, I just want to remind them, Congressman Walberg, when they go to the pump and they put $1 worth of gasoline in their vehicle, over 60 cents of that dollar will go to taxes in one form or another. Just think about that. We hear a lot about oil companies and about profits, but when you have $1 of gasoline, over 60 cents of that dollar goes to taxes. That is something we really need to think about here in Congress. We need to consider it. It is just a microcosm, just a picture of the heavy tax burden every day that impacts the average American. I can't thank you enough for putting this together this evening.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H. Con. Res. 322. 
   As Israel celebrates the 60th anniversary of the founding of its modern state, I rise to recognize the bonds of close friendship and cooperation forged over the years between the United States and Israel. 
   Since declaring its independence on May 14, 1948, Israel has been the shining symbol of freedom and democracy in an area historically rampant with violence and oppression. In just 60 short years, Israel has become the economic leader of the Middle East by proving to its people the rewards of capitalism, while also leading the region in other facets of a free society, including human rights and freedom of the press. 
   Israel has worked hard to develop friendly working relationships with its neighbors, Egypt and Jordan, setting an example of leadership and peace while other countries around them spread hatred and terror. As the Middle East comes to embrace the liberties and freedoms of democratic societies, the United States will stand steadfast in its commitment to a free Israel. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and congratulate the success of Israel on its 60th anniversary. It is vital the United States continue to develop its strong relationship with Israel so that many other countries around the world still oppressed and ruled by terror can see the true value of a free and democratic society.

Since its inception on April 23, 1908, the Reserve and its more than 1 million citizen-soldiers have protected American citizens at home and abroad. When tyranny raises its fist and liberty is threatened, the citizen-soldier answers the call to ease the suffering. For this, our Nation is forever grateful. 
   Today, more than 20,000 Army Reserve soldiers are deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and 18 other countries, with an additional 7,000 Army Reserve serving in the United States. In my home State of Minnesota, historic Fort Snelling is the proud home to the 88th Regional Readiness Command, comprised of Reserve units from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. America's greatness lies in her people, and the American soldier is the embodiment of hard work, patriotism and service, the finest of America's principles. 
   Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize today the selfless commitment and sacrifice of so many citizen-soldiers. It is they who lay down their lives to defend those who cannot defend themselves. It is they who lay down their lives to protect the rights of those who disrespect our flag and our Nation. And it is they who lay down their lives so that true freedom will never know extinction. As April 23 approaches, let us remember and be forever grateful for the Army Reserve's 100 years of noble service and sacrifice to our Nation.

   Floyd and his wife, Dilly, have done so much for the people of our Nation and for the people of our State. They started a program called ``Operation Minnesota Nice,'' Mr. Speaker, where they send care packages to area troops from Minnesota who are currently serving both in Iraq and in Afghanistan. 
   Recently Floyd stepped down from that position so that he and Dilly could focus on a few other service-related activities. One is ``Operation Help Support Our Troops & Families.'' Another is ``Operation Military Kids.'' This provides educational opportunities for the children of active service personnel. 
   Recently Mr. Olesen received the American Legion 6th District Service Officer of the Year award. He is a wonderful American. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, it is so important that we encourage all Americans to do what they can, where they can, when they can, while they can to serve their fellow man. Mr. Olesen has done that and more.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (CURRENT FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership on this issue, which is perhaps the most important vote that Members will take during their entire congressional career. I know for me, this is my first term in Congress. This is the pivotal vote that I will be taking. And my heart has been breaking. I have been despairing over this vote that is coming before us not because I am afraid to take the vote but because I am despairing over what could be the outcome because I grieve over the fact that we may reject, for the first time in the history of our country, in a wholesale manner, free markets, free answers and free capitalism. 
   And what that means is freedom. And there is nothing more important in this country than freedom. It's why a mom would put her 5-year-old in an inner tube in Havana and brave the shark-infested waters for 90 miles to get to Florida so that she could see her son enjoy something she never knew. And that is a concept called ``freedom.'' 
   And what does that have to do with the bailout? It has everything to do with the bailout because what this bailout represents is the wholesale leap downward towards socialism, towards saying that we can never have failure again. Nobody can ever have a bad day. Congress has to jump in and make it right every time, because government has to take up risk and back up everybody's risk. 
   I wrote something earlier this week that I would like to share in the course of my remarks this evening. When Bear Stearns hit bottom in March of this year in 2008, the credit crisis claimed the first big Wall Street victim. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said, we had to bail out this bleeding financial giant at the cost to the taxpayers of $29 billion. Even for Washington that is a lot of money. Secretary Paulson said that would stabilize the markets. But it didn't. 
   Next, Treasury Paulson said that we had to bail out mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. All roads in this big fat mess go through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It is a monster of ugly proportions created by the government. That should be our first lesson. Government should never create a private business. But it created this private monstrosity and then decided it would back up with a wink and a nod any risky, hare-brained loan or mortgage-backed security that Fannie and Freddie came up with. 
   The starting price of that bailout was $200 billion and climbing. And that is on top of $300 billion that was passed by Congress only a month or so earlier in another massive housing bailout bill. We were told then that this would surely calm the markets. But it didn't. 
   Treasury Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke then siphoned $85 billion from taxpayer coffers to save another private company known as AIG from bankruptcy, and again with the stated purpose of stabilizing the markets. Did it do the trick this time? No. Things appear only to have gotten worse. 
   More than $600 billion into these market-calming bailouts, the market turmoil has only ramped up. And it's continuing. In fact, it has now grown to such an incredible crescendo that here we are tonight, and the Treasury Secretary and the Federal Reserve Chair has told Congress, in no uncertain terms by the way, that we must spend another $700 billion in taxpayer funds. We are told we must do this now, without delay, without deliberation, as Congressman Garrett has said, without answers to most of our questions. 
   This would bring the bailout tally to well over $1 trillion, now that is real money, even for Washington, approaching half the size of America's entire budget. 
   In other words, every American who has played it safe and has played it smart to avoid being in debt is now being asked to spend the rest of his or her life paying off the debts of Washington and the debts of some miscreants on Wall Street. We are well on our way to privatizing profit but socializing risk. And we are well on our way to eliminating moral hazard from economics altogether. This is antithetical not only to the free-market basis of the United States economy, but also to the rich heritage of liberty, that is called freedom, that we've long enjoyed. It runs counter to the American Dream, to what we hold dear, unless you're a fat cat that is rolling the dice with taxpayers' money. Then who cares? 
   American taxpayers are chumps here in this equation because American taxpayers are being asked to clean up a mess that the American taxpayer didn't create. Congress must not rush to judgment on this matter. We can't do that. It's a complicated issue. That is true. This isn't easy for any of us to sort out. All Members of Congress, I think, are going through a crash course in a Ph.D. in high finance all within less than 1 week's time. And the consequences could threaten generations with lack of prosperity. 
   We can't just stick a $1 trillion Band-aid on that problem. We don't have that kind of money in our back pocket, because after all, when Uncle Sam opens his cash box this week, there are no greenbacks in there. There are only feathers flying out that cash box. 
   We have to examine the root causes of this problem. And we have to seek to address the core issues. It's real simple. Government got involved where it shouldn't get involved. We spent more money than what we had. It's not too tough to figure out. Otherwise it's only a matter of time before we find ourselves right back where we were. 
   The recklessness of government is the primary culprit here. Once again, just like on energy, it is Congress that created this problem. For years Congress has been pushing banks to make risky subprime loans. You heard me right. It wasn't the lenders on their own. Congress passed laws that said we're going to fine you and we're going to file lawsuits against you lenders if you don't make risky loans. And using the authority of the Community Reinvestment Act, the big push for subprime mortgages began in earnest during the Clinton administration. Republicans aren't completely lily-white here with hands. The Clinton administration however ramped this up. And banks that didn't play ball were subjected to serious fines and lawsuits, and regulatory obstacles were placed in their way. 
   Expanding access to the American Dream is a worthy goal. We all agree with that. But by blindly pursuing that goal and allowing the end to justify means, we put millions of Americans today at financial risk. Although we question what that risk might be. 
   Because many of these home loans are backed by mammoth government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and the Freddie Mac, kind of like your weird uncle and weird aunt, Wall Street was more than happy to trade on these egregious loans. The assumption, which was proven right, was that Uncle Sam would guarantee them. Fannie and Freddie quickly grew too big. And all calls to regulate them, made even in fact by this administration, more closely to reform their structures were ignored, ignored I would say by the current Chair of the House Financial Services Committee of which I'm privileged to serve on. 
   In fact, leaders in Congress such as Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, resisted reforming Fannie and Freddie at every turn. When former Treasury Secretary John Snow pleaded before Chairman Frank before his committee for Fannie and Freddie reform, the chairman responded, ``Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not in a crisis. I think we see entities that are fundamentally sound financially.'' O, that Barney Frank were right. But Treasury Secretary Snow was right. 
   And millions of homes and a mountain of wealth were built on a foundation of sand. And when the housing bubble burst, it all began to collapse. And suddenly, the homeowners who took out loans that they couldn't afford had homes that were worth less than when they bought them. And stalwart financial giants were left holding on to billions in securities that they just couldn't cash, what are called ``illiquid assets'' that you read about in your morning paper. And without liquidity and without the free flow of credit, the market ground to a halt, and companies began to buckle. 
   Endless government bailouts will not prevent this crisis from repeating itself. We need to remember that. It will further cement the precedent that got us here in the first place. There are other options to bringing much-needed liquidity to the market, including infusing the market with new capital by suspending the business tax and the capital gains tax. 
   Also Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac need to be dismantled and quick. Now that the implicit taxpayer guarantee that they enjoyed for years has been made permanent, we have to make a clean break with them. 
   Accounting that artificially devalued securities and other assets could be temporarily suspended. And before Congress jumps to a full trillion dollar plus bailout, it should explore these and other market reforms. Congress should look for the best way to provide the greatest stabilization in the markets with the least taxpayer exposure. 
   And that is where House Republicans come in. We do not want the American taxpayer to bail out this $700 billion tab. It isn't about Wall Street. It's about this street, Washington, D.C. The Congress created this problem. For 2 years, the Democrat-controlled Congress, while this head of steam has been building, has failed to dismantle Freddie and Fannie. They have failed to dismantle the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   But the real issue here is the forgotten man. That is the issue. It's the forgotten man. It's the poor, beleaguered American taxpayer. Who is going to be left to bail him out?

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the people of Hugo, Minnesota. 
   It was just several weeks ago that the people of Hugo encountered a terrible tragedy; it occurred at 5 o'clock on a quiet Sunday afternoon. A tornado touched down in Hugo, and within 30 seconds over 50 to 60 homes were completely flattened, between 150 and 200 homes were uninhabitable. But the wonderful spirit, Madam Speaker, among the people of Hugo, the fire department, the police department, the State Patrol, almost instantaneously had a wonderful textbook outpouring of rebuilding. 
   Within one week, the community of Hugo had so many volunteers they had to turn them away. They completely removed all the debris from the city within one week, and now they're on the road to rebuilding. 
   I congratulate Mayor Fran Miron. I congratulate City Administrator Mike Ericsson. And I congratulate all the people of Hugo who have exuded the spirit of Minnesota, the loving experience of loving a neighbor. And that's what people in Hugo do best, they love each other. 
   So congratulations to the people of Hugo. You will rebuild. You will be back. And I'm so honored to represent you here in this great House.

   In 70 A.D., Rome sacked Jerusalem, and the diaspora of the Jews occurred. History teaches that when a people are five generations removed from their homeland, the nation ceases. Yet after 2,000 years, Israel was reborn and today has reclaimed its language, people, and has once again become a land flowing with milk and honey.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, today, I was proud to support, H. Res. 1127, a bill which condemns the endemic restrictions on freedom of the press and media and public expression in the Middle East and the concurrent and widespread presence of anti-Semitic material, Holocaust denial, and incitement to violence in the Arab media and press. 
   The people of Israel have been victims of violence and hatred for far too long. Not only are these peace-loving individuals targets of rocket attacks and terrorist actions, they are also victims of government-censored, hateful press. It is far too common for Arab media markets to condemn Israel and promote actions which foster violence and hinder the peace process in the region. Israeli reporters and journalists have been harassed and intimidated by Middle East government officials who have placed harsh legal restrictions on what news can and cannot be reported. 
   I strongly believe that the universal right of all persons to peacefully express themselves in a nonviolent way should be upheld in the Middle East. It is the responsibility of the United States and the global community to condemn this lack of freedom and work to promote an environment which fosters the license of nonviolent speech and press and peace.

<DOCNO>Ms. BACHMANN. (FOSTERING CONNECTIONS TO SUCCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 6307, the Fostering Connections to Success Act. This vital piece of bipartisan legislation was designed to make much needed improvements to the child welfare system, focused on some of the most vulnerable among us--foster children. 
   There are more than 500,000 children in foster care nationwide today, many of whom come from troubled homes and have been moved from family to family several times. My husband and I have cared for 23 foster children, and I understand full well the struggles these children face on a daily basis. This bill goes a long way in alleviating some of the roadblocks standing in their way. 
   The main focus of this bill is to improve the accessibility foster youth have to essential services, their family, health care, and education. However, this legislation makes considerations for those not only actually in foster care, but for those who ``age out'' of the system--a group of young men and women who are often overlooked. 
   A key component of this bill is the extension of federal foster care payments up to the age of 21. We are considered adults at the age of 18 in this society, but reaching 18 does not automatically mean that an individual is financially independent. As these young men and women pursue a degree of higher learning, or whether they choose to start working, this bill will give them the financial help they desperately need. Too often their troubled past and unstable family background have not provided them the foundation of support to do it on their own. 
   Along with providing--for the first time--federal financial support for relatives who assume legal guardianship of foster children, this bill also expands coverage of federal funds for the training of child welfare workers to include private agency and non-profit workers who provide foster care and adoption services on behalf of the state. When combined, all of the components of this bill offer the overhaul our foster care system so sorely needs. 
   Today, I stand proud knowing that Congress is on the cusp of passing such a crucial piece of bipartisan legislation for America's youth. As a foster mother myself, I thank Congress for giving this matter the serious time and consideration it deserves.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (STOP CHILD ABUSE IN RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR TEENS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to offer a motion which will ensure that parents of children in residential treatment facilities have control over any medication being prescribed to their child. While the bill as currently written would require a parent or a legal guardian to disclose to the facility any prescription drugs that their child is currently taking, the facility would not be required to receive parental consent for the child to be issued a prescription for any new medications. 
   As a mother and also as a foster mother, I strongly believe in the importance of the role of the parent or the legal guardian in a child's life. This is especially true, Mr. Speaker, when it comes to matters as serious as the health and well-being of a child. 
   Prescription drugs, such as medication to treat psychiatric conditions, can have a major impact on the mind and the body of an adult, let alone on the young mind and the young body of a child. Such a critical decision should only be made by a qualified medical doctor with the expressed consent of a parent or legal guardian. This is only common sense, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today would allow residential treatment facilities to impose their will on children without affording those children the protection and guidance of their closest family. Whether the parent, whose intimate relationship and familiarity with their child is critical in choosing a treatment path, feels that it is in their child's best interest or not, any medication could be prescribed. For example, in its present form, this bill would allow a treatment facility to prescribe contraception to a child, who when properly informed and guided by a parent may have chosen to carry the baby to term, either raising it as their own or contacting an adoption agency, not terminating its life. 
   The purpose of this amendment is to protect children who are in a very vulnerable situation away from their families in a residential treatment facility where they are supposed to be receiving help for a very difficult problem. The parents and the guardians who have raised and cared for these children, who know and understand their children and their medical histories best, should know about any new or changed medications to exercise their role as primary medical decision makers for their children. The right of consent should be explicitly stated in this legislation meant to protect these vulnerable youth.     
   Mr. Speaker, one thing that I saw firsthand as a foster mother, there were too many children of color, minority children, who were overly prescribed for prescription drugs at a younger and younger age. This is a very disturbing issue and expressly underscores why parents or their guardians should have a say to actually give consent whether these children are given prescription drugs. 
   That being said, my motion, Mr. Speaker, does not infringe in any way on the role of the medical facility at a treatment facility. The expertise of the staff and the physicians would still be fully utilized in the diagnosis and, upon parental consent, the dispensing of prescription medication. 
   Moreover, my motion would not require parental notification for nonprescription drugs. A child in a residential treatment facility would not be hindered in obtaining any over-the-counter medication, such as aspirin. Only prescription drugs, which can have such far-reaching effects on a patient, would be applicable to the terms of this motion. 
   The prescription drugs often used in these facilities, especially the mental  health drugs, have very serious, and sometimes fatal side effects. This is no laughing matter, Mr. Speaker. These side effects for children, for children, Mr. Speaker, include suicide, homicide, psychosis, heart problems, tics, movement disorders, diabetes, even obesity. 
   Mr. Speaker, a parent is one of the most powerful influences in a child's life. I think this body agrees on that. In the case of a child in a residential treatment facility, with a very small voice and no ability to protect himself or herself, it is imperative that a parent or a legal guardian be given proper authority over the course of the treatment recommended by the treatment facility.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to offer a motion which will ensure that parents of children in residential treatment facilities have control over any medication being prescribed to their child. While the bill, as currently written, would require a parent or legal guardian to disclose to the facility any prescription drugs their child is currently taking, the facility would not be required to receive parental consent for the child to be issued a prescription for any new medication. 
   This issue is very real for me. As a mother and a foster mother who has cared for children in similar situations, I strongly believe in the importance of the role of the parent or legal guardian in a child's life. This is especially true when it comes to matters as serious as the health and well-being of that child. Prescription drugs, such as medication to treat psychiatric conditions can have a major impact on the mind and body of an adult, let alone the young mind and body of a child. Our professionals deal with this on a regular basis in mental health facilities all across the nation. Especially tragic is the statistically high number of children of color who are placed on prescription psychotropic drugs, often with severe misgivings from parents or guardians. Such a critical decision should only be made by a qualified medical doctor and only after the expressed consent of a parent or legal guardian is given. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today would allow staff in residential treatment facilities to impose their will on children, without affording those children the protection and guidance of their closest family. Whether the parent, whose intimate relationship and familiarity with their child is critical in choosing a treatment path, feels it is in their child's best interest or not, any medication could be prescribed. 
   That is a historic leap in loss of parental rights over their children. Parents remain legally and financially liable for their children's mental and physical welfare yet this bill has government stripping parents of their right to consent to medical treatment via prescription drugs for their children. This bill says parents are good enough to pay the bill, but they can't be trusted to make decisions regarding their child's health. That is insulting, demeaning, and wrong. 
   The purpose of this amendment is to protect children who are in a very vulnerable situation away from their families in a residential treatment facility where they are supposed to be receiving help for very difficult problems. The parents and guardians that have raised and cared for these children, who know and understand their children and their medical histories best, should know about any new or changed medications to exercise their role as primary medical decision makers for their offspring. The right of consent should be explicitly stated in this legislation meant to protect these vulnerable youth. 
   That being said, this motion does not infringe on the role of the medical faculty at a treatment facility. The expertise of the staff and physicians would still be fully utilized in the diagnosis, and upon parental consent, the dispensing of prescription medication. Moreover, this motion would not require parental notification for non-prescription medication. A child in a residential treatment facility would not be hindered in obtaining any over-the-counter (OTC) medication such as aspirin. Only prescription drugs, which can have such far-reaching effects on the patient, would be applicable to the terms of this motion. 
   The prescription drugs often used in these facilities, especially the mental health drugs, have extremely serious, and sometimes fatal side effects. These include suicide, homicide, psychosis, heart problems, tics and movement disorders, diabetes and obesity. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members understand, a parent is one of the most powerful influences in a child's life. In the case of a child in a residential treatment facility, it is imperative that his or her parent or legal guardian be given proper authority over the course of treatment recommended by the treatment facility. 
   I believe this is an important addition to this bill and I urge my colleages to support the addition of this language.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. 
   In what feels now like a lifetime ago but was in fact only 2 days ago, on August 1, the world changed forever for the people of our State of Minnesota. Our people witnessed an event so unlikely, the sudden and complete collapse of nearly 2,000 feet of eight lanes of highway, propelling nearly 50 cars in midair for a horrific 60-foot plunge into the currents of the Mississippi River. An event so unlikely that we in Minnesota collectively remain shocked and filled with sorrow, knowing the inevitable sad news that is yet to come once our heroic first responders have freed our fellow Americans who even now as we stand here remain trapped underwater. 
   Minnesota needs the help and the prayers of all Americans and we appreciate the overwhelming support in our time of need. I know I speak for my husband Marcus and myself. We offer our deepest sympathies, as does everyone in our delegation, to the family and the friends of those who were killed. 
   Mr. Speaker, America believes in extending a helping hand to people who are in trouble due to no fault of their own, and I want to assure the residents of Minnesota today that we will have help in cleaning up and rebuilding. We will have help until the job is done. Because Congress understands, Republicans, Democrats, we're all Americans in this and we understand that this is not just an emergency for a day or for a week. We will provide the support and the work that is necessary to rebuild the lives and the communities that were damaged until this tragedy is over. And that is what makes America so great. 
   This bill is just our first step toward recovery. I thank Chairman Oberstar for his brilliant work, working around the clock to bring this to the floor. It's inspiring the way so many have come together and worked together over these last few days. 
   I join my colleagues from Minnesota, a great State that each one of us loves so much, in requesting your support to rebuild this bridge. Once again, I know we can count on you, the Members of this great deliberative body, to rebuild the great city of Minneapolis and again to make it whole.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank Representative Latta. I appreciate your leadership on the issue of energy, and although you are a brand new Member of Congress--you haven't been here for a long time--you've shown just extraordinary leadership on the issue that's probably facing more Americans today than any other, and that's the dramatic increase in the price of energy, and I know how passionate you've been on this issue. You've worked tirelessly in your district, and the people of your district in Ohio are fortunate to have you as their representative. Thank you so much for working so hard on this issue. 
   It's one, Mr. Speaker, that I believe probably every Member of this body is hearing from their constituents over and over and over again. I know that I have as well. I had conducted a meeting with several members of my community who own gas stations, independent owners of gas stations. And one thing that they told me that broke my heart, they told me that they are seeing 30 percent fewer sales at the pump, and they're also seeing 30 percent fewer sales inside their store, and they're hurting. 
   One gentleman told me that normally he would spend $10,000 to purchase the gasoline that would go into the ground in the holding tanks, $10,000, and that's money that's out of his pocket, sitting there in inventory until it can be sold. And he said, now, I pay $40,000 to have that inventory in the ground, and now sales are 30 percent less. And so he has more money in the ground, not producing for him, at a higher and higher price level, and he said this is eating up my entire profit margin. There are people going out of business. 
   And so what he told me is we've got to do something to get gasoline back down from its $4 a gallon, and that's what we're about here tonight to say there's very good news on the horizon. 
   It's doom and gloom when you wake up in the morning and you see and you hear on the radio and you see when you drive to the gas station what the price at the pump is. But the good news is, there is an answer, and America can go back to $2 a gallon gasoline or less. It's entirely possible. 
   Why? Because we have the answer right here in our country. We are standing on our own solution. We have energy that's available to us, 86 billion barrels, that's according to our own United States department, 86 billion barrels of energy right now that's available to us in the form of oil in the Outer Continental Shelf area. 
   We have over 10 billion barrels of oil that's fully recoverable up in the arctic energy slope. This is an area of land that Congress originally set aside specifically for the purpose of accessing that energy through drilling to bring back down to the United States. I had the privilege back in the mid-1970s of working two summers up on the Aleutian Chain in Alaska. That's when the Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, trans-Alaska oil pipeline was built. That oil pipeline is currently up. It's running, but it is only half full. 
   With very little effort, we could actually tap into that oil pipeline, the 10 billion barrels that we know are already in Alaska, and we could fill that pipeline. Rather than having it half empty, we could fill it and bring down another million barrels of oil a day. 
   And Mr. Speaker, 1 million barrels of oil a day translates into 27 million gallons of gasoline, and that would mean a 50 percent increase in American reserves than we're already tapping today. That's just those 10 billion barrels. That doesn't include the 85 billion barrels that are also available in the Outer Continental Shelf in the deep sea energy reserves that America only has. 
   But Mr. Speaker, I think most Americans aren't even aware that America is the only country in the world that has voluntarily made it illegal to access its own energy. That's right, Mr. Speaker, we are the only country in the world that's made it illegal to access our own energy. 
   Congress caused this problem. The problem is not OPEC and the problem is not speculators. The problem is the United States Congress. I believe part of the reason why we are seeing Congress's approval ratings at an astoundingly low 12 percent is because Congress has chosen to make it illegal to access the answer that we need, and that's our own energy resources. 
   Here's another great fact. In the gulf coast region, we have what is probably the world's largest reserve of natural gas. We have 420 trillion, 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that's available to us right now off the shore in the Gulf of Mexico. We can access this, and we can bring natural gas into our country, use it to fire up our electrical grid, and also, we could even change our cars and buses, run them on natural gas as well.     
   America also is home to 25 percent of the Earth's supply of coal right here in the United States, almost an unlimited supply. We have clean coal technology today that's available to us that can process coal and transmit that almost unlimited supply of energy all across the United States. 
   And as well, nuclear energy. I have a nuclear energy facility in my home district in the Sixth Congressional District of Minnesota, Mr. Speaker. And I'm so grateful we have that because nuclear power supplies almost 20, 25 percent of Minnesota's energy needs. It's a clean, safe, reliable form of energy, and it has zero emissions. I am so excited about this wonderful technology, but unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, again, Congress has made it illegal for us to be able to tap into this wonderful source of energy. 
   Whether it's nuclear, whether it's coal, whether it's natural gas, whether it's the oil reserves that we have, America has the answer. In fact, this is the industry that we can tap into right now. We don't need to find a magic bullet or a magic alternative. This is energy that we have available to us today that we could tap into today so we can see the American people very soon get back to paying $2 a gallon. 
   One thing that happened not too long ago was this body, the United States Congress, sent out stimulus checks to Americans all across the country. Why, Mr. Speaker? Because people in the United States Congress were worried about the economy, so we went to the United States Treasury and we wrote checks that are still being sent out to Americans all across this country. Why? We wanted to encourage Americans to spend money to stimulate the economy. 
   Do you know what I believe the greatest stimulus would be to Americans? It would be to get gasoline back to $2 a gallon. And it's so possible. It  was just about 18 months ago that the Democrat majority took over in this body. And when they took over, gasoline, on average, at the national level was $2.33 a gallon. Mr. Speaker, that average today is about $4.07 a gallon. That's a dramatic increase in the price of gasoline, unheard of increase in the price of gasoline. It took us 25 years in the United States for gasoline to go from $1 a gallon to $2 a gallon. And just in the time that the Democrats have held the gavel they have taken this country from $2.33 to $4.08 a gallon. 
   I was listening to the previous discussion that occurred, and I heard some suggestions about why the price of gasoline has gone up so dramatically. And I find it interesting, because if you look at the votes from 1994 until today, this Congress has already voted on whether or not we should explore in ANWR. We voted on it. In fact, the Congress, back in 1995, sent a bill to President Bill Clinton to say that we should be drilling in ANWR. The House passed that bill, the Senate passed that bill. Unfortunately, it was President Bill Clinton that vetoed that bill; otherwise, we would have already been drilling in ANWR. We wouldn't be in the pickle that we're in today. 
   But this is the vote and these are the facts. I'm not trying to be partisan because we need to come together, as Democrats and Republicans, and solve this problem now because Americans are feeling real pain and the economy is reeling over energy prices. But here's the facts, Mr. Speaker. This is a fact. Any American can go and find out what the voting has been on ANWR exploration, of bringing energy down from Alaska. 
   Ninety-one percent of Republicans have voted to explore in ANWR and drill for oil in ANWR, 91 percent; 86 percent of Democrats have opposed drilling. And that hasn't changed today because we already know what the Democrat plan is for energy, they've made it abundantly clear. It is very simple. Their plan has been, let's have the United States Government--that created this problem--take over the oil industry and nationalize oil refineries. That's what they said last week at a press conference, let's nationalize oil refineries. Well, that's not a new idea, but it's not an American idea. And that's not an idea that the American public wants us to embrace. They don't want us to embrace socialism. But that's what we heard Democrats say last week. 
   Here's the other part of their plan: It is, drive less and pay more. Drive less and pay more. That's not what the American people want. But Senator Obama, the nominee of the Democrat party, just recently said it isn't the high price of gasoline that has him worried, it's how quickly that price went up. Well, I'll tell you one thing, Congressman Bob Latta, Congressman Paul Broun and also Congressman Rob Wittman, who was on the floor tonight, it's the high price of gasoline that's bothering us. 
   Republicans don't want to see gas at $4.08 a gallon, or $5 or $6--or whatever that price could be by the end of summer. We don't want it that price because we know for a fact we can get gasoline back down to $2 a gallon or less very simply if all we do is explore what we already know we have. We've got the resources, we've got the technology. We can do this thing, we're Americans. We're Americans, and we can do this, just like Congressman Wittman said, like we did with the Apollo 13. We can do this, and it's exciting. 
   We don't have to go with the Democrat agenda, which is, nationalize the oil industry, take over the oil refineries. We think the United States Government--who didn't do such a great job at Walter Reed Hospital--is going to be brilliant and bring down the price of gas by taking over oil refineries? I don't think so. I don't think that's who I want to trust, not with the American people saying that we have a 12 percent approval rating; I don't think they would trust us either. 
   And I don't think the American people want us to drive less and pay more. I think what the American people want is what the Republicans are offering. And that's why I'm so grateful to Congressman Latta tonight for sponsoring this important hour on energy. Because what Congressman Latta is trying to let the American people know is that we can get back down to $2 a gallon of gas or less if we open up the key to our own answer, which is, open up America's supplies and do it in a clean, safe, environmentally sensitive way, which we've already done. 
   How do I know that to be true? Because the United States was one of the only countries in the world last year that actually reduced its emissions. That's right, Mr. Speaker, the United States is one of the only countries in the world that reduced its emissions. All these other countries that signed onto the Kyoto Treaty, the EU, that signed onto this elaborate, bureaucratic-driven cap and trade system, their emissions all went up, ours went down. What's the difference? 
   We, in this country, believe in freedom. We believe in freedom and we believe in free markets to solve our problems. And they do, free markets solve the problems. It's not socializing our oil industry like the Democrats have suggested. It's not sitting home, putting a sweater on, turning our thermostat down, that's not going to solve the problem. It's not going to be paying more at the pump; that's not going to solve the problem. It is unleashing American ingenuity and finding these new sources of supply, which we already have, with technology that we already have, and bring the supplies in so we can make it happen. 
   I am so excited about what Congressman Latta is 
   doing. And I just want to end now with these other statistics, and they're very simple. House Republicans voted 97 percent of the time to have coal-to-liquid technology, to give us more oil at cheaper prices. Democrats opposed it 78 percent of the time. 
   Oil shale exploration. The United States is the Saudi Arabia of oil. We have more oil just in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming than all of Saudi Arabia, over 1.3 trillion barrels of oil. Republicans said yes, let's explore that oil 90 percent of the time. Democrats opposed exploring that oil 86 percent of the time. 
   Outer Continental Shelf, where we have 86 billion barrels of oil. House Republicans voted 81 percent of the time, let's explore, let's access that energy. Democrats, almost the flip, 83 percent opposed exploration. 
   On refinery increase. Because, you know, we had over 300 refineries not too long ago in this country, we're now down to somewhere near 150 refineries. The Republicans voted 97 percent to increase the number of refineries, Democrats opposed it 96 percent. 
   I don't take any glory in reading those numbers, but if you average them all together, over 90 percent of the time, Mr. Speaker, Republicans have voted to explore American energy, explore it now so that Americans can pay less. That's our answer. We're not new to this dance. This has been the answer that Republicans have been giving since 1994. That's the answer we want to have. Democrats, since 1994, almost 90 percent have said no, let's not access American resources; in fact, let's make it illegal to access these resources. Well, that's not what the American people say. 
   Mr. Speaker, over 70 percent of the American people have had it up to here. They're seeing their lives change; they're seeing jobs lost, jobs sent overseas. They want us to explore here, explore now, so they can pay less. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, we agree with the American people. And Congressman Latta is leading the charge tonight to let the American people know that we're with them, we're in their corner. We don't think they are the problem. We think the American people are way out in front on this solution. 
   So I yield back, Congressman Latta. I yield back because I can't wait to hear what more you have to say on this issue. And thank you for that opportunity.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you, Congressman Latta. I want to address a point that was brought up by Congressman Broun and really the absurdity of the remark regarding the oil leases that oil companies have taken up. These lands are owned by the American people and they are leased out to oil companies or natural gas companies. These oil and gas companies have to pay for these leases. They aren't just given to them free of charge. They have to pay for the right to search for the oil.  
   They take all the risk, and they find the natural resource and they access that natural resource. It doesn't make any sense economically for a company to lease something and waste money on leases that they aren't going to use. It's already in law that if the companies that lease this land, if they are not productive, it's already a law they have to turn the leases back. They can't just lease them forever, get them for free, not pay for that right to lease the land. They have to already turn them back if they aren't productive, because the companies know if there's oil on the land, or if there's gas on the land, they already know if it's there. 
   Just because they have leased land doesn't mean that there's oil on it or that there's gas on it. It just doesn't make sense someone is going to waste money if they are in a private company. That takes away from profit, and you need to have profits to be able to go forward. 
   Again, this is the 75th anniversary of the New Deal, and it reminds me of Solomon, who said in Ecclesiastes, ``There is nothing new under the sun.'' And there is nothing new under the sun with a lot of these suggestions we have seen. As a matter of fact, the plan we have seen so far from the Democrats has been this, and it's pretty simple, it is: Drive less, pay more. That is pretty much the plan that we have seen. Oh, yeah, also, let's increase taxes on the domestic production of American energy. That doesn't take too much for the American people to figure out. 
   If Congress would decide we are going to start taxing food, do you think food would cost more? Of course it would. What about if Congress decided, Let's add taxes to health care, as if that wasn't expensive enough. Would that cost more? Of course it would. 
   This is not the way the American people want us to go. They don't want us to jack up taxes on American production of oil. They don't want to drive less, they don't want to pay more. They don't want to have America socializing and taking over oil refineries. What the American people want, pure and simple, is freedom. They want freedom, they want the free market, and they want to see energy prices get back down to $2 a gallon or less. 
   I know it's possible, I know it can happen, and that is why I am so thankful for your brilliant leadership tonight, Congressman Latta, and also for Congressman Paul Brown, and also for Congressman Wittman, who was here earlier this evening speaking, because here's an answer. Here's an answer. 
   It's here, it's ours, it's for the taking. We can be environmentally sensitive. We can explore here in America now, and we can have Americans pay less. I yield back.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to let all of our troops serving overseas know that America supports you. Eliminating or cutting funding for our men and women who wear the uniform of the United States is not a recipe for ensuring stability in the Middle East; in fact, it is a recipe for demoralization, and it is irresponsible in its proposal. I urge all Members to support our troops and oppose any effort to cut off or restrict funding for American troops in harm's way, whether in Iraq, in Afghanistan, or elsewhere in the global war on terror. 
   It is imperative that we fully support those who are on the front lines fighting the war on terror. America thanks you, our brave men and women in uniform.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for that designation of hour, and the purpose for being here this evening is to focus on the number one issue that many of us are hearing from our constituents back home, and that's the pain that they're feeling over the increase in energy prices. 
   There are a number of us here that are serving in the United States House of Representatives that are hearing the American people, Mr. Speaker, and we are crying out, as our constituents are crying out, to make sure that something can be done. 
   And the reason why we're bringing this discussion here before this body, the most magnificent body on the planet, the floor of the United States Congress, where freedom reigns, we're bringing this up here because the United States Congress is the entity that caused the current problem that we're under, and let me explain why. 
   The United States Congress has made it virtually illegal to access America's rich storehouse of energy resources. I know it's hard to believe, Mr. Speaker. It's almost impossible to believe. Why would any group of people, especially in a country where there's freedom, want to restrict access to energy resources? It doesn't make any sense. 
   So a number of us are here this evening because we want to talk about the possibilities that there are to have energy independence in the United States and to reach the very possible goal of getting back to having Americans pay $2 a gallon or less. 
   So, to start off this evening, I'd like to call on my colleague and I'd like to defer to him, Mr. Patrick McHenry from the great State of North Carolina.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentleman. I appreciate, Congressman McHenry, your passion, your work on the issue, particularly the work that you are doing offering that spectacular prize. 
   One thing that we do understand and know in the depth of our bones is that American innovation has never died, it has always been alive and well. And when you hold that tremendous carrot out there, we know the American people can deliver, Mr. Speaker. That has been proved generation after generation. Every generation has been presented with a crisis. 
   Today, in the United States, this Special Order hour and the speakers who will be speaking now during this time are addressing the number one challenge of our age. And the great thing is the fact that we have an answer. It's entirely possible to solve this crisis. And we know the formula: It's explore here in America. Do it now so that the American people can get back to paying $2 a gallon for gas or less. It's entirely possible, and it can be done. 
   That's why so many of us are excited. This coming weekend the Republican leader, JOHN BOEHNER, will be hosting a trip with about 10 freshmen, and we will be doing an American energy tour. On that tour, we will have a chance to go to Golden, Colorado to take a look at the national alternative energy laboratories, where we can find some of the ideas of the next generation, innovation that is yet to come on energy use and independence. And from there we will go up to Alaska, to ANWR, where there are proven reserves. 
   To speak out more on ANWR tonight, I've asked, and he has accepted, the Representative from western Iowa, Representative STEVE KING, who has been to the ANWR region of Alaska, who has been there, who knows the value of energy independence. 
   Before I yield to my brother, I want to just highlight today in the Financial Services Committee--of which I am a member and of which Congressman McHenry, who was here speaking before myself, is also a member--we had the occasion to have the Federal Reserve Chairman, Mr. Ben Bernanke, in front of the committee today. And for all of us this was an enlightening moment because the Federal Reserve Chair stated without blinking an eye today in committee, he said, ``A 1 percent increase in supply of energy''--American energy--``could lower prices by as much as 10 percent.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who told  our Committee on Financial Services that if you increase the source of American supply by even 1 percent, you can lower the price at the pump by 10 percent. Well, Mr. Speaker, the Republicans in the United States House of Representatives want to increase American supply vastly more than by 1 percent. We can do that, and we can get back to $2 a gallon of gasoline. 
   So now I would like to take the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to yield to my colleague, the esteemed Representative STEVE KING from western Iowa, on the issue of ANWR.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. 
   We are excited about being able to go up there this coming weekend. And just think, here we are at the end of July. The end of July. And when we had our briefing this afternoon, what we were told is that essentially we should be taking with us a waterproof down parka. So this is not necessarily an area where we are going to find tourists lying on a beach. There probably couldn't be a better square footage area on the planet to drill than the ANWR area. And I know the freshmen that are going look forward to having another Special Order when we come back, Mr. Speaker, so we can report to the American people on our findings. 
   Before I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio, I just wanted to mention that one argument that we have been hearing a lot from the Democrats who are in charge of Congress--the Democrats control the agenda both in the House and in the Senate. And it's really mind bending to think that the Democrats have taken virtually no initiative whatsoever to add even one new drop of oil into the American pipeline nor one new watt of electricity. It's absolutely true. There has been complete inertia on the part of increasing America's energy supply. 
   What have we heard from the Democrats? We have heard for a catcall from them that 68 million acres that are leased out right now to companies that want to produce energy in America that apparently, according to Democrats, they're just sitting on that land. 
   Well, now, first of all, that doesn't make sense. My husband and I are business owners. One thing business owners don't do because there's not a lot of margin, there's not a lot of fluff or paddling left in your business budget, you don't just buy assets and leave them to not produce. It's a nonsensical argument from the Democrats. When they're saying that there are 68 million acres that are being leased, recognize, as the people, and your Federal Government, Mr. Speaker, deal with onshore and offshore leases, they told me this: They said, Representative Bachmann, every single acre is leased, and every single acre is in the current range of exploration. It takes so long to permit. And then the Federal Government allows 11 different points in the permitting process where lawsuits can be filed against the people who want to produce energy. So these energy producing wannabes are in a very difficult position of putting their capital on the table, their money on the table to try to drill for energy, and at the same time they have to wait for these artificial timelines to expire for a permitting process and they have to deal with these nonstop lawsuits. It's amazing anyone wants to go into the business. And yet, unfortunately, this is the only thing that our colleagues on the other side, the Democrats, have come up with as an excuse on drilling. It doesn't make any sense to me. I'm  sure, Mr. Speaker, it makes no sense to the people who are watching tonight. 
   So I would like to yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio, Mrs. Jean Schmidt, for her comments now on energy.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Reclaiming my time, I had the Minnesota turkey producers in my office just a few days ago, and they told me that their energy prices have tripled this year in three different ways: One is in the area of feed. Another is the climate control that they have to have in the turkey houses. In Minnesota it gets hot and it gets cold. And then the third is on the transporting of the birds both to and from being produced. So they said they're getting hit on every single level. And the Minnesota Farm Bureau was in my office yesterday. They told me the same thing. 
   It doesn't matter which part of agriculture we are talking about. In Minnesota we have a lot of 
   agriculture. Our farmers are feeling it, and not only are our farmers feeling it, our constituents, every time they go to the grocery store, are feeling it. So I thank the gentlewoman for bringing up this very important point. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio, JEAN SCHMIDT, for her work that she has done and for listening to her constituents. 
   I know off the floor we have talked about the beating that your constituents are taking on this issue. I know your heart is breaking for the people back in your district in Ohio. You see the reality of how this is impacting people. 
   And you spoke about petroleum, how petroleum is a part of every meal that we have. And I know that truckers in Minnesota told me that everything you have on your table takes about on average 1,200 miles in a truck or in some form of transportation to get to that table. So if we haven't seen increases in groceries, and I know in Minnesota we have seen increases in groceries, we are going to continue to see them if we don't solve this problem. We can get back to $2 a gallon gasoline. It's entirely possible because we have the resources. 
   So I thank you for your fervor on this issue. And I know one thing: Had the Republicans been in control of Congress this year, we would have seen action. We wouldn't have seen inertia. Just like the Republican-controlled Congress passed measures before in previous years to drill in ANWR. Unfortunately, when those measures made it to the Senate, they weren't passed. The one year when both the House and the Senate passed a bill to begin drilling in ANWR, which was in 1995, unfortunately, President Bill Clinton chose to veto that legislation. We would have had all of that oil online and swooshing down the pipeline from Alaska down to the lower 48 so that we could have had that available.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. I thank the gentleman from the Buckeye State, Mr. Latta, for your words because you understand the answer, which the American people get. This is not terribly complicated. This is not difficult to figure out. America has made a big mistake. And it isn't the American people that have made a big mistake. It's the Members of Congress that made a big mistake when they made it illegal, and that's right, the United States Congress made it illegal to access the answer to our energy problem. 
   Mr. Latta has laid that case out very well. He has made the case. And he has made the case that we need to change the way we're doing business, and we need to make it legal. And instead of being one of the biggest importers of energy, we can be the biggest exporter. Because it's all about jobs. 
   And that is why I would like to hand out the baton now to my esteemed colleague from the State of Michigan, Representative Tim Walberg. Because in the State of 
   Michigan, Mr. Speaker, there is possibly no other State that compares in terms of the misery that they have dealt with with their recession and with the job losses. And I think probably no one can speak to this better than Representative Tim Walberg and also his esteemed colleague, Thaddeus McCotter. 
   And now I will yield to my friend, Representative Tim Walberg.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for the American people to understand, as incredulous as it sounds, the majority, which again is run by the Democrats, both in the House and in the Senate, have made a deliberate decision to do absolutely nothing, nothing, nothing to bring even one drop of oil or one new watt of electricity online for the American people. 
   I just read this morning in my clips in Minnesota that energy went out in the afternoon. It was so hot, the demand was so high our energy grid is getting overloaded and we haven't been building the new power plants and exploring for the new energy. 
   This is key, Mr. Speaker, for the American people to know. The Republicans in Congress have a plan. It is American energy, yes. The Democrats have said American energy, no. We want $2 a gallon gas. We can get there if we drill here, drill now, so the American people can pay less. It's entirely possible. 
   The Democrat plan has been drive less, pay more. It's not working real well, Mr. Speaker. People don't like that plan. They really would like to be able to pay $2 a gallon gas, especially when they know it is possible. 
   We are so grateful we can have this opportunity tonight, so grateful. But I tell you, the passion burns pretty deep in here because we know when we go home fairly soon for the August break, we have a lot of angry people on our hands at home, and they have every right to be angry. We are here calling on the Democrat Congress, pleading with the Democrat Congress, listen to the American people. Drill here, drill now so the American people can pay less.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, today Congress is about to embark upon another corporate bailout--this time for Detroit's Big Three automakers--without any assurances to the taxpayers that it won't be back for more. In fact, from all news reports, while this bailout comes with a starting price of $15 billion, Congressional leadership negotiating the deal fully expects that this is just the beginning and that taxpayers will be hit up again in the new year. 
   Though the already-passed $700-billion Wall Street bailout has had little to no success, Congress is about to go down this same road again. And, it appears that it does so with few qualms about the impact of its actions on hard-pressed taxpayers. 
   We hear promises of strict oversight and accountability measures--but who does the Congress think it's kidding? 
   Already two nonpartisan, independent panels have lambasted Treasury for its execution of the current bailout scheme. The Government Accountability Office's (GAO) scathing report about the Federal Government's poor oversight says it all in the title: Additional Actions Needed to Better Ensure Integrity, Accountability, and Transparency. 
   Why should taxpayers expect the government's oversight of this bailout be any different? 
   Unfortunately, the Democrat-led Congress has chosen to blindly oblige Big Labor at  every turn, regardless of whether it's in the best interest of taxpayers. 
   They have dismissed consideration of alternative proposals that could truly restructure these companies over the long-term and help them rein in costs. 
   They don't want Ford, GM and Chrysler to reorganize under the protection of the bankruptcy courts, even if it would save them without a taxpayer bailout, because it means that they would actually make structural changes and renegotiate labor contracts without the threat of outside lawsuits. 
   The Democrats have already spent more than a trillion dollars in bailouts this year--why not a few billion more? 
   Mr. Speaker, the hardworking men and women in America did not sign up for this. 
   They did not turn over their hard-earned money to Uncle Sam just so Congress can dole it out to unaccountable companies that made poor business decisions for years. 
   Throwing taxpayer money at Detroit's spiraling problems will not fix their long-term management and productivity troubles and they will only be back for more time and time again. 
   Congress should not look the other way and put the taxpayers, and their children and grandchildren, on the hook for billions more in unaccountable spending.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (BUDGET SCHOOL -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. I want to thank the gentlelady from Tennessee and applaud her and thank her for her efforts as she is leading this wonderful budget school for the people of the United States, and I would consider her the dean of our budget school, and she's doing a wonderful job as dean. And I think that Representative Steve King may be considered a tenured professor in the budget school that the gentlelady from Tennessee is quite brilliantly hosting for the benefit of the American people. 
   It's so important that we're taking up this topic and devoting this time, because what all Americans share in common is that we, generally speaking, all are working for a living. And the one thing that we're finding is that more and more of our time is being spent working on behalf of political subdivisions. Whether it's the Federal Government, whether it's State government, whether it's local government, quite often our taxes are taking up perhaps as much time as from when we get up on January 1 and go to work, or if it's January 2, until perhaps in May or June, almost everything that we make during that time period is going to government. 
   I know that's hard to believe. But when you add up all the money that we're paying in taxes, about that much of our time is going to earn money that will, in turn, be handed over to government to spend our money. That's what's happening, and that's what we're yielding in terms of our sovereignty, is the amount of time that we are spending working to provide for our families; that much time is being spent going to government, because someone is going to spend the money that we earn. 
   The question is, will we have the power over being able to make those choices over spending, or will political subdivisions, whether it is the Federal, State or local, have the ability to make those choices? 
   I want to show you now a chart that we have up here. This talks about how much the budget that has just been passed, which the majority, the Democrat majority has the largest spending increases in American history for the budget and the largest tax increases in American history. 
   Take a look at the numbers. On every State, from Alabama to Wyoming, there's an increase in taxes for every American across the board, on average, from Alabama to Wyoming. And these aren't small increases. This is over and above what the average American is already paying. 
   But take a look at these increases. If you're in the State of Alabama, it's over a $2,500 increase in taxes beyond what you're paying now. If you're in the State of Wyoming, it's over a $3,100 tax increase. 
   I represent great people, great people from the State of Minnesota in the Sixth Congressional District. In Minnesota, the average taxpayer in Minnesota will pay over $3,000 more in taxes than what they're paying now. 
   Well, take a look at what your grocery bill has been doing. It's been going sky high lately. 
   And take a look at what we're paying at the gas pump. I was in St. Cloud, Minnesota last week. The price of diesel gasoline was $3.81. The price of regular gasoline was $3.14. When I took office and was sworn in for the first time as a brand new freshman Member of Congress, I thought gasoline was too high then, and it was about $2.25 a gallon. 
   Well, what has this Congress yielded, the 110th Congress? 
   So far this Congress has gone for the largest tax increase in American history, the largest spending increase in American history. 
   And as the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), and as Representative Steve King has said, from Iowa, and also the gentleman from Georgia, Representative Kingston has said, this Congress has failed to do anything to reform Social Security and Medicare. Every American should take pause right now and realize how sobering that is, because the United States Government has made a promise to the senior citizens of this country, has made a promise. I'm worried that this Congress will have difficulty keeping that promise with our senior citizens if we don't reform these important programs. We can't do that if we are raising the average American's taxes. 
   And I will yield back to the gentlewoman from Tennessee after I make this important point, and it's this: In the Budget Committee markup of Fiscal Year 2009 there was a unanimous vote to increase the marginal tax rates. 
   What does this mean? 
   Whether you are a low-income American, a middle-income American, or a high-income American, guess what? Your taxes are going up. That will impact you in an already weak economy. 
   Unanimously, unfortunately, the Democrats voted to cut the $1,000 child tax credit in half. That really hurts. My husband and I have five kids. We raised 23 foster kids. Do you know how important a $1,000 child tax credit is to the average family? That's really important. Well, they voted unanimously, unfortunately, the Democrats, to cut the $1,000 child tax credit in half. That will impact average Americans.  
   They also voted to eliminate the marriage penalty tax relief. Why would we do that? Why would we want to take away tax credits for people who are married? Married people are raising the next generation of Americans. We want to help them, not hurt them. 
   They also voted to eliminate the capital gains and dividends relief. This was the big driver. From 2000 until 2008, this has driven our economy forward. This has been a good thing. 
   And also, unfortunately, to bring back the death tax. 
   This is not the direction we want to go. The direction we want to go is one, a budget that the Republicans have put forward, and that's a growth budget, a budget to cut your taxes, cut wasteful spending, and put in place the mechanisms that will provide growth for this economy so that you can keep more of your income and start working for you, rather than working for the government. 
   And that's why I commend the gentlelady from Tennessee. As the dean of our budget school, she has been letting the American people know, in the plainest possible language, that we are here because we want to work for you. We hear you. We hear the difficulties that you're laboring under. 
   And I yield back to the gentlelady now to go on and continue to explain forthwith to the American people how important this ongoing discussion is.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, as the author of an amendment that was not made in order under this rule, I rise in opposition to this rule. My amendment would have prohibited taxpayer funds authorized by this bill from being used to purchase mercury-laden compact fluorescent light bulbs, also known as the CFL. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention to take the choice away from public schools as to how to meet their lighting needs. In fact, I believe that Congress already makes, too often, decisions for our citizens. But it is Congress' single-minded dangerous pursuit of this environmental fad that has gotten us all to this point of silliness today. 
   Congress must ensure that mercury-laden light bulbs are safe before we encourage their use in our child's classrooms. There are very serious health concerns about these light bulbs that are filled with mercury. They pose problems to humans precisely because of their high mercury content, and we must be sure of their safety before we force them on our public school children through this ill-conceived law. 
   When mercury light bulbs break, let's remember, extensive cleanup is needed. That's what these regulations show us. This is very highly selective and very detailed clean-up regulations. 
   What does this mean for school children that could be exposed to light bulbs of the broken mercury latent light bulbs? On the EPA's own Web site  are these eight pages of instructions about how to deal with a mercury spill, specifically including spills due to broken mercury light bulbs. 
   Let me run you through just some of the steps for cleaning up just one broken mercury light bulb. 
   Before the clean-up ever begins, people must leave the room for 15 minutes as the room airs out putting a halt to the learning that's taking place in the classroom. The school then is told to shut off their central air-conditioning system, or, in Minnesota's case, central heating system, and then they're told not to use a broom to sweep up the broken light bulb as they could come in contact with mercury at a later time. 
   This should give Congress pause to think about this next rule that says if clothing comes in contact with a broken light bulb and the mercury, it must be disposed of immediately. Imagine that. Children or teachers or the janitorial staff would have to remove their clothing immediately, and we're told that you are not allowed to wash your clothes. That's what the EPA rules say. You're not allowed to wash your clothes. That won't do the trick because mercury fragments in the clothing might contaminate the washing machine and also pollute sewage. 
   Let's get this straight. Congress is worried about harming sewage and yet we're rushing to place these mercury light bulbs in our classrooms next to our children. That step alone should be a warning to the dangers of mercury-laden light bulbs.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. But the kicker of them all is the disposal process. Immediately a person must place all of the clean-up materials in an outdoor trash can or protected area for normal trash pickup. But make sure that you check with your local government. 
   In Minnesota, my home State, it does not allow for normal trash disposal for mercury. Instead, they require that broken and unbroken mercury bulbs be taken to a local recycling center. 
   There are so many rules that are contained on the EPA Web site that I don't have time to address them all, but while these clean-up guidelines are important and should be followed, the harm that just one broken light bulb can have on a child, senior citizen, or an animal is very real, which is why Congress should not embark on these fads. 
   I hope none of us will have to respond to the news story of a girl or a boy or a senior citizen or an animal who is poisoned by a broken mercury-ladened light bulb. That would be horrible. 
   I speak today to alert this body and the American people of this yet considerable loss of liberty.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BACHMANN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, the morning of September 11, 2001, I was a Minnesota State senator meeting  with a group of local educators at a Perkins Restaurant in Woodbury, Minnesota. Because you can't find a babysitter at 7 o'clock in the morning, I had my three daughters with me at the restaurant when I learned of the attacks. After that meeting, I dropped our girls off at school and then, together with millions of Americans, in horror I watched my television as the terror unfolded. Thousands of innocent Americans were targeted for death that morning by an evil regime of radical jihadists. Then came the challenge of explaining to our children the magnitude of the tragedy that had just befallen our Nation. As a mother, I can tell you it was one the most difficult conversations that I have ever had. 
   September 11 galvanized Americans. We knew without a doubt that we had an enemy, but America fought back, united. We were attacked on September 11, but the radical Islamic jihadists declared war on innocent Americans long before that morning and, chillingly, that war continues even today. Their brand of evil chooses to kill the greatest number of innocent civilians. They are a cruel enemy. They are unwavering in their resolve to seek the total annihilation of the United States of America and of our freedoms, and of our Western allies especially. They seek to destroy our friend, the State of Israel. 
   Today, Iraq is the central front in this war, and that is according to the radical Islamists themselves. Some in this Chamber may want to deny that fact. However, it is the jihadists who chose Iraq as the central front in the war on terror. It wasn't the United States. And we fight them on their turf. Al-Zawahiri has said many times that Iraq is one of the crucial fields in the Islamist war. The radical Islamists know that they cannot beat us with guns and with bullets alone. They can only beat us in one way, and that is if they crumple the resolve of America to fight and to win this war. 
   To American soldiers, I want to say to you specifically tonight, know that many of us here in the United States Congress support you and your mission. We pray for you. We love you. We appreciate you and your sacrifices on behalf of our freedoms. It is because of your bravery that we will defeat the radical jihadists. Surrender is not an option, not if our goal is the maintenance of freedom. 
   It is very telling, I think, that the resolution that we are debating this evening only states what those on the other side of the aisle oppose. After all these hours of debate, the American people have yet to hear a plan from the Democrats for victory in this war against terror. 
   I believe, and you, our troops, know that victory against the evil people who want to kill Americans transcends politics. Victory in this war means that no mother will have to explain to their children the death of thousands of innocent Americans. 
   American soldiers, please know that many of us in this Congress stand strong in our resolve to support you and our fight to preserve America's freedoms. On my watch, I pledge to you during this, my term in Congress, that I will stand for you, and I will vote to preserve America's freedom. 
   And I want to say to you this evening that it is American soldiers, Minnesotans, who are in the National Guard. It is members of the Minnesota National Guard who make up over 10 percent of this increase in troops. Minnesota is supplying over 10 percent of those troops. 
   I had the brigadier general of the Minnesota Guard in my office yesterday, and I asked him, What is the morale? What is the message that these troops want me to know? And he said, They want you to know that they stand ready to fight, and their morale is high. 
   I say thank you to the Minnesota National Guard. Thank you for your sacrifice. Thank you for your bravery. I will stand with you. Just as the Minnesotans who stood first in line in the battle to fight for our Union, it is Minnesota who is standing strong in this battle to fight. It is the battle of our time, the balance of our generation, and I stand with you.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, it truly is a momentous evening this evening and the entire day here on the March for Life that occurred here on our Nation's capital, and it is a privilege for me to be here as a freshman Member of Congress, hailing from the very cold State of Minnesota, to be able to be here on this floor on this momentous occasion. 
   We heard so many eloquent speakers, led by TRENT FRANKS, a man who has a great love for people, not just a love for babies, not just a love for women. He has a love for people, and I am so grateful for the wonderful hour that he just led. We have other Members of Congress, Mr. Speaker, who have come down to this Chamber because they are moved by this issue, not just for their love for babies or their love for women or love for men, but they are moved by many factors that go to increase our Nation and the natural resources that are in our Nation. 
   One of those is Mr. Bishop who is from Utah's First District, and he would like to speak for a few moments on the floor of Congress.

   Mrs. BACHMANN. Thank you, Mr. Akin. It was a delight to be able to hear you speak, Mr. Akin. I know the people of Missouri's Second are honored that you are their Member of Congress. That was certainly a heartfelt emotion that you shared with us at the microphone, and I thank you for bringing what for many Americans is the pivotal watershed issue of our day, and I thank you for speaking so eloquently to that. 
   We have next before us this evening during this hour, Mr. Jeb Hensarling from Texas' Fifth District. 
   Mr. Hensarling is a very special Member of Congress to me. He is my mentor here and is a giant among men in many ways. He's a giant in my eyes, and a giant I know for his wife, a giant for his two children. 
   He lives the words that he speaks on a daily basis. There is no greater testimony that any man or any woman could ever have is the testimony of their life, and that, Mr. Hensarling, he knows very well. 
   And so with that, I yield to Mr. Jeb Hensarling of Texas' Fifth District.

   Ms. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Hensarling from Texas' Fifth District. He has confirmed once again to me, Mr. Speaker, that not only is he a giant among men here in this body, but he is a gentle giant, and those are the greatest of all. 
   I think I have seen a tenderness here this evening, a softness and an eloquence that he speaks, the foundational nature of the issue that we are grappling tonight. There is a sweet sorrow, if you will, regarding this subject because we are talking about something that is dealing with the foundational nature of this country and yet of all humanity, and that is life and what we will do with life. 
   And I jotted down just a few words before I came up to manage this hour. And I wrote down that every generation, Mr. Speaker, seems to grapple with an issue that transcends all others. That issue for 31 years has been whether government will protect from destruction life, innocent human life. 
   Our American landscape has changed so dramatically over these last 31 years. I was in high school when the Roe v. Wade decision came down. I hate to admit I was so ignorant when I was a junior in high school, I didn't even know what abortion meant. I didn't even know what it was. What innocence that time was in the early seventies here in the United States. 
   In that time, Mr. Speaker, we have lost 50 million fellow Americans, and now we've lost the children, some of whom those 50 million would have borne. There are 50 million women whose bodies were violated by the horrific violence that we call here in this chamber abortion. There are 50 million men who have lost out on the tremendous privilege and joy of fatherhood, and our Nation today is poorer because we're missing, Mr. Speaker, 50 million fellow Americans, so sadly. 
   An inordinate number of these 50 million Americans are children of color. We needed those children of color in our Nation. We needed those African American babies, those Latino babies, those Asian babies. We need them, Mr. Speaker, in our Nation. 
   And we mourn together the loss of these priceless treasures that would have woven a beautiful tapestry of humanity even here in our midst. Yes, we mourn with a great sadness, but we also rejoice, and we also take great joy in the fact that today, even now, we're making a down payment because today is a new day. 
   It's a new day for a future of change, and it's my hope and my prayer that it is today, Mr. Speaker, that the words that are spoken on this floor would captivate the attention of young women and young men across our Nation, young people who may have had the chance to turn this show this evening on television, who would choose to respect their bodies and would choose to respect their sexuality and choose to respect their fertility because fertility is a gift. It's not a given. It's a gift. 
   Ask those people who can't have children. Ask women with love who would love to bear a child but can't, young people who will choose to be givers in this Nation, givers to one another in love, givers to themselves, givers to our Nation and givers to the next generation of Americans. 
   Today, earlier, I had the great privilege of being in my home State of Minnesota. I went up to the steps of our State capitol. Thousands of Minnesotans had gathered. You think it's cold in Washington, DC? There is nothing like a March For Life rally in the State of Minnesota. It was sub-zero. I wasn't wearing boots. I had a wool overcoat on, and in a moment, my feet were tingling, freezing cold. There were thousands that were there that had braved sub-zero freezing temperatures, holding signs, from cities across the State of Minnesota because they wanted to be there to choose life, Mr. Speaker, and march for the greatest gift that any of us have ever had, the gift of life. 
   I want to take these few minutes right now to thank the Americans and the people across the globe who have chosen to adopt children. There is no such thing in this country as an unwanted child. There is no such thing. There is a line a mile long of men and women who would give anything tonight to adopt a child. Yes, even the less than a perfect child there's a mile long group of people who would say me, let me, just like Mother Theresa 
   of India who said give them to me and I will take these children. 
   Thank you to those who have chosen to give life, and whether you kept that child or blessed another family with a child, thank you for choosing life tonight. 
   I want to thank parents who have chosen to be foster parents, who have taken children in less than ideal situations, or parents that couldn't cope  with a child who was difficult. I thank the foster parents who have opened your hearts, opened your arms, opened your homes, who've inconvenienced yourselves, but yet, you have chosen a better way, to give life in a different sort of way to children in foster homes. 
   I also want to thank the women who have chosen life and the parents who have encouraged their young daughters or their sons to be supportive of women in a situation where they didn't know if they would choose life or if they would choose to take life. I thank the parents. 
   It's easy when your child is suffering with an unplanned pregnancy to say it's okay, I'll support you, I'll take you to that abortion clinic, I will pay for that abortion. But they don't always recognize that there is a price that that young woman will pay for the rest of her life in her emotion because her arms will be forever empty, and she'll know that there is a baby that could have been hers and yet was not, or a young man who knows he could have been a father to that baby. 
   Parents, think again. Taking the easy way isn't always the easy way, Mr. Speaker, and for boyfriends who just heard the news that their girlfriend is pregnant, oh, my gosh, of course I will pay for the abortion you say, let's do that. You don't need this; I don't need this. We've got a whole life in front of us. Who needs this? We can do this. I will borrow the money from my parents, the boyfriend might say, Mr. Speaker, or yet he might say I'll drop you if you don't have this abortion. I'll leave you. I'll walk out on you. 
   There's another way. There's another choice. There's a choice called life, and it may be inconvenient and it may be embarrassing and it may be expensive, and yes, it will change your life and there may be pain, but there will be joy when you hear that first cry, when you hold that hand that literally covers your finger. And when you look in those eyes and you stroke that silky hair, there is nothing like that baby that you will see, and it will change your life as a young man. It will change your life as a young woman. 
   That baby has the power to change America. Every baby has the power to change this country. They are America's greatest natural resource. 
   I thank my parents, David and Jean, who gave me life. I thank my husband who stood by me with our five babies and who stood by me when we lost a baby. I thank you for standing by me when we didn't know if we could go on anymore, and I thank you for stepping up to the plate, for being willing to bring 23 foster children into our home so we could offer an alternative for those children and hopefully give them a down payment on a future and on a hope. 
   These remarks that we gave here tonight are not about condemning anyone. Who could? Who could? I couldn't condemn anyone. Who could? But it's about lifting up people. We're here to lift up people. These remarks tonight weren't given to judge anyone. Who could? We're here to heal and offer a healing alternative. 
   That's why recently I introduced a bill, and it's a bipartisan bill. Democrats are on this bill. Republicans are on this bill. This is not partisan. This is about life, and this is about humanity and choosing the best that are among us, and in the Positive Alternatives Act, we just say something very simply. It says that today there are tax dollars that go to Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of abortion in the United States. Tax dollars go to Planned Parenthood. 
   There are not tax dollars that go to life care centers in this country, and we want to change that. We want to level the playing field.     
   And we want to give a positive alternative all across this great country so that there is a chance for men and women to say, let me think about this. Maybe I don't want to choose death. Maybe I want to choose something else. Maybe there's someone out there who can help me through a difficult time, who could help me with my medical needs, who could help me to get a job, who could help me get some education, who could help me get clothes on my back, who could help me if I want to keep this baby, who could help me if I want to give this baby to a family who maybe doesn't have a baby. It's just common decency to allow for an alternative that leads to life and not lead to guilt and to death, and perhaps remorse that even a lifetime could never erase. 
   We are such a great country, Mr. Speaker. I know you feel that way, I know you do. And we're a blessed country. Let's choose life. Let's choose the better way. It's the American way.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Mr. Speaker, today we're considering a massive housing bill which saddles the American taxpayer with billions of dollars to bail out both Fannie and Freddie as well as irresponsible lenders, and yes, even some irresponsible borrowers. 
   But what will the American taxpayer be getting in return for being asked to be put on the hook for a deal that they weren't a part of and now all of the sudden they have to jump in and bail out someone else? Remember, 95 percent of Americans are paying on time their mortgages, their rents. They weren't a part of this very bad equation, but now they're being asked to come in, to have their taxes raised to bail out irresponsible lenders, and yes, even some irresponsible borrowers. 
   What are they going to get in return? Are they going to be assured that the worst loans that were made won't be dumped into this refinance program? No, not going to happen. Will they be assured that this affordable housing slush fund that will finance millions of dollars for political groups like ACORN, groups that are currently under investigation in States for voter fraud, that they won't be getting more tax money? No. Are they assured that Fannie and Freddie will never again become too big to fail? No. Fannie and Freddie will become even bigger. Are they assured of a clear path out of this explicit Federal backdrop? No. It's not going to happen. In fact, it's the opposite. The banks are going to rid their balance sheets of the worst performing loans--what we used to call ``dogs'' in the industry--and it will encourage them to serve up on a silver platter for hardworking Americans a huge tax increase for them to pay. 
   The hardworking Americans, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, that are financing this bailout are already paying over $4 a gallon for gasoline and prices for groceries they never thought that they would have to pay. They are the forgotten man, Mr. Speaker. The ``forgotten man'' is the hardworking man and the hardworking single woman who is paying their bills, but who now is being asked to front the cost for poor performing loans. It's a bad deal, and we need to reject this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BACHMANN. Madam Speaker, we hear a lot about energy. I know I do as well. And the one thing that we know is that we're at a refreshing point of clarity in the energy debate. The reason for that is because the Democrat response has now become very clear. 
   A leadership aide said this week that the Democrat plan is to have the American people drive small cars and wait for the wind. That is one plan. If the Democrats want the American people to drive less and pay more, that's one plan. 
   Another plan that the Republicans have been pushing is to make sure that we open up Americans sources of supply. Our goal is to see the American people paying $2 a gallon or less. It's entirely possible. Congress created this  problem, Congress can solve this problem. Open up American sources of supply and fast-track the permitting process, take away the artificial timelines; we can begin drilling immediately, which is what the American people are demanding, and we can get gasoline prices back down to $2 a gallon or less and get the economy moving.
