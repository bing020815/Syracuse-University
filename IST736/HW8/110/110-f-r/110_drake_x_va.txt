<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 415, which recognizes the service of two remarkable Asian Civil War veterans and also pays respect to all participants of this war with Asian and Pacific Islander heritage. 
   Arriving in America as a stowaway aboard a ship from China, Edward Day Cohota enlisted in the 23rd Regiment, Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, in the early years of the Civil War. He fought in the Battle of Drury's Bluff in Virginia on May 16, 1864. His wartime service continued at the Battle of Cold Harbor in Virginia on June 3, 1864. After the war, Mr. Cohota continued to serve for a total of 30 years active duty in the United States Army. 
   Joseph L. Pierce enlisted in the 14th Regiment, Connecticut Voluntary Infantry, in 1862 and fought on America's bloodiest day, September 17, 1862, in the Battle of Antietam. After managing to avoid being one of the 23,000 casualties of that battle, he continued to distinguish himself on the battlegrounds at Gettysburg where his unit helped to repulse Pickett's charge. 
   These two soldiers are but two of the Asian and Pacific Islanders who served their adopted Nation so well in the Civil War. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Honda of California, for introducing this resolution. I would like to encourage my colleagues to give their appreciation to these volunteers whose service has not been fully recognized. Therefore, I urge a ``yes'' vote on House Resolution 415. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 1248, which recognizes the service of the destroyer USS Farenholt and her men who served our great Nation with bravery in the South Pacific during World War II. 
   The USS Farenholt was commissioned on April 2, 1942 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The destroyer sailed from San Diego, California on July 1, 1942 for the Pacific. 
   Also known as the Fightin' F, she participated in the United States' first land offensive of World War II, the August 1942 invasion of Guadalcanal. The next month, Farenholt also served as an escort for the aircraft carrier USS Wasp, which was attacked by two enemy submarines. When the Wasp sank, the Farenholt rescued 143 of her survivors. 
   The Fightin' F fought in the battle of Cape Esperance in October 1942, and joined the American force that intercepted and defeated Japanese destroyers and cruisers. During the fight, the Farenholt suffered 46 casualties and severe damage from three direct hits. Despite this, her crew kept her from sinking, and she joined in the February 1944 destroyer raid on the Japanese stronghold at New Guinea where she sank two merchant ships. That raid earned very high praises from General Douglas MacArthur. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Ellsworth of Indiana, for introducing this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to recognize these brave and dedicated men of the USS Farenholt by supporting House Resolution 1248. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 358, as amended, which recognizes the National Guard and Reserve members from Nevada for their extraordinary service, not only to their State but also to this country. 
   I want to thank my fellow Republican, Mr. Heller of Nevada, for introducing this resolution. All of America should be proud of what the citizen soldiers of Nevada have accomplished while mobilized and deployed for or in support of the war on terror. Since 2003, more than 3,100 people from the Nevada National Guard and Reserves have performed above and beyond the call of duty in both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. They have served in combatant support roles putting their lives on hold while serving the country they swore to protect. They temporarily left their families and jobs behind to support the needs of the country, and they should be recognized and thanked for their sacrifice. 
   I would also like to thank the families of these brave men and women, for they become military families when this country needs them the most. They provide essential support to those National Guard and Reserve men and women. For that, we are forever grateful. 
   Since the earliest days of this great Nation, we have required a strong military, a military that is ready and willing to protect the Nation's interests. The Nevada Army National Guard and Reserves are essential to that strong military. They have always acted gallantly when called upon in any situation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution  358 and pay respects to the brave men and women of the State of Nevada. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 1316, which not only honors the service of the Navy and Coast Guard veterans who for 60 years served on the LST amphibious landing craft from World War II onward, but it also recognizes the key role played by LST amphibious craft. 
   During World War II, the LST met the urgent requirement of the Allied Forces for a new vessel, a vessel that was capable of the shore-to-shore delivery of vehicles and troops while conducting an amphibious assault upon the enemy. Between 1942 and 1943, three separate acts of Congress authorized the construction of these LSTs, and over 1,000 LSTs were built during World War II. 
   These landing craft saw action in every theater of World War II. LSTs played an essential role during the D-day campaign of June 1944. Not only were they the first line of troop transports onto the beaches, but they completed an evacuation of 41,035 wounded men back across the English Channel. LSTs landed on the beaches of places like Sicily, the Philippines, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and countless others. They survived kamikaze attacks, ocean mines and enemy submarine attacks. These remarkable vessels and their sailors earned the second most battle stars after destroyers. 
   During the Korean war, LSTs landed at Inchon. In the Vietnam war, they participated in the 1974 refugee evacuations. Also, LSTs provided humanitarian assistance during Operation Desert Shield, Operation Desert Storm and Operation Restore Hope in Somalia.     
   To honor such valued service, LST veterans, members of the LST Association, gained approval, through legislation, to sail the refurbished LST 325 back from Greece to the United States to transform the ship into a museum. They completed their sail on January 10, 2001, in Mobile, Alabama. Now the ship is based in Evansville, Indiana, as the USS LST Ship Memorial. The Navy decommissioned the last active LST, the USS Frederick, at Naval Station Pearl Harbor on October 5, 2002. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this most worthy resolution. It is impossible to express how essential these LSTs were during World War II and continuing until the early 21st century. These remarkable sailors of these ships should be recognized for their dedication, bravery, and loyalty to their Navy and their Nation. We should applaud them today, and every day. 
   I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for introducing this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, this is day 67. That's 67 days since the start of the new fiscal year and our veterans still do not have access to the increased funding provided in a bill that passed the House and Senate months ago and the President is waiting to sign. 
   The House-passed bill includes increased funding to improve access to medical services for all veterans, new initiatives for mental health and PTSD, increased funds for improved medical facilities and increased funding to assist homeless veterans, to name a few. 
   If the Democrats are acting in good faith and in the best interest of our Nation's veterans, why continue to delay this crucial funding? 
   The Democrats have failed in their earlier effort to use funding for our veterans as a bargaining chip for billions in unrelated spending. Why continue to delay this bill? 
   There are few things more important than ensuring that this Congress provides all possible benefits and health care for our veterans. I'm calling on the Speaker to move this bill forward, and I call on all Americans to contact their Representatives and tell the Democratic leadership to send a clean veterans appropriations bill to the President now.

   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, for 2 days now, this Congress has addressed a bill to provide increased unemployment benefits. The irony is what we are not talking about. 
   We must talk about why are businesses leaving America, why are we losing these jobs. The answer is overwhelmingly the cost of energy and our refusal as a Congress to capture our natural resources. 
   Dow Chemical stood beside us when Representative John Peterson announced the NEED Act, the bill that lifts the moratorium for natural gas in the Outer Continental Shelf. They told us of a $30 billion expansion and 10,000 jobs that they wished were here in America, but they were going to China, Libya and Saudi Arabia. Why? The price of natural gas. You can't pay $8 to $10 in America for an energy source that's 85 cents in those countries. We all know we lost the fertilizer industry a long time ago.

   Mrs. DRAKE. Think of the jobs that could be created, the jobs that we could keep here just by this industry. 
   And just yesterday, the subcommittee voted on a 9-6 vote, with the Democrat majority all voting not to allow us to lift the moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf. In the last 25 years, we've captured 7 billion barrels of oil in the Outer Continental Shelf. Do you realize the spillage has been one one-thousandth of 1 percent? 
   We also need to talk about those American families, those American workers who have purchased homes where they wanted them to be, not  worried about a commute to their job, but today, for several of those, their gas cost is the same as their mortgage. That impacts business in America. 
   Mr. Speaker, America is a great Nation because of her people. It's our responsibility to put the policies in place that allow them to have a quality of life and to create the jobs.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (NOAA LAND SALE -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be standing today in support of H.R. 5350, legislation that I sponsored along with Congressman Bobby Scott, which authorizes the sale or exchange of a specific tract of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) property located in Norfolk, Virginia. The sale of this NOAA land is something the City of Norfolk has been working on since 2005. I am proud that this legislation is being considered today, as it will have a significant impact on the economic development of Norfolk. 
   Over thirty years ago, the federal government purchased 3.78 acres of land located at 538 Front Street in Norfolk for $47,300. From this time forward, this prime, waterfront location has remained under-utilized--when the original intention for this land was to be the future site of NOAA's regional headquarters. 
   Allowing the City of Norfolk to purchase this land for fair market value gives Norfolk a new area to continue redevelopment efforts that will foster job growth and economic opportunities for citizens in Hampton Roads. As Norfolk has experienced substantial economic growth since the time of the original purchase, I appreciate that this sale will finally be permitted  to further ensure Norfolk's future economic development efforts. 
   I am grateful for Representative Scott's work on helping to bring this bill to the floor, as well as the work of the Committee on Natural Resources and I look forward to the great benefit this redevelopment effort will have for the people of Hampton Roads.  
   Ms. BORDALLO I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I would certainly like to thank my colleagues for this resolution today in honor of my dear friend, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis. 
   Jo Ann really was the American dream, and we have all heard a lot about her life since her very unfortunate and very early passing last fall. But she came from a very poor childhood and reached just, I think, the highest of success to serve in this body. 
   But she was a success because she cared for other people and she put them first. And that's what people saw in Jo Ann. They loved and trusted her. She was a woman of great faith, great courage, great honesty, great strength, and great integrity. 
   Jo Ann was a very private person, and when she told me of her diagnosis with breast cancer, I was really quite surprised that she had made the decision that she would be very public with her illness for the purpose of helping other women. I think we all admire and thank her for doing that. But I watched as she went through her chemo, and I saw how she struggled to be here with each and every one of us. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank my colleagues. I know if Jo Ann were here today she would say, oh, don't bother doing that. But we all need a memory of Jo Ann. I think this is a fitting way to do it. She loved America. She served her constituents, she was true to herself, and she was a gift to each and every one of us who knew her.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (COMMEMORATING THE CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAILING OF THE NAVY'S ``GREAT WHITE FLEET'' -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I rise in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 261, a resolution I introduced to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the launching of the Great White Fleet. On December 16, 1907, 16 battleships, including, of course, the USS Virginia, launched from Norfolk for a 14-month-long cruise around the world. Envisioned by President Theodore Roosevelt, himself a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, as an opportunity to showcase the military and humanitarian might of the United States, the fleet sailed over 42,000 miles around the globe, traveling around the tip of South America, across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, through the Suez and Mediterranean and back across the Atlantic to Norfolk. 
   Upon arriving in Egypt, the fleet's commanding officer, Rear Admiral Charles Sperry, dispatched two of his battleships to assist in providing humanitarian assistance to the victims of an earthquake that had ravaged Sicily. The cruise, which has earned its place in American naval history as one the single greatest achievements of the 20th century, foreshadowed events in 2004 when the U.S. Navy provided assistance and comfort to the victims of the tsunami in Indonesia and neighboring countries and again in 2005 when assistance was provided to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. 
   The event also foreshadowed the debate in Washington regarding the size of the U.S. fleet and the needed industrial capacity. Painted white and visible for miles, the fleet caused President Roosevelt to ask rhetorically, ``Oughtn't we all feel proud?'' I can surely sympathize. As the Representative of Virginia's Second Congressional District, I fully understand the proud sensation of driving across the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel and seeing the raw naval power that is home ported in Norfolk. 
   That moment of pride transcends into a moment of pause when witnessed by our enemies and a moment of comfort when witnessed by our friends. President Roosevelt understood the concept of force projection before the term was fashionable. 
   Our great tradition of naval power was not founded by President Roosevelt, but he understood it and harnessed it foreshadowing the great challenges of the 21st century and today. 
   I would note, Mr. Speaker, that the idea of sending our fleet halfway around the world was not an idea widely accepted by Congress, and yet President Roosevelt through his leadership and determination and in his role as Commander in Chief set out to do what he thought was right, sending a message long before it can be done over a computer that the United States was now an ``A List'' celebrity on the world stage. And it worked. Upon its return, the headline of The Washington Post dated February 21, 1909, read: ``Eyes of World Opened By Fleet.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, ask most students of history about the achievements of President Theodore Roosevelt, and I imagine that they will start with the Panama Canal. I introduced this resolution in part because I feel that President Roosevelt's historic vision of a strong blue-water Navy as the cornerstone of American foreign policy should never be forgotten. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, today, the national average for a gallon of gas has reached $4.07. With your average vehicle tank holding 18 gallons, that translates to $75 to fill your tank. This is on top of skyrocketing food costs and, now, increases in both our natural gas and electricity bills at home. 
   Many American families simply cannot afford these prices. Yet we stand on this floor without allowing debate on a comprehensive solution for the American people. This country is tired of partisan maneuvering and is tired of Congress just saying ``no.'' 
   Madam Speaker, Americans are downright mad. Some may argue that high gas prices are an incentive to make Americans drive less or that high energy costs are an incentive for businesses and homeowners to utilize more green practices. High energy and gas prices also cause businesses and jobs to move offshore where natural gas is cheaper. 
   I firmly believe in investing in technology that will move us away from our Nation's dependence on petroleum, but during this transitional period, we must also increase our domestic supply and fuel our economy. No one can deny that energy is something that we all use and need. Americans expect this Congress to do everything within our power to address these high gas and energy prices. 
   Madam Speaker, we should not leave here for the Fourth of July recess without increasing our own natural resources. Bring relief to the American people. Keep our Nation competitive and open for business.

I have heard they can't fill their tanks, they're not doing any extras, they're not going out to eat or to movies or on vacation. And last week, a young woman serving in Afghanistan asked me to make sure that gas is not $5 a gallon when she returns home. 
   Repeatedly, people have asked me to drill now. And yet with all this frustration and economic hardship, the Democratic leadership of this Congress refuses to bring legislation to the floor that addresses the number one concern of our constituents: increasing domestic supply now, dropping gas prices now while we move to the alternative energies of the future. 
   This week Congress will consider dozens of suspensions, a bill concerning the preservation of White House e-mails, a bill creating a national historic trail in New York, and a bill creating a new section of national wild and scenic rivers in Massachusetts. But nothing to lower gas prices.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our colleague and my friend, Jo Ann Davis. I was honored to have served with her in both the Virginia General Assembly and now here in the U.S. Congress. 
   Jo Ann and I had reverse roles. When Jo Ann ran for the House of Delegates, I was her mentor. I was glad to see her success at being elected there. And when I ran for the U.S. Congress in 2004, Jo Ann was my mentor. 
   We were both Realtors and shared that common bond and that friendship. I was proud to support her in her historic elevation to the Congress. Jo Ann, as you have heard, was the first Republican woman to serve in this body. She was also the first woman from Virginia to be re-elected. 
   We all know that Jo Ann was a woman of great faith, great strength, great courage, great honesty and great integrity. I don't believe that it was ever Jo Ann's intention to be a trailblazer. I think her successes in her life as a mother, a grandmother, a businesswoman, as a legislator are all the result of a path that she chose in her life, and that was the path that cared for other people first, put other people first, and that she stood very strong on the principles to protect those around her. That earned her the respect of the people of the First District, and it lead her on the path to the House of Delegates and then here. 
   Jo Ann was a valued resource and a trusted confidant. Here in Congress, I was honored to work with her on issues facing the people of Hampton Roads and of Virginia. We served together on the House Armed Services Committee, and I have watched her very deep appreciation for the contributions of the shipbuilding industry, and she understood the important role that the Navy plays in our Nation, projecting strength and security around the world. 
   Jo Ann also was a true leader and a hero in protecting our military and their families, and she always worked to ensure that their rights and interests were protected. 
   It is fitting that the month of October is dedicated to raising breast cancer awareness. For even as Jo Ann battled her own illness, she saw her illness as an opportunity to help other women. When she was first diagnosed, she told me that she would be healed, and she was, from her first bout of cancer, and that she would use this as an opportunity for other women to see and to make sure that other women received the health care and didn't put things off. 
   I know that today I join my colleagues in extending our deepest sympathies to her family, to her husband Chuck, to her staff, to her friends. I appreciate the opportunity to stand here and to honor my good friend. I know that we will all miss her greatly.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee for having this hour this evening where we can come and tell you what our observations are about Iraq. And also, I would like to thank his family for the service of his nephew. I know he is in our thoughts and prayers for his safe return. I would also like to thank really the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have loved ones who are serving. I would like to thank the very brave men and women who are serving around the world for us today.     
   They truly understand the threat in the world, and they understand the consequences if we were to just pull out, and I think this is one of the most overwhelming things. 
   When you do make a trip like ours this year, it was my third trip into Iraq, and this year was my first trip into Afghanistan, but when you arrive in these Nations, the most overwhelming feeling immediately is that every single one of the young men and women that you're looking at serving in the U.S. military have volunteered to serve our Nation, and that is an incredible feeling. 
   The first thing that we did on our trip, it was very early August, we went into a neighborhood north of Baghdad. There was six of us on the trip, and we had the opportunity to meet with four Iraqi sheiks, two Sunni and two Shia. Now, like most Americans, I think I was of the impression that Sunni and Shia would never even speak to each other, much less work together to rid Iraq, their neighborhood, of the enemy. Well, they were in that room together and they sat Sunni, Shia, Sunni, Shia, as they talked to us about what they've done. 
   And the reason for what they've done, of course, is the incredible amount of violence that is taking place in Iraq against Iraqi civilians, executions, torture, and it's brought those sheiks into a position to join together for their neighborhood, for their region and, as they told us, for Iraq, that they did what they did for Iraq. They joined with our military. They worked together for 2 1/2 months, and when they were ready, combined with our military, these four sheiks and their citizens ridded that neighborhood of the enemy in only 4 days' time. They were so proud of themselves.  
   They told us repeatedly how their children could go out and play. Our military told us that this was the most dangerous street in northern Baghdad, the most IED attacks of all of Baghdad. They told us that they can go out and walk to the store now because of what's taken place. 
   What the incredible change that you're seeing in Iraq right now is that our military is helping local leaders to develop the capacity to govern at that very local level, the most important area, and to work on a regional level to bring that about. 
   Now, those sheiks are a little bit disappointed in their national government. I asked them about the Sunni members who had walked out of the government. Their answer is my favorite quote of the entire trip, and the quote was, they won't be reelected. I thought that's quick that they learned that. 
   They're extremely concerned about the involvement of Iran and Syria. Our military knows full well of the involvement of those two governments and weapons that are coming in and help that's being provided. They need services. Our military brought in the governor of Baghdad to look at their neighborhood and to see what could be done differently. 
   They also were very clear that they want their government to succeed, and they were very clear in telling us that they need our help and they want our help. 
   We also met with the Deputy Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister Barham Shala, who is a Kurd. The Iraqi Government, and we don't ever talk about this, is set up, when your prime minister is the Shia, your two deputies, one's a Kurd and one's a Sunni. Your president is a Kurd, so your vice presidents are Sunni and Shia so that you bring in all three together to be able to have the involvement of all three sects within the country. It's not just one person telling you what to do. 
   Of course, the Deputy Prime Minister expressed a little bit of disappointment in how far the national government had come. There were meetings that were taking place even while we were there. He was very clear, and I thought this was very important, that he said their focus is to establish the institutions of government so that their government would continue, regardless of who was in power, and that no one would be able to just grab power and do something different in Iraq, but that they form a stable government just like here in the U.S. 
   When we had a shift in January from Republican control to Democrat control, there was no change in the way our government functions. Our courts functioned, and actually, Admiral Fallon, in addressing the Senate just recently, made the same types of comments, how important it is that we set up a rule of law, that we protect human rights. 
   So I was encouraged to hear him talking about that. He did stress that it was going to take time, and I asked him, because it's been very important here to us in America and our benchmarks, that there are pieces of legislation that we want the Iraqi Parliament to pass. And I asked him if it was true that he actually had the votes to pass that legislation. His answer surprised me. He said, Oh, yes. He said, I have 75 percent approval for the legislation. I reminded him that in America we pass major pieces of legislation with one vote. 
   But he looked at me and said something critically important. He said, if I pass this legislation with 75 percent, it means I've cut out the Sunni from the government. They would feel they had no power and they would feel they had no voice. 
   Now, just today in the Armed Services Committee, we received the GAO report on Iraq and the status of these 18 benchmarks. About six of the benchmarks deal with legislation that we'd like to see passed, and we failed on that, that that legislation has not passed, as we all know. But there was another benchmark that was stressed in it, that there be political involvement of minority parties and minority rights be protected. Now, we've passed on that benchmark, but I would say to the gentleman from Tennessee, to you, Mr. Speaker, that if we had passed that legislation against the wishes of an entire group of people, that we would have failed in meeting the benchmark that minority parties be included. 
   He talked to us about Anbar and about how it's been stabilized. Our trip was due to go there, and we weren't able to because we were detained here in Washington for that extra day. But he talked to us as well about the $10 billion that's been appropriated by the Iraq Parliament for reconstruction efforts. That joins with the 60 countries that have joined with America in our reconstruction efforts there. There is $200 million that's been appropriated to use just in Anbar province, and those contracts are now being let because the security level there will allow those construction projects to go forward. 
   I'd also like to add that we do have a policy in Iraq, and that's called Iraqis First. Whether you're an Iraqi company or you're an Iraqi civilian, that if you're able to be hired by us, that we want to hire Iraqi first. 
   The Deputy Prime Minister was clear that they are a country in transition, and he did caution us that they would not meet their benchmarks by September 15, but I would really want us to focus on not did we meet 18 benchmarks but what are the goals and what are the objectives and how do we develop a fully functioning Iraqi Government and how do those benchmarks play into that, how do they make responsible decisions there like I think they just did in not forcing legislation that would have cut an entire section of their country out. 
   I think that's critically important. We all support benchmarks, but we want those benchmarks to reflect 
   achieving the goals that we've set, and we want to show where are those positive developments, and people are frustrated when they don't hear them, when American people don't hear of the progress that's being made or four sheiks coming together to stabilize their own region and asking that we not leave them and that we give them their help. 
   We did meet with General Petraeus. We met with Ambassador Crocker. We will receive their report on Monday. I know you have others who are here to talk. I just wanted to close by talking about the last thing we did that day. 
   We met with Iraqi security forces, and they were actually special ops. They were so impressive that I would have thought I was here in the U.S. watching special operation forces do a demonstration. Our military was very clear that they are very easy to train, and the good news that we haven't heard is that these Iraqi forces are able to train their new recruits that are coming in. I want you to know they were so proud of themselves. 
   Think of the risk to those men who are serving in Iraqi security forces. In our country, we know our men and women are in harm's way. That's painful for us as Americans, to have our men and women in harm's way defending this Nation. But in Iraq right now, anyone who joins the Iraqi security forces is in harm's way simply for joining, not in the threat of battle but simply for joining. 
   So I want to thank you for letting me tell you about them, tell you about what I saw on our trip to Iraq. It was critical for me to see Afghanistan for the first time because there's a lot of similarities in Afghanistan. We're doing the same thing. 
   We are looking at the local level now. We understand that that's the way we need to win this fight, but the change that's come about is like you have seen in Iraq, where local leaders join with us. Remember, they have to make a choice. Are they with us and their national government or are they with the Taliban in Afghanistan or with the al Qaeda in Iraq. 
   And they have to make the right choice, because if they make the wrong one, they're dead. And what's the message that we've sent to the world is that we're going to leave? How do you choose us if we're going to leave and you would be left there with an enemy? It's critical that we establish political, economic and security measures in Iraq so that this nation can function, can establish a government that will take them into the future and not just short term. 
   I did ask one question, and your article made me think about it, in armed services not long ago. We had witnesses come and talk about the National Intelligence Estimate, and my question to them was what would be the impact  on America if we were to leave, if we were to have done everything that we've done but if we were to leave before that government can govern itself, secure itself and develop itself economically? What would be our standing in the world? Would we be a paper tiger? What would our allies think of us? And would anyone ever trust us in the future? 
   The answer to me was we haven't studied that issue. Well, I think not only do we need to study the issue. We need to make sure that Iraq has made such progress that I've seen in my three trips. We need to make sure that these people aren't the victims of the violence that will take place. The Deputy Prime Minister pointed that out to us. He told us the consequences that would happen if we were to leave. He told us that Iraq is the heart of the Middle East and that everyone is watching what we we're doing. 
   So thank you for letting me join you tonight and thank you for the service of your nephew.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Chairman, as has been widely reported, the Department of Veterans Affairs continues to face challenges in improving service delivery to veterans and reducing the existing backlog of benefit claims. 
   While the VA made progress in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 reducing the size and age of its pending claims inventory, it has regrettably fallen behind in recent years. The VA's inventory of pending claims and their average time pending has increased significantly in the last 3 years and the Department is currently facing over 630,000 open benefit claims. 
   The VA reduced the average age of its pending claims from 182 days at the end of fiscal year 2001 to 111 days at the end of fiscal year 2003. However, by the end of fiscal year 2006, average days pending had increased to 127 days and is currently reported to be 177 days. 
   It should be noted that continued increases in the number and complexity of claims being filed have played a contributing role in the current backlog. In its fiscal year 2008 budget justification, the VA identified an increase in claims processing staff as essential to reducing the pending claims inventory and improving timeliness. However, the VA states that the budget request only provides resources to reduce the processing time to 145 days. Furthermore, even as increased funding is appropriated and staffing levels increase, the VA acknowledges that it still must take other actions to improve productivity. 
   Representatives from the VA have stated that there is a newly implemented strategy to manage the pending inventory and improve response time by getting more out of current resources, increasing staffing, and improving information technology. Given the current claims crisis, I believe that we need to know more about this strategy. 
   My amendment will require the VA to provide a report to Congress on the status of the number of pending disability benefit claims and the actions taken to reduce processing time for veterans' disability claims. As the House considers FY 2008 funding for the VA, I believe the Congress, the American people, and more importantly, our Nation's veterans are entitled to know how current and future resources will be implemented to address these concerns. This is the least we can do. 
   I understand that this amendment will be subject to a point of order and I will therefore not offer it. However, the current claims backlog is an issue of importance for our Nation's veterans. It is my hope that this Congress will address this issue in the near future.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Chairman, I introduce an amendment today to highlight the importance of State and local law enforcement participation in immigration enforcement. 
   The intent of this amendment is to fully fund the President's budget request of $26.4 million for State and local law enforcement support for the training and support for the voluntary participation of local law enforcement officers and immigration law enforcement as authorized under section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
   This program is designed to enhance cooperation and communication between Federal, State, and local law enforcement in identifying and removing criminal illegal aliens. Under 287(g), ICE provides State and local law enforcement with the training and authorization to identify; process; and, when appropriate, detain immigration offenders they encounter during their regular daily law enforcement activity. 
   It is very important to note that the 287(g) program is not used for rounding up illegal aliens in random street operations. This program is targeted specifically for those individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety and national security. Additionally, the 287(g) program is not used to determine the legal status of witnesses and victims of crime. Officers in the 287(g) program are trained to respect the status of witnesses and victims involved in a criminal case in order to ensure the integrity of our criminal justice system. 
   Currently, the 287(g) program is implemented in 13 jurisdictions. Perhaps the jurisdiction with the greatest success in this program is Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. In just 12 months, Sheriff Jim Pendergraph has been able to identify and deport nearly 1,900 criminal illegal aliens, most of whom had been previously ordered deported by an immigration judge. This program is working and the demand for participation among the States is increasing. 
   And in the report accompanying this appropriations bill, the committee has acknowledged the importance of identifying criminal illegal aliens while incarcerated in our State and local jails. Participation in the 287(g) program can rectify that problem. 
   Immigration enforcement is clearly a Federal responsibility. It is the Federal Government's primary duty to ensure the safety and security of its citizens. But we cannot do it alone. We need the assistance of our State and local law enforcement who encounter these issues on a daily basis. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to point out that the reason I chose this funding, the Office of the Secretary of Management, is because in researching this, I realized there was an $89 million increase between 2007 and 2008 funding. That is a 60 percent increase. I think it is important that money be spent in our communities. 
   I would also like to point out that I did research the $50 million that was referenced in the report, and that report isn't very accurate because by the end of this month, there will be roughly $1 million left in that account, not $50 million. In 2006, $5 million was appropriated for operating expenses. In 2007, it was $5.4 million; and then there was the $50 million appropriated for start-up costs. But by the end of this month, those will have been almost spent. 
   With the hard work of people like Sheriff Pendergraff in North Carolina and our other sheriffs across the Nation, the public is aware of the services, the resources, the technology and the training, that can be provided through this program. 
   Unfortunately for us in Virginia Beach, all of America heard of the very, very tragic accident that took the lives of two beautiful young women at the hands of an illegal alien DUI driver who had been apprehended in our community at least three times and was still back out on the street. 
   This is a voluntary program, but citizens in our State are asking: How can you break our law, be in our justice system and be right back out on the streets again? This is a program that deals with people who have been apprehended and not victims or witnesses. 
   There are also State-level programs. With our DMV, I think every one of us would want to know that our DMVs can find fraudulent documents because of these resources that are available. 
   And in regards to our correctional systems, for local governments to be telling ICE right in the very beginning, ICE can have all of the paperwork done and be ready when that person is released for that person to be deported, just like that, no additional cost of detainment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friends today who have spoken on behalf of this amendment, and I certainly appreciate the chairman of the subcommittee saying he is willing to accept this amendment. I think all of America thanks you.

   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, Americans are growing frustrated. A recent Los Angeles Times poll placed Congress' approval ratings at the lowest point they have been in a decade, 27 percent down from 36 percent in January. And based on the many calls that my office receives every day, that frustration is largely embodied in the immigration issue. 
   Specifically, for the last 2 weeks, I have received numerous calls from my constituents asking where is the border fence. Well, Mr. Speaker, that's a good question. Where is the border fence? Last night and early this morning, while this Chamber was debating a Homeland Security funding bill, that contains no funding specifically for fencing, hundreds of people were able to make their way across the border or were trafficked into America. 
   And while we would like to believe that every single person made their way in order to seek out a better life for themselves or their family, we know that is not always the case. Some, as evidenced by the plot to attack Fort Dix, are here to harm us. 
   I would impress upon the majority to do the right thing.

   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 352 is a bipartisan resolution which recognizes the important contributions that public works professionals make every day to improve the public infrastructure of the United States. I represent a coastal district in which healthy water transportation and infrastructure systems add to the economic and environmental prosperity of southeast Virginia. Healthy water transportation and infrastructure systems are not only important to coastal communities, but to every district across the country. To meet these needs, as well as the need for flood protection and environmental restoration, passing a Water Resources Development Act for 2007 is a matter of high importance. 
   According to separate studies conducted by the Congressional Budget Office, EPA and municipal groups, the current rate of capital investment will not keep our wastewater treatment systems operational. State and local governments are spending approximately $10 billion a year in capital investments in wastewater infrastructure. Most of this funding comes from local ratepayers. For rural towns like those located on the eastern shore of Virginia, this often proves to be an unattainable feat. 
   Because of the importance public infrastructure places in enhancing our quality of life, improving our environment and contributing to our economic prosperity, it is important for Congress to recognize the contributions that professionals, engineers and administrators make to ensuring America remains the world's premier economic power. 
   I urge all Members to support H. Res. 352.

   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I introduced House Resolution 386 last week which recognizes the important work of the Coast Guard, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, and National Safe Boating Council in promoting boating safety. 
   I represent a district in which recreational boating plays an extremely important role in the lives of many constituents. Sailors, water sports enthusiasts, and fishermen are active recreational boaters in the Chesapeake Bay and in Virginia's coastal waters. 
   Recreational boating is one of the Nation's most popular pastimes, and while the number of recreational boating fatalities has declined by more than half since 1970, many lives are still lost each year. And, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, there are far too many of us who have lost friends or family members. 
   More than half of these lives could be saved with the proper use of boating safety equipment. The Coast Guard and States continue to work closely together to promote boating safety and to decrease the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities on U.S. waters, and they should be commended for their efforts. 
   Congress took action in 2005 to support State and Federal boating safety programs by establishing the Sport Fishing and Recreational Boating Safety trust fund. In fiscal year 2006, more than $92 million in recreational boating safety State grants were provided to the States and U.S. territories from revenues that were wholly derived from Federal taxes on marine fuels and fishing equipment. This funding supports programs that encourage the use of personal flotation devices and other safe boating practices and are critical in safeguarding the recreational boating public. 
   This resolution highlights the importance of safe recreational boating, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mrs. DRAKE. Actually, Mr. Speaker, I'm disappointed to be standing here tonight, discussing the bill that we're discussing, and I really wonder what the Americans who are sitting at home watching our debate tonight are thinking. From one side, they're hearing this is the best thing that has ever happened to America. From the other side, they're hearing what this bill is really all about. 
   I represent Virginia's Second Congressional District. That's the entire coastline in Virginia--the Atlantic coastline. For the 4 years that I've served in Congress, 2 years of those were on the Natural Resources Committee. I worked on this issue of the Outer Continental Shelf. I can't tell you how disappointing it was to know that the rumors I was hearing over the weekend were true and that, yes, it would open up the Outer Continental Shelf on paper but not in reality, because what this bill does is it says,  from 50 to 100 miles, yes, States, you may opt in. However, Virginia and every other coastal State, you will receive no royalties for doing that. 
   Now, when you look at the Gulf States--Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas--37 1/2 percent of those royalties go to those individual States. I don't think that this Congress believes in treating our States differently. 
   So, in discussing this bill, the reality of this bill will be that States will say ``no'' because why would a State agree to be treated so completely differently? So the reality becomes industry can go harvest this resource at 100 miles out. The problem is that's very expensive; it's much more dangerous, and we know the bulk of the resource in the Outer Continental Shelf is within 50 miles of the coast. 
   So what we're saying is, yes, America, we're going to do it, but in reality, no, America, it won't work. I think Americans are smarter than that, and Americans today understand that we have vast resources in this country that we've blocked. It's time for us to have a solution to open our American energy, to meet our needs and to treat our States fairly.

   Virginia gets zero. Look at Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, 37.5 percent. Every other coastal State, zero. 
   The effect of this legislation will be none of these coastal States will allow for drilling. So industry will now look at 100 miles out or more. Problem with that? Resources within the first 50 miles. 
   America needs to realize that we are the only Nation that does not take resources from our Outer Continental Shelf. The American families are hurting. American businesses are hurting, and look at the impact on our economy. After all of these months of bills on the floor and discussion on the floor, this is the result of this bill.

First and foremost, I would like to recognize my distinguished leader of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Ranking Member JOHN MICA for once again delivering on his promise to support the needs of his Committee members on issues of importance to them and their districts; also, Congressman RICHARD BAKER, Ranking Republican on the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, for his leadership and legislative expertise without which WRDA would have once again gone unauthorized; and Senator JOHN WARNER, Craney Island's champion and the Commonwealth of Virginia's leader in the Senate; for his steadfast dedication to seeing this vision to fruition. 
   Also, Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay special tribute to two other individuals, not Members of Congress, but without whom we would not be here today. As Governor of Virginia and then Senator, George Allen always supported the expansion of Craney Island, recognizing its impact not only on the Commonwealth but the Nation. Robert ``Bobby'' Bray, who retired this year after 29 years as Executive Director of the Virginia Port Authority, always saw the Craney Island Eastward Expansion not only as a major port development project but also as an opportunity to enhance the quality of life for all Americans. To these and countless others, on behalf of the 2nd District of Virginia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and our Nation, I extend my sincere gratitude. 
   The Eastward Expansion of Craney Island is truly a matter of national significance. When complete, this landmark project will provide capacity for additional material dredged to maintain navigability of the region's shipping channels in addition to providing land on which to build a much-needed fourth marine terminal in Hampton Roads. 
   In 1997, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution that directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study of Craney Island. The study has been completed and the Eastward Expansion of Craney Island was recommended as the best alternative. Initially, the project costs considered for Federal participation comprised only the design and construction of the dredged material placement site, known as the Eastward Expansion. At that time, the Federal cost share for the project was identified as approximately 4 percent, and the Virginia Port Authority share as approximately 96 percent. It is important to note that the cost of the marine terminal construction (approximately $1.6 billion) will be solely the responsibility of the Virginia Port Authority. 
   Because the Corps had been constrained by policies that did not take into account the unique dual nature of the Craney Island Project, the initial plan formulation and cost share were determined based only on the Federal interest in the least cost for dredge material placement only part of the authorization to conduct the study. This method of determining the cost share did not take into account the substantial National transportation savings benefits associated with the port construction on the Eastward Expansion of Craney Island, which is the second part of the study authorization.  
   This Craney Island Marine Terminal will provide national economic development benefits of nearly $6 billion in transportation savings. The Port of Virginia is a major international gateway to the Midwest. In fact, more than 55 percent of the cargo handled by the Port originates in or is destined for locations outside the Commonwealth. More than 3,000 companies outside Virginia use the Port because of the cost-effective and reliable movement of freight to and from the Port of Virginia. 
   Container traffic in Hampton Roads is projected to triple by 2030 and will exceed the Port's capacity by 2011. Without the additional capacity created by a new marine terminal at Craney Island, cargo that would otherwise use the Port of Virginia will be rerouted to other ports, resulting in freight moving over longer distances at a higher cost. This increase will generate a total of $6 billion in additional transportation costs when applied to the amount of cargo that would be rerouted to other ports over a 50-year period. 
   However, with a new marine terminal at Craney Island, this additional $6 billion cost is avoided and becomes an origin-to-destination cost savings to the Nation in terms of maintaining the efficient, low-cost transportation afforded through the Port of Virginia. 
   The Eastward Expansion of Craney Island also meets National Defense needs. The ability of the United States to respond to military contingencies requires the availability of adequate U.S. commercial port facilities. The Port of Virginia is one of 14 port facilities designated by the Department of Defense as a strategic port through which military deployments are conducted. The Port of Virginia is expected to be able to make its facilities available to the military within 48 hours of written notification. When complete, the Craney Island project will provide additional capacity to meet military logistical needs and ensure the safe, secure, and smooth flow of military cargo through the Port of Virginia while minimizing commercial cargo disruptions. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Virginia Port Authority has been working for many years in partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to develop a plan for the Eastward Expansion of Craney Island. By authorizing the Federal cost share at 50 percent, the WRDA Conference Report acknowledges the importance of expanding Craney Island to both Hampton Roads and to the entire Nation. I am grateful the Congress has supported this endeavor. And, I look forward to seeing the same support from the President.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (ENSURING MILITARY READINESS THROUGH STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY DEPLOYMENT POLICY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I recognize that this is a contentious issue. I also recognize that some of us will never agree on the question of Iraq and whether our presence there is justified. However, I believe there is common ground, and I introduced a substitute amendment during the Armed Services Committee that highlights the common ground. 
   My substitute amendment, which is modeled after Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM's alternative to what has come to be known as the Webb amendment, replaced the base text with a sense of Congress that the Department of Defense should strive to meet certain goals concerning dwell time between troop deployment. 
   My amendment maintained the goals that are outlined in the underlying bill. My amendment represents an alternative that touches on the issues that all of us, Republicans and Democrats, agree on. We all agree that our troops need to rest between deployment. We all agree that a rested fighting force is an effective fighting force. We all agree, hopefully, that these goals should not be limited to troops deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom, which the underlying bill unfortunately does. 
   We all agree that this committee must continue, as it has done so effectively in the past, providing the resources to our troops that they need to do their jobs effectively and safely. 
   I believe this bill creates an unrealistic expectation on the part of our families and our military members. The bill does not define threat to national security interests, and the Presidential waiver is simply paperwork with no minimum standard. 
   I also believe this bill violates the separation of powers as defined in our Constitution. Unfortunately, the Democrat majority decided to consider this bill under a closed rule with no room for debate on alternatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is common ground on this issue, but, unfortunately, it is not represented in this bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 3159.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, housing is a very complex issue. We are talking about a person's home, real people with a real problem. Prior to Congress I was a realtor for over 20 years.  
   I have worked with many families to help them realize their dream of homeownership. I have served as chairman of the Virginia Housing Study Commission. I have seen good markets and bad and many changes to the mortgage industry. I have struggled with how to define and protect against predatory lending practices. I have seen interest rates and loan products that seem too good to be true. 
   Unfortunately, we have seen they were too good to be true. There are many components of this bill, which I think are excellent. Enacting those reforms now would have a huge impact on the housing market and be helpful to American families. 
   My concerns with today's package include the establishment of a new, affordable housing fund and a $300 billion Federal loan guarantee program. A lender with troubled loans could contact those homeowners, offer a federally backed loan and refinance at a loss. 
   But now he has moved that loan from a complete loss to 85 percent current value that will be guaranteed by the Federal Government. He now has no reason to work with that borrower. Neighbor A bought at the height of the market. He struggles but pays. Neighbor B negotiates 85 percent of current value, a huge impact on the value of surrounding properties. 
   This is a voluntary program. Can't we develop incentives for the private sector and not obligate the American taxpayers with $300 billion in loan guarantees? There are several things that are currently making a difference. The FHA Secure loan program, HOPE NOW, an alliance to prevent foreclosure through outreach to delinquent borrowers. Fannie Mae is currently working on a streamlined short-sale program to allow the sale of properties that are overmortgaged.     
   The fact is, one out of two people never contact their lender for help. Both the administration and the private sector need to explain what is available. Neither has done a good job.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment reduces the Office of the Secretary of Management $10.4 million, and increases ICE salaries and the expense account by $9.1 million, restoring the funding that was in the President's budget to fund the 287(g) program.     
   I chose this account because between 2007 and 2008 budgets, it has increased 60 percent, or a total increase of $89 million. The 287(g) program provides training, technology, and resources to local law enforcement officers to work with the Federal Government, with ICE, to identify illegal aliens who have broken our laws. 
   This is a voluntary program available to both our State and local governments. Currently, it is implemented in 13 locations. One of the most prominent of these is Sheriff Pendergraf in North Carolina, who has detained and deported 1,900 illegal criminal aliens in the last year. 
   America saw the very tragic accident that occurred in Virginia Beach that took the lives of two beautiful young women at the hands of an illegal alien  drunk driver. And, Mr. Chairman, this individual had been arrested and detained on DUI offenses in the past and was released onto our streets. 
   I believe that immigration is a Federal responsibility, but we need the help of local and State law enforcement officials. We need to identify the gaps and figure out how to bridge those gaps. 
   The 287(g) program can also be used to better coordinate with our DMVs; none of us want fraudulent documents used and driver's licenses issued for our States, and can also be used with our Departments of Corrections, so that when an illegal alien has served time in our prisons and jails, they're deported immediately, and there's no additional expense to us. 
   Contrary to the report language in this bill, by the end of June there will only be $1 million remaining in the 287(g) coffers. Due to the success of this program such as in Mecklenberg, North Carolina, and high-profile cases like in Virginia Beach, there is an increased awareness and an increased demand for this program. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, make our communities safer, and allow better coordination between local, State, and Federal governments.

   Our constituents are begging for something to be done, yet the language in the Homeland Security appropriations bill will cripple the ability of the border fence to be built in high-priority areas. 
   I understand that process and procedure are important, but this Congress has already made its stand on the fence when, in a bipartisan fashion, it supported the Secure Fence Act back in October.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. 
   I would like to thank Mr. Smith, the chairman of the Terrorism and Unconventional Threats Subcommittee, and Mr. Thornberry, the ranking member, for their support and for working in a collaborative way to quickly bring this resolution to the floor. 
   I rise today to honor the brave men and women of the United States Special Operations Command. The Second Congressional District of Virginia is home to Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek and Dam Neck and is home to Naval Special Warfare Group TWO and Naval Special Warfare Group FOUR, as well as Naval Special Warfare Development Group. The fine sailors, airmen, soldiers, marines and civilians of the command hold a special place in my heart, as they do for many of my colleagues on the Terrorism and Unconventional Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee and on the Armed Services Committee. 
   This resolution is both proper and timely, as the 20th year anniversary of the establishment of the United States Special Operations Command in Tampa was this past Monday, April 15. Since that time, SOCOM has been involved across the globe as the ``tip of the spear,'' providing for our Nation's security across the continuum of conflict. 
   On September 20, 2001, in preparing this country for the war on terror, President Bush said, ``Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes. Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on television, and covert operations, secret even in success.'' 
   Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, SOCOM has been leading the way in the war on terrorism and in promoting peace and security around the globe by conducting the full range of special operations missions. We are here today to honor those men and women who operate with little recognition, the ones whose successes remain unnoticed by the world at large.     
   We face an enemy vastly different from the one 20 years ago. Our enemy hides in the shadows, within society, and it is no longer bound by convention. 
   As my colleagues know, I have on many occasions come to this floor to talk about the mainstream media and their seemingly unwillingness to address the positives regarding our military and their achievements throughout the war on terror. As little as the American people hear about the successes of our conventional forces, they hear less about the successes of our special operations forces. 
   That is why this resolution is timely and important. The men and women of SOCOM are there, every day, with little or no logistical support, building relationships and providing security in some of the most remote places across the globe. 
   Mr. Speaker, we honor all those who wear the uniform. But today, I believe it is important that we honor those patriotic men and women that comprise our special operations community. 
   U.S. SOCOM's vision sums this up: To be the premier team of special warrior, thoroughly prepared, properly equipped and highly motivated at the right place, at the right time, facing the right adversary, leading the global war on terrorism, accomplishing the strategic objectives of the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Our Nation's borders are our first line of defense. The first step in any immigration plan is to provide for a secure and impenetrable border. 
   I have introduced a discharge petition on Representative Heath Shuler's bill, the SAVE Act, which provides a clear, three-point plan to get tough on illegal immigration. The plan is simple: 
   Increased secured security along our borders, mandatory worksite enforcement, and greater interior enforcement. 
   This issue deserves debate, and I am proud to reach across the aisle to work with Mr. Shuler on this bipartisan bill. I urge all of my colleagues to join me and Mr. Shuler and sign this bipartisan petition before you leave today. 
   It's time to demonstrate that Congress is serious about illegal immigration. The American people expect and deserve our quick and complete attention to securing our borders and protecting our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman for recognizing me tonight, and I would like to apologize for being late for your hour. But as I was coming over here today, I was connected by my office to a constituent who is serving in Iraq right now. I stood out in that hallway just beyond those doors and had a conversation with him with much better reception than I usually get on a local call from my cell phone. So it was absolutely remarkable, and I just wanted to share with you a little bit of what he said. 
   First of all, he is a contracting officer working with our reconstruction teams. I asked him, because we often hear that we are not employing Iraqis, that these are all major companies that are doing this work. He was quite surprised that I asked that question. He said that we have an ``Iraqi First'' program, and all jobs are offered first to Iraqi companies and to Iraqis, and if they can't perform that job, then other companies from other countries are brought in. They are completely screened. He even has an Iraqi who works with him on staff. 
   I asked if he had a message for us tonight. And the answer was that he asked us not to forget them. 
   I think that brings up the issue you just mentioned, Mr. Price, that what just happened today on the House floor. And what we know and the Department of Defense is now putting out information that there was a $3 billion reduction in the funds that have been appropriated in the bills that both of these bodies had passed for 2007. Not for those but for the military construction, the bills that the House had passed and had not been passed by the Senate. 
   So we heard on the floor here today that that was not a reduction. It was actually an increase. That is not the way that this is being viewed, and it is not the impact that it would have on people who are serving today. 
   But Mr. Price and Mr. Speaker, I would say to you that there is no one in America, no one in Congress that wants America to be at war. There is no President that wants to be a war President. And I have said to people if I believed this war we are engaged in was about democracy in Iraq or about a people who have fought each other for centuries, I would oppose this war, too. 
   But it is a war about our civilization with an enemy who has vowed to kill us and to end our way of life, an enemy who has attacked us and who works and plots constantly to attack us again. I truly believe if Americans just had the facts that they would make the right decision. 
   My constituent said it very clearly. He said we cannot let this enemy win. And every Iraqi that I have ever talked with, this is something America never hears and I think if they did hear it, it would make a difference, but from President Talabani on down, whether they are Iraqis I have met when I have been on trips there or Iraqis here, they all say, ``we are grateful to America for our freedom.'' And we, as Americans, never get to hear that. 
   The real question is what are our options? To let this enemy win and to say that they defeated the Russians in Afghanistan and the Americans in Iraq? What would that do to us? What would that do to our allies, and who would ever believe us again? 
   And if we were to make that decision and to allow this enemy to win and pull our troops out of Iraq before the Iraqis are ready to govern and secure themselves, the real question is how will we manage the cost of this defeat? How will we manage the murder of all those Iraqis who have joined in the freedom of Iraq, the person who was working for my constituent right now, those who have served in government, in the police, in the Iraqi security forces? 
   Thank you for yielding. I know you have a lot to talk about, and I appreciate the work that you are doing on the floor.

   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I have joined several of our colleagues in a letter requesting that the Senate majority leader end the partisan wrangling and move forward with the veterans appropriations bill. 
   Our veterans have always been willing to man the front lines in the defense of this Nation and deserve to be honored for their service. From 2001 through 2006, this House increased funding for our veterans from $48 billion to $70 billion. This year the House came together in a bipartisan manner to increase funding for our veterans by an additional $6 billion. 
   This is why I am so disturbed to read in Roll Call that Democratic leaders have made ``a decision to delay sending the veterans bill to the President so they can use it as leverage to pass other spending bills.'' 
   In my mind, veterans and especially those waiting for services at VA facilities or working to secure their VA benefits are not bargaining chips. They are heroes. And we should not allow partisanship to interfere with our commitment to protecting their best interests.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Well, thank you to the gentleman from Pennsylvania inviting me to be here with you today. This is such a critical issue, and one that I truly appreciate your leadership in the time that I've served in the House of Representatives, that this has been your passion. It shows to America today, but it's something that is a critical need, for our country, for our economic and for our national security. And I really want to thank you for the explanation that you give to America. 
   And I heard you talk just a few minutes ago about Cuba and China, and I think that's when America is going to demand of elected leaders, why are we blocking the deep sea drilling of natural gas off America when Cuba is going to be doing it and selling it to China, right off the coast of our Nation? And I really want America to watch that and to remember that you've been talking about that for all this time. 
   One of the things that was painful for me that I learned in working with you on your bill this year is the story of Dow Chemical and how a company founded in Michigan in 1897 has lost 7,000 jobs since 2002. But they're now doing a $30 billion expansion, and 10,000 jobs that should be right here in America are going to countries like Saudi Arabia and Libya because of the price of natural gas. You can't pay that $14 you just showed us if you can pay 85 cents in Saudi Arabia. And that was a real driver in the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
   Virginia has really made a name for herself nationally on the issue of energy because of a study that was introduced by Senator Frank Wagner to look at manufacturing in Virginia. And what that study showed right away was that an absolute problem was the cost of natural gas in Virginia, and that was causing us to lose our manufacturing base. And I don't think that we've put that together into our discussions about energy. 
   But I certainly agree with you, there has to be a comprehensive approach to energy. I brought something today to show you that I'm very proud of, and I hope you can see it. This is the work of Old Dominion University in the Second District of Virginia in Norfolk, Virginia. And this is a sample of a biodiesel that's created from algae. They are working with our sewage treatment plants; they're using that algae. But think about it even in the terms of agriculture and the run-off that we don't want in our rivers and in our streams and in our bays, that those nutrients, those fertilizers could be used to spur the growth of algae to be used in a product like this. So there are so many exciting things there, and that's part of what we need to focus on in your bill, in the NEED Act, which does make designated revenue streams for alternative energies for those future technologies that we need as we move into the future. But we also have to think about the needs of today and the economy of today. 
   And sometimes I wonder, people who fight your initiatives, if they understand the impact that it has on our economy. And I just have to question that they don't understand the problem that they're creating for us in America. 
   But the other things, that you have fixed royalties that will go into environmental restoration projects, in addition to renewable energy, weatherization and energy assistance, gives us funding for that, and royalties back to our local governments and to our States. 
   In Virginia we all know our number one issue right now is transportation and how we fund that. This would give us a designated stream that wouldn't put an additional burden on our taxpayers. 
   And critically important to us in the Second District is that the legislation will target 5 percent, roughly $20 billion, of funds that would go towards the restoration of the great natural resource of our Chesapeake Bay. That fully funds the estimate we've had from our Chesapeake Bay Commission for what it would take to restore the bay. 
   And what's interesting is that this is gas only. We need to make sure that we have that discussion. You mentioned Exxon Valdez. My numbers are that you're 13 times more likely to have a spill moving product in by tanker. 
   But we're talking about natural gas. We're talking about nothing that would have an impact on our environment, but would have a huge impact on our economy and our national security. 
   It also puts our States in control. So thank you for that, that States would make the decision of, during that first 100 miles, of whether to be in or out of this program. 
   So I want to thank you for letting me join you. I want to thank you for your leadership. I want to thank you for continuing to be the voice that says this is a crisis in America. We can no longer continue to be dependent on foreign sources of energy. With the technologies that exist today, we need your legislation; and thank you for telling America about it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the motion to instruct conferees. This motion would instruct House conferees to accept section 1536 of the Senate version of the national defense authorization, a provision which received near unanimous support on the other side of the Capitol. This section states, ``A failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for radicals, including al Qaeda and Hezbollah, who are determined to attack the United States and its allies.'' It goes on to state that ``a failed state in Iraq would lead to a broader regional conflict, possibly involving Syria and Iran.'' 
   I would remind my colleagues that only a few short months ago, the President of Iran was quoted as saying that very soon we will be witnessing a great power vacuum in the region, and that Iran is willing to fill this void. 
   Madam Speaker, the other side has attempted over 40 times to wave a  white flag in Iraq. This motion would put this Chamber on record as supporting a policy of success in Iraq. Our goal must be the path that we are on; a stable, functioning Iraqi Government, who can be an ally with us in the war on terror and not the goal of our enemy, which is Iraq as the capital of their caliphate. 
   Madam Speaker, I visited Iraq this summer. I had the opportunity to meet with the Deputy Prime Minister, and I asked the question why Iraq had not passed the legislation that we were using as a benchmark. I told him I had heard he had the votes to pass the legislation. 
   His answer to me was quite surprising. He said, ``Yes, I have the votes. I have 75 percent to pass the legislation.'' He said, ``But if I do it, I will be cutting the Sunnis out of the government; they will have no voice and no power.'' 
   That is exactly the opposite of what their goal is in Iraq. I would maintain that the Iraqi Government is working very hard for stable institutions where no one group can take over power again. 
   We have all seen the efforts of our military and the surge are working, creating stability and security. And now we are seeing the best of all results, which is the Iraqi people themselves, who have chosen us and have chosen their government. And in the words of their own sheiks that we met, two Sunni and two Shia, they said, ``We are working together for Iraq.'' 
   I urge my colleagues to support this motion in the best interests of our national security and working together for Iraq.

   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, this is day 66; that's 66 days so far that our veterans have not had the use of the increased funding for their benefits and health care. That's $18.5 million a day not able to be used. This bill has been done for months and the President has already agreed to sign it. But instead of moving the bill forward, the Democratic leadership in Congress continues to postpone this bill. So far, only one of 12 appropriation bills have been passed and signed into law. Why? Our veterans are heroes. There are few things more important than ensuring that this Congress provide all possible benefits and health care for our veterans. 
   I'm calling on the Speaker to move this bill forward. And I call on all Americans to contact their representatives and tell the Democratic leadership to send a clean veterans appropriation bill to the President now. Our veterans deserve it.

   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, this is day 73. That is 73 days since the start of the new fiscal year. Our veterans still do not have access to the increased funding provided in a bill that passed the House and Senate months ago and the President is waiting to sign. 
   This bill includes increased funding to improve access to medical services for all veterans, new initiatives for mental health and PTSD, increased funds for improved medical facilities, and increased funding to assist homeless veterans, to name a few. 
   The Democrats have refused to move the bill forward while our veterans have been operating on an extended shoestring budget since October 1, and 2 days from now the current budget will expire. 
   If the Democrats are acting in good faith and in the best interest of our Nation's veterans, why have they continued to delay this bill, and why do they now intend to use our veterans to pass an end-of-the-year omnibus spending package? 
   The veterans bill could be passed and sent to the President and signed today. I am calling on the Speaker to move the bill forward, and I call on all Americans to contact their Representatives to tell the Democratic leadership to send a clean veterans appropriations bill to the President now.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (CHESAPEAKE BAY GATEWAYS AND WATERTRAILS NETWORK CONTINUING AUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, my district is home to many beautiful American treasures and one of them is the Chesapeake Bay. ``Save the Bay'' is one message that reaches beyond all political boundaries. 
   Working alongside my longtime colleague and friend Jo Anne Davis in the 109th Congress, we passed legislation to create the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail--which is part of the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network we are reauthorizing today. As many of you know, this initiative falls under the larger Chesapeake Bay Program, which was created in 1983 to restore and protect the bay. 
   I am proud to lend my vote in favor of this bill today, however, I would like to call attention to one of the greater matters that this Congress should also be voting on: legislation to help the American people pay for the astounding cost of energy. One example is a comprehensive bill by Representative Peterson that creates a partnership between energy development and the environment. This bill opens up the OCS for natural gas exploration and uses an estimated $86 billion dollars in royalties for environmental restoration efforts. The Chesapeake Bay Commission estimated that the total cost to restore the Chesapeake Bay is $19 billion. The NEED Act fully funds the Chesapeake Bay restoration effort at $20 billion. This energy bill is another way we can help Save the Bay, and the budgets of American families. 
   I am an original cosponsor of the NEED Act and I believe it is an example of bipartisan energy legislation. We must all come together in a bipartisan manner to pass legislation that will increase our domestic energy supply and help alleviate soaring prices. I cannot speak for your districts, but families in Virginia's Second District need an energy solution now and it is our job to give them one.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 222, commending NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, on the celebration of their 90th anniversary, and out of respect to my friend and our colleague, Jo Ann Davis, who so ably represented NASA Langley and who introduced this, her last resolution, just 4 days before she passed away. 
   Established in 1917 by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, NASA Langley Research Center is the oldest of NASA's 10 major field centers and the Nation's first civilian aeronautical research facility. 
   Research there began with 15 employees. Today, NASA Langley boasts a workforce of over 3,600. And from the very beginning, NASA Langley has been on the cutting edge of research into all aspects of aeronautics, from fixed wing to rotor craft, from propeller engines to jet engines. In fact, whether subsonic, supersonic, or hypersonic, NASA Langley Research Center has always been on the forefront of mankind's consistent refusal to keep both feet on the ground.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, on October 22, the President will posthumously award our Nation's top military honor to the first Navy SEAL since the Vietnam War. 
   In June of 2005, Lieutenant Michael Murphy of Patchogue, New York, led a team of four SEALs on an intelligence-gathering mission in the mountains of Afghanistan when Taliban supporters revealed the team's position. A heavy firefight ensued, and the team, cut off from all reinforcements and outnumbered 50 to 1, fought valiantly to preserve each other's lives. Faced with certain death, Lieutenant Murphy deliberately exposed himself to enemy fire in order to gain a clear signal which would communicate with rescue forces. He risked his own life to save the lives of his men. 
   Madam Speaker, as the proud representative of both Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek and Dam Neck Fleet Combat Training Center, my heart goes out to the family of the first Navy SEAL to earn the Congressional Medal of Honor in the global war on terror. 
   Lieutenant Murphy was a true American hero and will live on as an inspiration for all who serve within the ranks of the most elite special operations forces in the world.

That is $18.5 million a day not able to be used. And why? Because the Democratic leadership has decided to not complete this bill and send it to the President who has agreed to sign it. 
   In June, this House passed this appropriation bill with a $6 billion increase in a bipartisan manner. We were proud of our work and grateful to our veterans. On September 6, the Senate completed their bill. This work is done. Our veterans are not pawns in a political game. They are heroes.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the Pearce amendment to H.R. 2262, which establishes the Minerals Commodity Information Administration at the Department of the Interior. The MIT collects and disseminates data on virtually every commercially important nonfuel mineral commodity produced worldwide, information that is critical to businesses, the government, and importantly, the Department of Defense to help manage the National Defense Stockpile. Due to the importance of the data, the MIT should be an independent agency reporting to the Secretary of the Interior. 
   This information from the MIT is critical to the effective use of the Nation's natural resources and for accurate forecasting. Without a reliable source of worldwide commodity information, the U.S. would be blind to any impending supply shortages. 
   One of the most fundamental functions of the Federal Government is to provide for the common defense. There is an undeniable nexus between our Nation's minerals policy and national security policy. Currently, 24 strategic and critical military materials are imported at no less than 40 percent from our foreign trading partners. For example, the U.S. imports 54 percent of its magnesium. This mineral is vitally important in constructing airplanes and missiles. Requiring our military to import the strategic and critical minerals it needs from foreign nations, some of whom may be hostile, puts our military at a significant disadvantage and weakens our ability to adequately sustain our national defense. 
   At a time when defense needs are determined in terms of capabilities-based planning instead of threat-based planning, an accurate assessment of our Nation's minerals is vitally important. The Pearce ROCK Act amendment is a means to that end. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Pearce ROCK Act amendment.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (THE COUNTDOWN CREW -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman for that and thank him for his commitment to  telling America how important it is that we keep our tax cuts that are in place and the very positive results that have taken place from the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. Those are real savings that are helping Americans today. 
   At the end of 2006, that tax relief that Americans got to keep in their pockets was valued at $1.1 trillion. That is a lot of money for families, for small businesses. 
   You mentioned my experience as a Realtor. I want to tell you, when I was new in the real estate business, I couldn't figure out how to put more time in the day, how do I do all the things that I needed to do. It took me just a while to realize there is no more time in the day, and there are only seven days in the week, and the only answer for me was to hire other people to do the things that I didn't have the time to do. 
   What that meant for me in my little real estate business was I became an employer. All of a sudden I was paying payroll taxes on employees, as well as paying double for myself as a self-employed individual in the real estate industry. At the end of each year, when I would look at a really good year and sell a lot of real estate, I would say, I am really not making any money for as hard as I am working because so much is going to the Federal Treasury in the way of taxes. So I appreciate that in 2001, when the tax cuts were put into place that we reduced those income tax rates to Americans. 
   I think a lot of people don't realize that today we have a 10 percent tax rate for our lowest payers, down from 15 percent. That is slated to expire in 2011 if we don't act then and keep that in place. Our other rates dropped by 3 to 4 points, not the full 5 points for our lowest-income Americans. 
   I have heard you talking in here tonight about your children. I have two children and I have four grandchildren. When I was ran for office, because it was something I felt I needed to do, but not something that had always been a goal of mine, the way I made myself do that every day is I took a picture of my granddaughter, who was then under 2 years old, taped it to the dash of my car, and every time I got in the car I said, Caity, I am doing this for you. 
   I stand here today now as a Member of Congress and say Caity, and the other three, because there are three more now, I am doing this for you. Because if we want to leave our children the America that we have enjoyed, we have got to make sure that our tax policy supports our economy, that it grows our revenues and it allows Americans to be the ones to decide how they are spending their money. 
   One of the big changes in growing revenues for our country, of course, is the capital gains tax, which has been reduced from 25 percent to 15 percent. As a Realtor, before coming to Congress, I can't tell you how many times I would hear from people, I can't sell that rental property because I can't pay that capital gains tax. But in 2003, when that was dropped by 10 percent, that made a lot of difference for people, and people were allowed to take assets and free them up and not be looking at such an overburden of taxes in order to do that. 
   We have talked about it. Congressman Kingston has mentioned President Kennedy. I wrote a quote of his down that I thought I would share tonight with America. This is from President Kennedy. He said: ``An economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance our budget, just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits.'' 
   That is the from the 1960s. Here we are in 2007 still having the same discussion and still trying to point out to America that when you keep your own money, that you spend it, you save it, you create jobs, you create wealth for yourself. 
   We have heard a lot about taxing the wealthy and how we should do more of that. But what people don't realize is by allowing people to grow their own wealth, we do raise taxes on the wealthy. They have actually risen 39 percent. Our income taxes are up 8.8 percent on personal income tax, while corporate income taxes are now up 22.2 percent. What better way is there to raise revenue than allowing people to be successful and spend their own money the way they see fit? 
   I am dismayed by two actions that were taken by this Congress in the very early days. There is a three-fifths majority that is needed to raise taxes. However, by a simple majority vote of this body, we now have a simple majority vote that is able to waive that. America needs to watch what this body does, and they need to hold us accountable. 
   The other thing that this Congress did in those early hours is pass something that is called PAYGO. It sounds very good, and Virginia is actually a pay-as-you-go State. We are not allowed to have a deficit in our budget. So it sounds good to everyone, until you stop and realize what it means. 
   What that means is when these taxes are ready to begin expiring, that in order to keep them in place, that other taxes either have to be raised or spending cuts have to take place to offset them. That doesn't take into consideration at all the positive impact we have seen of reducing taxes. It only looks at things on the 
   surface. 
   It is like the philosophy that is out there that if we are bringing in a lot of money today with tax policy, let's raise it just a little bit and we will get more. It is actually the opposite that takes place. I believe our responsibility is to grow our economy. Our responsibility is to have a tax policy that grows revenues for us and makes sure that we have the economy and the future for our children and our grandchildren. 
   I thank you for letting me join you today.

Everyone that I have told about this back at home is shocked. Their eyes get big. I think they felt safe to think it would take a three-fifths supermajority vote to raise taxes in America, and they are very distressed to hear it. That is why I wanted to mention it tonight, because so few people know that that took place in the opening of this session in our House rules. I think that is unfair, and I think America should know it, and I think America should watch what we do.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 25th Anniversary of Operation Smile, a worldwide children's medical charity that repairs cleft lips and cleft palates for children and young adults in developing countries. Operation Smile, which is headquartered in Norfolk, VA, was founded by Dr. William Magee, Jr., a plastic surgeon, and his wife, Kathleen, a nurse and clinical social worker. 
   In 1982, the Magees traveled to the Philippines with a group of medical volunteers to repair children's cleft lips and cleft palates. While many children were treated, the inundated volunteers, lacking in resources and manpower, were forced to turn away the majority of those who sought help. 
   The Magees were heartbroken to see such an overwhelming need. Yet, instead of being discouraged, the Magees were inspired by their experience. As they prepared to leave the Philippines the Magees made a promise to return to the Philippines to help more children and Operation Smile was born. 
   The Magees returned to Norfolk and began to solicit the donations of surgical equipment and supplies, began grassroots fundraising, and assembled a volunteer team of doctors, nurses and technicians. Just as they promised, the Magees returned to the Philippines to treat even more patients. 
   Since those humble beginnings in 1982, Operation Smile has grown into a worldwide children's medical charity whose network of medical volunteers are dedicated to helping improve the health and lives of children and young adults worldwide. Operation Smile has helped more than 100,000 children and young adults in 30 developing countries overcome their physical irregularities. The organization now operates one of the world's largest volunteer networks, utilizing more than 5,000 medical and non-medical professionals around the world. 
   During their medical missions, credentialed medical professionals volunteer to repair facial deformities while building public and private partnerships that advocate for sustainable healthcare systems for children and families. Furthermore, Operation Smile trains and educates local medical professionals and leaves behind necessary equipment to lay the groundwork for long-term self-sufficiency. 
   I commend the Magees for their passion to improve the health and lives of children and young adults worldwide. Through Operation Smile, their efforts over the past 25 years have offered new life and new hope to those suffering from facial deformities and their families. In recognition of Operation Smile's 25th Anniversary, I am truly honored to commend their noble work here on the floor of the House of Representatives.

   Since its founding one century ago, Chincoteague has enamored citizens and visitors alike with its small town charm and pristine natural beauty. This is no small feat if you consider just how much has changed in the past few 100 years. 
   As we commemorate Chincoteague's proud history and rich traditions, we must acknowledge its roots as a small fishing village. Today, thousands of people still flock to Chincoteague each year to share in its bountiful shores and the abundance of nearby wildlife. Chincoteague should serve as an example of a happy coexistence between people and nature. 
   From Chincoteague's annual pony roundup to the annual seafood festival, even the simple everyday beauty of its sunsets, the town of Chincoteague is truly a unique community which has come a long way without letting time erode its proud heritage.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, we have seen in the gulf region and now along the Mississippi River what can happen when hurricane and flood protection infrastructure is inadequate or fails to perform. Yet more Americans are moving to coastal areas where the risk of hurricanes and floods is great. 
   In the south Atlantic region, the coastal population grew 51 percent from 1980 to 2000, and this trend is expected to continue. Along the Gulf of Mexico, the population has increased 38 percent from 1980 to 2000, and this trend is also expected to continue. 
   We do not know where the next hurricane or flood will hit, but we do know that many of our major cities, including parts of Washington, D.C., have a greater probability of flooding than did New Orleans. 
   For example, the City of Sacramento, California, has almost twice as many people as New Orleans; yet it has less flood protection than any other major city in America. Cities like Houston, St. Louis, and Miami also are at risk. We cannot treat citizens of these cities differently unless we have a policy reason that we can explain and justify to our constituents. 
   As we have learned from recent levee failures, our infrastructure is aging. What we know about the existence and conditions of these other levees we often learn when one fails or it is overwhelmed by a flood event. For instance, the State of California in 2005 declared a state of emergency in the Central Valley in anticipation of the failure of 24 levees. According to the State of California, it would cost more than $5 billion to make critical delta levees, but not all delta levees, stronger in the face of flood and seismic events in the Central Valley. 
   In the past, Congress has taken steps to ensure that the Nation's flood damage reduction infrastructure is properly inventoried, inspected, and assessed. In 1986, the Congress authorized the National Dam Safety Program Act to conduct an inventory and assessments of all dams nationwide. The National Inventory of Dams shows that 45  percent of all Federal dams are at least 50 years old and that 80 percent of them are at least 30 years old. 
   We know less about the status and capabilities of our levees. There has never been a national inventory of levees. Little is known about the current condition of both Federal and non-Federal levees, including whether these levees were designed to meet current conditions or whether they have been properly maintained by the non-Federal interest. 
   Over the decades, levees have been built by different entities, at different times, and to different standards. They have been linked together to provide a protective system, but with such a mixture of conditions, the true level of protection may be in doubt. 
   Over time, development has taken place behind some of these levees so much more may be at risk in terms of lives and economic resources. 
   There is so much that we do not know about the levees in America that we cannot be sure how safe our cities and towns really are. We need more information. 
   The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 included language establishing a panel to develop recommendations for a National Levee Safety Program. However, the Committee on Levee Safety is unable to meet since a drafting error contained in the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 inadvertently keeps the Army Corps of Engineers from carrying out important work. 
   H.R. 6040 strikes the incorrect language and replaces it with language stating the Committee on Levee Safety can develop its recommendations subject to the availability of appropriations. 
   This technical change will allow the Corps of Engineers to convene the Committee on Levee Safety as soon as this bill is enacted. 
   With the recommendations that will come from this Committee on Levee Safety, the Congress can develop a national policy for levee safety and a program to ensure that levees are functional and safe. 
   I urge all Members to support H.R. 6040.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5001, the Old Post Office Building Redevelopment Act of 2008. The bill would direct the General Services Administration to enter into an agreement to develop the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue in accordance with its plan approved by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in 2001. The bill would also authorize GSA to relocate the Federal agencies currently occupying the Old Post Office Building. 
   The management of Federal real property has been on the Government Accountability Office's high-risk list since 2003. One of the key issues the GAO has raised is the problem of unused and under-used Federal property. 
   Currently, the Old Post Office is under-used and has been for some time. Over the years, there have been many attempts to make better use of this historic building. The most recent attempt was made after Congress passed the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act in 1976. This act, among other things, required GSA to encourage the public use of public buildings for ``cultural, educational and recreational activities'' and allowed Federal entities and commercial enterprises to share federally owned buildings. 
   Unfortunately, the mixed use of Federal and commercial space was not successful in this case. Today, there are only a handful of Federal agencies in this historic building on Pennsylvania Avenue, considered America's Main Street. This area of the city has undergone revitalization to help benefit and attract people who live, work and visit the Nation's capital. Allowing for the redevelopment and reuse of this important building will help to further the progress made in this area of the city. 
   Authorizing GSA to proceed with the full redevelopment of this building has the potential of being a win-win situation for the Federal Government, the taxpayers, and the local community. I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (PRE-DISASTER MITIGATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6109, which reauthorizes the successful Pre-Disaster Mitigation program for the next 3 years. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation program was originally authorized by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 as a pilot program to study the effectiveness of mitigation grants given to communities before disaster strikes. Prior to the creation of the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program, hazard mitigation primarily occurred after a disaster through FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Every disaster costs us in damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure, and potentially in the loss of lives. 
   The Pre-Disaster Mitigation program prevents damage and destruction by helping communities to act proactively through projects that reduce the cost and limit the adverse impacts of future disasters. 
   With FEMA's assistance, local governments identify cost-effective mitigation projects, which are awarded on a competitive basis. Since its inception, mitigation programs have helped local communities save lives and reduce property damage through a wide range of mitigation projects, such as home elevations, buyouts, improved shelters and warning systems.  
   In 2005, the National Institute of Building Sciences issued a study that conclusively demonstrated Federal mitigation programs saved the Federal Government money. Specifically, the study found that for every dollar spent on mitigation, the American taxpayer saves over $3 in Federal disaster payments. 
   Mitigation projects also are intended to save lives, and this year's record tornado season underscores the importance of lifesaving warning sirens. Given the tremendous destructive power of tornadoes, you can't mitigate against property damage, but you can mitigate the loss of life with a warning system. I particularly want to thank Chairwoman NORTON for including report language clarifying that Congress intended tornado warning sirens to be funded in this program. 
   At this point I would like to read a paragraph from the committee report on this subject: 
   ``The Committee notes the clear purpose of the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program to reduce injuries, loss of life, and damage to property from natural disasters and the program's broad statutory authority to provide Federal assistance for projects, such as tornado warning sirens, which serve this purpose. Given the sudden nature and extreme destructive power of tornadoes, the Committee believes warning sirens are a cost-effective measure for mitigating injuries and loss of life from tornadoes. The Committee believes that Section 203 of the Stafford Act clearly authorizes mitigation assistance for tornado warning sirens.'' 
   I believe this language makes it perfectly clear that Congress intended tornado warning sirens to be an eligible project under the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program and Congress expects the Federal Emergency Management Agency to administer the program accordingly. 
   In conclusion, mitigation works. It saves lives, limits future damage, and reduces Federal disaster costs. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation program is a worthy program, and I look forward to working with Chairwoman NORTON to reauthorize it this year. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (RAW SEWAGE OVERFLOW COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2452, the Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act. 
   Our Nation has nearly 23,000 miles of ocean and gulf shoreline along the continental United States, 5,500 miles of Great Lakes shoreline and 3.6 million miles of rivers and streams. Public confidence and the quality of our Nation's waters is important to every citizen of this Nation, but it is also critical to industries that rely on safe and clean water. 
   To improve the public's confidence in the quality of our Nation's waters and protect public health and safety, Representatives BISHOP and LOBIONDO introduced H.R. 2452, the Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act. Sometimes, especially during wet weather, sewage systems can leak or overflow. This can be caused by inadequate design or capacity or by breaks in the system of pipes that are often old and in need of repair. 
   H.R. 2452 requires the publicly owned treatment works develop and implement a feasible monitoring program that is reasonably able to detect the occurrence of an overflow or leak in their sewer systems in a timely manner and to notify the public and health authorities whenever a release would threaten public health and safety. 
   The Environmental Protection Agency is to develop regulations to help local utilities implement these monitoring and notification requirements starting 180 days after these regulations have been issued. EPA or the States, as the case may be, are to incorporate these monitoring and notification requirements into local utilities' Clean Water Act permits on a rolling basis as their permits come up for renewal. 
   This should provide for the orderly implementation of this program and minimize the need to reopen utilities' permits. To minimize burdening local  utilities with duplicative notification requirements, States that have substantially equivalent release notification programs in place may seek EPA's approval to implement the State's notification program instead of the requirements under H.R. 2452. The bill authorizes the use of State revolving loan funds to help communities pay for this monitoring and notification program. 
   Under this program, EPA and local utilities must define the appropriate amount of monitoring to reduce risk and reasonably protect human health. However, they need to be careful not to unwisely use up funds that are meant to address the very infrastructure problems that are causing the release of sewage in the first place. 
   I congratulate Representatives BISHOP and LOBIONDO on sponsoring this bill. The public has a right to know when their waters are threatened by sewage release. So I encourage all Members to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, the abolition of slavery was never fully achieved in our country, or anywhere else in the world. While the slavery that exists today looks different from the slavery of our country's past, it is still a widespread, horrific reality. Human trafficking is modern-day slavery. It manifests itself in many forms: forced and bonded labor, sex slavery, and even militant activity, as has been seen with child soldiers. 
   I am outraged that such an offense against humanity and against the ideals of our country is allowed to flourish on our soil and abroad. As the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Human Trafficking, I am proud to be an original co-sponsor to H.R. 3887. This reauthorization brings renewed attention to the fight against human trafficking. 
   Mr. Speaker, trafficking is a shared global problem which will require a global response. Congress has rightly taken the lead in putting this issue on the international agenda. Human trafficking is an issue that transcends political ideology and every faith. We have a moral imperative to put an end to this modern-day slavery. For this reason, I support H.R. 3887, because I believe it will put us on the right path to finally abolishing slavery in our country and around the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, only through increasing public awareness to this global problem and demanding action will we bring an end to slavery. I commend the sponsor of this bill and the many Members of Congress who have joined together to bring an end to slavery once and for all.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (OUR CONSTITUENTS' NUMBER ONE CONCERN IS THE HIGH PRICE OF OIL -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to start by thanking the gentlelady from Colorado for hosting us this evening and sharing the stories from her own district and the people that she stopped and talked with. 
   We've just come off our district work period for Memorial Day, and I know all of us at home over these last few days have heard over and over again from our constituents about the extremely high price of gas and how they just can't make that work in their lives and with their incomes. And I was thinking about tonight and coming down here to join you, and I realized this is my fourth year of serving the Congress. That means this has been 4 years that I have been saying the same thing over and over and over again. 
   In my first 2 years here, I served on the Natural Resource Committee so I had the opportunity to listen. And one thing I learned right away in 2005 that really upset me, because I didn't know this even though I've lived in Virginia now for 41 years; I grew up in northern Ohio and I grew up on Lake Erie, and I found out in 2005 that Canada has been taking natural gas from under Lake Erie since 1913. 
   I want you to know I never saw a derrick. I never saw any type of a rig. I never had any indication that that was taking place. And I thought, I really felt that I had been misled and that here we are in America blocking getting our own resources and here all along our neighbors are doing it. 
   And we know today that the one thing that would change the price of gasoline for our citizens, for our constituents, for America, for our businesses is to increase our own domestic supply. The number one issue that would make a difference. 
   In the 109th Congress, my first 2 years here, we did vote in this House. We voted to open up ANWR. I was surprised in those years when I learned that the National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska--just for a visual for people across America, when I learned that if you visualized that wildlife refuge as RFK stadium, ANWR, where the actual drilling would take place, would be the size of a postage stamp; and that really upset me because that wasn't the mental picture that I had. And I also learned that we have not built a refinery in this country since 1976. Those were all things that I learned in my first year serving here in Congress. 
   Serving on the Resource Committee, I listened to our neighbors in Canada who came to the Resource Committee to tell us how they were successfully taking oil products from oil shales and oil sand, and they came to volunteer to help us be able to do the same thing. And we still haven't done anything to increase our own domestic resources using yet a third way to do that.     
   I was fascinated when I would listen to the hearings about using the technology of liquefied coal, that that's old technology, that we can do jet fuel, diesel, gasoline, that would run in all of our engines today by using coal. 
   America is the Saudi Arabia of coal. Again I question, why are we doing this and why are we making America less competitive? Why are we putting this burden on our citizens? 
   I met Alaskan citizens who came to talk to me, to beg us to drill in ANWR, and they are the people that live right there. 
   I think it's time that we had a strategic energy plan. Now, in 2007 and 2008, the discussions that have taken place on this floor about increasing domestic supply have come not because we've brought any sort of strategic plan to the floor. It's come in other pieces of legislation like you saw tonight, in a bill when Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers stood and did a motion to recommit to try to get at the problem that we're all facing in America. 
   I know that we can protect our environment. I know that we can encourage conservation, that we can incentivize alternative energies as well. 
   In the Second District of Virginia, we're very proud of one of our universities, Old Dominion University, that is creating biodiesel out of algae. How exciting and interesting is that. They are also doing significant research in what's called coastal energy: wind, wave, solar. But there again, how do we increase our domestic production in our country? 
   But I also go back to what about families across America. Just before we went on our Memorial Day break, when I got home, when I was sitting there talking to my husband about what was his week like, what was my week like here in D.C., and he said to me, I know you don't know this, but do you know our water bill was $88 for last month? $88 just for water. 
   We both know that in the last 7 years our real estate taxes have tripled, and we're seeing today what we're paying for gasoline, what we're paying for food, and you've explained very, very well about the higher cost of transportation and that we have to move these products. 
   And that's us sitting there talking. We've lived in our house for 20 years. Our children are grown. How do families do it today? How do families do it that have to commute any distance because of the price of housing in our country? And more and more people have had to live further out. 
   If we want America to be competitive, if we want to grow our economy, if we want our families to be able to feel like that they're getting ahead and succeeding, we have got to join together in this Congress. We have to have a bipartisan solution, and we have to increase our domestic supply. 
   I'm sure that you were as distressed as I was when I read the newspaper article that our President had gone to Saudi Arabia and asked them to increase the gas production. My first thought was, why didn't he come here to Congress and tell us that we must change the law and allow for this domestic production, to allow for the siting of refineries, and to tell the American people that it is the policies right here in Washington that are stopping that from taking place? That's what I would hope that he would do. 
   I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity. I know you have other speakers. I think you and I could probably talk half the night to America about this issue, about how important it is, but every single person listening to us tonight knows how critically important it is that we increase our domestic supply and that we're able to drop this price and for American families to be able to feel that they can do something, that they can enjoy life and not have to worry and worry how they're going to pay for all the things that are in their lives today. This is something that I feel we, as Members of Congress, could make a difference and could make those changes.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (OUR CONSTITUENTS' NUMBER ONE CONCERN IS THE HIGH PRICE OF OIL -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Well, first, I'd like to thank the gentleman for that very thorough explanation to America as to what is really going on. I was very proud to stand beside you several months ago when you did your press conference on your bill. There were several of our colleagues there--original cosponsors on your bill--standing with you. 
   I'll never forget standing with you as well were representatives from Dow Chemical because they made an announcement, too. They told us that they were doing a $30 billion expansion in China, Saudi Arabia and Libya, 10,000 jobs that they wished were right here in America. The reason they did it was because you couldn't pay $10 to $12 for a unit of gas here that you could pay 85 cents for in Saudi Arabia. I've never forgotten that. I thought it was very, very painful. 
   Your bill as well does something that is very important. It has a 37 1/2 percent royalty back to the State. Now, the Commonwealth of Virginia desperately needs that kind of funding for our number one issue of transportation. Your bill also fully funds the Chesapeake Bay Commission's request for the bay cleanup. So there are ways that we can be environmentally protective and that we can be environmentally sound. 
   You brought up various environmental groups, and I wanted to say to you that I was going to speak to the Natural Resources Committee one day about why I support deep sea drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. I represent the entire Atlantic coast in Virginia. Well, there was someone there from one of our environmental groups whom I knew. I went up to him, and I said, ``I know if you're speaking you're going to say the exact opposite of me, but what I really want to ask you is: Do you understand the impact that you have on our economy or is that your point?'' He actually acted like I'd hit him. I said, ``No, no, no. Wait. I'm really serious. I'm trying to understand what the issue is, but I truly believe you either don't know or you intend to do it.'' Do you know what? He turned and he walked away and he wouldn't answer me, but we cannot as leaders in our country stand back and allow this to take place. 
   I just wanted to finish up with a couple of facts that I found very interesting. One is, if we were to increase that nuclear that you have on there, we could keep 200 billion tons of carbon out of our atmosphere annually if we simply had the nuclear capability of France.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. The second thing is that we're 13 times more likely to have a spill if we transport oil product by tanker. I think that's important for America to know. 
   There is another that you've said, that it has been over 30 years, almost 40, since there has been any significant spill from any sort of deep sea drilling. We all saw what happened with Katrina and Rita. There were no problems there. We know Canada has an oil rig in the north Atlantic, off the coast of Newfoundland, called Hibernia. There have been no problems there. As you have said, the technology is so much better. 
   The other important thing is the horizon is only 12 miles out. You're talking 50 miles from Virginia Beach. That's half the way to Richmond. So there is no way you would ever see a rig. 
   I want to thank you because you have done just a tremendous job of bringing this issue to the forefront and of explaining it to America, and I truly believe that when Americans have the facts and Americans understand this issue that Americans will be demanding of us as Members of the House and as Members of the Senate that we deal with this issue. I really hope that they call their Representatives all across America, that they phone and tell their Representatives and demand that we deal with this issue and not make America less competitive. 
   I keep talking about families. What about single parents? How do you deal with this incredible cost? You have brought it up. It is something that we have been extremely concerned about, the price of natural gas for home heating, and we have been very fortunate in our area to have milder than normal winters. That has not been the case across the country. So thank you. 
   I would like to thank the gentlewoman and yield back to her as well.

   The Medicare prescription drug insurance program continues to exceed expectations. The current private sector approach has resulted in more choices available to Medicare beneficiaries while simultaneously keeping costs below previous projections. 
   The majority of seniors are satisfied with the program and are saving on average $1,200 a year. Seniors are able to choose a prescription drug plan that meets their needs. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has stated that requiring the Federal Government to negotiate drug prices with the manufacturer will not result in any savings to the Federal Treasury or the taxpayer. When asked, seniors support lower drug prices; but when told that means less choice of available drug or pharmacy, they disagree. 
   Seniors across America want their doctors, not the Federal Government, to choose the most effective drugs.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. A March 2007 Los Angeles Times editorial posed the question: ``Do we really need a General Pelosi? Too many lives are at stake to allow Members of Congress to play the role of Eisenhower or Lincoln.'' 
   How unfortunate that less than a month after the fifth and final brigade of this surge effort has arrived in Iraq we sit here once again prepared to put bad politics in front of sound policy and undercut that mission, putting the lives of our troops, our coalition partners, and millions of Iraqis at risk. 
   Once again, the leadership of this institution wants to play general, so it chooses to circumvent the committee process to rush a hastily written piece of legislation to the House floor, one that has no chance of becoming law.  And so the question that I and many Americans have is: Why? 
   You can find the answer in today's Washington Times. According to this body's majority leader, we are here because ``if we don't do anything, these groups,'' meaning MoveOn and affiliates, ``will feel like we haven't done anything.'' 
   So that's it. We are here to appease MoveOn.org. Where is the policy? Where is the plan? Are we to believe that this bill will bring an end to violence in Iraq? Are we to believe that our withdrawal will make our Nation or the world any safer? Thus, politics replaces policy. We are a Nation at war against Islamic terrorists who have no intention of giving up the fight. We must defend this Nation. We cannot afford to play politics. This legislation carries no plan for securing Iraq or the Middle East, only politics. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have authorized our military to execute this surge and to report to us in September on its status. Why should we cut the rug out from under them now? Our troops will not give up on us; let's not give up on them. I urge rejection of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DRAKE. Thank you, Congressman Johnson, for your service to our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the past few years have been increasingly difficult ones for the American people, for our military families, and, most importantly, for our servicemembers in harm's way. 
   Our troops have done everything that has been asked of them, and more. Their sacrifices are unimaginable to many of us here on this floor. Through it all, the only thing that they have asked is for our support through our words, through our prayers, and, most importantly, through our actions. 
   During my two visits to Iraq, the question that I encountered from servicemembers was, What are they saying back home? They watch C-SPAN, and I know with certainty that they are watching us right now. 
   The resolution that we are discussing today is nonbinding and, therefore, merely symbolic within the Beltway. The driving force behind it has more to do with the situation in Washington than it does the situation in Baghdad. Yet, half a world away this resolution will have demoralizing effects for those men and women who we have asked to go into battle. 
   It is important for the American people watching this debate to know that this plan is currently under way. 
   The Second Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division moved into Baghdad nearly a month ago.     
   The Fourth Brigade of the First Infantry Division is deploying this month, with three more brigades set to arrive soon. That means that we are not here today to discuss whether or not the troops will go, we are discussing what message the troops will hear from us when they get there. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I am concerned about the current situation in Iraq. Last April, I witnessed the election of the Iraqi Prime Minister. Since that time, the Iraqis have failed to make acceptable progress, stabilizing their nation, and strengthening their democratic institutions. 
   Many of us have concerns about the plan. Will Prime Minister Maliki live up to the commitments that he made in November? Does this plan get the most out of the 21 trained and equipped Iraqi battalions deployed outside of Baghdad? These are reasonable questions, and ones I believe that are within the scope of Congress to discuss and resolve. 
   I appreciate debate, and the American people appreciate debate. But it is important to remember that the American people have sent us here to solve problems. Unfortunately, this resolution makes no attempt to solve the problems in Iraq. 
   If Congress believes that the President's plan can be improved on, then Congress has the responsibility to work with the Commander in Chief to ensure that the Iraqis are meeting stringent benchmarks and are living up to their commitments. This resolution is best defined by what it lacks. This resolution fails to include the proposal for a bipartisan panel tasked with outlining rigorous benchmarks and making sure they are met so that our troops may return home in victory. 
   This resolution fails to specifically protect the funding that our troops need to execute the mission. This resolution fails to condemn the terrorists and insurgents who target both our troops and Iraqis, and, most importantly, it fails to reiterate that victory should always be the goal. 
   We were told this week would provide an opportunity for every Member to go on the record, yet the majority has not allowed a Republican alternative that would protect funding for the troops. How do the American people know where their Representatives in Washington stand on funding for our troops when the majority will not allow that to be? 
   The American people are anxious, but they want progress, not defeat. They want to see their elected officials working together to ensure success on behalf of our troops. Simply inserting a sentence, saying you support the troops, is not enough when your actions say otherwise. The consequences of retreat would be dire. This is understood by our allies as well as our regional partners who have spoken up against withdrawal. 
   According to the Iraq National Intelligence Estimate, it would result in an immediate increase in sectarian violence and genocide and has the potential to destabilize the entire region. For decades, the instability in the Middle East has repeatedly resulted in the deaths of American citizens and servicemembers, in places as far apart as Beirut and Yemen, New York City, and the Pentagon. 
   A retreat at this point in time could, down the road, necessitate our troops returning to an Iraq that is much more dangerous than the one they left. I truly believe that the United States has the most formidable military in the world, not solely because of our technological and tactical advantages, but because our men and women in uniform fight in the name of a free and Democratic people. They fight on behalf of freedom for all, knowing they have the full support and confidence of the American people. 
   When we take that support away, we strip our troops of the greatest weapon in the fight against tyranny. I ask my colleagues not to vote for this resolution, but to once again work together.

   We should celebrate this achievement as evidence that we are making progress in Iraq, and we should allow the new strategy a chance to work. The 2007 Iraq budget represents a 21 percent increase over the 2006 budget. Over $10 billion will be dedicated to reconstruction efforts and capital investment projects this year, and over $7 billion will be used to provide security to protect Iraq from insurgents that continue to work against the cause of freedom.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DRAKE. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>

   Mrs. DRAKE. I rise today to speak about a true freedom fighter, a man whose sense of the rule of law and democracy has kept him in prison for the past 2 years. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak for my constituent from Virginia Beach, Dr. Yacob Haile-Mariam. 
   In 2005, Ethiopia held their national parliamentary elections. Dr. Yacob Haile-Mariam, a citizen of Ethiopia, resigned his position as professor at Norfolk State University and was elected to the parliament as a member of the opposition party. 
   Soon after the election, Dr. Haile-Mariam was arrested. Last week, the Ethiopian tribunal, adjudicating this matter hastily and without notice, terminated the proceedings and found him guilty of the charges against him. Dr. Haile-Mariam faces sentencing, including the possibility of the death sentence.     
   Mr. Chairman, the conviction of Dr. Haile-Mariam and other members of the opposition party is adverse to the principles of democracy, freedom and human rights that the United States promotes across the globe. More importantly, the conviction of these individuals is contrary to the commitment Ethiopia has made in recent years to engage in a civil society and establish a democratic government which respects the rule of law, due process and international principles of human rights. 
   The injustice of Dr. Haile-Mariam's imprisonment has been felt throughout Hampton Roads, most particularly by his loving and supportive family. I have been in contact with his brave wife, Tegist, and officials at the State Department since 2005 seeking a positive resolution to this unfortunate situation. While I do not believe decreasing funds from this particular account would expedite the release of Dr. Haile-Mariam, I could not stand by without speaking for a man whose voice has been taken from him.
