<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this important bill and urge its swift passage. 
   I'm pleased that House leaders, both Republican and Democrat, and the administration have been able to come together quickly on a clean, targeted economic stimulus package. The bill promises to relieve the financial strain on hardworking Americans while providing a much-needed boost to the economy and the housing market. 
   Today, I want to highlight a few provisions in the bill produced by the Financial Services Committee. These provisions increase the conforming loan limits for both the Federal Housing Administration and the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And what will this do? It will keep property values from falling further by temporarily permitting Fannie, Freddie and the FHA to help homeowners and buyers finance and refinance mortgages in high-cost areas like the City of Chicago. 
   In short, it will help save the neighborhood. 
   These are important first steps; but as the President indicated last night, there are additional steps that require our full attention in the days to come if we are to reinvigorate the economy. We need to prevent a return of the marriage penalty, the death tax and the alternative minimum tax, along with higher taxes on income dividends and capital gains. We also need to send comprehensive FHA and GSE reform to the President. 
   During the last two Congresses, our committee in the full House has passed bills to modernize the FHA and reform Fannie and Freddie, but these efforts have yet to become law. The latest FHA proposal was even rumored to be part of the stimulus package, but it is not. 
   And that is why I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to conference these two bills and get a final product to the President immediately. 
   A modernized FHA program will provide insurance so that more struggling American homeowners can refinance their existing mortgages and keep their homes. It will give first-time homebuyers a viable alternative to bad subprime loans. By providing Fannie and Freddie with a world-class regulator, we can infuse the housing market with liquidity so that more financing is available for perspective homeowners. 
   In addition, we need to supply more funding for housing counseling. Counselors can help guide homeowners into a loan that best meets their budgets and needs, steering them away from a situation that could lead to foreclosure down the road. 
   Madam Speaker, it is critical to the housing market and our economy that we finalize GSE and FHA reform and increase housing counseling. Adding liquidity and consumer confidence to the flagging housing market can restore vigorous growth to our economy, and we must do it without delay. 
   And in the near term, I urge my colleagues to support this economic stimulus package as a critical first step.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 3221, FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding and, Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to the rule. 
   I was very disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle couldn't resist the temptation to shut out all the Republican amendments during the debate on the rule. Like Chairman Frank did in the committee, calling up Republican amendments, they could have allowed at least one Republican amendment to be offered to this bill. 
   Speaker Pelosi has said that the Democrats are advancing a New Direction for America. However, I would argue that denying House Republicans from offering any amendments to this bill is the wrong direction. 
   Our voices have been silenced. It's a sad day when people who represent about half the population of the United States don't have the opportunity to bring solutions to the table during debate on this important issue. I hope that this wasn't a calculated maneuver for political gain. 
   Congress is yet to send a single bill to the President that might begin to address the turbulence in the housing market, and I know that this is important. Ranking Member Bachus and I had planned to offer an amendment that contains cost-effective reforms that can start helping homeowners and the economy now. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, our substitute amendment would decrease the deficit by $25 million over 10 years. Instead of outbidding each other on how much taxpayer funding should be spent on bailouts, House and Senate leaders should have chosen to move the good, commonsense, bipartisan ideas that are right in front of them in our amendment, and many have been passed before. 
   The amendment represents the very best elements of housing reforms that Congress has been debating over the last several years and none of the bad ones. It includes FHA reform which alone could help an additional 250,000 homeowners refinance through the FHA Secure program. 
   Our amendment would strengthen the national oversight of the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as reform these entities.  
   These reforms would infuse much needed liquidity into the flailing housing market. 
   It would add funding for housing counseling; enhance appraisal standards; require mortgage originator registration; provide resources to crack down on mortgage fraud; enhance disclosure; and provide liability protection for lenders that help struggling homeowners to refinance and eventually repay their loans. 
   It also provides returning veterans with foreclosure protection and temporarily raises loan limits on mortgages backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   Notably absent from our amendment is a high price tag. That's because it doesn't reward speculators, fraudsters, or those who engaged in inappropriate or recklessly irresponsible behavior. Several components of our amendment, including FHA and GSE reform, already have passed in one or both Chambers. 
   I understand that some--but not all--of our good provisions will be included in the Frank amendment. We need to break the logjam on these commonsense reforms. Counselors can help prevent foreclosures by guiding homeowners into a loan that best meets their budget and needs. And FHA and GSE reform will add much-needed liquidity to the market while providing more consumers with an alternative to bad, subprime loans. 
   Most importantly for Chicago and other urban communities, our amendment addresses mortgage and appraisal fraud, which has skyrocketed in Chicago and devastated communities. 
   I wish my colleagues could have had the opportunity to vote on our Republican commonsense, cost-effective substitute amendment. This could have been the bipartisan alternative to the bill we will vote on today, which is littered with controversial provisions. 
   However, my colleagues from the other side of the aisle chose to shut out our clean alternative and shut out the voices of millions of Americans who want a cost-effective solution to jump-start the housing market and get our economy back on track. 
   Again, I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise reluctantly in opposition to title IV. I am a fiscal conservative and I strongly support a balanced budget, fiscal discipline, and earmark reform; but I am afraid that this version of PAYGO means taxes will go up. 
   I think that the problem that we have had between the two sides of the aisle is over what is spending and what is tax relief. And I think that we see tax relief as tax relief and that it is the people's money and they know best how to spend it; and the other side of the aisle includes tax relief as spending. So I think until we can iron out that difference, I think we are going to have problems. 
   Madam Speaker, the Wall Street Journal today in an editorial called ``Tax As You Go,'' that is January 5, puts it best and much better than I can say it and I would just like to quote a couple of lines from there. It says: ``PAYGO, by contrast, gives the appearance of spending discipline while making it all but impossible to let the taxpayers keep more of their money. It really should be called spend and tax as you go.'' I would urge everyone to look at this Wall Street Journal, and I submit it for inclusion into the RECORD.  
   Tax As You Go 
   Congressional Democrats are dashing out of the gates to establish their fiscal conservative credentials. And as early as today  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will push through so-called ``pay-as-you-go'' budget rules for Congress. Keep an eye on your wallet. 
   ``Paygo,'' as Washington insiders call it, sounds like a fiscally prudent budget practice: If government spends more on program A, it has to spend less money on program B, and thus budget deficits will be restrained. We're all for that. But when Republicans proposed exactly that budget rule in recent years, House Democrats voted it down. 
   Ms. Pelosi has something different in mind. Under her paygo plan, new entitlement programs and all new tax cuts would have to be offset by either cutbacks in other entitlement programs or tax increases. This version of paygo is a budget trapdoor, designed not to control expenditures but to make it easier to raise taxes while blocking future tax cuts. 
   Supporters of paygo claim it will help restrain entitlement spending. It won't. Paygo doesn't apply to current entitlements that will grow automatically over the next several decades. Ms. Pelosi's version of paygo applies only to new entitlements or changes in law that expand current programs. 
   And on present trajectory, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, food stamps and the like are scheduled to increase federal spending to almost 38% of GDP by 2050, up from 21% today. Paygo won't stop a dime of that increase. This may explain why one of the leading supporters of paygo is the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal outfit that favors far more social spending. 
   Paygo enthusiasts also claim that when these rules were in effect in the 1990s the budget deficit disappeared and by 2001 the budget recorded a $121 billion surplus. Sorry. The budget improvement in the late 1990s was a result of three events wholly unrelated to paygo: the initial spending restraint under the Republican Congress in 1995 and 1996 as part of their pledge to balance the budget; a huge reduction in military spending, totaling nearly 2% of GDP, over the decade; and rapid economic growth, which always causes a bounce in revenues. Paygo didn't expire until 2002, but by the late 1990s politicians in both parties were already re-stoking the domestic spending fires. 
   What paygo does restrain are tax cuts, by requiring that any tax cut be offset dollar-for-dollar with some entitlement reduction. Congressional budgeteers always overestimate the revenue losses from tax cuts, which under paygo would require onerous budget cuts to ``pay for'' the tax cuts. As a political matter, those spending cuts will never happen. 
   First on the chopping block, therefore, would be the investment tax cuts of 2003 that are set to expire in 2010. Last year Democrat David Obey of Wisconsin, the new Appropriations Committee chairman and a prodigious spender, gave this strategy away when he urged paygo rules so he could enact new social spending and pay for it by canceling the Bush tax cuts for those who make more than $1 million. 
   Never mind that, in the wake of those capital gains and dividend tax-rate cuts, federal revenues climbed by a record $550 billion over the past two fiscal years. Incidentally, thanks to the current economic expansion and the surge in tax revenues, the budget deficit has fallen by $165 billion in just two years--without paygo. 
   Given all of this, it's especially puzzling that even some conservatives seem tempted by paygo's fiscal illusions. Our friends at the Heritage Foundation have of late become obsessed with future entitlement forecasts and have advised Ms. Pelosi to enact paygo rules to stop it. But Heritage notably did not insist that tax increases be excluded from any paygo rule. Had such logic prevailed in 1980 or 2003, it's possible that neither the Reagan nor Bush tax cuts would ever have become law. As a political matter, paygo is about returning Republicans to their historical minority role as tax collectors for the welfare state. 
   That's not to say that new budget rules aren't highly desirable. The line-item veto, a new Grace Commission to identify and eliminate the billions of dollars of waste and failed programs, and an automatic spending sequester if the budget rises above agreed baselines would all help to restore spending discipline. But it is precisely because these rules would restrain spending that they are not on the Democratic agenda. 
   Paygo, by contrast, gives the appearance of spending discipline while making it all but impossible to let taxpayers keep more of their money. It should really be called ``spend and tax as you go.''

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise to congratulate the Waubonsie Valley Warriors on winning the Illinois State Girls Soccer Championship. In the final tournament, the Lady Warriors won three consecutive games to capture the State title against an exceptionally competitive field. 
   Despite the loss of Illinois Gatorade Player of the Year, Bri Rodriguez, who suffered a torn ACL in the quarterfinal match, the team notched a 3-0 victory over Belleville Althoff in the championship. This is the second consecutive State championship for the Waubonsie girls soccer team, which this season recorded an undefeated record of 26 wins, zero losses, and 1 tie. 
   Kiki McClellan, Vanessa DiBernardo, and Megan Green each succeeded in scoring hard-earned goals during the championship game. And Claire Hanold kept her goal-keeping streak alive by blocking five shots and securing her 22nd shut-out of the season. Indeed, every member of the team stepped up to bring the trophy home through her outstanding play. And guiding them to the championship was Coach Judy Bergstrom. 
   Madam Speaker, the Warriors' success can be attributed to their determined spirit and strong work ethic. These talented young ladies have made their community and the entire State of Illinois proud. So once again, I congratulate the Waubonsie Valley Warriors on this historic achievement and wish them continued success in the years to come.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF FINANCIAL LITERACY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 273, to designate April as Financial Literacy Month. This will be the fourth year that I have had the pleasure of working with my friend and colleague and fellow Chair of the House Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus, Mr. Hinojosa, to promote the goals and ideals of Financial Literacy Month. 
   I am amazed at the progress that we have made so far over the last few years in raising awareness about the importance of greater financial literacy and economic education. Hundreds, if not thousands, of public-private sector, nonprofit, and community-based organizations across the country have established financial literacy programs. More than 50 of them will be on hand in the Cannon Caucus Room on April 24 to share the benefits of their knowledge and experience at the annual Financial Literacy Day Fair, and I encourage all of our colleagues to attend and learn more about these important efforts. 
   As Mr. Hinojosa mentioned, we have received dozens of letters in support of these efforts and this Financial Literacy Month resolution from various financial and educational organizations. And I think that this year we have set a new standard for unity on this issue, with well over 100 Members of Congress co-sponsoring this resolution. In doing so, I think we send a clear, unambiguous message that the  House is committed to addressing one of America's most pressing needs. 
   And while we have made great strides in raising awareness, the need for improved financial education has never been greater. According to the Federal Reserve, consumer debt in America now exceeds $2.4 trillion. According to the Department of Commerce, the personal savings rate in America recently dropped to negative 1.1 percent, a level that has not been seen since the Great Depression. 
   The fact is that today's marketplace abounds with options for managing wealth. Credit and investment opportunities are presented to consumers on a daily basis. For instance, by the time they reach their second year in school, the vast majority, 92 percent, of American college students have at least one credit card, and yet just a small fraction of those students have sat down with their parents and learned the basic principles of money management, like compound interest and supply and demand. 
   We have a responsibility to ensure that Americans of all ages have access to the tools and resources they need to capitalize on their investment choices, succeed in today's sophisticated economic market, and enjoy a secure financial future. And the key to this success continues to be basic financial education starting early, during grades K through 12. 
   It is a testament to the progress we are making that 38 States now include personal finance education in their curriculum guidelines. But we must continue building on this progress if we are to help today's students become tomorrow's successful investors, entrepreneurs, and business leaders. 
   The Financial Literacy and Education Commission established by Congress in the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act of 2003 recently held a national summit to develop better methods of teaching money management skills. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee to implement and enhance economic education initiatives as we work to reauthorize No Child Left Behind in the coming year. 
   I also look forward to working with my colleagues on legislation that will put young Americans on the path to an affordable education and a firm financial future. 
   At the start of the 110th Congress, I introduced one such bill, H.R. 87, the 401 Kids Family Savings Act of 2007. This bill will allow parents and family members to set aside money in a child's account that will accumulate interest tax free and can be used for college tuition, a first home, or even retirement. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is critically important that families have access to effective savings mechanisms like these if they are to secure their financial futures. But it is even more important that Americans have the know-how and motivation to use them, and that is the goal of the Financial Literacy Month and the resolution before us today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my good friend and distinguished colleague from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa) for introducing this resolution and for his dedication to improving financial literacy. I also would like to thank Mr. Hinojosa's staff, especially Greg Davis, for all their hard work, diligent work in bringing this resolution to the floor. I would also like to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. Waxman and Mr. Tom Davis, for helping to move this resolution through their committee in such a timely and bipartisan manner. And, finally, I would like to thank the gentlelady from California (Ms. Watson) and the gentlelady from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for their support and for managing this resolution on the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 118. 
   Last month, the United States Olympic Committee selected Chicago as the official U.S. candidate for hosting the 2016 Olympic games. It's been over 100 years since the Midwest hosted these games, and I am pleased to report that the Nation's heartland is ready, willing and able to do so again. 
   I have lived in the Chicago area my whole life and I can't imagine a better location for the summer Olympics. The people are welcoming and they are sporting spirit is high. A national hub of water, railroad and air, the ``Windy City'' has a diversity of culture and community that reflects the very best of America. And as host of the 2016 games, Chicago will serve as the Nation's emissary to the world, just as it did once during the World's Fair of 1893. 
   Director of Works for that historic fair, Daniel Burnham, once famously said, ``Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood, and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans, aim high in hope and work.'' 
   From reversing a river to building the world's tallest tower, Chicagoans have a heritage of big dreams. And in keeping with its motto for the 2016 games, ``Stir the Soul,'' Chicago's visions for the Olympics will be a dream the whole country can share in. 
   To Mayor Daley, Patrick Ryan, the chairman of the Chicago Olympic Committee and all its members, I would like to extend my personal congratulations. Without their hard work and dedication, securing this nomination would not have been possible. 
   I thank the gentleman from Chicago (Mr. Emanuel) for sponsoring this resolution and the gentleman from Illinois, our former Speaker Hastert, for his hard work in gaining such attention. 
   I would also like to thank the efforts of all of our friends on the Illinois delegation, every one of whom helped in this cause tremendously by letters of support and by cosponsoring the resolution before us today.     
   The International Olympic Committee will be making its final selection in 2009. I invite all my colleagues  from across the Nation to unite behind Chicago and commit to doing our part to bring the 2016 Olympic games back to America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support H. Con. Res. 118, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Lampson). 
   Every year, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC, receives funding through the Justice Assistance Account's Missing Children Program. For the past several years, the House has allocated funding in the Missing Children Program to NCMEC; however, in this year's bill, there is no allocation. My amendment carves out of the Missing Children Program $34 million for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
   Authorized by Congress in section 404 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, the National Center is a true public-private partnership, funded in the current fiscal year by Congress at $26.6 million and augmented by $11 million in private sector donations. 
   Since its inception in 1984, NCMEC has handled more than 2.1 million calls, trained 226,000 professionals, printed and distributed over 42 million publications, worked more than 130,300 missing children's cases, and perhaps most importantly, played a role in the recovery of more than 112,900 children. In fact, NCMEC's total recovery rate is an impressive 96.3 percent. 
   Furthermore, the National Center operates the CyberTipline, the congressionally mandated ``911 for the Internet.'' NCMEC has handled more than 475,000 leads since March 1998. These leads have resulted in hundreds of arrests and prosecutions for such crimes as child pornography, online enticement of children, and sexual molestation. 
   Mr. Chairman, for generations the message was simple. Parents told their children to never talk to strangers. My parents told me, and I told my children. Times have changed. There are more threats to our children, and our message must change with technology. Similarly, the role of the National Center has changed. The Internet opened a new world of child exploitation, and in order to sufficiently protect our children, we must give the National Center the resources it needs to help keep our children safe and at home. 
   I would urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I know that you are committed to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and I know that this will be an important issue discussed at conference, and I understand that you would like me to withdraw this amendment.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank Chairman Mollohan for all of his work on this bill, and I appreciate your commitment to all the missing children's programs. It is very important. And I know that you are equally disturbed by the prevalence of Internet crimes against our children. And the numbers certainly don't lie. 
   According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTip Line, the number of reports relating to the online enticement of children for sexual acts increased by 139 percent between 2005 and 2006. Over the same period, there was a 194 percent increase in the number of reports related to unsolicited obscene material sent to a child on the Internet. 
   Certainly more can and must be done. And this problem is not regional; it is not isolated to big cities or rural  communities. This is a real national problem that will not go away unless we can expand our capabilities of our law enforcement, which is exactly what my amendment will do by increasing the funding for the Internet Crime Against Children Task Force. 
   The Internet Crime Against Children Task Force, or ICAC, plays a very critical role in protecting our children on the Internet. The ICAC Task Force's mission is clear: to help State and local government enforcement agencies develop an effective response to cyber-enticement and child pornography cases. This help involves forensic and investigative support training and technical assistance, victims services, and community education. 
   The amendment would carve out $15 million out of the Justice Assistance account's Missing Children Program for the Internet Crime Against Children Task Force. It would also carve out $15 million out of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program for the ICAC Task Force. Both accounts were used in fiscal year 2007 to fund the Internet Crime Against Children Task Force at $26 million. 
   And I certainly understand the problems that having to do with this amendment, so I am certainly willing to withdraw my amendment if the chairman and ranking member are willing to work toward an increase in funding for the Internet Crime Against Children Task Force in conference. 
   I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1591, the so-called U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act of 2007. 
   That's what my Democratic colleagues are calling the bill. And while I support the funding in the bill for troop readiness and veterans' health care, I wonder why the bill's title ends with Iraq Accountability. Why not mention hand-outs to dairy interests, spinach farmers, citrus growers, or for storing peanuts? Yes, $74 million for storing peanuts. 
   Why not mention the unrequested funding for fighting wildfires in the west, or the doubling of so-called ``emergency'' funds for the long-known and well planned Base Realignment and Closure effort--funding that the new majority knew was needed, but wouldn't provide in the continuing resolution just last month? Why not mention the increase in the minimum wage or funding for asbestos abatement in the Capitol contained in this alleged emergency wartime supplemental appropriations bill? 
   ``Clean'' is not a word I would use to describe this bill, which includes more than $21 billion in spending that is completely unrelated to troop readiness, veterans' health, or Iraq. Sure, I've heard of Christmas in July, but Christmas in March? What happened to the other party's promise to end business as usual? This bill is worse than usual. As the editorial in USA Today put it yesterday, ``It's hard to believe which is worse: leaders offering peanuts for a vote of this magnitude, or members allowing their votes to be bought for peanuts.'' 
   Don't get me wrong. I agree that Congress has a responsibility and an obligation to ensure the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense have the resources necessary to care for our veterans from all wars and our wounded soldiers returning from Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. 
   I agree that Congress has a responsibility and an obligation to see that American troops are ready and able to fulfill their mission. That's why I am a cosponsor of a bill introduced by my distinguished and decorated colleague from Texas, Mr. JOHNSON. H.R. 511 pledges, ``Congress will not cut off or restrict funding for units and members of the Armed Forces that the Commander in Chief has deployed in harm's way'' in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   I also agree that we must do a better job holding the Iraqi government accountable. For too long, we pursued an open-ended commitment without well-defined goals and clear benchmarks for success. 
   That's why I am a cosponsor of legislation, H.R. 1062, that will hold the Administration--and the Iraqi government--accountable in achieving clear benchmarks. 
   It requires the President to report to Congress, every 30 days, on the extent to which the Government of Iraq is moving forward on more than a dozen fronts, from troop training and security to rebuilding, reconciliation, international cooperation and enforcing the rule of law. 
   It also requires progress reports on the implementation of strategies that will prevent Iraqi territory from becoming a safe haven for terrorist activities. 
   But the bill we are considering today goes beyond funding and benchmarks and crosses a constitutional line that has long kept Congress from micromanaging military and foreign affairs. 
   Instead of sweeping away bureaucratic obstacles to success, this bill creates 435 new armchair generals. 
   Instead of giving General Petraeus and our diplomatic leaders the flexibility to fulfill their mission, it saddles them with bureaucratic requirements and arbitrary timetables. 
   Instead of ensuring that our troops in harm's way have the resources and equipment they need, this bill uses our military men and women as pawns in a dangerous political game. 
   Instead of giving our troops, the Iraqi people, and their fledgling government one last chance, it gives them one last mandate--to retreat in defeat. 
   As if the bill wasn't wasteful enough, it starts a perilous countdown to a vacuum in leadership and security that threatens any prospect for peace or stability in the Middle East for years to come. And it does a great disservice to our men and women in uniform and their commanders in the field who have already sacrificed so much for our freedom and security and that of the Iraqi people. They deserve better. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this irresponsible bill.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding and, Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. 
   In 2005, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Energy Policy Act, or EPACT, the first comprehensive energy package enacted with bipartisan support in well over a decade. I supported it for one reason, because it made a much needed and sustained investment in the basic science and applied energy research that will end our reliance on foreign oil. 
   Congress and the Federal Government must make a steadfast commitment to support the development of advanced energy technologies and alternative fuels that will help end our addiction to oil and gasoline. That is why in the 109th Congress I introduced H.R. 6203, the Alternative Energy Research and Development Act. This bill reflected the latest research, the emergence of innovative technologies, and new ways of thinking about our power problems. Among other things, it supported the development of biofuels, solar and wind power, and battery technologies. It also promoted energy conservation in a number of important ways. 
   This bill received bipartisan support from the Science Committee. It was approved unanimously by this body in September of last year, but the other body, on the other side of the rotunda, failed to act on it before Congress adjourned. So why aren't these widely supported provisions included in the bill we are considering today? Good question. 
   I tried to offer an amendment to include provisions from H.R. 6203 in this bill. I went to the Rules Committee to explain my amendment and how it might contribute to our energy independence. But before I could speak, a decision had already been made by the Democratic leadership not to allow any amendments to this bill, not even those whose provisions had been passed unanimously just 4 months ago. 
   So how does this bill contribute to our energy independence, Mr. Speaker? I supported fixing the Clinton administration oil and gas leasing errors, but I believe we are missing the opportunity to take the next step. We should know where the money will go. Instead of creating a slush fund, as this bill does, for some unknown use in the indefinite future, we should take the steps today to invest in the kind of research, development, and demonstration projects outlined in H.R. 6203 that will ultimately lead to advanced energy technologies. We need to start today. 
   If we are serious about energy independence, we should put that money to work today as an incentive for consumers to become more energy efficient and use alternative fuels. This could be accomplished by extending and expanding the tax credits created in EPACT for the purchase of vehicles that run on alternative fuels. Let us lift the cap on the number of vehicles that can qualify for these credits. Let us expand incentives for the installation of alternative refueling infrastructure. 
   I introduced another bill in the last Congress that would do just that by using the revenue generated from repealing certain tax credits for oil and gas production. These are the kind of concrete initiatives that will bring us measurably closer to achieving true energy independence. These are the kind of worthy initiatives we should consider. 
   I will have to support this bill, I guess, but I think it could be better, so much better, and that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1227, GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, while I am grateful that this rule made in order one of my amendments to H.R. 1227, I rise today in opposition to this modified closed rule because my other amendment, a very important amendment, was not made in order. 
   My second amendment would have struck section 302 of H.R. 1227 and inserted a new section at the end of the bill resetting the section 8 funding formula to its pre-continuing resolution state. The amendment would require HUD to distribute section 8 funds to public housing authorities for the remainder of the 2007 calendar year as they were distributed before the enactment of the continuing resolution just last month. 
   The section 8 funding formula change that was included in the CR was not well thought out. One doesn't need to look very far for evidence of this fact. Under the funding formula change that was included in the CR, all of the gulf coast PHAs lose funding, and the budget of the New Orleans PHA alone drops from $73 million to $3 million in 2007 and then permanently from there on.  
   The bill before us today fixes this problem for the gulf coast and New Orleans PHAs, but not for the rest of the country. I guess they realized that they had made a mistake in that area, but let's just leave the other PHAs in trouble. Half of the PHAs in the country, then, over 1,200 public housing authorities in 29 States, remain in trouble. 
   Because of the section 8 funding formula change in the CR, PHAs in half of our Nation's communities will not be able to serve many of our neediest citizens. Very soon HUD will issue a notice that informs PHAs that if they haven't spent their ``unspent balances'' by a date certain, they lose these funds. If a person is walking the streets with a voucher and hasn't found a place to rent, he or she loses the voucher because these ``unspent funds'' will be recaptured by HUD. It was wrong to change the funding formula midyear when PHAs had already set their budgets for this year. 
   My amendment would have corrected this problem by telling HUD to distribute section 8 funds to PHAs for the remainder of 2007 calendar year as they were distributed to PHAs before the enactment of the CR. 
   Unfortunately, my Democrat colleagues on the Rules Committee voted against making my amendment in order and against restoring much-needed funds to many of the Nation's PHAs. And they did so with full knowledge that PHAs in their own congressional districts would benefit from my amendment. 
   All three counties in my district lose funding under the formula change in this CR, but at least I attempted to do something about it and didn't consciously vote against fixing the problem. 
   We also will continue to try to fix the problem caused by the section 8 formula included in the CR. As ranking member on the Housing Subcommittee, I will continue to work with my Housing colleague Chairwoman Maxine Waters to craft a bipartisan section 8 reform bill in the Financial Services Committee, which is the appropriate place to address any changes to the funding formula, not in an appropriation bill such as the recently enacted CR. 
   I recognize that the minority party may not be able to stop this rule from going forward, Madam Speaker, but I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to seriously consider voting against this rule. While the bill prevents PHAs in the Gulf Stream from being harmed by the formula in the CR, this rule does nothing to help PHAs nationwide that are in the same predicament. 
   Again, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me begin by thanking Chairman Frank for bringing this bill to the House floor today and for presiding over a constructive debate when the Financial Services Committee considered the legislation earlier this month. 
   I also want to thank Ranking Member Bachus for his leadership on this issue and of course Chairman Waters for all the work that she has done in the Subcommittee on Housing on this. 
   Let me just kind of return to where we started with the hurricane on August 29, 2005. Hurricane Katrina hits New Orleans. September 2, 2005, President Bush signs into law a $10.5 billion supplemental appropriations measure for the affected areas. It was passed by voice vote in the House. September 9, 2005, President Bush signs into law a second installment, this time for $51.8 billion, again passed the House. March 16, 2006, the House passes the third installment for the supplemental. May 30, 2006, HUD approves Governor of Louisiana Blanco's Road Home Program, and the Governor needed congressional approval for the $4.2 billion. Fifteen days later, the House agrees to the conference report of voting approval. June 15, 2006, President Bush signs into law a third installment for the amount of $19.3 billion. June 16, 2006, the Road Home Program is operational in Louisiana. March 5, 2007, the Road Home enters its ninth month of operation. 112,672 Road Home applications. How many have closed? 2,790 grants. 
   So we have entered a new era where it was very important for us to go down and see what was happening and to make sure that we could effectively have something happen there. 
   The hurricanes that struck the gulf coast in August of 2005 affected over 1 million Americans, destroying or damaging some 265,000 homes and apartments in Louisiana and Mississippi alone. Since the disaster, the Federal Government has committed more than $110 billion to help the gulf coast, including $16.7 billion for the CDBG program, which provides flexibility for housing and economically rebuilding the programs. Unfortunately, getting the money out the door is taking more time than it should. With respect to the CDBG funding, for example, only $1.2 billion of the $16.7 billion promised has been delivered. 
   With respect to the affordable housing stock, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita left 112,000 fewer rental units in the five-State gulf coast region than existed before the storms. As the region recovers, and as residents seek to return, there has been a spike in demand for nondamaged rental units from construction workers, displaced lower-income renters, and higher-income homeowners who are temporarily renting units in the area while their houses are repaired. 
   Since the disaster first struck, the Financial Services Committee has certainly played an active role passing much needed legislation last Congress that relieved regulatory burdens and shored up the government's flood insurance program. During this Congress, the full committee and the Housing Subcommittee, on which I serve, have held multiple hearings on the reconstruction and recovery area in the gulf. Indeed, over the President's Day recess, as Chairwoman Waters mentioned, my colleague from Texas, Mr. Neugebauer, and I participated in field hearings held by Chairman Waters in New Orleans and Mississippi. There we heard from residents trying to rebuild their lives and communities in the face of considerable obstacles and often maddening bureaucratic delays. 
   The magnitude of the challenge facing the gulf coast residents requires us to rise above partisanship and political finger-pointing and develop sustainable solutions to the very serious problems that persist in New Orleans and other parts of the region. 
   While the committee Republicans share the majority's goal of providing displaced families with stability and ensuring there is access to safe, affordable housing, a number of provisions in H.R. 1227 are troubling. Accordingly, the Republicans will offer several amendments made in order by the Rules Committee that will seek to assist those in need while, at the same time, being mindful of the need for fiscal responsibility and for prioritizing among competing demands for tax dollars. 
   It is important that we act in a deliberative and thoughtful manner on this important piece of legislation. Rather than seeking to simply reconstitute a public housing system that was clearly broken long before Katrina made land fall, we owe it to the residents of the gulf coast to build something better. Our focus should be on helping those families who lived in the gulf before the hurricanes and wish to return home to rebuild their lives and communities. 
   Hurricane Katrina not only left physical devastation in its wake; it left behind a reservoir of anger, strong emotions and painful experiences. Our challenge is to channel these experiences and emotions into an appropriate response. Thousands of affected Americans depend on us not to get angry, but to do it right. So do the families who in the future may themselves experience a Katrina-like tragedy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me just say that going down there was quite an experience and something I never would have dreamed had happened. To see that firsthand, to go into the public housing and to see the interiors that had been sitting there for over 18 months that had been underwater for several days, particularly in New Orleans. In Mississippi, it was just a storm surge so the wall of water went in and then it went out, taking with it the homes. 
   But in New Orleans where the water sat, and to see the debris that was left inside, the clothes, the furniture, the food and cupboards and the mold will take an enormous amount of fixing. 
   When I was talking about it to someone, they asked, Are the cars still in the trees? I said, No, the cars have been removed from the trees, but the buildings are still standing just as they were untouched. So it is a big job. 
   As Ranking Member Bachus said about finding mixed-use housing, to move public housing into the 21st century I think should be all of our goals, to be able to provide a place where those who need subsidized housing can live in what would be a larger unit. The units that we saw were tiny. Water heaters were in the kitchen next to the stove with all of the wires where little kids would be playing. So to have larger units for a family, to have open spaces, and to have the services. 
   Right now they are in a quandary because people want to come back, but there is no housing. People want workers in their community, and there is no place for the workers to live. So until we can break this cycle, and that is what takes leadership from those that are in the community, to break that cycle so there is housing, there are workers, and there are services. 
   At least seven hospitals were destroyed in New Orleans. They don't have the medical services or the groceries stores. So even if someone comes back, and they have restored some of the housing and some of the units, they may remain empty because they are living in a place that is almost empty and there are no services. You can't just go to the grocery store. We have to jump-start this, and I think this bill goes well on its way to get over the bureaucracy and to have the leadership, the grass-roots leadership, begin to do that. 
   In Mississippi we saw a different situation where the storm came in and out.  All you see are slabs and concrete stairs from those slabs going to nowhere. About the only thing remaining were oak trees, beautiful, beautiful oak trees that did survive. All of the other foliage is gone. 
   There they have been able to rebuild. A lot has been done. Maybe it is because houses didn't sit in the water. The water came and went, and they were able to remove the debris. But there I think we had some of the leadership that is needed on the local level. 
   From the hearings, it gave us hope. After 18 months, they have the money. Congress has done their job and we will be able to get them back on a track and not set precedents that will be unwieldy if there are other such disasters. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   The other thing that worries me, though, is just that you said you saw a government that did not care about its people. And I think certainly we have seen people in the government here that care very much; $110 billion has been turned over to those States to use to rebuild. I just think that we all care about it, we as the government, we in the administration, and I think the State and the local government.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise to introduce an amendment that I think fixes a provision of the bill that mistakenly includes replacements for 2,000 units in New Orleans, even though these units were not occupied and, in fact, were condemned and scheduled for demolition prior to Katrina. 
   Let's just do the math. Before Katrina, there were 5,156 public housing units that were occupied in New Orleans. We don't know how many of those 5,156 residents will want to return. We have asked HUD to find them and conduct a survey to ask that question. In the meantime, this bill authorizes replacements not only for the 5,156 units that were occupied by Katrina, it throws in another 2,000 units that were unoccupied, condemned, and scheduled for demolition. I see no point to that. 
   We don't know how many of the residents will return. Why then would we want to replace not only the 5,156 units they occupied, but an additional 2,000 units that nobody lived in even both before Katrina? 
   My amendment will permit one-for-one replacement of the units that were occupied by public housing residents at the time of the 2005 storms. 
   According to CBO estimates, this amendment would reduce the spending authorized in this bill by $270 million, which is the cost of replacing the 2,000 public housing units that nobody lived in before the 2005 storms hit. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge support of the amendment, and reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I am glad that Mr. Neugebauer clarified that. The buildings, we went into those buildings and we climbed up to the second floor and it was just as bad as the first floor and there were no other floors. 
   One thing about New Orleans housing is at least it was not the high rises like we saw originally in Chicago, that a whole precinct would be public housing. And those have been done away with. 
   But let me just say that we want people to come back, and we want them to have the housing. And there are some of the units that have been fixed up. And what has happened is there is nobody there, and the police have to come because they are broken into and they are vandalized. And we need more people there. 
   But these units, we need to know how many people are going to come back originally. We have got to start the process someplace, and we don't seem to be able to do that. If we have 5,156 residents that were promised that they could come back, we should provide that. And it is a one-on-one. But for the 2,000, let's get those first people back and get them back by August so that they could have their kids go to school. The housing is not great, but let's get them back to do that. But to have 2,000 other units that are built  that we really would rather get the first ones going, we have got the money for it. And I think now we are talking about 18,000 people that are on the waiting list. 
   First of all, let's just say that there are people that have moved to other States. They have jobs. They have a life. The survey goes out, and it is going to be completed by HUD and we will know. We don't know how many people are on the waiting list. Nobody has made an attempt to figure out if they are people that are waiting or they have gone someplace else. 
   So I would say that this is just to get it going. And to undertake 5,165 units is going to take awhile. Obviously, to build a whole multi-use facility is going to take a lot more time. But there are plans to do it. So we can do it both, but let's get it going. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, with that, again, before we make all these decisions, we really have to know how many people are going to return. If we have the 5,100-some units and all the people that have been living in those units don't return, then there will be a time that they can open up the section 8 housing and have people off the waiting list who qualify. If they still qualify, if they come back. 
   But what this bill is doing is a one-on-one replacement, and that is what it says in this bill, is to replace the one-on-one replacement for those units that we were talking about, whether it is 5,000 or it is 7,000. And I say let's use the dollars that we have to start with the people that were displaced from there. They have the public housing, they have the vouchers, and let's not wait any longer. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to Mr. Bachus for the remaining time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would again extend FEMA temporary financial assistance through the end of December and then provide those section 8 vouchers to FEMA-assisted families when FEMA assistance expires, and that is exactly what the gentleman was talking about, but I think that the amendment is unnecessary. 
   The President currently has the authority to extend the length of this temporary assistance, as he has already done before. This assistance was supposed to expire at the end of 18 months, but the President extended it through August of 2007 to allow FEMA ample time, I think, to work with the families and help them secure permanent housing. This means that this assistance will have lasted a full 2 years since Katrina. 
   Since the hurricanes, FEMA has provided billions of dollars in assistance directly to individuals and households to support their recovery, including flood insurance payouts, direct payments for rental assistance, payments for home repairs and lost property. But FEMA assistance was supposed to be temporary to give families that were affected by the devastation time to get back on their feet. But today, as was said, 35,000 families are still living in FEMA trailers. Our efforts should be focused on moving these families to permanent housing, including homeownership, instead of keeping them in limbo. 
   It really concerns me that we move from FEMA and then turn it into section 8 housing. Deadlines such as the August 2007 deadline have encouraged families to make decisions about their future rather than continuing the expectation that the Federal Government will provide for them. In fact, every time FEMA has had a deadline and has enforced it, we have seen more people move further on the road to recovery and self-sufficiency. When FEMA moved people out of the hotels and motels, people said thousands would be  homeless. In fact, nationwide less than 100 people were in the shelters as a result, and most of them for only 3 days. I understand the same held true for the cruise ships. When the cruise ships' assistance ended, nobody ended up in a shelter. 
   So we need to encourage the President to have the flexibility he needs to do this right, and that means leaving it to the administration to determine when and for how long to extend the housing aid through FEMA. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   What this really boils down to, I think, and the problems we are having in communication is what to do with the long-term disaster housing. We haven't faced something like this before. 
   We have the disaster vouchers. We have the section 8 vouchers, and how do we make this all work. I think we all care about what is happening to these families. It has been over 18 months. We are concerned. People need to get on with their lives. 
   I don't think we are really asking for anything different except that we think that this is unnecessary because the President has the flexibility now to do what we are talking about. I think we should leave it. We think we should leave it to the administration to determine when, whether, and for how long to extend the housing aid through FEMA. 
   I agree, most of the families and individuals in the FEMA-sponsored housing are living in travel trailers that are not suitable for long-term housing. Just think of a family living in a trailer for the long term. I think extending the assistance will prolong this unsuitable housing arrangement. 
   I think FEMA is working now to determine, with Federal and State partners, to address the potential for what is going to happen for long-term housing needs as a result of these hurricanes. 
   We are setting precedent here. Let's hope we never have something like this again. I think this is moving along. 
   It will increase the amount of this bill if these vouchers are made permanent, but maybe we need to sit down and really work out what are disaster vouchers, and we already are working on section 8 vouchers; and we have jumped ahead on some of these things. I know everybody is enthusiastic on  this committee and wants to do everything right now, but we have a whole consideration of section 8 vouchers. And to extend FEMA and then turn them into permanent vouchers, section 8 vouchers, and I know they have to be eligible, but we really need to sit down and determine and debate what are really the long-term ramifications of what is going on. 
   I think some of these things can be worked out later. We don't have to do everything at once. I think this already is a costly bill, and I think we should wait to determine some of these things. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

If people finally have found housing, and they qualify for Section 8 vouchers, they will be able to get them, but let FEMA work to address the problem and the potential for long-term housing needs as a result of the hurricane. 
   I just do not think that this amendment is necessary because it has been taken care of by the administration.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (SOLUTIONS FOR HIGH ENERGY PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, tonight I rise because my constituents in my district are sick and tired of paying record-high gas prices while Congress does nothing to increase domestic energy production. Imagine for a moment that you are a regular working mom struggling to make ends meet. You need to get the kids to and from school, you need to get to work, you need to buy groceries, you need to do all of the things that millions of working parents do every day. Then at the end of the week, you stop by the gas station only to find that prices are so high that you can't even afford to fill your tank. What do you think she would want from her representative in Congress? 
   I know what my constituents want us to do. Everything. We should allow exploration of America's own energy reserves in places like ANWR and the Outer Continental Shelf waters. We should bring new carbon friendly nuclear reactors online and begin the reprocessing of nuclear energy. We should invest in clean coal plants with carbon sequestration technologies. We should invest in research and development of alternative energy technologies, be that wind, hydro, geothermal, solar, and we should provide the tax incentives necessary to accelerate their deployment. 
   In short, we should do all of the above and more. America can neither drill nor conserve its way to cheaper energy. We must have a comprehensive approach that does have both short- and long-term solutions. 
   Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Science and Technology Committee, I have been a long-time advocate for research development for energy technologies like hydrogen, cellulosic fuels, solar, wind, and green buildings. In my own district, scientists at Argon National Laboratory are leading the way on the development of specialized batteries for special hybrid vehicles. They will allow motors to drive 40 miles before using a drop of gas. That's more than enough to cover Americans' commute to work and back. Then they can just plug the car into a regular electric socket and recharge it for another 40 miles. 
   I believe that the significant advances in these energy technologies are just around the corner, but in the meantime, we must provide relief to hardworking Americans being squeezed by soaring gas prices, and that means increasing the domestic supply of energy. 
   America is the only industrialized Nation in the world that prohibits oil and glass exploration in its Outer Continental Shelf waters. Foreign nations, like Cuba, are permitted to drill closer to our shores than the American companies; and yet instead of opening America's vast energy reserves, Congress forces us to rely on expensive oil from the Middle East. 
   I agree that examining futures markets for excessive speculation and exercising proper oversight is fine and good, but if we want to effectively curb speculation in the oil market, we should show that we are serious about developing our own energy reserves. When more supply is on the horizon developing our own energy reserves, speculators will have much less incentive to invest in oil commodities. 
   This debate isn't just about the price that Americans are paying at the pump. It's about the growing threat to our economy and our security. Last year alone, America increased its dependence on foreign members of OPEC by an additional 7 percent. How much more money and control are we willing to turn over to nations in these unstable regions of the world? And yet despite this growing threat, Congress is still debating legislation that holds zero potential to increase domestic energy production or help break our addiction to foreign oil. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm glad that the House leadership has finally realized that we need to bring bills to the floor  to address America's energy needs. I just wish the legislation considered today was up to the task.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (EDUCATION: THE QUALITY OF OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Thank you. I thank the gentleman from California, Mr. McKeon, for facilitating this discussion on the 25th anniversary of President Reagan's A Nation at Risk report and the importance of education to our economic future. I appreciate your leadership on the Education and Labor Committee. I can't think of a more appropriate event than the 25th anniversary of the report, A Nation at Risk, to review our education system and our global competitiveness. I think this report outlined the dire consequences if we as a Nation fail to improve our schools. In the 25 years since that warning, a number of things have changed. But we still face many of the same concerns raised by the report. 
   I remember well when this report came out. In fact, I was president of my local high school board at the time, and I know how devastated we were to find out how badly we were doing. People asked me why I wanted to be on the school board. I wanted to be on the school board because I wanted to make sure that my children got the best education available, and I wanted to work to make sure that that happened. So I was concerned about this. 
   I thought back on my family, and the thing that was always so important to our family was education. In fact, my father told all of us, there were four of us, that education was the most important thing, and if you got a good education, you could do most anything that you wanted. I don't think I would be here if it hadn't been for that. But he also was a very great man, and he said, And I will pay for it. 
   Now when you look back at that time, it wasn't as expensive, and we think of all of our kids and grandchildren in schools now.     
   But my older sister went to medical school, I went to law school and became an attorney, my brother went to law school and became a judge, and my little sister got her master's in Latin and Greek. Now, she doesn't use that too much anymore, but I think the point is that is how important education is and how it remains. 
   I really do worry, because it is at a time now when we have to compete on a global scale. Americans have shown their entrepreneurial skills and leadership, making the U.S. the largest and most robust economy in the world. However, we are seeing that Asia and Europe, our economic competitors, are making significant new investments in their infrastructure and human capital. 
   In a recent report, ``The Gathering Storm,'' in looking at what is happening, this report shows that our competitors' investments are beginning to pay off and they are challenging the U.S. leadership in sciences, no matter how it is measured: By the number of patents, they are having more and more patents they are gaining; articles written in the scientific journals; Nobel Prizes won; percentage of the gross domestic product dedicated to research and development; and even the number of degrees. 
   We all know that our graduate schools have been filled with graduate students who have come from foreign countries. In the past they have been staying in our country. Now we are seeing the brain drain with them leaving. 
   So despite the evidence that science and education is responsible for America's preeminence in so many areas today, the 2000 Hart-Rudman Report on National Security found that ``the U.S. Government has seriously underfunded basic scientific research in recent years. The quality of the U.S. education system too has fallen well below the scores of other nations.'' In fact, in one of the reports, we find that with other countries, we rank number 28, that is 28 under all of these other countries for our educational system. 
   I believe that now, more than any time in our history, we are at a crossroads. The economic prosperity of this country is the product of our well-trained workforce, and if the United States is going to be able to continue as the economic leader and have the creativity and the innovation that we need in technology, we have to ensure that our current and future workers have the tools necessary to compete. 
   There is not a quick fix to this problem, but there is no question that by providing the quality education to the  next generation of workers, that we are going to ensure the success of our country, and without a well-trained workforce, we could see employers moving the best jobs to other countries where workers have the skills necessary to perform that work. So we can't allow this to happen. 
   We have the building blocks necessary for the best education system in the world, but when we compare American students to other students, there is no question that there is room for improvement. Just ask the employers in our districts or area colleges and universities where employers are finding it more difficult to find skilled workers and where college students are having to take remedial classes when they go in as freshmen because they are not at the point where they can really do the first level of college education. 
   I think that certainly Congress has recognized the importance of addressing this issue. In 2001, along came No Child Left Behind. Our intention was to address the achievement gap that exists in our country between the disadvantaged children and their more affluent peers by holding the States and schools accountable for the education of all students. This law also gives parents and taxpayers information on the education that their children receive compared to other schools. So I believe that this goal continues to be supported in Congress and in the schools and communities across the country. 
   Now, 7 years after the passage of No Child Left Behind, I think we are now reflecting on where things are working and how we can improve the law. 
   I know, Mr. Chairman, you have spent so much time on this issue, and we have had numerous, numerous hearings in the last few years and this session of Congress, but also in the 109th and the 108th, and always working, and even before that since 2001, to make sure how we can improve the law. But I had thought that we would be reauthorizing this system last year, and, unfortunately, it has been held up. But it has given us time. 
   I remember we had one hearing with 46 people that came in to testify. It was kind of the last hearing before we thought we were going to get this bill out. I think I sat through the whole thing. But also I have and a lot of the other Members have held roundtables in our districts to talk to superintendents, to talk to teachers, to talk to parents, to talk to businesses, to talk to Chambers of Commerce, to talk to students as well, and the community, because that is what it takes to make our schools the best that we can have. 
   So I think that this discussion tonight will demonstrate the need to reauthorize No Child Left Behind sooner rather than later. I guarantee that our international competitors are not waiting for the U.S. to catch up. I think that we need to really proceed, really with the hope that everyone will realize that education is the basis of everything that evolves for our children and our grandchildren to be a success and have a very successful life and really contribute to our country in moving ahead. 
   I would like to thank you for hosting this discussion tonight. With that, I will yield back so some of our other Members have an opportunity.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for all his hard work on this bill as well as on this amendment, which I support. 
   My problem with it is that right now we are doing a lot of housing law on these disasters, and what we are doing is setting precedent. And if this trend in the weather continues, I think we'll probably see a lot more. So I think we have to be very careful in how we move on this, because if it is made permanent, then the disaster voucher program will serve as a model for the future disasters, forcing Congress to act similarly time and time again. 
   Assisted families will continue to receive this rental subsidy for several months. This is to continue allowing time to transition to other types of housing, including home ownership. And I think that what we are doing is really making, prematurely making these DVPs permanent, so that as long  as the recipient remains eligible for assistance it eliminates other approaches. 
   Authorizing this, according to the Congressional Budget Office, puts the cost at about $11,900 per voucher per year. And I really wonder, we all have the goal of really getting the people, the victims of this disaster, back where they want to be, back in a home. And I don't know that by extending the time more, we have got until December, will encourage them, give them the incentive then to get moving. I think extending it through December 31 of 2007 allows Congress and HUD to assess the appropriate long-term solutions. 
   What we have been talking about with all of these vouchers, we have got other ways to do this. And we put in the bill the survey, and until this survey is completed, it may be difficult to identify the need for a permanent disaster voucher program extension, as the disaster voucher program provides assistance to many of these former HANO tenants. So I think we are kind of putting the cart before the horse. We really need to know where the people are, if they are coming back, and what their future plans are. And until HUD has the opportunity to do that, which they have said they would do soon, but not soon enough in time for this bill. So I think that this is premature, making these vouchers permanent, so long as the recipient remains eligible for their assistance.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. I want to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee for yielding me the time. 
   I know that both the chairman and the ranking member share my great frustration that again this year the Department of Energy failed to request funding for the university reactor infrastructure and education assistance program. That is why I was extremely concerned to learn that this bill included no funding for this program. 
   At the same time I recognize that the subcommittee has provided $15 million in funding for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to support university programs, but that spending will be limited to scholarships and fellowships and ``human infrastructure'' programs. And I understand that Assistant Secretary Spurgeon has indicated publicly that DOE plans to support universities, faculty and students with over $60 million in funding from its core research programs. 
   I would ask this of the ranking member: Does the subcommittee expect the DOE to fulfill this commitment? And, furthermore, is the $15 million in NRC funding in this bill in addition to DOE's commitment? 
   I yield to Mr. Hobson.

   Finally on a separate and unrelated issue, I remain concerned that there is no funding in this bill for the Army Corps' dispersal barrier on the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal, which is designed to keep aquatic invasive species like the Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes and devastating the ecosystem. 
   I recognize the bill contains no funding for the barriers because the bill identifies no projects, and because additional authority included in WRDA is required for the Corps to complete and operate the barriers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this open rule and the fiscal year 2008 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Chairman VISCLOSKY, Ranking Member HOBSON, and their subcommittee for putting together a strong bill that clearly recognizes the importance of scientific research and energy security to our national competitiveness. In particular, I want to commend them for more than meeting the President's request for the DOE Office of Science. 
   Mr. Speaker, we face a world in which our economic competitors in Asia and Europe are making significant new investments in their own research capabilities. These investments are beginning to payoff, as Asian and European countries challenge U.S. leadership in the sciences, no matter how it is measured--by number of patents won, articles submitted to scientific journals, degrees awarded, or Nobel prizes won. 
   Report after report has called on Congress and the President to invest in U.S. research capabilities. The benefits of such an investment to the U.S. economy and U.S. competitiveness are well known. Economic experts have concluded that science-driven technology has accounted for more than 50 percent of the growth of the U.S. economy during the last half-century. 
   That's why President Bush and Congressional Democrats and Republicans have proposed doubling federal funding for basic research in the physical sciences over the next 5 to 10 years as part of their innovation and competitiveness initiatives. 
   Supporting over 40 percent of total federal funding for basic research in the physical sciences--more than any other Federal agency--the DOE Office of Science is the Nation's primary supporter of research in the physical sciences. 
   Mr. Speaker, U.S. scientists are as bright as any in the world, but they traditionally have had better tools than everyone else. Under the President's budget, 21,500 researchers would have access to the DOE's unique system of large-scale, specialized user facilities. Nearly half of those users will be university faculty and students, many will be from other federal agencies, and a significant number will be from U.S. industry. 
   And the Office of Science is using those facilities and its expertise to address our energy challenges. It supports basic research related to: The production of cellulosic biofuels; the development of advanced materials for the safe storage of hydrogen; more durable and efficient solar panels and wind turbines; and advanced nuclear systems, not to mention fusion power. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Office of Science has developed a balanced investment strategy to ensure the U.S. retains its dominance in such key scientific fields as biotechnology, nanotechnology, materials science, and supercomputing well into the next century. I again commend my colleagues on the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee for recognizing the great contributions that basic research in general--and the DOE Office of Science in particular--make to our energy security and our national competitiveness.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Turner-Biggert-Gillmor amendment to increase funding for HUD-approved housing counseling services by $6.76 million, bringing the HUD total housing counseling budget to $48.34 million for fiscal year 2008. 
   As the ranking member of the Financial Services Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee, I want to thank my colleagues from Ohio for their work on this amendment, which is a modest increase in funding that could prevent millions of Americans from losing their homes. 
   I've spent many an hour this year listening to witness after witness testify before our subcommittee and the Financial Services Committee about the current home foreclosure spike. According to data released by the Mortgage Bankers Association, while our country will continue to enjoy record homeownership rates, foreclosures are on the rise and we should expect another 1 million Americans to lose their homes this year. These mortgage foreclosure rates raise eyebrows and call into question what actions can be taken to help homeowners keep their homes. I would like to emphasize the word ``action.'' 
   Almost 2 weeks ago this body passed, by a vote of 411-7, House Resolution 526 sponsored by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings). This resolution called on this body to take action to support home ownership and responsible lending. The resolution directed us to increase opportunities for loan counseling. So what can Congress do to meet this directive today? What is it we should be doing right now to ensure that 650,000 homeowners and those who may follow can keep their homes? One step in the right direction is to support the Turner amendment to increase funding and, therefore, opportunities for housing counseling. 
   It is crucial to promote financial literacy and educate our youth and adults. This is the most direct way of ensuring that consumers understand the terms of their loans so that they may avoid predatory loans and foreclosure altogether. 
   I'm pleased that on June 25, NeighborWorks America and the Ad Council launched a national ad campaign aimed at preventing home foreclosures. Homeowners in trouble can try to save their homes by calling a hotline, 888-995-HOPE, a number provided by the Homeownership Preservation Foundation. 
   In addition, we have about 2,300 HUD-certified housing counseling agencies across the country. Americans should know that they can visit HUD's Web site or call 800-569-4287 to find a HUD-certified counselor in their neighborhood. HUD-certified counselors can give straightforward and free or low-cost advice to potential or existing homeowners about buying a home, refinancing a mortgage or preventing foreclosure. 
   The Turner amendment is one way that we can enhance the ability of our local HUD-certified housing counselors to help our constituents avoid foreclosure and keep their piece of the American Dream. But I think this amendment is good for the economy, good for American homeowners, and I think it's crucial that we act upon it now, where so many people are in these dire straights. 
   I know that there are groups that are in support of this, and one that comes to mind that we just received a letter from is Acorn. So I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, on Monday it was with reluctance that I voted to oppose the earlier version of this bill. I did so not because I believed there was no urgent need to act. On the contrary, I believed we had to act quickly, but we had to do it right. 
   I've fought hard to present alternatives and add taxpayer protections. Working with some great colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we offered options that ranged from insuring instead of buying mortgage-backed securities, to tightening the language on possible losses to the Treasury, to injecting capital through tax cuts for repatriation of foreign earnings and more. Working with Mr. LaTourette, we even attempted to limit the initial outlay to $250 billion so that Congress  could come back in a month and reassess the need for the remainder of the $700 billion. 
   Over the last few days, we've made more progress. The FDIC is raising its insurance limit to protect people's savings. The SEC is revising its mark-to-market accounting guidelines, and we have included middle class tax relief. But there still are many changes I would like to see. Unfortunately, the volatility in the market is threatening the financial security of my constituents and millions of American families, small businesses, and retirees. 
   Make no mistake: the latest compromise is not the best package. It's the package that can move through Congress in time to protect the economy from lasting damage. With the clock ticking, credit markets seizing up, and the market swinging wildly, it is clear that the time for seeking better options has run out. I'm glad we held out for the taxpayer protections that we got. But if we don't act now, those who are least to blame for this mess will suffer the most. 
   So it is with reluctance that I support this bill today and urge my colleagues to do the same. Our work is by no means complete. I look forward to revisiting the issue as Congress monitors the program to ensure that we minimize risks and that the taxpayers see a return on this investment.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (NATIONAL MISSING CHILDREN'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an original cosponsor of House Resolution 1142, recognizing May 25, 2008, as National Missing Children's Day. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan declared May 25 to be National Missing Children's Day. In doing so, he provided an annual reminder of our Nation's obligation to locate and recover missing children. National Missing Children's Day prompts parents, guardians, and other trusted adult role models to make child safety a priority. 
   It is tragic that every year thousands of children are abducted or go missing in our country. While more missing children come home safely today than ever before, there is still work to be done. Nearly 8,000 children are reported missing each year in the United States. More than 2,000 children are reported missing every day. Too many children do not make it home, and many more continue to be victimized by acts of violence. In fact, children are the most victimized segment of our society, and crimes committed against children of all ages are the most underreported of any victim category. 
   In 1979, the disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz served as the impetus for the creation of National Missing Children's Day. Etan's photo appeared in the media across the Nation and around the world. His image came to represent the anguish of thousands of families searching for their missing children. Today, local, State, and Federal law enforcement work diligently across the country in an effort to find children and reunite them with their families. 
   In December 2007, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 2517, the reauthorization of the Missing and Exploited Children's Program. I am proud to be the lead Republican sponsor of that bill, and am hopeful that we will be able to complete the reauthorization this Congress. 
   Our efforts here in Congress provide resources, training, and technical assistance in order to assist in increasing the capabilities of State and local law enforcement to locate missing children. The recognition of May 25, 2008, as the 26th National Missing Children's Day serves to remind us that we still have work to do to reunite families, work that requires parents, families, neighbors, and law enforcement to come together to locate all missing children. 
   For this reason, I am proud to join my fellow cochair of the Congressional Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus, Mr. Lampson, in support of National Missing Children's Day, and thank him for introducing House Resolution 1142. I ask for my colleagues' support, and thank Mr. Bishop for managing this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1147, congratulating the Northern Kentucky University Norse women's basketball team, the 2008 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II tournament champions. How far women have come since the days that women basketball players were required to play half court only. I remember those days. This has really changed. 
   On March 29, 2008, and before a crowd of 3,067, the unranked Northern Kentucky Norse, from Highland Heights, Kentucky, put an end to the third-ranked University of South Dakota's Coyotes' 31-game win streak. NKU's women's basketball team used a 23-9 run to overcome a nine-point deficit and beat South Dakota 63-58 in the 2008 NCAA Division II national championship game. 
   Only 3 weeks earlier, NKU was just hoping to make it into the NCAA tournament. The Norse improved its NCAA chances by advancing to the Great Lakes Valley Conference finals, where it lost to Drury. Despite the loss, the team received a fourth seed in the Great Lakes regional. Earlier in the tournament, NKU had to overcome a 15-point deficit to win its first round games against Indianapolis, 55-54. The Norse then whipped Drury, 84-65, and edged Missouri S&T, 60-52, on the path to the finals. 
   NKU is led by one of the top coaches in the NCAA Division II women's basketball, Nancy Winstel. Currently in her 25th season as head coach at Northern Kentucky University, Coach Winstel reached the 500-win plateau 3 years ago. With this most recent championship, Coach Winstel has led NKU to two national titles, having earlier guided NKU to the 1999-2000 NCAA Division II national championship. 
   We should recognize Northern Kentucky University for embracing a regional stewardship role as reflected by its significant consideration to the intellectual, social, economic, cultural, and civic vitality of the region and the commonwealth. NKU supports multidimensional excellence across the full breadth of its work: Teaching and learning, research and creative activity, and outreach and public engagement. The university fosters a community that values openness, inclusion, and respect, and is committed to intellectual and creative freedom and to the open expression of ideas. 
   I extend my congratulations to the university's President, Dr. James Votruba; Athletic Director Jane Meier; Head Coach, Nancy Winstel, and her staff; and all of the hardworking the players, the fans, and to Northern Kentucky University. I am happy to be joined by my good friend and colleague, Representative Geoff Davis, in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments, and wish all involved continued success. I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   If there are no further speakers on the other side, I would yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2744, the Airline Flight Crew Technical Corrections Act. Just last week, this bill was approved unanimously by the Education and Labor Committee. The reason H.R. 2744 has secured the level of support that it has is because it sticks to what its name promises, a bill that has been crafted narrowly to address a need identified by flight crew personnel that has arisen because of a technicality in how their work hours are calculated. 
   Airline personnel, including certain flight attendants, are subject to a unique scheduling process in which they are paid for being on call, but in some cases are not credited with those hours in the work requirement calculation used for Family and Medical Leave Act eligibility. What is the practical impact of this situation? Some flight crew personnel may work a full-time schedule, but fail to qualify for family and medical leave. This is a real concern for those grappling with health conditions or a family obligation. 
   The bill before us today is an important opportunity to extend the protections of FMLA to flight crew who might otherwise be denied benefits under the law. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important legislation, and I want to thank Representative Bishop and Chairman Miller for working with Members on both sides of the aisle to ensure this bill achieves its stated goal, no more and no less. But no one should look at this bill as a substitute for the type of comprehensive reform that is needed. 
   Mr. Speaker, many Members have been uneasy about efforts to open up the Family and Medical Leave Act for small changes when it is clear that broader reforms are necessary. The Family and Medical Leave Act has worked well for 15 years, offering workers the flexibility to attend to their own health or care for a loved one in their time of need without fear of losing their job. 
   But despite the law's many successes, it has also become clear that many changes are needed. The reality of today's workplaces are different than those of a decade-and-a-half ago. In an addition, the courts have offered evolving interpretations, and, as is often the case with such a sweeping change to employment law, there have been unintended consequences for both employers and employees. 
   There is another reason that some of my colleagues have been cautious about opening up FMLA. There is always a danger that by placing special protections in the law for one group of workers, we may end up on a slippery slope of piecemeal changes that breed confusion rather than clarity. This could lead to unintended consequences that could actually harm workers if, for instance, our new protections for one class of workers are interpreted by the courts or Federal regulators as a means to exclude other workers. I think these are valid concerns, and that is why this bill has been drafted carefully in an effort to avoid these dangers. Going forward, I think we must be mindful of the consequences that could come from further attempts to tweak the law, rather than to give it a more thorough update. 
   So while I continue to believe that we must proceed with the utmost caution, I also believe it is reasonable today to correct this law so flight crews can benefit from the FMLA, just as millions of other workers do. The bill before us today is a small step, but one that will make a meaningful difference to a number of my constituents and other families across the country. 
   I would like to thank the flight attendants in my district who came in to see me on this topic for all their help. I am hopeful that we can take the same constructive approach on broader FMLA reforms to ensure that FMLA continues to work as it was intended, offering a balance for both workers and employers. 
   With that, if the gentleman has no further speakers, I will yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1007 to pay final respects and express the condolences of the House of Representatives for those affected by the devastating shooting incident on the campus of Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois on February 14, 2008. 
   On that dark Valentine's Day, five students lost their lives, and 17 others were injured. Those five who were taken from their families are: 20-year-old Gayle Dubowski of Carol Stream, 20-year-old Catalina Garcia of Cicero, 32-year-old Julianna Gehant of Mendota, 19-year-old Ryanne Mace of Carpentersville, and 20-year-old Daniel Parmenter of Westchester. 
   The wounds suffered that day have been deeply felt by those families that lost loved ones, but the entire Nation shares in their pain. Messages of support continue to flow in from across the country and around the world. 
   I would like to take special note of the extraordinary outpouring of kindness and sympathy from the students  and faculty of Virginia Tech. Having endured a similar tragedy just last spring, their words of wisdom and perseverance have given strength to many in the NIU community. 
   Our Nation's universities and colleges are places where students begin to embrace adulthood, where they begin to relish a newfound freedom, and where they begin to realize their dreams. For many they are places that offer new beginnings and pathways to brighter futures. To have that cut short for these five young men and women by such a senseless act is almost beyond comprehension. So today we come together to comfort one another and pray that the Northern Illinois University community and our Nation can begin to heal in the aftermath of this unspeakable tragedy. 
   We also come together to support the efforts of America's higher education leaders and administrators to ensure tight security and safe conditions for all students. The recent violence on college campuses has American families concerned. As a Nation we must work to create safe yet accessible facilities and ensure that parents don't have to fear for their children's lives when they send them off to school. If ever there were a place where America's youth should feel safe, it is in institutions of learning. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also believe that we owe sincere and heartfelt gratitude to NIU's administration, the law enforcement officers, faculty and students for the way they have handled the crisis. The strong, coordinated response by campus security reflects long hours of training and undoubtedly saved the lives of potential victims. And the entire DeKalb community, both on and off campus, has shown unity and courage in the face of extraordinary adversity. 
   Simply put, no one can ever be truly prepared to handle a tragedy like this, but the response of the Northern Illinois University family has been a credit to them and to the State of Illinois. 
   So in the spirit of the NIU Husky fight song, let us now move ``forward, together forward,'' and may we all learn from the example of NIU as we tackle future challenges that face our Nation. 
   I ask my colleagues to keep the students and families of NIU in their thoughts and prayers, and I ask for their support of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (NATIONAL SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1013, expressing the sense of the Congress that providing breakfast in schools through the National School Breakfast Program has a positive impact on classroom performance. 
   The National School Breakfast Program was created in 1966 to help schools serving breakfast to ``nutritionally needy'' children. Made permanent in 1975, the program focuses on those schools where assistance is needed to provide adequate nutrition for students. 
   The School Breakfast Program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service through State education agencies, in agreement with local school food authorities, in nearly 84,000 schools and institutions. 
   In fiscal year 2006, over 9.7 million children participated in the School Breakfast Program daily. Of those, 7.9 million received their meals for free or at a reduced price. In my home State of Illinois, more than 223,000 students received free and reduced-price breakfasts daily. 
   Public or nonprofit private schools serving K-12 and public or nonprofit private residential child care institutions may participate in the School Breakfast Program. School districts and independent schools that choose to take part in the breakfast program receive cash subsidies from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for each meal they serve. In return, they must serve breakfasts that meet Federal requirements, and they must offer free or reduced breakfasts to eligible children. 
   Many States that have implemented school breakfast programs have seen encouraging outcomes. Maryland has seen an increase in standardized test scores 17 percent above the State average, an 8 percent reduction in tardiness, and a reduction in referrals to the office for discipline by 20 percent. 
   Unfortunately, the problem persists that millions of children go to school hungry each day, even though breakfast is the most important meal of the day. The Federal child nutrition programs can offer a great deal in the promotion of nutrition and wellness, especially in terms of assisting those children most in need. That is why I stand in support of this resolution, encouraging every child to start the school day with a nutritious breakfast in order to learn, grow, and develop to their fullest potential. 
   I ask for my colleagues' support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3121, FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this rule governing the consideration of H.R. 3121. I had hoped that the committee would see the wisdom in providing an open rule on this important legislation, and in the absence of an open rule, that it would at least make in order amendments that both sides of the aisle took the time and effort to draft. 
   Unfortunately, as has been said repeatedly, of the 26 amendments filed with the Rules Committee, only 13, half of the amendments filed, were made in order, and of those 13 amendments that the Rules Committee made in order, not one, not one Republican amendment was made in order. 
   Has the majority again gone back on its promises to have an open, fair, and bipartisan operation of the House floor? On December 5, 2006, Majority Leader Hoyer was quoted in Congress Daily PM as saying, ``We intend to have a Rules Committee that gives opposition voices and alternative proposals the ability to be heard and considered on the floor of this House.'' Clearly, today, the leadership of this Congress has again turned its back on its promises. 
   The original Flood Insurance Reform Bill, H.R. 1682, which Chairman Frank and I introduced together earlier this year, enjoyed substantial bipartisan support in the Financial Services Committee. However, due to political pressure, a bill was introduced by my friend from the other side of the aisle, Congressman Taylor, to add wind to the National Flood Insurance Program. 
   The flood reform bill turned partisan. So the majority introduced a new flood reform bill, H.R. 3131, and expanded the flood insurance program to include wind. While nine out of 13 witnesses, insurance experts, testified before the Financial Services Committee that wind should not be added to NFIP, the majority did it anyway. 
   The new flood-plus-wind insurance passed out of the committee; and in July, at a hearing on adding wind to the NFIP, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, insurance experts, environmental groups, floodplain management groups, the Treasury, and FEMA all opposed this expansion. That is why we are concerned about not having these amendments come to the floor. 
   Members on our side of the aisle had hoped to be given the same opportunity to debate important issues on the House floor. The amendments filed by my colleagues Mrs. Miller, Mr. Garrett, Mr. Hensarling, Mr. Pearce and Mr. Rohrabacher were not made in order, and Mr. Price's amendment was not even considered. 
   In particular, I wanted to say something about Mr. Hensarling's amendment. This should have been allowed. This is a hugely important issue. The other side has added a whole new Federal commitment on wind to flood insurance. At the Rules Committee, where I presented the majority request  for an open rule, Mr. Frank stated that he would welcome all amendments that address significant issues. 
   Now, it is the prerogative of the Rules Committee, and we had a great discussion on that at the committee, and it seemed to talk more about SCHIP, but it is the prerogative of the committee to make amendments in order. But when they hear from the chairman of the committee, Financial Services, in this case, they did not follow his suggestion. There was no more significant issue than adding wind to the flood insurance. 
   So I guess that Republicans don't deserve the right to participate in the amendment process, whether it is as a member of the committee of jurisdiction or as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Only through an open rule is that possible. For this reason, I rise in strong opposition to the rule being considered here today.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I would like to express congratulations to the ranking member on her taking over as the ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have always known Chairman Frank to never shy away from a debate. I appreciate his acknowledgement that he would have liked to have had the opportunity to debate the amendments that were not made in order. I know how concerned he was about that and it shows by his vote on the floor. So I really appreciate that. He has always been ready, willing and able to know what the opposition is and their concerns and to debate that. 
   Mr. Chairman, Chairman Frank and I did introduce H.R. 1682 earlier. That was the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007. That was to address the much-needed reforms to NFIP, the Nation's largest single-line property insurance provider. Unfortunately, the legislation before us today, I think, jeopardizes our commitment to enact these reforms because it does couple H.R. 1682 with H.R. 920, which is Representative Taylor's bill. We all know how sincere he is about this much-needed reform. But it does add wind to the National Flood Insurance Program. I really am concerned about this. 
   We had several hearings. Witness after witness testified that adding wind to the flood insurance program was not a good idea. At one of the hearings, adding wind to NFIP, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the insurance experts, environmental groups, floodplain management groups, the Treasury and FEMA all were opposed to such an expansion. 
   In previous Congresses, flood modernization bills virtually identical to H.R. 1682, the Frank-Biggert bill, enjoyed broad, bipartisan support. During the last Congress, the Financial Services Committee considered H.R. 4973, the Act of 2006, which the House passed by a vote of 416-4 on June 27, 2006. 
   But instead of embracing this approach and the recent track record of bipartisanship on NFIP, the other side of the aisle has chosen to introduce this new bill and include language that I think really threatens the passage of necessary reforms to the program. I am disappointed by this action. NFIP needs reform now, not a controversy and costly program expansion. 
   For the majority of its 39-year history, NFIP has been a self-funding program. However, flood insurance claims from the 2005 hurricane season have grown to almost $18 billion, a total greater than all the claims from all the other years combined. Unless the NFIP program is reformed soon, the program will face insolvency. In January, the GAO placed the flood insurance program on its High-Risk Series list, which recommends increased congressional oversight for troubled programs. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, it is clear that NFIP reform is needed now. Therefore, before expanding the NFIP program to include wind, we should keep our commitment to reform NFIP and move H.R. 1682 instead of the bill before us today. The administration has said that if the wind provision is included in this bill, the President will veto it. So adding wind, really, to me, is a poison pill to the flood insurance reform bill and is compromising our efforts to enact much-needed bipartisan reform of the National Flood Insurance Program.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the anniversary of America's staunchest ally in the Middle East, Israel. After 60 years, Israel has proved that a nation that embraces liberty and democracy can flourish in the face of even the strongest adversity. Despite decades of violence and terrorist attacks, the Israeli people have achieved an outstanding level of economic, intellectual, and cultural success. 
   Among its most notable achievements has been its well-earned reputation as a free sanctuary for millions of refugees from around the world. No other nation in the Middle East has embraced a diverse array of oppressed people like Israel. Over the last 60 years, individuals from more than 100 countries have traveled there and found a welcome home. And, as in America, this great diversity has created a vibrant culture, one that I have enjoyed on several occasions. 
   In Israel, I have seen firsthand the impressive contributions Israelis have made to the world in areas from scholarship and engineering to cooking and music. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the people of Israel on this historic achievement. Their efforts have created for America a powerful ally and a dynamic trading partner, and I'm confident that our close relationship will remain strong for many years to come.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (AMENDING THE HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING ACT OF 1991 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas, the ranking member of the Science Committee, for yielding me the time. 
   And I am so pleased to be the cosponsor of this bill that was introduced by my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird). He has been a great member on the Science Committee for several years. This bill may seem familiar to many of my colleagues in the House and for  good reason. In both the 108th and 109th Congresses, we did introduce legislation that would do exactly the same thing as the bill we are considering today with some additions. H.R. 4218 in the 108th Congress and H.R. 28 in the 109th Congress were approved not only overwhelmingly by the Science Committee but by the full House of Representatives.     
   Unfortunately, because of jurisdictional complications, our friends in the other body across the rotunda had never considered this legislation. It had been endorsed by the President's science adviser, Dr. Marburger, several years ago. It is a real shame that it hasn't moved forward, but we are really happy we are, I think, going to have both sides of the aisle work on it this time. 
   At the time when we first introduced the High Performance Computing Revitalization Act in April of 2004, a new Japanese supercomputer, the Earth Simulator, was the fastest supercomputer in the world, a title it held for well over 2 years, from June 2002 through November of 2004. 
   Some experts claimed that Japan was able to produce a computer far ahead of American machines because the U.S. had taken an overly cautious or conventional approach to computing R&D. In hindsight, we see that caution meant lost opportunities. 
   Granted a lot has changed since November of 2004. The U.S. is now home to not only the world's fastest supercomputer, but seven of the 10 fastest, thanks to the hard work and competitive spirit of people at IBM, Cray and Silicon Graphics, as well as the Department of Energy and NSF. 
   But we must retain the leadership and development and use of supercomputers. As confirmed by reports of the Council on Competitiveness and the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee, supercomputers are essential to maintaining U.S. leadership in many scientific fields and have many applications, from pharmaceuticals and climate to national and homeland security. 
   That is why the bill that we are considering today is so important. It is designed to ensure U.S. preeminence and competitiveness in computational science. This bill commits the Federal Government to providing the research community with sustained access to the highest end supercomputers, supporting all aspects of high performance computing, including software development and data management for scientific and engineering applications, and developing and maintaining a road map for computational science in the fields that require it. 
   I am honored to have worked with the chairman of the Research and Science Education Subcommittee, Mr. Baird, on this straightforward, commonsense legislation, and I have good reason to be hopeful that it will pass. As my colleague from Washington has already indicated, we made changes in this bill, simple changes, that would help our colleagues in the other body avoid those jurisdictional problems that they seem to have sometimes that have stymied their consideration of this bill in the past. 
   In closing, I just want to say that this bill will provide researchers in the United States with the computing resources they need to remain world class. Our Nation's scientific enterprise and our economy will be stronger for it. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1068.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (ENERGY TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Hall, for yielding me the time to discuss H.R. 85, the Energy Technology Transfer Act. I would also like to commend my friend and colleague Mr. Baird of Washington for managing this bill, and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Miller) for his hard work on this bill. 
   The provisions in this bill were included in section 11 of H.R. 6203, the Alternative Energy Research and Development Act, which passed the House by voice vote in September of last year. The Federal Government spends billions every year on energy-related research and development at our universities and national laboratories. The result is often new technologies that reduce our consumption of energy or encourage the use of alternative fuels, and thus reduces our dependence on foreign sources of energy. 
   But the biggest challenge to realizing these energy savings is getting these technologies out of the laboratory and into the marketplace where they can benefit all energy end users. Whether we are talking about a business owner, a homeowner, or a county or local government official, these energy end users may be hesitant to embrace advanced or alternative energy technologies with which they may not be familiar, have little experience or which may require new infrastructure. 
   The risk of investing in new energy technologies is just too great compared to conventional energy technologies, and getting information on the latest, greatest energy technologies can just be too costly or time-consuming. 
   That is why section 917 of EPACT of 2005 directed the Department of Energy to create a geographically dispersed network of energy efficient technology  transfer centers. The purpose of these centers is to transfer and provide education on energy efficiency and distribute clean energy technologies developed by DOE and at the national laboratories to energy end users. 
   The bill we are considering today, H.R. 85, the Energy Technology Transfer Act, would simply improve section 917 of EPACT. Instead of creating from scratch this network of centers, H.R. 85 would authorize the DOE to provide grants to and partner with existing community outreach networks. These existing networks could include cooperative extension system offices, State energy offices, local governments, institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations with expertise in energy technologies or outreach. 
   The Cooperative Extension Service and similar community outreach networks have a long and successful history of transferring knowledge about new technologies and techniques to farmers and other constituencies. However, few have the resources to focus on energy efficiency outside of the agriculture center. H.R. 85 would change that and would build on the successful model of the ag extension service without creating any new entity or bureaucracy. 
   H.R. 85 still demands the same requirements of these centers. They must be geographically dispersed; they must coordinate regional resource engineering and business expertise; and they must help apply energy technologies and methods suitable to local climate. But instead of limiting these centers to the transfer of energy technologies, H.R. 85 would expand their mission to include all advanced energy technologies. 
   In addition to requiring grant recipients to demonstrate results or risk losing their grant, H.R. 85 would require grantees to provide feedback to DOE on the research needs related to the production, storage or use of energy identified by energy end users. It would also encourage grant recipients to work with utilities to carry out informational activities for energy end users. 
   H.R. 85 prohibits grant recipients from using grants funding to construct facilities to house the tech transfer center. It doesn't authorize any funding that isn't already authorized in EPACT. In other words, this bill contains no new funding. Instead, it simply gives new guidance and direction to the Secretary about how to bolster the Department's technology transfer capacity. 
   I just want to give you one example from Chicago about how this program might work and its potential to save energy through the deployment of advanced energy technologies. 
   Before expanding their frozen pizza production plant in Woodridge, Illinois, Home Run Inn Pizza consulted with the University of Illinois Chicago's Energy Resource Center. After conducting an assessment of the plant and its operations, the UIC Energy Resource Center identified nine ways Home Run Inn Pizza could reduce their energy consumption and energy costs. Using advanced energy technologies developed as a result of DOE's funded research, Home Run Inn Pizza could reduce natural gas consumption by 13 percent and energy consumption by 5 to 6 percent, saving a total of over $15,000 annually. 
   Because of resource limitations, the UIC Energy Resource Center will help 12 companies in this way in fiscal year 2007, saving each on the average 15 percent of its energy budget and providing a return on investment within 2 years. 
   With passage of H.R. 85, the UIC Energy Resource Center and other cooperative extension and community outreach organizations could add the capacity and expertise to help many, many more companies, building managers, home builders and homeowners use technology to save energy and money. 
   I want to conclude by thanking the bill's chief cosponsor, my friend and colleague from North Carolina (Mr. Miller) for his strong interest in tech transfer and this legislation in particular. As we have worked with the majority to improve this legislation, his input has been invaluable. I also want to thank Chairman Gordon for recognizing the value of this legislation and moving it expeditiously through the committee. I want to thank Ranking Member Hall for his assistance as well. 
   Finally, I want to thank the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges and a long list of its members for their strong support of this bill. This bill represents just a small investment in the tech transfer capabilities we need to help our universities and labs move advanced energy technologies from the labs into the markets so Americans can enjoy the tangible benefits of our Federal investment in R&D. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in reluctant opposition to this massive bailout of Wall Street. I understand why many of my colleagues are inclined to support it; the urge to act now and do something--anything--to restore investor confidence is very compelling.     
   Our economy faces great risks, and I agree wholeheartedly that the government must intervene in some way to restore stability. But the plan that we are considering today is not what my constituents want, it's not what's best for the average American taxpayer, and it's not what's best for this economy. 
   As a member of the working group assigned by GOP Leader BOEHNER to explore alternatives to a massive taxpayer-funded bailout, I was very pleased this weekend when we were able to develop a very realistic, workable alternative option to shore up these mortgage-backed securities. We took a long, hard look at the market and saw that a government-backed insurance plan could go a long way toward returning market value to many of these assets. It would address the market's aversion to these investments, and it would be entirely funded by risk-based premiums leveled on the holders of the assets, not taxpayers. 
   Our premise for this plan was and remains that Wall Street should pay for Wall Street's mistake.  
   In addition, we outlined a tax proposal that would have injected billions into the private market, restoring liquidity and credit available on Main Street America. By temporarily removing the disincentive to repatriate, or bring back to America, profits made by American companies overseas, we could open the floodgates of capital into our marketplace. 
   These are ideas that can work. But instead leaders have only agreed to attach a watered-down version of the insurance proposal to the same $700 billion bailout that the administration originally proposed. It creates an insurance purchase option for financial firms but then offers them the alternative of free taxpayer money. I wonder which one they will take? 
   I'm very pleased that this plan has been improved over the past few days, especially the provisions limiting golden parachutes and allowing the public to share in the profits that may be made. But I am not convinced that we have taken the time to really come up with a strategy that truly protects the taxpayers. 
   Let's take another look. Maybe we should start over. We discussed looking at the S and L crisis. The administration discounted that. Let's go back and look at the FDIC and doing away with mark to marketing. Instead of banks using fair value accounting, the SEC should use true value, giving immediate positive impact on the financial industry. 
   Madam Speaker, we can and should do better. Main Street Americans deserve no less.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the false choice being offered to America on the House floor today. 
   Despite months of pleas from the American people, the Democrat leadership of this House is still trying to dodge the issue of real energy reform. 
   We can't expect this country to break its addiction to foreign oil if we continue to address only half the problem. But that's exactly what this bill does. It includes numerous provisions aimed at boosting conservation. I support them. In fact, I'm the lead Republican cosponsor on a bill that closely mirrors a section of this legislation dealing with clean buildings. I'm also a strong supporter of the development and deployment of renewable and alternative energy technologies like hydrogen, cellulosic ethanol, geothermal, solar and wind. But to call this bill we're considering today a comprehensive energy solution is just plain wrong. 
   Some on the other side of the aisle would have us believe that this bill will open new areas of the Outer Continental Shelf to offshore exploration. Instead, it discourages States from allowing drilling off their shores. By not allowing States to share in the royalties from offshore oil and natural gas exploration, we virtually guarantee that no State would permit production off its coast. 
   In addition, it includes no new refinery capacity, no clean coal, and zero nuclear energy. In my home State of Illinois, we rely on nuclear power for 50 percent of our energy needs. It's safe, carbon-free, and could provide sustainable domestic energy for decades to come. Scientists at our national labs have developed new reprocessing technologies that will allow us to reburn spent nuclear fuel, vastly reducing the toxicity and the volume of waste. With this new process, we can solve the waste problem. 
   Does anything in this bill take advantage of the advances we have made in nuclear power? No. Instead, the bill includes a renewable energy mandate that will raise energy costs for consumers who live in States like Illinois that rely heavily on clean nuclear power. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can do better. Let's work together on the all-of-the-above energy package that embraces long-term energy solutions while also boosting production and conservation to provide near-term relief at the pump.

By requiring owners of mortgage-backed securities to purchase insurance, we put the ball squarely where it belongs, with those who were responsible, not the innocent, hardworking taxpayers. 
   Let's not play the blame game. Let's work together to find a solution. We have a terrible problem here right now. Let's find that solution.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 7081, the United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act. This landmark legislation will ensure India's continued access to safe, clean carbon-free nuclear power while guaranteeing, through international inspections, that India's nuclear ambitions remain peaceful. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have been a strong proponent of nuclear power because it is an efficient and inexpensive way to meet our growing energy needs. In fact, my state of Illinois derives 50% of its power from nuclear energy. In my district, Argonne National Laboratories has been at the cutting edge of the next generation of nuclear power. 
   Most recently, they have helped to develop an advanced nuclear reprocessing technology called UREX, which literally re-burns spent fuel to extract more energy. At the same time, it improves efficiency and vastly reduces the toxicity, volume, and danger of the final waste product. 
   As the global appetite for energy continues to a row, nuclear technology will become increasingly important if we are to meet this unprecedented demand. This agreement will allow India, which has one of the fastest growing economies in the world, access to advanced nuclear technology. Cheap and abundant nuclear power will ensure that their economy can continue to flourish, without the pollution that plagues many other rapidly modernizing nations. 
   This agreement also has built in safeguards to ensure that sensitive nuclear technology is not compromised. India has agreed to prevent any third-parties from accessing their nuclear technology and to allow international inspectors into 14 nuclear sites around the country to enforce this agreement. These provisions will ensure that sensitive nuclear info does not end up in the hands of terrorists or rogue nations that would seek to do us harm. 
   The United States and India have a long history of cooperation stretching back over half a century, and I am pleased that we can continue this productive partnership. I urge all of my colleagues to support this historic legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, I'd like to start out on a positive note, but I guess I must say that I'm disappointed about the bill, the way it is as we're considering it today. 
   While the bill has improved since its introduction, I had hoped that we could take up the same bipartisan FHA Modernization Bill, H.R. 5121, that passed House last year. And since we've been talking about it, I might say it was cosponsored by 54 Republicans and 51 Democrats and one Independent, so it was a good bill and a bipartisan compromise that was agreed to by Chairman Waters, Chairman Frank, and then Chairman Mike Oxley.  
   And given the overwhelming vote, and the exact number was 415-7 for last year's bill, I had hoped that we could take it up and move it quickly to the floor. But instead we have two bills this year. We have the bill, H.R. 1752, which I introduced, which was identical to last year's bipartisan bill, and we have Chairman Waters' bill. And so I think we're today considering a new bill with new provisions that are not bipartisan, and I think it has delayed the FHA modernization and will serve fewer borrowers than last year's bill. But it's an important bill. 
   There are some key differences between these bills. There is one that has caused the greatest concern for me and many of my colleagues, and that is the inclusion of a provision in H.R. 1852 that creates a funding placeholder and siphons off FHA funds to a brand-new government trust fund. And it's admirable, affordable housing. We all want affordable housing in all forms, whether it's section 8, whether it's public housing, whether it's FHA modernization. But I think that taking the funds out of FHA and using them for a purpose unrelated to its core mission of the FHA would threaten the solvency of the FHA fund and its ability to pay off the insurance claims. And we are reaching a crisis there, where we are going to have to have some credit influx into the FHA fund. So we'll hear more discussion on that during the consideration of Mr. Hensarling's amendment during this debate. 
   So it's my hope that we can work together to address Members' concerns through the amendment process so that a modernized FHA bill can help assist more low- and moderate-income Americans in buying and keeping their homes. 
   I'd like to just briefly talk about and thank Chairman Waters for offering a specific provision in this manager's amendment. The chairwoman's original draft only permitted first-time home buyers to participate in new low- and no down payment loan programs. But the amendment under consideration corrects that and mirrors the provision in the FHA modernization bill that allows any FHA qualified borrower to participate in the new FHA low and no down payment loan program. So clearly, the FHA has a role to play in the solution to this country's rising foreclosure rate. 
   And as I think I said on April 19, during our first committee hearing on this, this bill, one of the most important things that Congress can do, as we search for ways to help those that have been harmed by the subprime market, is to give FHA the tools it needs to be a viable alternative for the first-time and low-income borrowers. 
   And then I'd like to address an issue that Chairman Frank did bring up, and even though he's not on the floor. But the legislation that I have included another bipartisan agreement last year, and that was the automatic reduction of annual premiums in FHA to no more than 55 basis points for loans that remain active after 5 years. And automatic premium reductions can be a good thing. They can reduce refinancing and perhaps some defaults and foreclosures as well. 
   In contrast, I think that the Franks-Waters bill requires the refund of excess upfront premiums charged to higher-risk borrowers, those with FICO scores under 560. So I'm concerned that this provision would have the unintended consequences of limiting the number of borrowers that could be served by the FHA program because it requires initial premiums to be even higher. And I think that the refund provision would also be very difficult to implement. 
   This is an insurance program. And when you have car insurance, you don't get a refund if you don't have an accident. You might have your rate lowered, which is what was in the former bill. So I think that that is an issue that he talked about that I wanted to clarify. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   In closing, I would really like to thank Subcommittee Chairwoman Waters for her work on this bill. I am pleased that the FHA modernization bill is moving forward, and I think that the bill that we will vote on today is much improved from the original draft as a result of constructive input from Members from both sides of the aisle. It contains many bipartisan provisions that I support and still contains a few provisions that I do not support. But it is my hope that the provision siphoning money away from the fund will be struck and that true risk-based pricing will be implemented so that FHA can serve the maximum number of borrowers possible. But those arguments have been made and have been rejected by the majority, so it is my sincere hope that we can further improve the bill as it continues to move through the legislative process. 
   As I understand it, the Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to mark up its version of FHA reform tomorrow. So unlike last year, it appears that FHA reform is gaining traction in the Senate, and I hope that we can move this bill beyond the House during this Congress and that the Senate and the administration will work with us to reform this important program.     
   I think American families deserve a 21st-century FHA program to have a safe and secure mortgage product as an alternative to the dangerous products offered by predatory lenders. Qualified American families looking to keep their homes and refinance their bad mortgages, many of which are currently in default, deserve to do so through a modernized FHA. 
   Again, I look forward to our continued work. And I would like to thank Chairman Waters so much. You know, as I leave as ranking member of this subcommittee and go over to the financial institutions, I do with some remorse. I really have enjoyed working with the subcommittee chairman on this committee, and the times that we have spent. I will still be on the committee, but won't have the opportunity to sit together and make some decisions. And I really have enjoyed every minute of it, the trip to New Orleans and Mississippi, as well as working on these bills with her. So I thank you so much. I also thank Chairman Frank. I think he has worked so hard on this committee. 
   I kind of think I will miss it because it certainly has been the most active committee I think in Congress this year. Never did I dream that we would have at least three hearings a week and two markups and all the things that have gone on. But I think you've made great progress in the housing field, and I appreciate both of you for your concern and your passion for housing and making sure that low-income families will be able to meet their American Dream. 
   With that, Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Chairman, I recognize myself for 1 minute. 
   I really believe in the concept of this. I think that there are a lot of high-cost areas that will really benefit from this. I hope that this will not hurt some of the low-cost areas; in other words, I think that the administration has said something about the fact that some of the areas across the country would be hurt and would lower, go below the $419,000 limit.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Chairman, I have some concerns about what we would call unintended consequences. I am a big supporter of financial literacy, and I chair the caucus. It is so important home buyers know what they are getting into, and I think that counseling is very important. I think that if we have an educated home buyer, we might not see so many of these foreclosures or near foreclosures or bankruptcy with the counseling. 
   My concern is the mandatory counseling for FHA, and only because of something that has happened in Illinois, that happened in Chicago when this mandatory counseling was put in for FHA mortgages. 
   What happened was that the lenders withdrew from the area. It was put in first by a ZIP Code in the city of Chicago and then put in for all of Cook County. The lenders withdrew from the area so there were no mortgages or very few available for those in that area because they weren't able to get the counseling that was needed in time to get the mortgages. 
   It takes time for counseling, and I know that you put in, and I think this would help, is that people could get counseling on the Internet. I think it is a very important thing. I just worry about when it is mandatory that we are going to have less availability of FHA involvement than when it is discretionary as in the bill. 
   I think that it makes FHA less attractive. If you are a prospective home buyer and one lender, a non-FHA, offers to put you into a mortgage that day while the FHA loan requires you to go through a counseling course, which will you pick? People will leave FHA, and we don't want that to happen. I know it is important that we have counseling and get people into this type of loan. The whole thing is, FHA is much better than the more exotic subprime loans, and that is the whole focus of this bill. I would hope that we can promote FHA, and I hope as this amendment moves forward, we can take a look at.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   My amendment strikes the bill in its entirety and inserts language that is identical to last year's bipartisan FHA modernization bill, H.R. 5121. Last year the bill had 54 Republicans, 51 Democrats, and one1 Independent cosponsor. Last year the bill was the bipartisan compromise that was agreed to by Chairman Waters and Chairman Frank and then chairman Mike Oxley. Last year's bill passed the House by a vote of 415-7 on July 25, 2006. 
   There are differences in the bills. This amendment, last year's bipartisan bill, I would like to highlight a couple of important differences. The Frank-Waters bill authorizes the FHA to implement risk-based pricing, but leaves in place the current, I think, outdated premium caps. My concern is that these limits on the premium caps will prevent FHA from serving riskier borrowers who could be prudently served by charging a slightly higher premium. 
   With the flexibility to charge slightly higher premiums, FHA would be able to serve borrowers with lower FICO scores who are currently being served only by the subprime market at very high interest rates. Just like last year's bipartisan House-passed bill, my amendment modernizes and updates premium caps, enabling FHA to reach down and serve riskier borrowers, but in a prudent manner. I think this is where growth comes in, because there will be more loans that FHA will be able to make. 
   Second, the Frank-Waters bill requires the refund of excess upfront premiums charged to higher-risk borrowers, those with FICO scores below 560. I am concerned that this new provision may treat your higher initial premiums and unintentionally limit the number of borrowers that could be served by FHA. 
   A refund provision also would be difficult to implement. Perhaps most importantly, refunds like this undercut the very concept of insurance. It is the logical equivalent of a healthy person requesting a 100 percent refund of his or her health insurance premium, or a driver who doesn't get into an accident demanding all of his car insurance back. 
   Just like last year's House-passed bill, my amendment includes another bipartisan agreement, the automatic reduction of annual premiums to no more than 55 base points for loans, and remains active after 5 years. Automatic premium reductions can be a good thing. They can reduce refinancing and perhaps some defaults and foreclosures as well. 
   Finally, the most significant difference between the bill I have introduced and the Frank-Waters FHA reform proposal, which has been of great concern to me and many of my colleagues, is the inclusion of a provision that creates a funding placeholder that you have heard talked about so much today that siphons off the FHA funds to create a brand-new government trust fund. 
   The other provisions that I mentioned are ones that represent significant differences between our introduced bills. Using FHA program funds to create a housing trust fund, to me, is where we have the most difference, and I believe it is not an appropriate use of FHA funds. Taking funds out of FHA and using them for a purpose unrelated to its core mission would threaten the solvency of the FHA fund and its ability to pay out the insurance claims. We don't want to have to come back here and do a bailout because FHA funds were diverted for other projects. 
   There is general agreement on the need for FHA modernization legislation. By modernizing FHA with my amendment, we can expand FHA and give a viable alternative to more low-income borrowers who may otherwise lose their home or be forced into the higher-cost subprime loans, or even predatory products. It is true that FHA cannot help all homeowners that are in the red, but it may help a good portion of them. 
   I would urge my colleagues to support my amendment, last year's bipartisan bill, the House-passed bill that many of my colleagues supported last year. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Chairman, we could have passed this bill 9 months ago, and then we would have added on to it. Unfortunately, this is my opportunity to do it, and this is the bill that I have had. I bring it up now. 
   As I said before, there are good things that have come out in the discussion today; there are some good things that have been added onto the bill that you have brought forward. The reason for bringing this up is I have some real concerns about some of the things that are in there, and this is my opportunity. 
   I don't think that we are penalizing low-income people that much. I know that in the discussion that we had in committee when this came up about no down payment, there are people that can't afford a mortgage with no down payment and can meet the monthly payments, but there was no risk with those people, no premium for FHA to ensure that kind of mortgage. 
   That isn't fair for other people that based on their credit scores are having to pay a premium. I would just disagree. If you are able to always meet those, then the risk should be dependent on what you do, not what somebody else does either. I would agree with that. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Chairman, just because someone is low income does not mean that they have poor credit. I think that is not where they are going to have to pay higher premiums, necessarily. It is inevitable in an insurance fund that lower-risk borrowers will subsidize higher-risk borrowers. Refunds of the nature that is in your bill would undercut the concept of insurance, as I said before, being the equivalent of a healthy person requiring a percent refund of his or her insurance premium, or a driver that does not get into an accident requiring their insurance back. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Chairman, looking at the two bills, let's look at flexibility risk-based premiums. H.R. 1752 permits upfront or annual premiums or both. Premium rates may vary over loan term if basis for change is determined at origination. 
   Under your bill, the same: requires annual report on risk-based premiums and how they were determined, authorizes premiums based on product risk. 
   The maximum upfront premium amounts, H.R. 1752: 3 percent, or 1.5 percent if annual premium is at its maximum. Under your bill, 2.25 percent for standard-risk and higher-risk mortgages, 3.0 for zero and lower down mortgages for first-time buyers. And then the maximum annual premium amounts in H.R. 1752, 2.0, or 1.0 if upfront premium is at its maximum. Under yours, 0.55 percent for standard and high-risk mortgages, 0.75 for zero down mortgages. And then the limit on premium charged for certain mortgages. If a borrower has 3 percent cash contribution and a score of 560 or more, the upfront premium is limited to 2.25 percent and the annual 0.55 percent. And then, under your bill it is included by creation of the standard-risk and higher-risk mortgage categories. 
   I guess we disagree on this, but I think I want the same thing. I want FHA to be used. I want it to be used for low-income, first-time home buyers and those that are trying to refinance. This is critical right now, and I just think there is some differences in what we have. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

It is self-funded and it is an insurance program. Now, we haven't been able to use it because it has been so capped in the amount of what they can do.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to this rule governing the consideration of H.R. 1852, the Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007. 
   I had hoped that the committee would see the wisdom in providing an open rule to this important legislation; and in the absence of an open rule, that it would at least make in order those amendments that the Members took the time and effort to draft, including one of my own amendments. Unfortunately, only some of the amendments filed with the Rules Committee were made in order. 
   While I'm pleased that some of these amendments made in order are Republican amendments, other amendments which were offered and debated during our committee markup of this bill were not made in order. These amendments deserve to be debated and given a fair hearing. 
   Mr. Speaker, last year FHA's modernization bill, which passed the House by a vote of 415-7, garnered broad bipartisan support. This year's bill does not have that kind of support. I am pleased that the majority has edged closer to last year's bipartisan bill since the introduction of the new bill under consideration today. 
   As I pointed out during our committee hearing and markup on this bill, the bill originally excluded homeowners seeking to refinance from benefiting from a modernized FHA. The bill will now assist more homeowners, perhaps some seeking to refinance a bad subprime loan, but still not as many as last year's bill. 
   I continue to object to provisions that do not fully allow for risk-based pricing. Again, witnesses during our committee hearings said this would result in FHA serving fewer, not more, American borrowers. I also remain opposed to the provision that siphons money away from FHA to fund a brand-new government program, another trust fund, to build more affordable housing. While this is a very important issue, affordable housing, what we need here is to have FHA money to help those that are in trouble, facing foreclosure, or those first-time borrowers who would not be able to find a good mechanism to find a mortgage. 
   During committee deliberations, we were given the opportunity to debate and consider a variety of issues pertaining to this bill. Members on our side of the aisle had hoped that all Members, not just those on the Financial Services Committee, would be given the same opportunity to debate important issues on the House floor. 
   Republicans support many aspects of this bill, H.R. 1852; but I think we all deserve the right to participate in the amendment process, whether as a member of the committee of jurisdiction, or as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Only through an open rule is that possible. For this reason, I rise in opposition to the rule being considered today and urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to bid a fond farewell to a long-time member of my district staff, Pat Salberg. Pat recently retired after 23 years of dedicated service to the people of Illinois' 13th Congressional District. 
   Having served as a caseworker on the staff of my predecessor, Representative Harris Fawell, Pat was kind enough to agree to stay with my office--only temporarily, she said--to aid the transition. That was 10 years ago. 
   It seems her retirement plans just kept getting pushed back by an untiring love of helping others. From seniors with Social Security questions to a homeless mom looking for shelter for her child, Pat never hesitated to go above and beyond to find a solution for those in need. 
   Were you to ask her colleagues about it, they would tell you that her love for others is rivaled only by her love of animals, both cuddly and otherwise. In fact, members of my staff in the district are to this day forbidden from stepping on spiders or other insects that might be roaming around the office. Pat insisted that they be scooped up to safety and set free outside. 
   One time she even tried to save a live lobster that someone had unwittingly given her as a gift. Pat didn't rest until it had been set free in a co-worker's pond. 
   Needless to say, it is little surprise to any of us who know Pat that Pat plans to spend some of her newly acquired free time volunteering at the Brookfield Zoo. I expect she will also spend more time gardening and playing bridge with friends. 
   Madam Speaker, Pat is a wonderful colleague and will always remain a part of our team in the 13th Congressional District. As she turns to new, more leisurely pursuits in life, I would like to wish her good health and great happiness. I know her two daughters, Wendy and Debbie, as well as her grandchildren, Megan, Scott, and Collin, will be glad to have Pat around even more. And I thank them for letting us borrow her for as long as they did. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Pat Salberg for all she has done for the community and for me. We will miss her dearly.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill, H.R. 2669, the so-called College Cost Reduction Act. Like many of my colleagues, I have serious concerns about the new mandatory spending that is included in this legislation. H.R. 2669 creates nine new entitlement programs, most of which do not attempt to address the hurdles many prospective and current college students face. 
   Mandatory spending entitlement programs already consume the largest portion of the Federal budget. The uncontrolled growth of entitlement programs, particularly Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, will eventually consume the entire Federal budget by 2050 if left unchecked. That means the Federal Government would have no available funds for programs other than entitlements; no militaries, highways, courts, law enforcement or border security. 
   So how are we addressing this looming crisis today? Well, it seems we are addressing it by creating new entitlement programs, nine of them. The new programs created under this legislation will not undergo the annual scrutiny of the appropriations process. Regardless of the success or failure of these programs, the American taxpayer, our constituents, will continue to pay for these new programs available to anyone that meets the basic qualifications. 
   Another serious concern is that some of the mandatory spending in H.R. 2669 is directed towards colleges, universities and philanthropic organizations. Traditionally entitlement programs have been directed at individuals who are in need of the Federal assistance, such as Medicare, Social Security, food stamps and student loans. Directing the mandatory funding under this legislation to institutions, instead of low- and middle-income students who need the assistance most, sends the wrong message about the priorities of this Congress. 
   During the Education and Labor Committee markup, I supported a substitute amendment offered by Mr. McKeon that would have invested $12 billion in the Pell Grant program, more than double the increase provided by this bill. It also reduced the PLUS loan interest rates for the Federal Family Education Loan Program to match the interest rate in the Direct Loan Program, currently 7.9 percent. The funding provided under the McKeon substitute would have been directed to those who need the assistance most, the students, without creating new programs and additional bureaucracy for students and parents to navigate. 
   Finally, I have concerns about maintaining the viability of the FFELP. In the last Congress, the Education and Workforce Committee made $20 billion in changes to FFELP by eliminating and reducing Federal subsidies to lenders. Just 2 years later, we are back again squeezing student loan lenders. My concern is this legislation is using the reconciliation process as a backdoor attempt to kill FFELP. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that I have to oppose the rule and this legislation. There are a few provisions in this legislation that I believe would help college students and address some concerns in areas of academic need.     
   However, I cannot support a bill that creates new mandatory spending for institutions at a time when we are addressing the looming crisis with our existing entitlement programs for individuals. I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule and against H.R. 2669.

   On March 31, 2007, the University of Wyoming Cowgirls basketball team defeated the University of Wisconsin by a score of 72-56 to capture the NIT title and conclude their most successful season in school history. 
   Led by junior Hanna Zaveckz, the tournament MVP, and junior Jodi Bolerjack, who scored 16 points in the championship game, the Cowgirls of Wyoming truly had a remarkable season in which they compiled a record of 27-9, finishing second in the Mountain West Conference. 
   The tournament title capped what ended up being the most successful season ever for the Cowgirls basketball team in school history. No Wyoming Cowgirls team had won as many games. The previous record was set by the 1978-79 team, which finished at 25-7, and no team ever advanced so far in postseason play. 
   As the State's sole 4-year educational institution, the University of Wyoming receives strong support from the State and its residents, making it the perfect place for a great learning environment. The university was recently ranked by the Princeton Review as one of the Nation's best colleges for 2006, and the College of Business Department of Economics and Finance was also ranked 10th in the Nation and 12th in the world for its program in resource and environmental economics. 
   I extend my congratulations to head coach Joe Legerski, athletic director Tom Berman, president Tom Buchanan, all of the hard-working players, the fans and to the University of Wyoming. 
   I'm happy to join my good friend and colleague Representative Cubin in honoring this exceptional team and all the accomplishments, and wish all involved continued success.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 561, recognizing the 20th anniversary of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. 
   Since 1987, McKinney-Vento has served as the foundation of a cohesive national strategy against homelessness. In addition to housing, McKinney-Vento includes vital programs that address the nutritional, health care, and educational needs of the less fortunate. 
   As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I have spent a great deal of time examining the unique obstacles that exist for runaway, homeless, and other disconnected youth, and I have seen first-hand the devastating impact that lost educational opportunities can have on the lives of homeless youth. Unfortunately, for many of these children, school is the only source of stability in their lives. 
   That is why in 2001 I introduced the McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Act, a bill that ensures homeless children have access to immediate enrollment without the barriers and red tape that had too often kept them out of school. My view was, and remains, that being without a home should not mean being without an education. I am pleased to report that Congress agreed and we were able to get this bill incorporated into the No Child Left Behind Act, signed into law in 2002. 
   Following the tragic hurricanes of Katrina and Rita, the Education for Homeless Children and Youth programs in NCLB were put to the test and proved crucial to providing much-needed stability and vital services to those in need. Because programs like McKinney-Vento were already in place, the Federal Government was better prepared to meet the educational and social needs of displaced children during a time of national crisis. 
   Perhaps most importantly, this anniversary is an opportunity to call attention to the work that still remains to be done, work like tearing down barriers that prevent unaccompanied homeless youth from attending school. 
   In this spirit, I would like to invite my colleagues to join me in supporting a vital piece of legislation that will do just that, H.R. 601, the FAFSA Fix for Homeless Kids Act. This important bill, which was introduced along with my good friend from Texas, Congressman Hinojosa, will ensure that the doors of higher education remain open for some of our Nation's most vulnerable youth. At no additional cost to taxpayers, this bill simply ensures that unaccompanied homeless youth are not required to submit a parent's financial information to qualify for Federal student aid. While these requirements are logical for most applicants, they create insurmountable barriers for unaccompanied homeless youth who cannot supply these records. 
   As a member of the Financial Services and Education and Labor Committees, I look forward to working with my colleagues on other important policy initiatives like reauthorizing the McKinney-Vento programs under HUD and NCLB. As we move forward on these items in the coming months, we must join together to ensure that addressing the needs of America's homeless remains a top priority. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my good friend and distinguished colleague from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) for introducing this resolution and for his dedication to improving the lives of homeless Americans. I would also like to thank Mr. Frank and Mr. Bachus for cosponsoring this resolution and helping to move it through the Financial Services Committee in such a timely and bipartisan way. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution and urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to congratulate the Hinsdale Central Red Devils on winning the Illinois State Team Badminton Championship. 
   At a tournament last weekend hosted by Eastern Illinois University, Central scored a hard-fought victory over a tough field of competitors, including the very talented second-place winners from Hinsdale South. 
   Led by Karishma Kollipara, who won her third State singles championship, the team racked up a total of 14 points for a two-point margin of victory. This marks the first time that Central has won the State team championship in badminton, and follows on the heels of a second place finish in 2004, fifth place in 2006, and sixth place in 2007. 
   In addition to Karishma, teammates Katie Cortopassi, Melissa Moucka, Jessica Petrie, Alex Ward, and Julie Ziolkowski all helped to bring home the trophy through their outstanding play in both singles and doubles. And guiding them to the championship were Coach Carissa Niemann and Assistant Coach Courtney Wallace. 
   Mr. Speaker, the competitive and team-oriented spirit of these champions is a credit to Hinsdale Central and to Illinois. They worked and played hard all season to become the best in the State, and last Saturday they proved to be just that. 
   Once again I congratulate the Red Devils on this historic achievement and wish them continued success in the years to come.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentlelady for her comments, and I would yield myself time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the author of H.R. 3018, the Family Self-Sufficiency Act, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   First, let me thank Congresswoman Waters for working with me to include the language of this bill in the section  8 reform bill, H.R. 1851, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Bill Act of 2007, which the House passed on July 12 of last year by a vote of 333-83. 
   Not to anyone's great surprise, the Senate has yet to take up this larger section 8 reform package. My hope is that the House will pass this bill today, and the Senate will, at a minimum, move this smaller but very important noncontroversial bill. 
   The bill will strengthen the Family Self-Sufficiency Program, or FSS, and help more disadvantaged families gain independence from government assistance. The FSS is offered in connection with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program. It provides homeownership counseling, job training, child care, education and other services to help individuals obtain work. 
   Let me take just a minute to give you just one example of a Family Self-Sufficiency Program success story from my congressional district. Angela, a single mother of two from Willowbrook, Illinois, served 6 years in the Navy. When she finished her service, she got a part-time job and, thanks to the GI Bill, enrolled as a full-time student. Yet she still struggled to make ends meet. 
   In stepped the wonderful team at the DuPage Housing Authority. Through their Family Self-Sufficiency Program, they helped Angela with the rent for a dozen months, moving her and her two children from tenant-based rental assistance to the Housing Choice Voucher Program. During this time Angela was able to complete college and obtain a degree with a double degree in human resources management and psychology. 
   The FSS program then connected Angela to a resume-writing class offered by the Illinois Employment Training Center. Within just 1 week of posting her new, polished resume, Angela secured three interviews and a new part-time job. 
   This March, Angela secured full-time employment as a human resource assistant at the Edward Hines VA Hospital. Angela now earns twice the hourly wage she did when she started working with the FSS program. But the story doesn't end there. 
   FSS also connected Angela with a financial planner who helped empower Angela with a little financial literacy to improve her budgeting and asset management skills. Today, Angela is working to prepare herself for homeownership, a long way to come from public housing. 
   Now, Angela is also giving back. She is an active member of the FSS program in DuPage County, providing insights and suggestions to help keep the program relevant and effective for local participants. 
   Even amidst record-high energy prices and other challenges facing our economy, there are bright stars like Angela who, with a little help, can successfully make ends meet, raise children, get an education, secure a job and achieve the dream of homeownership. 
   What better way to help more of our neighbors in need than to support this bill today. It's a simple, bipartisan step that we can now take to ensure that a brief period of economic hardship doesn't turn into a lifetime of poverty and dependence for many of our Nation's most vulnerable families. 
   It does so by addressing the lack of consistent Federal funding for administering FSS services. The bill establishes a minimum ratio of program coordinators to participants, with funding for one coordinator per housing authority, serving an annual average of 25 or more families enrolled in FSS, two coordinators for 75 or more families, and three coordinators for 125 or more families. 
   It also requires HUD to establish and implement performance measures, collect data on FSS programs, evaluate their effectiveness, and report to Congress on its findings. Finally, the bill provides some funding flexibility to reward innovative and successful FSS programs. 
   These are good, flexible programs that help put disadvantaged families on the path to independence. Public housing can be an important safety net, but it is not a permanent solution. Let's give these individuals all the support we can to help them stand on their own two feet. 
   Before I conclude, I would like to thank John Day, president of the DuPage Housing Authority; Jeffrey Lubell, executive director of the Center for Housing Policy; and the folks at the American Association of Service Coordinators, the National Housing Conference, the New America Foundation, and the Corporation for Enterprise Development, for making this bill a reality. 
   I would, of course, like to thank Angela for her courage and willingness to let me share her success story with all of you today. 
   I would also like to thank the gentlelady from Wisconsin for managing this bill and all the hard work that she puts into the Financial Services Committee. 
   With that, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (PROVIDING NEW EFFECTIVE DATE FOR APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF LAW -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 188, introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone). This bill will provide a new effective date for certain provisions in Public Law 105-331. It is a simple bill and it is simple to describe. 
   Passage will allow the Edison Tower Museum in Edison, New Jersey, an extension until the end of June to raise private funds. These funds will match the roughly $380,000 in surcharges due from the sale of coins as part of the Thomas Alva Edison Commemorative Coin Act of 2004. 
   As a result of some miscommunications and, frankly, a lack of clarity in materials, the United States Mint provided the Edison Memorial Tower Corporation regarding statutory requirements, this brief extension is necessary. It will allow the corporation time to raise private sector matching funds and thus claim the surcharges from the sale of the coins. 
   The situation is now cleared up and the Mint has corrected the documentation and all concerned agree that a brief extension of the statutory 2-year timeline is both reasonable and a practical and fair way to deal with the situation. 
   The matching fund requirements were part of sensible reforms to the commemorative coin program enacted in the 104th Congress at the behest of the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle). They are an important safeguard against misuse of the commemorative coin program. This modest extension creates no precedent for future surcharge recipients who fail to raise the required funds in a timely fashion, and is merely a brief pause to allow satisfaction of the statute. 
   This is a good bill, one that passed the House in November of 2006 by voice vote but was not acted upon by the other body. I urge its immediate passage. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE TO INSURE HOME EQUITY CONVERSION MORTGAGES -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 391, legislation that would temporarily remove the cap on the number of home equity conversion mortgages that may be insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's FHA program. I would like to thank my colleagues, Congressman Jim Matheson, and Congresswoman Ginny Brown-Waite, for introducing this important bill. 
   This legislation is similar to H.R. 2892, the Reverse Mortgages to Help America's Seniors Act, which was approved by the House by voice vote in the previous Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, this legislation would enable senior homeowners to  continue to tap into an important source of cash, the equity in their own homes. Nicknamed ``reverse mortgages,'' these HECMs allow Americans age 62 and older to maintain financial independence while staying in their own homes. 
   The reverse mortgage is a unique loan that allows seniors who are homeowners to convert part of the equity in their homes into tax-free income without having to sell their home, give up title, or take on new mortgage payments. 
   The funds collected from a reverse mortgage can be used for whatever needs a senior may have, including home repairs, health care costs, debts or simple daily living expenses. 
   Instead of making monthly payments to the lender, as with a regular or forward mortgage, the senior can receive payments or a payment from the lender. Under the reverse mortgage, senior homeowners can receive a lump sum, fixed monthly payments, a line of credit or a combination of the three, depending on their individual situations. 
   The program ensures that the reverse mortgage is paid back when they move or when they pass away, and the homeowner will never owe more than the house is worth. 
   With a reverse mortgage, senior homeowners who are house rich but cash poor can access cash for their needs while keeping their homes. 
   When the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program was initially made permanent, the number of such loans that the FHA program could handle at any given time was capped so that HUD and Congress could determine the safety and soundness of the program. 
   Nearly 10 years later, we now know the program is successful. In my home State of Illinois alone, the number of FHA-insured reverse mortgages has nearly doubled since 2004 to just short of 2,000 in 2006. 
   With the removal of the cap, more seniors will be able to put the equity in their homes to work for them. 
   Under this bill, the cap only will be removed through February 15, as was noted. It is my hope that by temporarily removing this cap, which currently limits the number of outstanding loans to 275,000, another measure that we will consider later could expand the removal further, eventually leading to a permanent fix. 
   According to the AARP, a leading supporter of this bill, only the complete removal of the volume cap will prevent the possibility of detrimental program disruptions in the future. 
   Living in the home that may have seen the raising of children and the joy of grandchildren should be an option for seniors well into retirement. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill that will protect the ability of seniors to stay in their homes and provide them with economic security. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, in closing let me just say that the number of elderly people in America continues to rise, and with advances in health care and technology seniors will continue to represent a larger percentage of the population. It is important that these citizens have as many economic resources as possible to support them in the future. 
   Further, studies show that given the chance seniors overwhelmingly desire to live out their lives in their own homes. The reverse mortgage is an important tool that can help in addressing the needs of seniors today and in the years to come. 
   I thank the gentleman from Utah for introducing this bill, and I thank the gentleman from Georgia for managing the bill. I urge support of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the goals of International  Women's Day. This is a day that not only recognizes the struggles women and girls have faced and continue to face throughout the world, but also celebrates their significant advancements and achievements. 
   Founded in the United States in the early 1900's, International Women's Day has grown to be recognized throughout the world each year on March 8th: from Australia, to Singapore, to Afghanistan, to Chile. This year alone, there are 269 International Women's Day events scheduled around the globe, with 44 occurring in the United States. 
   Since the inception of International Women's Day, women have made considerable progress throughout the world. A vast majority of women now have the right to vote. There currently are eleven women heads of state and 27 women presiding over national assemblies across the globe--including NANCY PELOSI, the first female Speaker of the U.S. House. 
   Some of women's most notable legislative successes here at home include: securing the right to vote in 1920; passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963; Title IX in 1972; and the Violence Against Women Act in 1994. 
   Despite these significant achievements, women in the United States and throughout the world still face obstacles to full equality. Women and girls are more likely to be illiterate, impoverished and a victim of domestic violence. Additionally, the U.S. Department of State estimates that every year, 800,000 to 900,000 people are victims of trafficking--most of them are women and girls. 
   I stand here today--in solidarity with women and girls around the globe--to bring attention to International Women's Day. It is important to recognize and celebrate the obstacles women have surmounted on the road to equality. Additionally, I hope to bring attention to the inequalities that we still face, so that we can continue to break down gender barriers in the hope that we can one day eradicate gender inequality.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (RECONNECTING HOMELESS YOUTH ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the lead Republican sponsor of H.R. 5524, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008. I am pleased to be here with my good friend the gentleman from Kentucky, Congressman John Yarmuth, as we consider this important bill reauthorizing and strengthening the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, set to expire this year. 
   Mr. Speaker, each year, between 1 and 3 million children in the United States find themselves on their own and on the street. Throughout our Nation, local shelters, like NCO Youth & Family Services and Aunt Martha's in my district rely on Federal support to keep these children safe and off the streets. 
   Congress first enacted the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act in 1974 and has regularly reauthorized it to ensure a basic level of support for unaccompanied youth. To meet the needs of these children, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act authorizes three major programs: The Basic Center Program, the Transitional Living Program and the Street Outreach Program. 
   The Basic Center Program, or BCP, provides youth with emergency short-term shelter, food, clothing, counseling and referrals for health care. The BCP seeks to reunite young people with their families whenever possible or to locate appropriate alternative placements. In 2006, BCP grantees served more than 48,000 youth. 
   The Transitional Living Program, or TLP, assists older homeless youth in  developing skills and resources to promote their independence and prevent future dependency on social services. In 2006, TLP grantees provided services to more than 3,600 youth. 
   The Street Outreach Program provides emergency shelter and related services to young people who have been or are at the risk of being sexually abused or exploited. The goal of these efforts is to inform young people about services that can help them find suitable housing and address the problems that lead them to be on the street.     
   In 2006, the Street Outreach Program served over 619,000 youth. The bill before us today reauthorizes the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act through fiscal year 2013. Under the bill, the Department of Health and Human Services would establish grantee performance standards and provide a periodic estimate of the incidence of youth homelessness. 
   H.R. 5524 also creates a National Homeless Youth Awareness Campaign that will focus on increasing awareness about the issues facing runaway and homeless youth and the tools available for preventing runaway and homeless youth situations. 
   While the prevalence of homelessness is difficult to measure, it is estimated that about 5 to nearly 8 percent of youth experience homelessness each year. More can and must be done. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act will strengthen Federal efforts to keep our children safe and off the street. 
   I would like to take a moment to share the story of one of these kids, Dennis, a constituent of mine, whose life changed as a result of one of these programs strengthened in this bill, the Transitional Living Program. As a senior in high school, Dennis began to isolate himself from family and friends. He was diagnosed with a bipolar disorder, and even though he was prescribed medicine, he didn't take it. According to Dennis, he felt ``walled off to a point where it just crushes in on you, it was like someone turned off the switch. It was very, very difficult to see joy.'' 
   After months of bitterly fighting with his parents, Dennis packed up his car and ran away. He stayed on the couch of friends and family for the remainder of his senior year in high school and continued to deteriorate. 
   Fortunately, that year, Dennis learned of the NCO Youth and Family Services Transitional Living Program, and he decided to use it for housing. He needed a place to stay. But the program was not just housing, it taught him to manage his disorder, as well as training and managing, budget, cooking and cleaning, monitoring his credit, applying for a job, securing transportation and locating an apartment. 
   The program helped Dennis secure a job, giving him the hope and determination to make something of himself. After successful completion of the Transitional Living Program, where is he now? Well, Dennis is an Army private serving honorably in Kuwait. 
   According to Dennis, without the program, he would be half dead now. He says, ``If I hadn't come to NCO, I think I wouldn't have made it.'' 
   Because of the stories like this and the success that we have seen, I am really proud to join Mr. Yarmuth, my fellow sponsor, in support of this bill. This bill is about helping homeless children, and I strongly support it and urge its passage. 
   We need to start thinking about how to help families facing the prospect of homelessness because they are being squeezed by high energy prices, rising prices for gasoline needed to get to and from a job, for the food needed to feed their families and even for natural gas to keep their homes warm in the winter and for electricity needed to keep them cool in the summer, we are putting enormous pressure on the American families that can least afford it. 
   In addition to helping homeless kids, this Congress must take action to increase the supply of oil, reduce the price of gasoline and support the development of advanced energy technologies and alternatives to oil and gas. 
   Just this past weekend, the national average price of gasoline hit $4 a gallon for the first time. Well, I can assure you that for my constituents in the Chicago area, $4 for gas would be moving in the right direction. We have been paying well over $4 a gallon for weeks. 
   While I urge my colleagues to support this bill today, I also urge this House to take action to address the high price of energy generally and gasoline in particular, which, if left unchecked, will certainly increase the ranks of homelessness in the U.S. 
   With that, I thank my colleague, Mr. Yarmuth, for working with me to produce the bipartisan bill we are considering today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3. 
   Everyone has a family member or friend who suffers from diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or other diseases. Unfortunately, without Federal Government support, scientists won't have access to the stem cells they need to develop treatments and cures for these and a host of other diseases that touch the lives of every American. 
   We already are using Federal funds to support embryonic stem cell research. But science has advanced rapidly since the President announced his stem cell research policy. These cells were just identified less than ten years ago, and already, the technology is progressing by leaps and bounds. The 22 lines currently available under the President's policy were developed using outdated techniques and have been contaminated, possibly skewing the outcome of experiments. 
   There are now 125 good, pure cell lines available for use. Because they are more diverse, not only can scientists use them to research more conditions, but they better reflect the genetic diversity of individuals. 
   I support lifting the ban on Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, so long as the donors give their consent and the cells made available would otherwise be discarded and destroyed. It is simply tragic that something so valuable would just be thrown away when it has so much potential to alleviate so much suffering. 
   Given the promise that these stem cells hold, it is time to drop the restrictions and allow researchers to do what they do best. Let's let researchers go where the science leads them, not where politicians dictate. In order to truly explore all the possibilities, scientists must have access to all kinds of stem cells: adult, embryonic and those from umbilical cord blood and amniotic fluid. That is why I plan to vote for H.R. 3. 
   I am proud to support H.R. 3, and for the sake of the millions suffering from debilitating diseases, I ask my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I would say that all I can find in the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate is that it's $2.7 billion and not $2.4 billion over 2008 to 2013, as far as the CBO estimate that Chairman Frank was talking about. 
   You know, Congress has yet to submit a single bill to the President that might begin to address this crisis in the housing market, and here we are again debating controversial new housing legislation, instead of passing common-sense housing reform that could start helping homeowners. 
   And I feel like I woke up one morning, we just had a markup on the Housing bill, and suddenly, I couldn't even find the number of it, H.R. 3221, and it suddenly was a different bill with a lot of different provisions in it. Some were the same and some weren't. I have to say this reminds me of the SCHIP bill that we debated, which kind of came over here the same way from the Senate. I don't think it's going to be the same result, but I just can't understand that process. 
   And I do appreciate Chairman Frank's inclusion of FHA and GSE reform, as well as the funding for housing  counseling and mortgage fraud in the bill that we're considering today. But these are much needed reforms that could increase the liquidity in the housing market and provide consumers with an alternative to the bad subprime loans, and help to restore consumer confidence, which is so important. 
   But attaching these things to a taxpayer-funded bailout will not get them any closer to the President's desk. And make no mistake. This is a bailout. It would place U.S. taxpayers on the hook for the $300 billion guarantee, but that includes the riskiest mortgage debt on the market. And it does this by allowing speculators, borrowers who have overstated assets, who have cheated and knew that they couldn't make the payments, and those who invested irresponsibly, to pawn off their financial liabilities on U.S. taxpayers. This is a liability. 
   And instead of serving distressed homeowners, the bill requires that the lenders, not the homeowners, to make the decision to place the mortgage in the program. Since the lenders are the ones that would like to get rid of their bad loans and put those on the, be guaranteed by the Federal Government, the taxpayers, the taxpayers will be bailing out the banks, the investors on their most unwise lending decisions. 
   Even more disturbing is that the bailout is partially funded on the backs of seniors through changes to FHA reverse mortgage program. 
   Mr. Speaker, we shouldn't be asking American taxpayers to pay for the mistakes of those who over estimated their income on mortgage applications, or scam artists that inflated appraisals and flipped properties. 
   Nor should they pay for homeowners who chose to live beyond their means, using inflated home equity loans to buy a new plasma TV, a swimming pool or a fancy car. It is not fair to those who saved and invested responsibly. 
   The majority of Americans are working hard to make ends meet. Ninety-three percent of our mortgage holders are making their payments on time. Fifty-one out of 55 million Americans with a mortgage are making their mortgage payments on time. 
   Twenty-five million Americans own their own homes and have no mortgage. Thirty-four million Americans are prudently renting because they aren't ready to own a home. These hardworking Americans should not be forced to foot the bill for the bad decisions of a few who gambled that their home values would never stop rising. They don't think that's fair, and I don't think so either. 
   I understand that many of my colleagues are looking at the economic effects of the housing bubble and saying to themselves, ``We must act, we must do something. ``But we shouldn't do something if it's not right. Congress can help struggling borrowers and promote economic growth without burdening the taxpayers with inappropriate spending. 
   And that's why I join with Financial Services Ranking Member Bachus to offer an alternative plan that helps homeowners in a responsible way. It does include the FHA reform. This could solve this problem right away. Our substitute funds housing for counseling, other reforms to GSEs that's so important, without a so-called trust fund or slush fund. 
   And there's nothing in the Democrat alternative that would prevent a similar housing crisis like this in the future. Though improved, disclosure lender registration higher price is standard.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Our Republican alternative would do more than put an expensive Band-Aid on the housing market. It begins to address the underlying causes of the subprime mess. It will ensure that borrowers have access to legitimate loans; that they understand the terms of their loan, and that they are taking a loan that they can afford based on the actual value of the house. 
   We need to bring transparency and integrity to the homebuying process, and we need to expand access to credit for worthy borrowers who genuinely want to pay off their loans, but we need to do it without wasting taxpayers' dollars. 
   I think we have an alternative bill that would solve these problems. And many were supported by both Republicans and Democrats. It's a commonsense plan that doesn't spend money and, in fact, has been scored by CBO to actually reduce the deficit by $25 million. Coupled with Mr. Terry's tax credit for owner-occupied homebuyers, it will jump-start the flailing housing market and get our economy back on track. 
   That's why I urge my colleagues to vote against the bill before us today and consider the alternative, if we had the opportunity to have an alternative.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1079, which recognizes April as National Financial Literacy Month. I am pleased to say that this will be the fifth year in a row that Congress has designated April as Financial Literacy Month, and I would like to thank my good friend and fellow Chair of the House Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus, Mr. Hinojosa, for introducing this resolution and for his continuing efforts to improve financial literacy rates in America. 
   Our caucus, which boasts about 80 members from both sides of the aisle, has been on the front line of this issue for several years, and I think it is fair to say that we have made some genuine progress. Today, 40 States include personal finance in their educational standards. That is up from 31 in 2002. Even more promising, 49 States now include some aspect of economics in the  curriculum guidelines. But we have much work ahead of us if we are going to help today's children become tomorrow's smart investors, entrepreneurs and business leaders. 
   The savings rate is still hovering just below zero; 10 million Americans are unbanked; there were 2.2 million foreclosures in 2007; and the front pages of our newspapers across the country proclaim that millions of Americans are losing their homes because they were not ready to be homeowners. 
   Clearly, the need to improve financial literacy of Americans is greater than ever. And this applies to all Americans, not just students and children. From college grads to senior citizens, consumers are being asked to make decisions about increasingly complex financial products. According to the FTC, one-third of borrowers could not even identify the interest rate in a mortgage disclosure form and half could not correctly identify the loan amount. The problem is amplified by complicated legal jargon about balloon payments, rate resets, escrow accounts, prepayments and closing costs. The list goes on and on. That is why I have introduced several bills to help owners find a loan that best meets their budget and needs, steering them away from a situation that could lead to foreclosure down the road. 
   Just last week, I joined Financial Services Ranking Member Bachus and Housing and Community Development Subcommittee Ranking Member SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO to introduce legislation that would simplify mortgage documents and increase resources for housing counseling. Taken together, these reforms will not only prevent foreclosures, they will help owners to avoid fraud and allow them to easily compare financial products to find the best loan for their families' needs. 
   Mr. Speaker, efforts to stimulate the economy cannot succeed unless we equip Americans with the knowledge and resources they need to succeed in today's sophisticated economic market. Housing is just one of these areas where improved financial literacy will benefit consumers. 
   Americans also need access to the proper tools for saving and investing money. At the start of the 110th Congress, I introduced a bill called the 401 Kids Family Savings Act of 2007. This bill will allow parents and family members to set aside money in a child's account that will accumulate tax-free and can be used for college tuition, a first home, or even retirement, should the money last that long. Not only will this boost savings, it will get kids actively engaged in banking from the time they are old enough to count. This way, they can learn about things like compound interest in the best way imaginable, by watching their own college fund grow. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are so many great ideas for improving financial literacy rates. In fact, over 50 nonprofit community and private sector organizations from across the country came to the Hill yesterday for the annual Financial Literacy Day Fair. On display for policymakers were hundreds of books, programs and resources on how to improve financial literacy in ways that will make a positive impact on people's lives. It was a remarkable success, and I would like to congratulate the National Council on Economic Education, the Jump$tart Coalition, Junior Achievement, and all the other sponsors who worked with Senators AKAKA and ENZI to put it together. 
   I would also like to recognize the impressive efforts of Charles Schwab, John Hope Bryant and the other members of the President's new Private Sector Advisory Council on Financial Literacy. It is increasingly clear that teaching financial literacy requires cooperation between the government and industry. This council will help to facilitate that cooperation by making and implementing recommendations for improving on current financial literacy outreach efforts. 
   Mr. Speaker, Americans are a diverse group, but we all share some very basic financial needs. We need to be prepared for tuition costs, a home, health care and retirement. We need a financial cushion against unexpected challenges like the death of a family member. And we need the capital necessary for new entrepreneurs to launch the start-ups and open the small businesses that drive the economy. Every American should have the opportunity and know-how to fulfill each of these goals. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and show that financial literacy remains a top priority for Congress. 
   I would like to once again thank Representative Hinojosa and his staff, especially Greg Davis, for all their hard work on this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2739, which includes the provisions of H.R. 85, a bill called the Energy Technology Transfer Act that I introduced with my Science and Technology Committee colleague from North Carolina (Mr. Miller). The House approved our bill by a vote of 395-1 back in March of last year. And this is so important, Mr. Speaker, that it is now before this House again, and I appreciate it. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government spends billions every year on energy-related research and development for our universities and national laboratories. The result is often new technologies that exponentially reduce our consumption of energy or encourage the use of alternative fuels and thus reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy. But the biggest challenge to realizing these energy savings is getting these technologies out of the laboratory and into the marketplace where they can benefit all energy end users. Whether we're talking about a business owner, a homeowner, a county or local government officials, these energy end users may be hesitant to embrace advanced or alternative technologies with which they are not familiar, have little experience, or which may require new infrastructure. 
   To help energy end users embrace these new technologies, section 917 of the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 2005 directed the Department of Energy to create a geographically dispersed network of energy efficiency technology transfer centers to help in this process. This bill will simply improve that section 917 of EPACT, and instead of creating from scratch these network centers, H.R. 85 authorizes the DOE to provide grants to and partner with existing community outreach networks. These existing networks could include Cooperative Extension Systems--just like what we have seen with the farms--offices, State energy offices, local governments, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit organizations with expertise in energy technologies or outreach. And so instead of limiting these centers to the transfer of energy efficiency technologies, it also expands their mission to include all advanced energy technologies and requires grantees to provide feedback to DOE on the energy research needs identified by these energy end users. 
   I just want to give you one example of what I'm talking about in Chicago and how this program might work. Before expanding their frozen pizza production plant in Illinois, Home Run Inn Pizza consulted with the University of Illinois--Chicago's Energy Resource Center. After conducting an assessment of the plant and its operations, the UIC Energy Resource Center identified nine ways that the Home Run Inn Pizza could reduce their energy consumption and energy costs. Using advanced energy technologies developed as a result of the DOE-funded research, Home Run Inn Pizza could reduce natural gas consumption by 15 percent and electricity consumption by 5 to 6 percent, saving a total of about $15,000 annually. 
   So with the enactment of H.R. 85, the UIC Energy Resource Center and other cooperative extension and community outreach organizations could add capacity and expertise to help many, many companies, building managers, homebuilders and homeowners use the technology to save energy and money. 
   So the bill represents just a small investment in the tech transfer capabilities that we need to help our universities and labs move advanced energy technologies from labs into the market so Americans can enjoy the tangible benefits of our Federal investment in R&D. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Miller from North Carolina, for his strong interest in tech transfer and for being the lead Democrat on this bill. I want to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall for recognizing the value of this bill and moving it through the committee, Senators BINGAMAN and DOMENICI and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee for approving this bill and including it in S. 2739. Finally, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee and the House Republican and Democrat leadership for bringing this package of bills to the floor today and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney), the Chair of the Financial Institution Subcommittee, for her hard work on this bill, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill and urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you are a consumer and you have a complaint or a problem of a financial nature, which regulator are you going to call, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the CFTC, FTC, OFHEO, HUD, Treasury, OTS, NCUA, the SEC? In these challenging times, consumers should not have to have a Ph.D. in finance to quickly and easily get in touch with the appropriate State and Federal banking regulators. 
   Given the complexity of our banking system and the various regulators that work in this area, consumers may not know where to turn when they have a dispute with their institutions. This legislation creates a single hotline that can help steer consumers in the right direction. Federal regulators currently have had an informal system in place to redirect misplaced consumer complaints, and regulators are constantly trying to improve the system. But this bill will ensure that no consumer complaint falls through the cracks. Consumers should not have to make 12 phone calls to find the right regulator. 
   Again, I am pleased that this bill will ensure that consumer complaints are heard and that regulators are responsive. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the CHAMP Act. 
   I am a strong supporter of the State Children's Health Insurance Program--or SCHIP as it is commonly called. In my State of Illinois, there are approximately 167,000 low-income children who are enrolled in the program. Many of these children are in families where their parents work hard each month to make ends meet. And for many of these families, SCHIP is the safety net they need when they cannot afford private health insurance. 
   I support reauthorization of the SCHIP Program when the goals of the reauthorization are to cover low- to moderate-income children that do not already have health insurance. However, I cannot support legislation that will provide government-sponsored insurance for higher-income families at the expense of seniors. 
   The legislation we are considering today would allow States to cover children and adults well above the poverty level. A little-know provision in current law known as ``income disregard'' allows States to determine what is and is not income for the purposes of determining eligibility. This loophole allows States to provide SCHIP coverage to a family of four making more than $72,000 a year, or 350 percent of the Federal poverty level. While $72,000 a year may not get you on the cover of Forbes magazine, it is a level that most Americans would agree is above poverty. 
   For families with private health insurance making $72,000 a year, this legislation would provide them with an incentive to shift from their private insurance to the Government program. And who can blame them? But I don't think that the taxpayers in my district would support a bill that shifts individuals from private insurance to Government programs. 
   To expand coverage to middle-income families, the legislation would cut coverage to seniors in the Medicare Advantage program. In my district, there are more than 5,000 seniors who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. I often hear about the additional benefits that these individuals enjoy that are otherwise unavailable or available at a much higher cost. 
   We should not be forced to choose between seniors and children--particularly when the majority does not allow the minority to properly review the legislation, debate it in the committee or on the floor, or allow amendments and alternative ideas to be considered. 
   I support reauthorizing the SCHIP program when that legislation is focused on the most vulnerable population--the population the program was intended to help--poor children. But I cannot support legislation that will eliminate coverage for senior in order to provide coverage to middle-income adults and children--many of whom already have health insurance. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise to talk about this bill and I will hold the debate on FHA until that bill comes to the floor. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Frank and Mr. Baker for introducing this year's GSE bill to establish a new and stronger regulator for the GSEs and the Federal Home Loan Banks. 
   Like last year's legislation, this bill aims to give the new regulator clear direction about its authority, available tools and mission. With this enhanced authority and guidance, the new GSE regulator can guide the GSEs to be most effective for homeowners, market participants, financial institutions, and taxpayers. 
   The overall purpose of the GSE reform bill is to create a strong, world-class regulator, and I think in this bill we direct the new regulator to review and set portfolio limits, establish minimum capital requirements, and review new programs and products. 
   However, unlike last year's legislation, I think this year's bill introduces a new, extraneous provision that does not permit the new regulator to focus solely on these very important duties. This bill does not isolate this regulator from political influence, but rather establishes a stream of cash that is financed on the backs of the American homeowners. Why do I say this? What is the affordable housing trust fund; does anyone know? And why would we allow GSE money to be diverted to an unknown, non-existent entity? This was not in last year's bill. 
   Last year's bill permitted Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to manage an affordable housing fund. This year's bill permits the new regulator to establish and regulate the fund. I don't think that it is appropriate for this new regulator to manage the affordable housing fund. 
   The provision establishes a formula to allocate funds to States and Indian tribes which would in turn determine which organizations receive the funds. The new GSE regulator is tasked with establishing regulations to determine the prescription for States to distribute the funds. And as stated in  House Report 110-142, ``This bill provides that funds allocated for the affordable housing fund, may be transferred at a later date to a national affordable housing trust fund that may be subsequently enacted into law.'' 
   We just don't know what is going to be the amount of money, where it is coming from, except if we determine that it is estimated that it would extract $3 billion in assessments from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over a 5-year period. There is no dollar limit as to how large this fund can become. Where will this money for the fund ultimately come from? It will come from low and middle income Americans seeking to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage. Hardworking, low income and middle income Americans who are trying to have their part of the American dream will ultimately be footing the bill for a national housing trust fund, the purpose of which has not yet been determined in law. Taxing hardworking American homeowners is not the way to fund new affordable housing. 
   I share the chairman's commitment to increasing the stock of affordable housing for low-income Americans, but this fund is the wrong way to achieve this objective. 
   Therefore, I would urge my colleagues to take a look at the Bachus amendment to strike the affordable housing fund section of this bill. I think we have a really good bill here. It is similar to last year's bill. I know that we have talked about this in the committee, we should have hearings and further discussions on the need to build more affordable housing in this country, how it can be done and how it can be financed, and particularly what this new affordable housing fund means. 
   So with that, I urge my colleagues to, at this time, not support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the amendment to strike the Affordable Housing Fund. 
   I think the reason that we are having so much trouble talking about this, I know that in our March 15 hearing we urged the chairman if we could spend some time working this out prior to coming to the floor, and obviously that hasn't happened. But I think, because of all the questions, because we haven't had a hearing on this and we don't know what the national fund is; and he keeps saying we have got an Affordable Housing Fund now. 
   It is estimated by CBO that it is going to be $3 billion over a 5-year period. If that is 1.2 basis points, then it will be the $3 billion. But there is still no dollar limit as to how large the fund can become. Where will the money for the fund ultimately come from? We don't know, talking about is it going to be from lower and middle Americans, or is it going to be from shareholders? 
   But I think these are all things that need to be considered before we have the fund. And I know it is, ``Trust me. We are going to have a national fund and we will figure out how it is going to work.'' But I think that, in this day and age, that we really need to give the regulator some idea of what their job is. 
   I agree with so much of this bill. I think it is a shame. I voted for the bill last time, and I was very proud to do that. A lot of people didn't vote for the bill. And suddenly, most of the bill that was in that bill is now in this bill. 
   But unlike last year's legislation, I think this bill has included in this provision that doesn't permit the regulator to focus on the very important duties in this bill, and rather to have this Affordable Housing Trust Fund I think it is too bad. The new regulator has the duty to write those regulations and then administer an Affordable Housing Grant Fund program from day one, when we don't know what this national trust fund is going to end up being. I don't think that this is an appropriate time to do it. 
   So I urge that we would strike the Affordable Housing Trust Fund from this bill, and would urge support of that amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of this bill, I rise in support of the Homeless Emergency Act and Rapid Transition to Housing Act of 2008, or the HEARTH Act. I would also like to thank Congressman GEOFF DAVIS of Kentucky and, if she were here today, the original House version sponsor, the late Congresswoman Julia Carson for introducing this bill, H.R. 840. In addition, I would like to thank Chairman Frank, subcommittee Chairwoman Waters, and Ranking Members BACHUS and CAPITO for working together with Congressman Davis and me to give homeless children a fighting chance in this country. 
   I would also like to thank all of the staff on both sides of the aisle for all of their hard work: Scott Olson, Jonathan Harwitz, Cindy Chetti, Tallman Johnson, Lauren O'Brien, Aaron Spurck, Andre Stevens, Kathleen Taylor, Clinton Jones, Nicole Austin. A tremendous thanks for all they have done. 
   Mr. Speaker, for inclusion in the Congressional Record, I would like to submit additional views authored by Congressman GEOFF DAVIS, Congresswoman Capito, and me. These views were filed as part of our committee report to accompany H.R. 840, but they apply to this bill, H.R. 7221, as amended, as well. 
   Additional Views 
   Mr. Davis of Kentucky, Mrs. Capito, and I acknowledge the significant work that the Chairman, Ranking Member, and other Members and staff have done to address many of the concerns we raised about addressing the needs of homeless unaccompanied youth, children, and their families in H.R. 840, a bill introduced by the late Rep. Julia Carson as well as Rep. Geoff Davis. 
   There are inconsistencies in the definition of homeless for programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as compared to those administered by the Departments of Education, Justice, and Human Services. In the education section of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the Head Start Act, the same homeless definition is used. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act program uses a similar definition. However, the housing component of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act uses a different definition, which excludes a majority of the unaccompanied youth, children, and families recognized as homeless by non-HUD federal homeless programs. 
   As a result, hundreds of thousands of homeless students, homeless and disabled children, homeless infants, and homeless children running away from domestic violence, unsafe housing, or unstable living conditions are denied HUD homeless housing and services. 
   Several witnesses, including Dr. Ellen Bassuk, an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, testified before our Committee that many homeless children who are currently excluded from HUD's homeless definition are prone to health and developmental problems. Dr. Bassuk said that there is documented evidence that almost 90 percent of homeless families end up doubled-up, which results in severe overcrowding and dangerous situations. The homeless children in these families are at significant risk of physical and sexual abuse, have seen people shot and killed, or have had their own lives threatened. Highly mobile homeless students suffer academically, are less likely to graduate, are sick more than the average child, and are more likely to have behavior problems. 
   Homelessness among children is only becoming more pervasive. A study conducted by First Focus and the Brookings Institute determined that almost 2 million children will be affected by the foreclosure crises. Many of these children will become homeless, but, tragically, they will not qualify for HUD homeless housing assistance or services. 
   H.R. 840, as introduced, would reconcile the definitions of homeless used among HUD and the other federal programs that serve homeless unaccompanied youth, children, and families. In addition, as introduced, the bill would recognize as homeless many individuals and families that are not recognized as homeless by these other federal programs. 
   For many months, we have worked with Members of the Committee, staff, and government and non-government organizations representing various homeless constituencies to craft a new HUD definition of homeless that would allow homeless unaccompanied youth, children, and their families served by other federal programs to also be recognized by HUD as homeless and therefore qualify for HUD homeless housing and services. 
   On July, 31, 2008, during the Committee's consideration of H.R. 840, Rep. Biggert and Rep. Davis offered an amendment to allow all children and youth considered homeless by four other federal programs to be considered homeless by HUD. They withdrew the amendment because of an agreement with the Chairman that they would: (1) continue to work on language to amend HUD's definition of homeless as the bill moved out of Committee toward full House consideration; and (2) send a joint letter requesting that GAO examine the issue of homeless definition discrepancies and related matters. 
   Between July 31, 2008 and today, we and our staff have worked with the Chairman and Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee Chairwoman Waters, Education and Labor Committee Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon, and their staff on a letter to GAO and new language to expand HUD's definition of homeless to include more homeless unaccompanied youth, children, and their families. 
   On September 23, 2008, we joined the above-mentioned Members and sent a letter to GAO. In recent days, we offered language to Senate and House Members and staff negotiating the final language of H.R. 840 and S. 1518 to include homeless children, unaccompanied youth, and their families in HUD's definition of homeless. We are pleased that Senate and House Members have agreed to include the following language as part of HUD's definition of homeless:

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the Housing Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee. 
   I would like to thank the chairwoman and express my appreciation for all she has done for this, and to express my appreciation to my other chairman, Mr. George Miller, for his outstanding work on behalf of homeless people, and for working with our Financial Services Committee to recognize the educational and housing needs of homeless children and youth. I would also like to thank Representative McCarthy and Representative GEOFF DAVIS for their work as well. 
   As you know, the Education and Labor Committee has jurisdiction for the McKinney-Vento Education For Homeless Children Act, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and Head Start. H.R. 7221 will broaden HUD's definition of homelessness to include a subset of children and youth who meet the definition of homelessness used by other Federal statutes. We appreciate the inclusion of these children, and believe it is a step in the right direction. In particular, it covers those children and youth who, either on their own or as part of a family, have experienced a long-term period without living stably or independently in permanent housing.  
   Madam Chairwoman, as this term ``long-term period'' is open to interpretation, is it the committee's intention that any regulation that interprets this provision would acknowledge that ``long-term period'' should be viewed from the perspective of children and recognize their unique developmental needs?

   Mrs. BIGGERT. I have no other speakers, but I would yield myself such time as I may consume to close. 
   I spoke earlier a little bit about my friend and constituent Diane Nilan of Naperville, Illinois, who has done so much for the homeless. She has worked tirelessly for 20 years to provide a home for homeless children and families across the country, and I think she has seen firsthand the mental, physical and emotional degradation that children and families experience with homelessness. 
   In her testimony before the Financial Services Committee last October she said, ``Homeless service providers in communities of all sizes await the day that HUD provides the opportunity for people in all homeless situations to receive the assistance they need. They long to be free to focus on easing homelessness as it appears in their communities, on the street, doubled up or in motels, instead of having their hands tied with arbitrary rules and restrictions. They desire Federal resources to supplement local efforts to house and assist the growing number of families without a place to call home.'' 
   I would also like to thank Carol Simler of DuPage PADS and all the wonderful people in my district who help with homelessness. I know we all have so many stories in all of our districts. 
   With that, I would urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Mr. Speaker, I support provisions in this resolution that provide funding for roads and transit, Pell Grants, Special Education, NCLB, veterans' healthcare and scientific research at places like NIH and Argonne National Laboratory. 
   However, I do not support a provision in this bill that will slash housing assistance for hundreds of families and seniors in my district and for thousands more nationwide. 
   It is unfortunate that the leadership and appropriators on the other side of the aisle decided that it was OK to completely rewrite the funding formula for the disbursement of Section 8 housing funds in this bill without consulting with the authorizing committee, Financial Services. The last time I checked, authorizing on an appropriations bill is against the House rules. But of course, the rule for this bill denies us any opportunity to raise a point of order, or amend the bill. At least during previous Republican-led Congresses, our leadership had the courtesy to allow Democrats to offer amendments and points of order and followed rules that reflect a truly democratic process. 
   Now, I must point out that the other side of the aisle still has a chance to do this the right way. As the new Ranking Member of the Financial Services Housing Subcommittee, I am perfectly happy to work with the majority to craft a comprehensive, bipartisan Section 8 reform package that will provide stability and predictability for our public housing authorities and those whom they serve. 
   My constituents are not well served by this abrupt and drastic change in the formula, and I would warn my colleagues from Illinois to look closely at the new numbers for their districts. 
   The Chicago suburbs are hit hard by this new formula. Each housing authority in all three counties of my Congressional district will receive a funding cut this year. The housing authority in Cook County will lose $8 million, Joliet will lose $1.1 million, Aurora and DuPage County will lose over a million dollars. 
   These are not just dollars; these are families and seniors who are being hurt here. With this bill's proposed cuts to Section 8 housing funding, more than 100 families in DuPage County, about 150 in Will County, and thousands across the country will be kicked to the curb in 2007. This is unacceptable. 
   I am disappointed by the thoughtlessness of those on the other side of the aisle who determined the new formula and numbers in this bill. I urge my colleagues to alert their constituents who will become homeless this year about this fly-by-night formula change that our dear colleagues have brought to the floor today. I invite the Democratic leadership to explain to the neediest citizens in the suburbs of Chicago and in communities across our Nation why they won't have a roof over their heads in 2007. This is no way to start the New Year.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the author of H.R. 3019, the Expand and Preserve Home Ownership Through Counseling Act, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. First let me thank Congressman Ruben Hinojosa for being the lead Democrat on this bill. 
   In 2005, we founded the House Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus, which is now over 75 members strong, and we have been working together on this issue for a very long time. This bill is just one more example of how financial literacy can promote economic security and empower Americans to make more informed decisions. 
   Second, I would like to thank Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for their support for this legislation. Both the chairman and ranking member have included the language of this bill in various mortgage and housing packages, two of which, as Mr. Scott said, have previously passed the House but not the other Chamber. The first time was in November of 2007, and the second time was in H.R. 3221, and that bill passed the House on May 8 of this year. Unfortunately, the Senate has not yet acted on this important legislation. It is my hope that the Senate will consider the bill as a stand-alone measure and send it to the President's desk before we adjourn this year. 
   What does the bill do? Well, it elevates housing counseling within the Department of Housing and Urban Development by establishing an Office of Housing Counseling and a director of that office who reports directly to the Secretary of HUD. The office will be tasked with carrying out and coordinating HUD's Home Ownership and Housing Rental Counseling Program, targeted at low and moderate income individuals, the homeless and the seniors, just to name a few. 
   More specifically, the bill authorizes $180 million over the next 4 years for HUD to operate this office, offer grants to State and local counseling agencies and launch a national outreach campaign. The bill also calls for the office to provide a report to Congress on the root causes of defaults and foreclosures, including recommendations for policy reforms and best practices, as well as identification of populations most in need of counseling. 
   Mr. Speaker, counseling can help guide homeowners into a loan that best meets their budgets and needs, steering them way from possible foreclosure down the road. Housing counseling, one form of financial literacy, is often the first line of defense that first-time home buyers have against predatory lending practices. 
   In addition, counselors can save the homes of borrowers currently facing foreclosure. So many troubled mortgage holders genuinely want to pay for their home and had solid payment histories before their rates were reset. These are people that if given the right refinancing options, can and would be able to make their monthly payments. But they need someone to help them evaluate their options, guide them through the process and facilitate discussions with their current lenders. 
   One thing that we have learned during this downturn in the housing market is that many Americans need to better understand the terms of financial products, including and especially mortgages. Education is one of the most important tools in our arsenal to keep our economy and American families on sound financial footing. It is my hope that by providing greater access to home counseling services, we can help to prevent a repeat performance of the recent housing bubble. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to conclude today by thanking the folks at the DuPage Homeownership Center of Northern Will County in Illinois. They have helped so many residents of the 13th Congressional District of Illinois to secure sound mortgages or avoid foreclosure. And I would like to thank all the counselors and organizations across the country that are now involved in the HOPE NOW initiative, which reported last month it had helped over 2 million homeowners to avoid foreclosure. 
   With that, I would urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (EFFECTIVE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY PROSECUTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 4120, the Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act. I am very pleased to be the lead Republican cosponsor, and I thank the gentlewoman from Kansas for all of her hard work, but I am proud to be part of this important bill which will close an unacceptable loophole in the Federal criminal code. 
   As my colleagues have already pointed out, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit handed down a decision this year which freed a defendant who had been convicted of receiving and possessing child pornography. The case of U.S. v. Schaefer was not overturned for lack of evidence but rather because the prosecution failed to prove that images downloaded from the Internet moved across State lines in ``interstate commerce.'' 
   The judges who decided this case pointed out that the use of the phrase ``in commerce'' instead of ``affecting commerce'' in the law signaled Congress' intent to limit Federal jurisdiction in the prosecution of child pornographers. As cochair of the Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus, I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. We in Congress know the horrible consequences that result from the sexual exploitation of children used to create these images. We also take very seriously our duty to do everything in our power to protect children, punish predators and deter future acts of abuse. 
   That is why the bill we are considering today deserves our full support. It will close the loophole in current law by replacing the phrase ``in commerce'' with the phrase ``affecting commerce'' in the child pornography statute. It classifies the intent of Congress and will ensure that predators that use the Internet to transmit child pornography end up behind bars where they belong. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to again thank the gentlewoman from Kansas, my good friend, NANCY BOYDA,  for introducing this legislation. I also would like to thank the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for their assistance and counsel in drafting the bill. Mr. Speaker, as a mother of four and grandmother of seven, I know there is nothing more important than safeguarding our children from predators. We must not allow those who sexually exploit children to avoid prosecution because of a technicality. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 4120 to help close this egregious loophole in the law.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, like all of my colleagues here on the floor and in the House of Representatives, I fully support efforts to end all forms of discrimination. I admire Ms. Ledbetter's bravery for standing up for her right to work in an environment free from discrimination. 
   I know what it is like. I sat in law school class and was told by my professor that I was taking up the place of someone who belonged there, a man. As a woman who has felt discrimination, I understand her frustration and I am pleased that Congress is discussing this important issue. 
   If this bill were an anti-discrimination bill, I would be happy to vote for it and would encourage others to support it. But this bill is not about discrimination. It is about the statute of limitations. 
   The statute of limitations is an institution in American jurisprudence that pertains to all cases and all causes of  action. For instance, for torts the statutes of limitations is 2 years; for contracts, it is 6 years; for employment determination or discrimination, it is 6 months. We can't legislate change in the statute of limitations just because we don't like a particular Supreme Court ruling.     
   The statute of limitation requires plaintiffs to bring a claim or a cause of action within a reasonable time. And that is so witnesses don't disappear or die off, memories don't fade, and supervisors don't move on and documents are not discarded or destroyed. 
   That is why I cannot support the legislation before us today. H.R. 2831 would dismantle the statute of limitation for filing a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. If enacted, this legislation would allow an employee to bring a claim against an employer years, even decades, after the alleged act of discrimination. 
   In addition, this legislation would discourage the prompt investigation and resolution of discrimination. I think everyone would agree that if there is discrimination at an individual's place of work, it should be investigated and addressed as soon as possible to ensure fairness and prevent further discrimination. 
   Unfortunately, because no hearings were held on this legislation, I think the majority is rushing it through the House with little discussion on the bill itself. We can only speculate as to what all of the ramifications of this bill might be. I know that the gentleman is probably going to say there was a hearing, but it wasn't directly on this bill. So I would encourage my colleagues to oppose this well-intentioned but misguided statute of limitation legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which will prohibit health insurers and employers from discriminating on the basis of genetic information. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, this legislation has been around for quite some time. I have been working on for it more than 7 years, and Congresswoman Slaughter has been working on it for more than 12 years. It's been a long road, and there have been  many times I thought this day would never come; but it is here. 
   Over this period of time, I have heard stories from my constituents and other individuals across the country about how genetic information was affecting their lives. Quite simply, they are stories of how our laws have failed to keep pace with medical science. 
   A breast cancer survivor in Chicago told me that even though her doctor recommended she undergo a genetic test to see if she had a 60 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer, which was quite common in the type of breast cancer that they had, she refused the test. She said I can't, I will lose my job. 
   It isn't that she didn't want to know; quite the opposite. She desperately wanted to know, but she feared if she had an adverse result from the test, she would lose her job. She is not alone; studies show that 85 percent of Americans fear employers will use genetic information to discriminate. 
   And then there is the woman from Missouri whose sister had suffered from cancer was cautioned by her doctor that undergoing genetic testing would cause her to lose her health insurance. She too chose not to undergo a genetic test. She is not alone; studies show that 84 percent of Americans express concern that health insurance companies would deny coverage based on genetic information. 
   And then there is the man with a family history of PKD, decided to take a genetic test but chose to use an alias and pay cash rather than bill his insurance just to keep the test out of his medical file. And he also is not alone; 26 percent of genetic counselors themselves admit that they would use an alias and 68 percent said they would pay for the test out of their pocket to protect themselves from discrimination. 
   The dean of a prominent university in Massachusetts told me that the fear of genetic discrimination was hindering clinical trials, slowing the development of life-saving techniques. At NIH, fear of genetic discrimination is the most common reason people cite for not participating in clinical trials on breast and colon cancers. 
   Madam Speaker, I have heard these stories over and over again from individuals wanting to know their genetic risk of developing diseases as far ranging as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Tay-Sachs, and PKD. 
   The sad fact is that these individuals are avoiding genetic tests that would empower them with the information that could save their lives. 
   So I want to let all people know that when the House passes GINA today, we will be just one step away, and that would be the signing by the President, from realizing the medical benefits of genetic testing. One step away from ensuring that people will be able to take a genetic test without risking their jobs and health insurance. One step away from ensuring that patients can stop using aliases and paying out of pocket to keep their genetic tests secret. One step away from ensuring that individuals will be able to participate in genetic clinical trials without fear of discrimination. 
   And the last step is the President's signature, and I am happy to say that he is expected to sign this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, it is clear to me that by passing GINA and freeing people from fear of genetic discrimination, we can unlock the tremendous life-saving and cost-saving potential of genetic research. More Americans will participate in genetic clinical trials, and more Americans will use these technologies to improve their health. 
   And with these improvements comes the prospect of dramatically reducing the chronic care costs that cripple our health care system. We now have more than 500 different health advocacy and business organizations supporting this bill. Recent surveys shows that 93 percent of Americans believe that employers and insurers should not be able to use genetic information to discriminate. 
   With numbers like these, it should be no surprise that the House passed this bill last April 420-3, and the Senate passed it last week 95-0, and the President is expected to sign this measure into law. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your kind words. And it's been a long road, but we're here, and with your help. 
   Just let me say that there's three benefits that are so important for this bill. Number one is that people will get a genetic test. And if it shows that they have a propensity for having some disease, they can then take preventive measures and take measures that are going to improve the quality of their life. And it's personalized medicine. People have got to take command of their medical lives. 
   Second of all, because people will take preventive measures, this is going to reduce the cost of health care. It's going to reduce the cost to businesses because their employees will be taking these preventive measures, and it's going to reduce the cost to health care providers because people, again, will be taking these measures. 
   And as I said before, through the clinical trials, it will increase the ability to find cures for so many diseases if people get into these. 
   So with that, I would really like to take a moment to thank Representative Slaughter, Chairman Slaughter of the Rules Committee one more time, Greg Walden of Oregon who has been a major sponsor of this bill, Congressman Andrews of New Jersey, who has been so helpful, and Mrs. Eshoo from California, who has been so involved. And then Senator Snowe, Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for all their hard work on this issue. It's truly been a pleasure to work with all of them. 
   I would also like to thank Mr. McKeon and Mr. Miller again, the chairman and ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee, for all their support. And then the other chairmen, Congressman Dingell and Congressman Barton of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Mr. Upton of Michigan for coming down and working on this today. And then Chairman Rangel and ranking member McCrery of the Ways and Means Committee, and then Representative Camp for being the spokesman for them. I applaud them for all their efforts. 
   I would also like to thank former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been so supportive of this legislation. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention Sharon Terry and the Coalition for Genetic Fairness, as well as all of our other organizational supporters, for all their persistence and their expertise on this issue. 
   And Dr. Francis Collins of NIH for his testimony before all three committees in the House.     
   Finally, I have to thank the staff, all of the staff, who worked so tirelessly for years now behind the scenes on our behalf and put in long, long hours on this legislation. And in particular, my thanks go to Michelle Varnhagen and Jim Paretti from the Education and Labor Committee staff, and then Michelle Adams from Ms. Slaughter's staff, and Brian Peterson of my staff. 
   There's so many reasons why everybody should vote for this, and certainly having passed the House by 420-3 last April and the Senate 95-0, you say, This is a no-brainer; why didn't this happen a long time ago? And what's been alluded to is to get three committees in the House of Representatives to work on all of the issues, and they are so technical in how they relate to each other and how it relates to privacy and the other HIPAA and ADA and all of the things that had to be brought in here, I think everyone works so hard just to have a wonderful result. And it's no surprise that we're here, but it just took a long time. 
   With that, I would urge all my colleagues to vote for this measure. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 493, GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. 
   And I thank you for being a cosponsor of this legislation and for all your hard work on it. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the bill that is made in order. And I just want to say that I'll be talking in general debate too, but it was so important for me to come down here today to speak during the rule also. 
   When the human genome project was completed in 2003, the House of Representatives recognized it as one of the most significant scientific accomplishments of the past 100 years. For the first time, individuals actually could know their genetic risk of developing diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and the list goes on. And knowing that, they could take preventative measures to decrease their risk of getting such a disease. Completion of the human genome project and genetic testing spawned the personalized medicine movement, focusing on catching diseases earlier, when they are cheaper and easier to treat, or, even better, preventing the onset of the disease in the first place. 
   But after investing $3.7 billion in taxpayer money to achieve this breakthrough, Congress walked away and left the job undone. We left people without any assurance that their genetic information wouldn't be used against them. So, understandably, so many avoided this great technology, never realizing the untold health benefits and savings. 
   This concern even spilled over to NIH, the National Institutes of Health, where fear of genetic discrimination is currently the most common reason for not participating in research on potentially lifesaving genetic testing for breast cancer and colon cancer.     
   Fully one-third of those eligible to participate decline to do this for this  reason, undermining the development of new treatments and cures. 
   Madam Speaker, today Congress is here to settle some unfinished business and provide Americans the protection against genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment that they need to utilize genetic testing without fear. It's just a great day that we are here now, and it has been a long, long road to this. When you have got three committees of jurisdiction on the House side and various committees on the Senate side, to get all of these committees together to come up with a bill, to craft a bill that everybody can agree on and everybody will benefit by it, it's just a great day. 
   I really came to the floor to speak on the rule at this time, to acknowledge my good friend and colleague, esteemed colleague and a true leader on this issue, the chairman of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter. As my colleagues may know, and you just heard from Mr. Sessions, Congresswoman Slaughter first introduced a version of this bill in the 104th Congress. For the newest Members of this body, they might not know that was the nineties. In 1995, to be exact. 
   So that Ms. Slaughter introduced this bill at this time, that far back, is a testament to the foresight of my friend from New York. Just think, the human genome project really was 2003. So she's had the background in this scientific area to really have had that foresight for so long ago. That she introduced it, still amazes me, and the hard work. There were a lot of things that we worked out as far as the path through these years. I first joined her I think it was in 2005 when we introduced the bill again and again and again to reach this day. 
   So I really applaud her for her dedication to this cause, and her perseverance. Working with her on this bill has been a real joy, and I value our partnership and the historic legislation that it has produced. I look forward to hand delivering this bill to the White House with her. I think that that will be sooner than later. 
   Let me just say I want to highlight a few things and reasons for why we should pass this rule and why we should pass this bill. Besides the fact that we invested the $3.7 billion in the human genome, the bill is needed to maintain high quality genetic research and clinical trials at NIH. I think we have all emphasized that, that that is so important. They don't have the whole body of people getting into the clinical trials, which will then I think find the cure for these diseases. 
   Ninety-three percent of Americans believe that insurers and employers should not be able to discriminate based on genetic information. This bill passed the House last year 420-3. It passed the Senate last week 95-0. The bill has received three strong SAPs from the administration. And last year, President Bush said, ``I really want to make it clear to the Congress that I hope they pass the legislation that makes genetic discrimination illegal.'' Newt Gingrich, who has been a strong, strong supporter of genetic nondiscrimination said, and I quote, ``To not have this bill is to cripple our ability to save lives.'' This legislation is supported by over 500 organizations, including BIO and AHIP. 
   With that, I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (MOURNING THE PASSING OF FORMER ILLINOIS CONGRESSWOMAN CHARLOTTE THOMPSON REID -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a former member of this body and one of my personal role models, the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois, Congresswoman Charlotte Thompson Reid, who passed away on January 25, 2007. 
   At the age of 93, Charlotte Reid leaves behind an extraordinary legacy of faithful public service that will be remembered always by the people of Illinois, and especially by those in her beloved hometown of Aurora. 
   As a young lady, Charlotte Reid attended Illinois College in Jacksonville and began her career as a professional singer on NBC radio. She was a singer under the name of Annette King on the very popular Don McNeil's Breakfast Club early morning radio show. I don't think that most of the members of this body would remember that show, but I remember listening to it as a child as I was getting ready for school. 
   Following the show in 1962, after the sudden death of her husband, Frank, after he had won a primary and before the general election, Charlotte Reid was asked to step in and take his place for a seat as representative in the U.S. Congress for the 15th District of Illinois. Renowned for her hard work, gentle charm and integrity, Charlotte Reid won the election and went on to serve almost five distinguished terms in the House of Representatives. She was known for hosting events of singing and music at her Washington, D.C., home after hours. Legend is that she probably was the first woman to appear on the House floor in a pantsuit, an event that was noted by the minority leader Gerald Ford that day. 
   At a time when only a dozen women had a voice in the Chamber, Charlotte, or ``Charlie'' as she was known to her friends, inspired not just me but an entire generation of women to take leadership roles in our communities. 
   Following her time in Congress, Charlotte continued to serve her country in many different capacities, including as a member of the Federal Communications Commission, she had been appointed by President Nixon; the Board of Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services; and the Presidential Task Force on International Private Enterprise. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to take this opportunity to celebrate the legacy of one of Illinois' most venerable daughters. And to her family, I offer my heartfelt condolences and my prayers, especially her three children, including my good friend and former colleague in the Illinois General Assembly, State Representative Patricia Reid Lindner, her daughter, as well as her eight grandchildren and 13 great grandchildren.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Thank you so much, Mr. Kirk, for organizing this opportunity to discuss the Suburban Agenda. As a Member who represents part of Cook County, the most populous county in Illinois, DuPage County, the second most populous county in Illinois, and Will County, the fastest growing county in Illinois, I certainly share your strong interest in suburban issues. 
   So I am delighted to be able to talk a little about the 401(k) kids. I want to just take a few minutes to explain what I think is one of the most important issues facing my constituents and constituents all over, particularly in the suburbs, the rising cost of college education. 
   Other than buying a home, the cost of a college education is probably one of the first major expenses that families need to start saving for. The average cost of tuition at an in-state public school is now at least $13,000; for an out-of-state public school, it is $19,000; and an average tuition at a private school is $28,000 and rising. These numbers have risen and continue to rise far faster than the rate of inflation. 
   Adding to this problem, let me put on my financial literacy hat just a little bit, is that personal savings rates in this country have dropped to a negative 1 percent, one of the lowest savings rates since the Great Depression. So what I fear here is we have a financial storm waiting to strike families across the country. 
   With students already carrying 45 percent more debt than they did 10 years ago, I simply don't think increasing loan amounts and reducing loan rates is enough. We have to provide more tools for parents and students to save for college. That is why we have introduced H.R. 87, the 401 Kids Family Savings Act of 2007. 
   This legislation would put American children on the path to an affordable education and a firm financial future. It allows an individual, including a parent, a grandparent, an aunt or an uncle, to set aside a total of $2,000 annually in 401 Kids Savings Accounts for each child. 
   Like that Roth IRA, the money is contributed to the account after taxes, but interest accumulates tax free, and the balance can be used tax free for the approved purposes in the bill. In the case of 401 Kids Savings Accounts, the money could be withdrawn tax free, first of all, for the college education. 
   The legislation would extend through 2015, the Coverdell Education Savings Account tax benefits, and rename these accounts 401 Kids Savings Accounts. 
   Second, for housing. 401 Kids Savings Accounts also can be used when the child grows up and they haven't used the amount, all of the amount, for the purchase of a first home. 
   And third, retirement. When the child grows up, he can roll over his 401 Kids Savings Account into a Roth IRA for use much later during retirement. 
   By enacting these reforms, we really can supply families with a single vehicle to set aside money for their children's futures. Money contributed at birth could grow tax free for 18 years until needed for college. 
   Parents and relatives also would have the peace of mind of knowing that if the child chooses not to go to college, even though they put away the money, or chooses a more affordable school, any money left over in the accounts can be used for the child's first home or retirement. 
   I would be remiss, as we talk about financial literacy and talk about savings, if I didn't mention that even Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve has said that creating savings accounts for children at the time they are born is a great idea. So I am really pleased to be with you.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Thank you. Yes, there are several States that have started this process, too. The more that we can entice people to start that saving, to know what is available, the more that it is publicized, whether it is a State account or a Federal account, it is very important that this starts. 
   I know that in all the work that we do in the financial literacy and financial education that still we have kids that don't understand the difference between checks, cash or credit cards. Nor do people understand compound interest. Adults don't understand that.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Not even a teenager, but let's say a pre-teen, when the statement comes in and they look at it every month, they see how much interest, what interest means and what compound interest means, that they are getting more money every month, every year on this account. It isn't just sitting there static. 
   We have so many people in this country that are what we call ``unbanked,'' that don't even have a bank account or anything. They don't get these statements. So this is a tool, you are right, that kids learn about how to manage money. And part of that is having the opportunity that will be gained, being able to go to college because they had their parents and their family that put money aside for them. And you could put aside $2,000 a year, but you can start with $50, $100. Maybe families can't afford to put that much money in, but every dollar saved is a dollar towards education with the interest that is gained and reaped over the years in this account.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 2517, the Protecting Our Children Comes First Act of 2007. I was very pleased to be a cosponsor of this important bill which reauthorizes the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through fiscal year 2013.  
   I would like to take a moment to thank my fellow cochair of the Congressional Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus and sponsor of the bill, Representative Lampson, for his hard work on child protection issues, and Chairwoman McCarthy for her work in leading this bill through the committee. 
   It seems like every time I open the newspaper, I read another story of a child that has been abducted or has been sexually abused by a sexual predator. Naperville, Illinois, in my district, a city that has twice been voted by Money Magazine as the top city in the nation to raise children, has alone experienced over 30 cases in the last 4 years involving online sexual solicitation of a child. Clearly, more can and must be done on this issue. This problem is not regional. It is not isolated to big cities. It is not isolated to rural communities. This is a real national problem that will not go away until we give organizations like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children the tools and the resources they need to fulfill their mission and protect our children from current and emerging threats. 
   Since authorized by Congress in 1984, NCMEC has been extremely successful in this mission. In fact, NCMEC has received nearly 2.3 million telephone calls, printed and distributed nearly 43 million publications, trained 231,000 law enforcement, criminal justice, and health professionals, worked more than 136,000 missing children cases, and, perhaps most importantly, played a role in reuniting more than 118,700 children with their families. In fact, the National Center's child recovery rate is an impressive 96.3 percent. 
   For generations, the message was simple. Parents told their children that they should never talk to strangers. My parents told me and I told my children. But times have changed. There are more threats to our children today, and our message must change with technology. Similarly the role of the National Center has changed. 
   This is why we need this bill passed on the floor today, to expand the National Center's congressionally mandated mission to include recent enhancements in technology and give them the resources to address these and other protective issues. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this important legislation. The Andean Trade Preferences program continues to be a vital component of our efforts to promote peace, prosperity and stability in South America, and it should be extended. 
   But, Madam Speaker, listening to the debate today, I was reminded of an old adage that says ``political friendships follow the trade lanes.'' Consider Colombia. The success of this program there demonstrates just how critical trade is to creating friendly and democrat allies in troubled regions. 
   But there is more that we can do and should be doing. We must act quickly to approve the Colombian Free Trade Agreement, not only to meet our international obligations, but to strengthen our economy by boosting U.S. exports to Latin America. Last year alone, my home State of Illinois exported $214 million in merchandise to Colombia, ranking it fourth among the States. More importantly, Illinois exports to Colombia grew 136 percent between 2002 and 2006. 
   These trends are not unique. For all of our economic troubles, U.S. exports continue to drive profits and job growth. According to the Treasury Department's latest economic update, real exports have risen 7.7 percent in just the last four quarters. 
   A free trade agreement will promote even faster growth by giving U.S. exporters duty free access to Colombian  markets, the same access that our Colombian exporters already enjoy to the U.S. At the same time, it will strengthen our friendship with a vital ally and provide for stronger protection of the rights of laborers in that region. 
   Madam Speaker, the bill before us today is a good first step. I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee for their bipartisan efforts, and urge my colleagues to support this bill. But I also ask my colleagues to keep in mind that action today must be followed by action tomorrow. We must work as quickly as possible to pass the Colombian Free Trade Agreement in the coming months.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the creation of the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. While I share Chairman Frank's goal of increasing the amount of available affordable housing, I do not think that H.R. 2895 is the right way to do it. I will make three quick points to explain why. 
   First, let's look at how the trust fund is financed. Thanks to self-defeating provisions in both the GSE reform and the FHA reauthorization bills, low- and middle-income Americans, including the elderly, are going to pay for it. 
   How will it work? It is estimated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two entities that purchase or securitize almost 80 percent of American families' mortgages, will be taxed at more than $3 billion over a 5-year period to pay for the trust fund. Where will they get the money? As publicly traded companies, accountable to their shareholders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will inevitably pass along these new assessments to their customers. America's low- and middle-income homeowners will be footing the bill. That is not a good plan. It amounts to a mortgage tax on these hard-working, low- and middle-income Americans seeking to secure, maintain or refinance their home mortgages. In short, it is robbing Peter to house Paul. 
   What is worse, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the FHA trust fund provision could include a $370 million surplus in 2008 and a $2.1 billion surplus over the 2008 to 2012 period. Where does this come from? Well, the majority of FHA's surplus would come from reverse mortgage premiums that are paid for by our seniors, suggesting that they have been overcharged. I have supported ideas aimed at giving this surplus back to our seniors in the form of reduced premiums, which the Financial Services Committee rejected. 
   I would agree with the chairman that the funds for this trust fund should not be used for other purposes that have nothing to do with housing. But here with the FHA funds, in fact, I think that the money should stay in FHA, period. 
   Second, why are we creating yet another Federal housing program, when we have so many housing programs already in existence, over 100? The National Low Income Housing Coalition cites that nearly 600 housing trust funds have been created in the cities, counties and States in this country, generating more than $1.6 billion per year to support housing needs. 
   Third, to the extent that the State programs fall short in some way, I must point to the existing federally administered program designed to serve the housing needs of low-income Americans, the HOME Investment Partnership Program. This program already has the personnel, systems and regulatory oversight in place to accomplish the same objective as the National Housing Trust Fund. Instead of creating a Federal bureaucracy, let's improve on the home loan program.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Neugebauer amendment. I think that we have to look at bureaucracy. And I must say that I think that the existing federally administered program designed to serve the housing needs of low-income Americans, the HOME Investment Partnership Program, is a program that's already in place. It has the personnel system, the regulatory oversight in place to accomplish the same objective as the National Housing Trust Fund. And instead of creating a new Federal bureaucracy to address low-income housing availability, I think we should focus our efforts on improving the HOME program. Mr. Neugebauer's amendment creates a pilot program, and I think we could call it ``HOME Lite,'' within the HOME program. And so instead of reinventing the wheel and establishing another Federal trust fund and a brand new program, I support improving and being creative with an existing program. 
   If we look at the HOME program, the staff is already participating, they understand the jurisdictions the HOME program will be looking at, and so there is no learning curve for implementation. Revitalizing the HOME program will be more efficient by having less start-up costs, administrative costs, and the funds will be distributed to the project sooner, and not later.     
   At the same time, I think the national trust fund would be administered by exactly the same people who will be administering the program in the States and at the local level, so it will be able to allow them to operate under one program instead of two separate programs with a little different objectives but not much. So they will be doing the same thing twice and having to work with two different bureaucracies to establish an affordable housing program. So I think there might be some changes to the HOME program to align it more closely to some of the things that have been spoken about in the trust fund program. But I think that this would be a good compromise and would still have the trust program that will provide the affordable funding but do it through HUD at a program that has already been established.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, as many of my colleagues know and as the gentleman from Texas has said, I have been part of a group of Members from both sides of the aisle and from both Chambers who have been meeting actually over the past few months to try to find common ground on SCHIP legislation. 
   I am afraid that some of the facts that the gentleman from Wisconsin stated, he made some statements that I would hope he would join our group and we could go over those facts, such as the $83,000. 
   For my colleagues who have taken part, they know very well that these discussions that we have been having were productive at times and less productive at other times. But despite our disagreements and the bumps in the road, I think we persisted and continued to meet because we believe this is one of the most important issues that Congress will address. 
   The genesis of these meetings originated from a letter that 38 House Republicans sent to the President on October 18, and in that letter we laid out principles that we believed would be necessary to secure our votes on the legislation and make this truly a bipartisan reauthorization of SCHIP. These basic principles included covering low-income children first, SCHIP for kids only, SCHIP should not force children out of private health insurance, SCHIP is for American children, and the funding should be stable and equitable. 
   It is important to note that the letter did not mention the tax increase or the $35 billion in additional spending, two significant concerns for many Members on this side of the aisle.     
   Democrats also had their principles for the reauthorization. With these principles, we agreed to discuss how we could change the bill in a way that would gather the support of a significant number of House Republicans and  still have the support of the Members on the other side of the aisle. After weeks of negotiations, we came to a point where I think both sides realized that if a deal was going to be possible, we both had to give some ground for the benefit of a bill. 
   I think that we are and were very close to agreement in principle and a framework that both sides can support. To be frank, the agreement isn't a bill that I would write if I had the choice. I am sure that my friends on the other side of the aisle feel the same way. But this is how a negotiation works. I think if we both came away with a little bit of feeling like we hadn't won, then that's a true negotiation and both sides have compromised. 
   Unfortunately, I think we've run out of time for this year, and given that the current reauthorization ends on the 14th and there are a number of States projected to run out of SCHIP funding next year, I hope we can agree to an 18-month extension with additional funding to ensure that States will not have to drop children from the program. 
   But I would also ask that we continue working on a final bill when we return in January. I have spoken with the leadership on both sides and expressed my desire to do so. We need to put partisanship aside, and I would hope that we can continue to discuss this issue.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Obviously I rise in strong support of H.R. 493. I think it has been an honor to work with the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter) and, I might add, work we did. 
   When the Human Genome Project was completed in 2003, the House of Representatives recognized it as ``one of the most significant scientific accomplishments of the past 100 years.'' 
   For the first time, individuals actually could know their genetic risk of developing disorders such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and they could take preventative measures to decrease their risks. It spawned a personalized medicine movement, focusing on catching diseases earlier, when they are cheaper and easier to treat or, even better, preventing the onset of the disease in the first place. 
   But after investing more than $3.7 billion in taxpayer money to achieve this breakthrough, Congress walked away and left the job unfinished. 
   We left people without any assurance that their genetic information would not be used against them. So, understandably, they avoided this great technology, never realizing the untold health benefits and savings. 
   This concern even spilled over into NIH, where a fear of genetic discrimination is currently the most commonly cited reason for not participating in research on potentially lifesaving genetic testing for breast cancer and colon cancer. Fully one-third of those eligible to participate declined to do so for this reason, undermining the development of new treatments and cures. 
   Mr. Speaker, today Congress is here to settle some unfinished business and provide Americans the protections against genetic discrimination in health care insurance and employment that they need to utilize genetic testing without fear. 
   Besides the more than 200 health advocacy and business organizations that support this bill, recent surveys show 93 percent of Americans believe that employers and insurers should not be able to use genetic information to discriminate. 
   With numbers like this, it should come as no surprise that this legislation enjoys overwhelmingly bipartisan support. And I want to take a moment to thank my good friend Ms. Slaughter, Mr. Walden and Ms. Eshoo. It truly has been a pleasure working with all of them. I would also like to thank Mr. McKeon, Mr. Miller and all the other chairmen and ranking full committee and subcommittee members for working together to make this a better bill. 
   I would be remiss if I did not mention the members of the Coalition for Genetic Fairness, without whom this bill would not be possible. 
   Finally, I would like to thank Brian Petersen of my staff and Michelle Adams of Ms. Slaughter's staff and all the outstanding staff who worked tirelessly behind the scenes on our behalf and who have put in long hours on this legislation. 
   Why must we pass this bill today? Because it dramatically reduces health care costs while saving or extending human lives.     
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I will yield myself the balance of my time to close. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill has been a bipartisan bill. It has got 95 Republicans and 125 Democrats. GINA passed the Education and Labor Committee, Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee by voice vote. I think that GINA is needed to maintain high-quality genetic research and clinical trials at NIH. It passed the Senate last year 98-0, and the last Congress was a strong SAP for them, so when this goes to conference we will see what happens this year. 
   Let me just say that Newt Gingrich said to not have this bill is to cripple our ability to save lives. I would like to enter into the Record a statement of his in the Washington Times, and just to quote a little bit from it. 
   ``Without protection from genetic discrimination, we risk missing out on the promise of personalized medicine. But if we apply time-honored principles of fairness and justice to the genome era, we can grant the American public the gift of better informed patients, better equipped providers, an enhanced biotech industry, improved health and lives saved. 
   ``Let's not withhold this gift any longer. Let's empower all Americans to embrace the possibilities of personalized medicine for better health, and let's commend the forward-thinking bipartisanship of the 110th Congress that has brought us to the threshold of a world where Americans can embrace personalized medicine without fear. 
   ``Our health, and that of our children and grandchildren, depends on it.'' 
   Let me just say that this bill had to go through three committees, and that is not easy, Education and Labor, Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce. That is no small feat. I really thank Chairman Slaughter for all that she did to make sure that this went through, and all the time she has spent on this. It has been a great honor to work with her. 
   Again, let me thank the chairmen of these committees and the ranking members for the time that they put in, and all the Members that came down to speak today and all the Members that supported this as cosponsors. 
   To go through the three committees, everybody knows something about this place, but everybody wants to put their stamp on it. To come out with a bill we can all agree on, and, as people said, they have some things they would still like to put in, but I think being able to manage all of the different committees, and what was their jurisdiction and what maybe they thought was their jurisdiction but really was the jurisdiction of another committee, makes it a very interesting process. 
   And I think we all learned about how this type of bill works. It is a very technical bill, and that is why we thank all of the 200 groups, at least 200 groups that have worked on this bill and been able to give us the technical information that we needed to make this something that is going to save lives. It is going to lower costs and it also is going to find the cures for so many of these diseases and disorders, because people will be willing to go into clinical trials. So I congratulate all of the people that participated. 
   Madam Speaker, I include the article by Newt Gingrich for the Record

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to congratulate the Lady Volunteers of the University of Tennessee on their 59-46 victory over  Rutgers University to clinch the 2007 NCAA Division I women's basketball championship. But I am sure you are wondering why a Member from Illinois would rise to discuss a team from Tennessee. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is to congratulate not only this team but one of its key players, Candace Parker. Candace grew up in the district that I represent, the 13th District of Illinois, and once again she is doing great things. I first got to know Candace when she led the Naperville Central High School Red Hawks to a State basketball title in 2003, a feat that they repeated in 2004. 
   During her high school years, she was honored with both the Naismith and Gatorade National Players of the Year Awards. Candace followed Marianne Jones and LeBron James as only the third high school athlete in any sport to win the Gatorade National Player of the Year in back-to-back seasons, and is the first girls' basketball player to achieve this distinction. 
   During her first year at Tennessee, she was forced to take a medical red shirt at Tennessee where she underwent surgery to repair her torn ACL. During her time away from basketball, Candace was continuing to make headlines, but this time in the academic area. She earned a spot on the Lady Volunteers' honor roll, and was named to the Southeastern Conference All-Academic Freshman Team. She returned to the court for the 2005-2006 season without missing a beat. She was the only player on the team to start every game and led the Lady Vols in scoring and rebounds. 
   While facing Army in the 2006 NCAA tournament, she became the first female to dunk in a tournament game and the first to do it twice in any game.     
   That season, Candace was named the 2006 SEC Tournament MVP, the 2006 SEC Freshmen of the Year, and the 2006 SEC Rookie of the Year. Adding to her extensive list of awards this season, she was named the 2007 SEC Player of the Year. 
   But perhaps her greatest achievement came as she and the Lady Volunteers won the 2007 NCAA Division I women's national basketball championship. 
   Candace Parker is an outstanding athlete and scholar who has done so many impressive things in her short career. Again, I would like to congratulate her and her fellow Lady Volunteers for winning. All of Illinois, and especially the residents of the 13th Congressional District, are proud of Candace and wish her continued success in her endeavors. 
   I look forward to watching Candace and her teammates defend their title next season, perhaps against a team from Illinois.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (SOWING THE SEEDS THROUGH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of the Tauscher-Biggert amendment to H.R. 363, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineer Research Act. 
   While I am pleased to have worked with my colleague from California (Mrs. Tauscher) in developing this amendment, she deserves the credit for the substance of it. I just happen to think she had a great idea, and I am honored to lend my support. 
   Mr. Chairman, we face a world in which our economic competitors in Asia and Europe are making significant new investments in their own research capabilities, in terms of both infrastructure and human capital. These investments are beginning to pay off, as Asia and European countries challenge U.S. leadership in the sciences no matter how it is measured, by number of patterns won, articles submitted to scientific journals, Nobel Prizes won, the percentage of gross domestic product dedicated to research and development, and even the number of degrees awarded. 
   Report after report from the National Academies to the Task Force on the Future of American Innovation has concluded that we need more people with scientific expertise and engineering talent if we are to counter this threat. Only our national security and our economic competitiveness are at stake. 
   Unfortunately, the number of undergraduate degrees and Ph.D.s awarded in the U.S. in science and engineering has been flat or stagnant for over a decade; and of those undergraduates who have obtained a degree in science or engineering, only 28 percent actually go on to get their graduate degree or pursue a career in science and engineering. 
   That is why this amendment is so important. It expands eligibility for the NSF Early Career Awards to the thousands of scientists and engineers who have followed alternative career paths, such as working part-time or in non-academic settings, or who have taken a significant career break but want to get back into the lab. 
   For instance, over 12,000 men and women with doctorates in science or engineering currently are not working because of family responsibilities, according to the most recent statistics compiled by NSF. Of those, over 11,000 are women who may be raising children or caring for a sick parent. Imagine the countless benefits of just getting these 11,000 women back into the lab. 
   But this amendment has the potential to do so much more than that. It provides an opportunity for thousands of other people with scientific expertise and training, men and women, to get the support they need to reenter the scientific and engineering workforce and get back to doing the scientific work that is so important to the competitiveness of our Nation. 
   This amendment also recognizes and rewards those scientist and engineers whose innovative ideas enhance the economic competitiveness of the United States. It does so by making them eligible for the Presidential Innovation Award created by this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, by creating additional opportunities to expand the ranks of scientists and engineers and rewarding them for innovative ideas that make the Nation more economically competitive, this amendment strengthens our ability to innovate. 
   It is our ability to innovate that has made and will make America the envy of the world in terms of our freedoms, our security and our culture, health and prosperity. 
   I thank the ranking member, Mr. Hall, for his support for this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it as well. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (STAR-SPANGLED BANNER AND WAR OF 1812 BICENTENNIAL COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 2894, the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act. It is a great honor to be speaking on this bill brought to the floor by the efforts of my friend and colleague from Maryland, Congressman Ruppersberger. I commend the gentleman for his work on this act. 
   Mr. Speaker, over 200 years ago, a fateful night gave birth to what is now our national anthem, ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' As it is widely known today, Francis Scott Key penned the piece during the War of 1812 after he witnessed the American flag flying resiliently over Fort McHenry after it sustained 25 hours of British bombardment. 
   However, Mr. Speaker, what is often overlooked is the original title of the poem that Key wrote. The piece was entitled, ``In Defense of Fort McHenry.'' I bring this up because I believe it reveals a larger lesson about our Nation. We are, above all things, Americans, bound to serve and protect one another. What affects one citizen, community, or State affects the entire Nation. 
   When Fort McHenry came under attack, the brave patriots there fought for its survival, knowing that a nation depends on their efforts. Significantly, the failure of the British navy to take Fort McHenry proved to be the end of the British naval portion of the war. The attack launched from the great navy base on Bermuda had failed, and at nearly the same time a British land attack towards Baltimore faltered as well. 
   I cannot imagine a more inspiring sight than what Mr. Key saw that morning as the smoke from the British rockets cleared. After witnessing the fearsome and seemingly endless barrage, he must have imagined the worse. Yet, when he set his eyes upon the land, he saw the American flag, symbolizing the resolve of a nation and preserving the freedoms and ideals in the face of any threat. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Nation has endured many trials during its history. From its nascent moments of independence, through the sacking of the Capitol and the White House during the War of 1812, to Pearl Harbor and the attacks of 9/11, the United States has not only survived these tests, but has emerged a stronger union because of such adversity. 
   No matter how overwhelming the odds, men and women have put country above all and weathered each storm. And what has always been true is what was true that fateful morning when Francis Scott Key peered through the clearing smoke: This Nation's flag stands proud, a symbol of strength and spirit. 
   As far as the coin is concerned, surcharges on the sale of the $1 coins will be used to support bicentennial activities, including education and outreach activities, and preservation and improvements to the sites and structures relating to the War of 1812. 
   This event was a proud moment in the Nation's history, Mr. Speaker, and H.R. 2894 recognizes that fact. I urge immediate passage of the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mahoney) for his work on this bill. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the bill and urge my colleagues to support it. 
   In short, the bill makes a technical correction to a law Congress passed in 2003, The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, or FACTA. FACTA currently requires businesses to truncate a customer's credit or debit card number to five numbers. Many businesses complying with this requirement truncated the credit card number, but kept the expiration date of a customer's credit card on the receipt. 
   Very shortly after the FACTA was enacted, hundreds of lawsuits were filed against businesses because the plaintiffs claimed that expiration date should count as part of a customer's credit card number. 
   One such business is Home Run Inn, a family-owned business that makes ``Chicago's Finest Pizza,'' located in Woodridge, Illinois. It was not the intention of Congress to include the expiration date as part of the credit card number and caused this confusion. To my knowledge, no consumer has been harmed or been a victim of identity theft or fraud as a result of his or her credit card expiration date being printed on a receipt. 
   Therefore, this bill clears up the matter. If this bill becomes law, attorneys will no longer be tempted to file lawsuits against businesses, but consumers harmed by a business who was violating FACTA can still file a lawsuit. 
   Again, I urge my colleagues to support the bill and reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today I rise in support of H.R. 406, the Alice Paul Women's Suffrage Congressional Gold Medal Act. This legislation will recognize Alice Paul's role in the women's suffrage movement with the award of the Congressional Gold Medal, Congress's highest civilian honor. 
   It's a great honor to be speaking on this bill authored by my friend and colleague from California, Congressman Baca. I commend the gentleman for his work on this act. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill celebrates the 72-year struggle towards women's suffrage and the woman who devoted her life to that movement, Alice Paul.     
   To many, Alice Paul symbolizes the very spirit of determination and resilience of the suffrage movement. 
   She was born in 1885 to Quaker parents. Alice Paul's childhood was somewhat of an anomaly for the time, because she was raised with the belief of gender equality. In this way, her childhood reflected the vision of the larger society she would work to forge until her death. 
   A graduate of Swarthmore College, a recipient of a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, and a believer in working towards the betterment of society, Alice Paul became an ardent proponent of women's suffrage in 1907 while in London. 
   Upon her return to the United States in 1910, Ms. Paul brought the determination of the English movement to bear on the American campaign. She  joined the National American Women's Suffrage Association and was quickly charged with heading the drive for a Federal suffrage amendment. 
   Recognizing that boldness was needed to accomplish her task, Alice Paul organized a parade comprised of woman to coincide with the inauguration of President Woodrow Wilson. The participating women were attacked with both insults and physical violence. However, the news made headlines and suffrage became a popular topic throughout the Nation. 
   Because of differences on tactics, Alice Paul left Women Suffrage Association and formed the National Woman's Party. Paul and her newly formed party were more aggressively than ever, picketing a war-time President and staging hunger strikes. Such methods were met with vehement opposition from authorities who arrested Paul and members of her group, subjecting them to horrific prison conditions and even attempted to have Paul declared insane. Yet nothing deterred her. Paul continued the march towards enfranchisement. 
   The suffragist's imprisonment and abuse caused a public outcry so strong that President Wilson reversed his position on a suffrage amendment, supporting it as a necessary ``war-time'' measure. It passed the House and Senate in 1919, and was ratified by the necessary three-fourths of States in 1920. In August of 1920 American women gained the right to vote. 
   However, Alice Paul's advocacy did not end with that triumph. In 1923, Alice Paul began her work on the Equal Rights Amendment, the ERA. The amendment was introduced in every session of Congress from 1923 until its passage in 1972. To date, the amendment has never been become part of the U.S. Constitution. It has been ratified by 35 of the necessary 38 States needed to ratify the Constitution. Alice Paul fought for its passage each time. And we continue to fight for it to become an amendment to the U.S. Constitution in honor of Alice Paul. 
   Today, two prominent institutions work to memorialize Paul's life and the progress of the women's movement: The Alice Paul Institute and the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum in Washington. This Congressional Gold Medal will be displayed in an alternating fashion at these two establishments, further honoring Ms. Paul and her legacy. 
   This historic movement and this historic woman gave this Nation so much. H.R. 406 acknowledges this fact, commemorating Alice Paul. I urge its immediate passage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As Mr. Sessions said, after coming back to London, the Chicago publisher William Boyce founded the Boy Scouts of America, and the Scouting movement became so successfully transplanted in the United States that within a few short years, in 1916, the House of Representatives recognized that Boy Scouts of America ``tends to conserve the moral, intellectual, and physical life of the coming generation.'' 
   Those words have remained true generation after generation. And today Boy Scouts of America strives through its Scout outreach program to provide an opportunity for young people to join Scouting regardless of their circumstances, neighborhood, or ethnic background. Boy Scouts of America partners with other charitable organizations such as the Habitat For Humanity, the American Red Cross, and the Salvation Army to help countless citizens across our country as part of the ``Good Turn for America.'' And Boy Scouts reaches beyond its traditional programs to help schools and community organizations build character and enhance self-confidence of all of our youth through Learning for Life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join in recognizing the Boy Scouts of America's 100-year anniversary with a commemorative coin in 2010.

   Madam Speaker, I would like to, first of all, thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires) for his work on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2547, the FDIC Enforcement Enhancement Act. 
   In May I was pleased to join my colleague, Congressman Sires, in introducing this bill which gives the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation new tools to protect our constituents from financial scam artists. 
   After the great stock market crash in 1929 and the numerous bank closures during the Great Depression, Congress passed, in 1933, the Glass-Steagall Act, which created the FDIC. Congress created this independent Federal agency and charged it with a most important mission: To instill and maintain ``the stability and the public's confidence in the Nation's financial system.'' 
   For over 70 years, the FDIC has worked to meet its mission. The FDIC's name, seal, abbreviation, and other indicators are well known, and they are symbols that the public uses to identify a financial institution or a product as being legitimate, federally insured, sound, and supervised. These are easily identifiable FDIC symbols and they can be found in a range of places, from the bank teller's window to a financial institution's Web site. 
   Unfortunately, over the years, criminals have taken advantage of the public's confidence in the FDIC name and used it for malicious purposes. Criminals have fraudulently used the FDIC's name to deceive consumers, most often the elderly, into saving or investing their money in a criminal's illegitimate product offered by a criminal's illegitimate financial institution. 
   For example, some of you may have received or known individuals who have received e-mails from these scam artists. The e-mails, that are actually from criminals, claim to be from the FDIC and request that the e-mail recipient provide highly sensitive, on-line banking information. However, the e-mails are fraudulent and not from the FDIC. 
   Current law prohibits this criminal activity, but H.R. 2547 strengthens the FDIC's enforcement powers so that it can take immediate action against criminals that are fraudulently hiding behind the good name of the FDIC and to immediately stop such criminal activity so that the consumer's money doesn't disappear. 
   The act allows the FDIC to enter cease and desist orders against this conduct and impose fines up to $1 million per day on any person who falsely represents the nature of the product offered or the FDIC's insurance coverage available. In addition, the proposed legislation would clarify the FDIC's authority to seek injunctive relief against such person under the rules of any Federal, State or foreign court of competent jurisdiction. 
   The language of this act is similar or is identical to the act of 2005, the Financial Service Regulatory Relief, section 615, which the Committee on Financial Services approved by a vote of 67-0 in November of 2005. The House has approved this bill by a voice vote. 
   So I would urge my colleagues to again support the language and vote for today's bill. This bill gives the FDIC the ability to help prevent our constituents from becoming victims of financial scam artists and, like Glass-Steagall, aims to give our constituents confidence in the Nation's financial system. 
   Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (BROWNFIELDS REDEVELOPMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 644, the Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act of 2007. I want to commend Congressman Miller of California for introducing this legislation for the fourth time. 
   This bill aims to provide local communities greater access to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's brownfields program to clean up and redevelop contaminated sites. More importantly, the bill will help local communities create new jobs and expand their tax base. 
   The revitalization of brownfields sites has always been a familiar topic in Illinois, as my home State has thousands of these underused or vacant  properties. Brownfields are those sites where redevelopment is complicated by potential environmental contamination. They are less seriously contaminated than those covered under the Superfund Act, and there are an estimated 500,000 of them across the country. 
   HUD administers a brownfields program called the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative, or BEDI. The main purpose of BEDI is to spur economic and community development of the brownfields sites. The problem is that due to a loan guarantee requirement, the program has been underutilized. Over the past 5 years, the Financial Services Committee has sought to make HUD's program more effective, specifically the BEDI program. 
   At hearings, we learned that many communities had been shut out of the BEDI program because they can't get a grant without going through the cumbersome process of applying for a section 108 loan. That is very hard on those smaller communities. 
   Under current law, HUD's brownfields redevelopment projects must be backed by those section 108 guaranteed loans. The section 108 loans require a local community to provide loan security by collateralizing its BEDI project with that community's current and future CDBG allocations. Therefore, many small communities have been hesitant to reply for BEDI because they are unwilling or unable to pledge their block grants as collateral for the guaranteed loans. In short, H.R. 644 amends the HUD Act of 1974 to permit HUD to issue BEDI grants independent of the section 108 loan guarantees. 
   This bill does not create a new program and would not trigger new spending or receipts. This bill will facilitate brownfields redevelopment in thousands of communities across the country, thereby encouraging economic development, expanding communities' tax bases and, most importantly, creating new jobs. 
   I applaud the bill's sponsors for introducing H.R. 644. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1066, the Depository Institution Community Development Investments Enhancement Act, and I want to commend Chairman Frank for introducing this legislation. 
   The regulatory relief legislation that was signed into law last October increased the authority of banks to invest in projects that benefit low and moderate income communities. The legislation increases the allowable percentage of public welfare investments from 10 to 15 percent of a thrift's capital and surplus. Banks currently have this authority. 
   H.R. 1066 would expand this authority in allowing thrifts to invest in distressed areas, as well as the low and moderate income communities. This enhanced authority is important because the need for investment in government-designated disaster areas may not necessarily be confined to low to moderate income areas. 
   H.R. 1066 also would make it easier for banks to invest in projects in devastated and abandoned communities on the gulf coast or to revitalize rural areas that are underserved or distressed. This legislation allows greater opportunities for banks and thrifts to provide housing, community services and jobs to communities throughout our Nation. It also helps these institutions meet their obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act. Since the law was enacted in 1992, existing authority has already generated more than $16 billion of investments. 
   Twice last year legislation similar to H.R. 1066 passed the House overwhelmingly. H.R. 6062, the Community Development Investment Enhancement Act of 2006 passed the House by voice vote in September. The same language also was included in the House passed version of regulatory relief legislation, H.R. 3505, which cleared this body last March by a vote of 415-2, as Chairman Frank noted. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1066. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (GENERAL LEAVE -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, this is starting to feel like Ground Hog Day, the same debate over and over. By my count, this is the eighth time that we have debated SCHIP legislation on the House floor in the 110th Congress. Considering that the most recent debate was on the legislation to extend the program through March of 2009, it is hard for me to understand why the majority finds it necessary to hold this vote. This is time and, more importantly, goodwill that could be better spent discussing legislation that both Republicans and Democrats could support. 
   House Republicans have stated repeatedly the principles that we believe necessary to secure our votes on the legislation to reauthorize SCHIP. Those basic principles include covering low-income children first, SCHIP for kids only, SCHIP should not force children out of private health insurance, SCHIP for U.S. citizens only, and the funding should be stable and equitable. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I have been part of a group of Members from both sides of the aisle and from both Chambers who met for months late last year to find common ground on SCHIP legislation. For my colleagues who took part in these meetings, you know very well that the discussions were productive at times and less productive at other times. But despite our disagreements and the bumps in the road, we persisted and continued to meet because we believe that this is one of the most important issues that this Congress will address. While I believe we were making progress, we ran out of time. However, the extension provided by Congress in December gives us another opportunity to do the right thing. 
   It's the majority prerogative to determine when bills come to the floor, but if Democrats are serious about reauthorizing SCHIP, let's sit down and finish what we started last fall and write a bill that both sides can agree to. Partisan posturing is not going to provide relief to the working families and health coverage for kids.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for working with Members from both sides of the aisle to craft legislation to help consumers secure sound mortgages and shine a light on the mortgage practices from day one of the home-buying process. I would also like to associate myself with the remarks of our distinguished ranking member, Mr. Bachus, and add just a few points. 
   First, I would like to thank Chairman Frank for adding two of my bills to the underlying legislation, H.R. 3019, the Expand and Preserve Homeownership Through Counseling Act, which has become title IV of the bill; and H.R. 3017, the Stop Mortgage Fraud Act, which has become section 212 of the bill. 
   Why are these important? Well, first, for so many, the problems out there could have been avoided through one simple thing: housing counseling. If consumers understand what they are getting into before signing on the dotted line for a mortgage, they would be armed with the ability to make better decisions about a mortgage. Title IV elevates housing counseling within HUD, and the Office of Housing Counseling will expand HUD's capacity to offer grants to States and local agency. 
   The language also tasks HUD with conducting a study on defaults and foreclosures and launching a national housing outreach campaign so that consumers know where to find a legitimate HUD-certified counselor. They can get the help they need now to buy and keep their homes. 
   Second, section 212 of the bill authorizes additional funds for the FBI investigators and Justice Department prosecutors to crack down on mortgage fraud. It's no secret that organized crime gangs, many operating in Chicago, have discovered a more lucrative business than drugs. Mortgage fraud scam artists inflate appraisals, flip properties, and lie about information, such as income and identity on loan applications. 
   Finally, as a former real estate attorney, I know that any mortgage legislation reform should first aim to do no harm. By that, I mean five basic pieces. First, it should preserve access to credit and homeownership opportunities for qualified low- and middle-income borrows; second, facilitate transparency in the mortgage market; third, create a level playing field; fourth, promote strong underwriting standard; and, fifth, foster competition. 
   Achieving these objectives is critical for both primary and secondary mortgage market participants, from homeowners to investors. Has the bill under consideration fully realized these goals? I would say we have come a long way on mortgage reform, but our work is not finished. Today, several Members will offer amendments to improve the bill: the manager's amendment offered by Mr. Frank and Mr. Bachus, and additional amendments by Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite, Mr. Garrett, Mr. Hensarling, Mr. McHenry, Mr. Gary Miller, and Mr. Price. I urge my colleagues to support these amendments. I would like to particularly thank Mr. Kanjorski for working with me on H.R. 3537, which we will offer as an amendment today. 
   It's important for future American homeowners and our economy that we put political agendas aside and get this right. Too much action and we worsen the problem; too little action and we allow it to happen again.

   Overall, this amendment addresses deceptive, abusive and fraudulent mortgage lending practices related to titles on escrow accounts, mortgage servicing and appraisals. We worked hard following our markup last week to clean up language in this amendment regarding the prompt crediting of payments and Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, commonly known as RESPA, liability, in addition to making several more technical changes. 
   We have more to do, especially further developing the language in the payments and escrow sections in this bill; but I'm confident that, based on the bipartisan progress that we've made this far, we can work out our differences as the bill continues to move through the legislative process. 
   Again, I thank Mr. Kanjorski and my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for their hard work and cooperation on this amendment. It has broad bipartisan support, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, there are a few provisions in H.R. 2669 that I believe are very important to students and parents across the country. 
   I support the increases in Pell Grants and cuts to interest rates on federally subsidized student loans provided in H.R. 2669. These provisions are the most effective way we can help low and middle income students achieve the dream of a college education, and I am pleased this bill will provide relief for those students. 
   I am also pleased that the final bill includes a small but very important provision that is similar to legislation I have introduced, the FAFSA Fix for Homeless Kids Act. 
   The current Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, creates insurmountable barriers for unaccompanied homeless youth--youth that are homeless and alone. These children do not receive financial support from their parents, and many do not have access to parental financial information or a parental signature required by the FAFSA. As a result, unaccompanied homeless youth are prevented from accessing the financial aid they need because they cannot supply the information required by the FAFSA. 
   The FAFSA Fix for Homeless Kids Act addresses these barriers by allowing unaccompanied homeless youth to apply for federal financial aid without providing parental income information or a parent signature. This will open the doors of higher education to some of our nation's most vulnerable youth, and I am pleased that H.R. 2669 includes the FAFSA Fix for Homeless Kids Act. 
   While I am encouraged that H.R. 2669 includes these provisions, I still have serious concerns about a number of other provisions in the bill. Specifically, I oppose the mandatory spending in the bill that is directed at institutions and philanthropic organizations. It is unprecedented to provide mandatory spending to these organizations. Instead of creating new and complicated programs, we should have provided additional funding to Pell Grants. 
   I also have concerns about the viability of the Federal Family Education Loan Program. During the last Congress, the Education and the Workforce Committee made $20 billion in changes to the Federal Family Education Loan Program by eliminating and reducing federal subsidies to lenders. Just two years later--certainly not long enough to evaluate the impact of those changes--we are back again squeezing student loan lenders. Does the Democratic leadership expect lenders to continue offering student loans out of the goodness of their hearts? This program is essential to the students and families in my district, and I hope that this legislation is not a back-door attempt to kill the Federal Family Education Loan Program. 
   I support H.R. 2669 because of the additional funding provided for Pell Grants, the decrease in student loan interest rates, and the hope it will give to unaccompanied homeless youth. However, I have serious concerns about the mandatory spending created in H.R. 2669 and the viability of the Federal Family Education Loan Program. I hope that in the future that we can work in a more inclusive manner to address the skyrocketing costs of college without adding to the deficit that students we are trying to help will eventually have to repay.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an issue that means a great deal to me, the education of homeless youth. 
   Shortly before the August recess, this House overwhelmingly passed a resolution commemorating the 20th anniversary of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. In addition to recognizing the positive impact of McKinney-Vento, this resolution called on policymakers to unite behind certain common goals for the future. One of those goals is to improve the access of homeless children and youth to education in the public schools. 
   In order to meet this goal, I invite my colleagues to cosponsor a bill that I recently introduced with Representatives SARBANES and GRIJALVA, H.R. 3205, the Homeless Education Improvement Act of 2007. The bill will extend and improve the successful homeless children and youth programs in NCLB. 
   Mr. Speaker, being without a home should not mean being without an education. I strongly encourage my colleagues to cosponsor the Homeless Education Act.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (TAKING RESPONSIBLE ACTION FOR COMMUNITY SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the TRACS Act legislation being presented here. 
   I thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Oberstar, for all of the work that he has done on this bill, and I'm really very proud to be an original cosponsor on it. 
   I really believe in the rail system. I believe in our transportation system, and I think that we have always put our railroads in a very high context as far as being able to move our goods across this country and being able to ship at a reasonable rate. A situation has come up, something that, I think, is very unfair, and I think it is what this legislation will address. 
   In considering a merger, the STB is required to look at how it affects Congress. If there is just one major rail, just one--a class A--then they don't have the same requirements that other mergers have. If it's a class 1 and more than a class 1, then the STB, the Surface Transportation Board, is required to consider the safety and environmental effect of the proposed transaction, including the effects on local communities: the traffic congestion, the grade crossing, the public safety, the socioeconomic impact, and the traffic congestion--commuter rail and Amtrak. 
   The clarification that we want to make is, if there is just one of the class 1 rails, then they need to take these same things into consideration. 
   Mr. Whitfield of Kentucky talked about the rural area. I think we're really looking at congested areas, when a merger is to take place that will affect an area of densely populated areas such as the suburbs of our great cities. It's not just one area that's going to be affected. Mark my words that these types of merger requirements will affect so many more than just the Chicago area, as was suggested by the chairman of the subcommittee. 
   I don't think that our purpose here today is to kill any merger. It is to clarify and to make sure that there is fairness in what the Surface Transportation Board will look at. Will they look at just the commerce and competitiveness of two rail lines and how it will affect all of the competition between all of the rails or will they also take into account the effect on the public interest and on the communities that are involved? 
   Now, in the area that we've been talking about in Chicago, I have to say that this is an area that has grown up around the railroads. It has increased to such a dense population that socioeconomic issues are affected, that public safety is affected and that traffic congestion is affected. All we want is to clarify that the Surface Transportation Board can take that into account. 
   I have just one other clarification about mitigation. I didn't want to get into specifics, but in this issue, the mitigation would be $30 million. Now, I have in my community a rail crossing that is being put underground, and it has nothing to do with this other line. The cost of that is $53 million to have a separate grade crossing. So, when we talk about $30 million that would affect at least 40 communities and at least 141 rail crossings, I think this is something to consider. 
   So it's just a clarification, and I would urge my colleagues to vote for it. 
   I thank the chairman so much for bringing this up and for having a hearing which, I think, was very open.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (JUBILEE ACT FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING AND EXPANDED DEBT CANCELLATION OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation and applaud Chairman Waters for her hard work on this legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I must admit that I wanted to cosponsor this bill for a very long time, but the bill as introduced had a number of problems for me. But I am pleased to say that they have been resolved, and I want to thank Chairman Frank for offering in the Financial Services Committee a manager's amendment that addressed many of my concerns and allowed me to become a cosponsor and also for the manager's amendment that will be brought up today. So I am pleased to join him and Ranking Member Bachus in offering a manager's amendment today that makes it an even better bill, addressing the most important concerns, including economic conditionality that the administration expressed in its statement of administration policy issued on Monday. 
   Mr. Chairman, over a decade of hard work and determination has produced results for the poorest countries in the world. Poverty has been reduced and living conditions are improving. Today's bill recognizes and builds upon the previous work of this body on debt and development issues, and I hope that this trend will continue. 
   When I served in 2004 and 2005 on the Domestic and International Monetary Policy Subcommittee as the Vice Chair, I was pleased to work with many members of the Financial Services Committee, the administration, and interested organizations to craft legislative language that eventually authorized funding for the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, or MDRI. 
   MDRI expanded the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, HIPC, Initiative of 1999. In short, this historic, U.S.-led initiative called on the international community to provide up to 100 percent of debt relief and performance-based grants to the world's poorest countries. So Congress has since then appropriated about two-thirds of its financial obligation towards MDRI and HIPC. Unfortunately, I think we fall a little bit short on our commitment, but despite this shortfall, the program is working for 41 of the poorest countries in the world: 22 have graduated from the HIPC program, 10 are on their way, and 9 are beginning the process. So I'm pleased that the bill under consideration today, with both the committee and floor managers' amendments, recognizes these facts and seeks to preserve and build upon the impressive progress made under MDRI and HIPC. 
   So why do we need the Jubilee Act? Well, the fundamental purpose of today's legislation is to establish a plan for ``phase two'' of the U.S. debt relief initiative. And that's what we need. The bill sets out to forgive the debt and issue grants to the next group of the world's poorest countries, 24 in total, which do not currently qualify under HIPC self-sufficiency and sustainable debt initiatives. Importantly, it also seeks to prevent these countries from entering new lending post-relief debt so that they don't squander the economic and social progress achieved through the debt relief. 
   I would like to note that the statement of administration policy on this bill recognizes that debt relief should be tied to economic conditionality to ensure that it will promote economic growth and provide real benefits to the poor. In addition, the bill including the manager's amendment, would ensure that countries eligible for debt relief don't have excessive levels of military expenditures, don't support acts of international terrorism, are cooperating with the U.S. on international narcotics control matters, and are complying with the U.S. standards to eliminate human trafficking and are working with the U.S. to stop illegal immigration to the U.S. 
   I worked really closely with constituents from my district, and I really want to thank Sister Sheila Kinsey, Dan Driscoll-Shaw, Ron Durbin, and my other constituents too numerous to mention here for their guidance, their compassion, and encouragement of this bill. It's an honor to work with them. 
   As I close, I just want to say that the important part of our discussion today is to recognize that the ultimate goal of both ``phase one'' and now ``phase two'' of the U.S. international debt relief and poverty reduction initiatives is to improve the life of the people of impoverished countries around the world, and this is going to happen because of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CONSUMER PROTECTION WEEK -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for House Resolution 94, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Consumer Protection Week. 
   Now in its ninth year, this special week brings together a diverse array of public and private organizations in support of one common goal, ensuring that Americans have the knowledge and financial savvy they need to be responsible consumers and to protect themselves in the marketplace. 
   There have always been those who would prey on the unwary consumer, be it through misleading claims or fraudulent practices. And as more and more Americans begin conducting transactions on the Internet, or with the use of other rapidly changing technologies, we must actively educate ourselves against new and evolving threats. 
   Among the most serious risks today consumers face is identity theft. In Illinois alone, we had over 11,000 reports of identity theft in just 1 year. According to the FTC, Illinois ranks among the top 10 States where consumers are most likely to have their personal information compromised. And yet, by following just a few simple tips, consumers are better able to recognize frauds and can significantly reduce the likelihood that their private information will fall into the wrong hands. 
   In many cases, the wisest and safest consumers are those who simply, with the best understanding, make their choices. Whether it is paying for college, saving for retirement or shopping for a mortgage on a first home, many Americans just don't know where to look to learn about the scores of options that are available to them. 
   That is why, Mr. Speaker, in February 2005, I joined with my friend and distinguished colleague, Representative Hinojosa, to establish the Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus. We began this caucus to ensure that Congress did its part, not just to protect consumers but to empower them. We wanted to make certain that Americans of all ages and all walks of life have access to the tools and the educational resources they need to ensure the economic security of their families. 
   Today, we have the opportunity to do just that. We can join the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Postal Service, the AARP, Better Business Bureaus of America, and hundreds of other consumer advocates across the country that have collaborated to make National Consumer Protection Week a success. 
   Together, we can raise the awareness, not just of pitfalls in the marketplace, but the wealth of information and options available to consumers. One such resource, as Representative Hinojosa said, is consumer.gov, a Federal Web site that provides one-stop shopping for information on everything from avoiding identity theft to finding savings at the gasoline pump. 
   I would like to also take this opportunity to thank my friend from Texas and cochair of the Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus, Mr. Hinojosa, for working so hard on today's resolution, and his tireless effort on financial education issues. 
   In addition, my thanks go out to Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton of the Energy and Commerce Committee for helping to bring this resolution to the floor in such a timely and bipartisan manner. 
   And finally, I would like to thank the distinguished gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) for managing our resolution here today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to sponsor House Resolution 94, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 57, a resolution congratulating Illinois State, as it celebrates on February 15 its 150th anniversary of its founding. I would like to thank my good friend, Mr. Weller of Illinois, for introducing this resolution and recognizing the important role Illinois State University plays in educating the citizens of Illinois and many other States in the Nation. 
   With more than 20,000 students, Illinois State University is a large-scale university with a small-college feel. Of the 20,000 students, there are 3,000 students enrolled in graduate degree programs. In addition to a number of graduate certificates, Illinois State offers 63 undergraduate programs and over 47 master's degrees, specialist and doctoral degree programs. 
   Illinois State University has been ranked as one of the 100 best values in public education by Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine. ISU actually jumped four spots, from 83 to 79, in Kiplinger's newest edition and was only one of two State schools to make the list. 
   Sixty-six percent of Illinois State University students receive financial aid, and the school has a low default rate of 2 percent, well under the national default rate of 4.5 percent. 
   Illinois State also recognizes the importance of educating students to become good teachers. Founded by Jesse Fell in 1847, Illinois State was the first public university in Illinois and was quickly established as a teachers' education institution. 
   Now, 150 years later, the university is the second largest producer of teacher education degrees in the country. In fact one in seven Illinois teachers holds a degree from Illinois State. Mr. Speaker, Illinois State University is a remarkable institution, and I would like to congratulate all of those students, the alumni and past and present employees on all that they have accomplished over the past 150 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1495. My district in Illinois represents the front line in the fight to keep the Asian carp from decimating the ecosystem of the Great Lakes and endangering a multi-million dollar commercial fishing industry.     
   Competing with native species for food, living space, and spawning areas, these voracious fish grow to between 50 and 150 pounds, eat up to 40 percent of their body weight every day, and each female can carry up to a million eggs. 
   The bill before us today will enable the Army Corps of Engineers to fortify its aquatic and invasive species dispersal barrier, an invisible, underwater, electric fence on the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal in Illinois that repulses fish like the Asian carp. 
   That is why I rise today, to thank Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica, as well as Subcommittee Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Baker, for recognizing the continuing threat of the Asian carp and including provisions in this bill to protect the Great Lakes. Our Great Lakes are too important just to leave them vulnerable to invasive species like the Asian carp.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding to me. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to say good-bye to a good man and a cherished colleague. Chairman Lantos was one of those most respected and distinguished Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, and he will be missed. 
   During his 14 terms in this body, he championed the causes of people everywhere who face oppression and cruelty. Through his leadership of both the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Human Rights Caucus, he guided U.S. policy with morality and integrity. 
   As I listened to Ms. Eshoo, she used the same words as I would say of him. He was truly a gentleman, one of those rare breeds of old world statesmen who brings clarity and respect to our national debate. And while he was indeed an accomplished speaker, Chairman Lantos inspired not only by his words but by his own personal story. I think we will all remember him standing here in this Chamber, straight rail posture, and saying ``after you, my dear,'' always the gentleman. 
   From his tragic experiences in the Nazi camps to his rise in Congress, he showed how one truly remarkable individual can overcome the worst sort of tyranny and achieve great things. 
   So to Chairman Lantos's wife and daughters and grandchildren and great grandchildren, I send my thoughts and prayers. We can all take comfort in the fact that he had a full life with a legacy that will never be forgotten.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise to support House Resolution 526, recognizing homeownership and responsible lending. As the ranking member of the House Committee on Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, I want to thank the gentleman from Maryland, Representative Cummings, and Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Maloney for working in a cooperative fashion to ensure that the language protects borrowers while preserving access to homeownership opportunities. 
   Over the past several years, the housing market has helped to drive the national economy as Americans bought and refinanced homes in record numbers. The benefits of homeownership are undeniable. For this reason, there has been a significant focus on improving homeownership opportunities for everyone, including the low-income borrower. At the same time, the subprime market has flourished and provided credit to many families that may not have qualified under conventional standards. 
   Today, this country enjoys record-high homeownership rates. More than 68 million Americans own a home. Of this 68 million, 50 million homeowners have a mortgage, and 13 million of them have a subprime loan. According to a recent Chicago Tribune article, ``Subprime loans, often with adjustable rates, made homeownership possible for millions of Americans whose credit ratings or income levels made them ineligible for cheaper prime loans.'' 
   However, of the 13 million subprime loans, roughly 5 percent of them are entering foreclosure. According to the data released by the Mortgage Bankers Association, these numbers are on the rise. These mortgage foreclosure rates raise eyebrows and call into question what actions are to be taken to help homeowners keep their homes, and I would like to emphasize the word ``action.'' While I believe that this resolution under consideration outlines many important facts, most of which Americans have seen printed in the news for months, it does not take action. The resolution tells the House something that we already have authority to do, and that is to take action. 
   Americans are waiting for the leadership of this House to exercise that authority. We can talk about the increase in foreclosure rates until we are blue in the face, and why is the leadership in this House waiting. The fact of the matter is, this body needs to join forces with the folks in the public and private sectors to take action immediately. 
   What it is we should be doing right now is to ensure that the 650,000 homeowners and others who may follow can keep their homes. First we can and should pass a Federal Housing Administration modernization bill. I introduced H.R. 1752, the Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007, a bill  identical to the one that passed the House last July by a strong bipartisan vote of 415-7. 
   However, on the same day, two of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle introduced another FHA reform bill that includes a new and controversial housing trust fund provision. This trust fund provision has stalled the bill. So while the other side of the aisle is holding out for a brand-new trust fund, millions of Americans may lose their homes in 2007 because they did not have the refinancing option that a modernized FHA could have offered them. 
   In testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Assistant Secretary for Housing Brian D. Montgomery urged Congress to pass an FHA reform bill and said FHA could help hundreds of thousands of additional borrowers to secure a safe and affordable mortgage. He said that the best thing to help subprime borrowers is to reform FHA, and he added that HUD is prepared to immediately implement FHA reforms. 
   Second, this resolution mentions we can immediately increase opportunities for housing counseling. It also says that we should raise public awareness. I think that first by advertising available resources we can both raise public awareness and increase opportunities for housing counseling. It is crucial to promote financial literacy and educate our youth and adults. This is the most direct way of ensuring that consumers understand the terms of their loan so that they may avoid predatory loans and foreclosure altogether. 
   I am pleased that on June 25, Neighborhood Works America and the Ad Council launched a national ad campaign aimed at preventing home foreclosures. Homeowners in trouble can try to save their homes by calling a hotline, 888-995-HOPE, a number provided by the Homeowner Preservation Foundation. 
   In addition, we have about 2,300 HUD-certified housing counseling agencies across the country. Americans should know they can visit HUD's Web site or call 800-569-4287 to find a HUD-certified counselor in their neighborhood. HUD-certified counselors can give straightforward and free or low-cost advice to potential or existing homeowners about buying a home, refinancing a mortgage, or preventing foreclosure. 
   Third, we need to address the root problems resulting from predatory or bad subprime loans. The Federal regulators have recently stepped up to the plate and tried to address the increasing number of foreclosures through interagency guidance on subprime loans. The guidance to mortgage lenders focuses on loans in the subprime market, particularly adjustable rate mortgage products. It specifies that a lender's assessment or a consumer's ability to repay should be based on the fully indexed rate, assuming a fully amortized repayment schedule. The guidance also focuses on the need for clear and balanced communication to the borrower with regard to mortgage loan benefits. 
   I support these efforts, but there is much more to do. I know that the issue of mortgage fraud is hot in the Chicago area. We need to ensure that law enforcement has the necessary tools and resources to crack down on fraudulent activities. 
   Finally, I support this resolution because I agree with my colleagues on the importance of shedding some light on actions that Congress or Federal regulators can take to help homeowners enter into realistic and affordable loans in the future. As we consider our options to take action at the Federal level to help Americans keep and own their homes, I would urge my colleagues to carefully weigh the potential consequences of such actions. 
   We should allow secondary mortgage markets to adjust to the rise in foreclosures accordingly and to continue to supply liquidity to the primary mortgage market. Simultaneously, we should take immediate action. We need to pass FHA modernization now, and we need to ensure that people continue to have immediate access to financial education and counseling, credit, and viable mortgage options so that people in future generations can realize the American Dream of homeownership. 
   Again, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) for his hard work on this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the ranking member, the gentleman from Texas, for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of H.R. 5940, I rise to express my continued support for the bill that we are considering here today. 
   Most Americans learn in grade school and high school that atoms are building blocks of nature. In the years since I was in school, incredible machines  have allowed us to even see every one of these atoms. But now, thanks to the National Nanotechnology Initiative, or NNI, we have developed and continue to develop the tools, equipment and expertise to manipulate those atoms and build new materials and new machines, one molecule at a time. 
   First established in 2001 and later authorized in statute in 2003, the NNI has by all accounts succeeded at coordinating nanotechnology research and development across many Federal agencies to the benefit of our national competitiveness. According to a recent review of the program by the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, PCAST, the United States has been and remains the recognized leader in nanotechnology R&D. But the Council rightly pointed out that the European Union and China are gaining ground on us. That is why I am pleased that we are building on the success of NNI by passing H.R. 5940 today. 
   Thanks to the NNI, the U.S. has an extensive network of nanoscale science research centers. Five of those centers are operated and maintained by the Department of Energy's Office of Science. One of those DOE centers, the Center for Nanoscale Materials, is located in my district at Argonne National Laboratory. 
   In its first year of operation, Argonne's Center for Nanoscale Materials hosted over 100 scientists and engineers engaged in nanotech research from across the country and around the world, giving them access to the most powerful x-ray device in the Western Hemisphere at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne.     
   As Americans face ever rising gasoline and energy prices, we are fortunate that Congress and the President had the foresight to invest in the DOE's nanoscience centers. Because of our Federal investment in years past, scientists and engineers are already hard at work manipulating atoms to create new, lighter, stronger materials for wind turbines, improved lubricants for gear boxes, and better wiring for generators, all of which will improve the efficiency of wind power. DOE scientists are also using nanotechnology to make more durable and efficient solar cells, catalysts for the direct conversion of light energy to hydrogen, new materials for lighter, more powerful, longer lasting batteries that will improve energy storage and bring the plug-in hybrid car to market more quickly. Thanks to nanotechnology, progress is being made on advanced energy technologies that will reduce our reliance on foreign oil and gas. 
   But to continue making progress, Congress must provide adequate funding for these critical facilities and research efforts. Unfortunately, because the fiscal year 2008 omnibus bill essentially flat funded the basic energy science program, the DOE had no choice but to reduce the run time of scientific user facilities like the advanced photon source by 20 percent. Without a doubt, this will impact the work at the Center for Nanoscale Materials which relies on the APS. 
   I remain hopeful that the fiscal year 2008 supplemental working its way through Congress now will include additional funding for these important facilities and research efforts of the DOE. With that in mind, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Madam Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to H.R. 3021. I support giving schools some Federal assistance when it comes to school construction. In fact, I've sponsored legislation in the past that would provide interest-free and low-interest loans to States and localities to support school construction, renovation and repair. 
   I represent some of the fastest growing communities in the country, and I know how school districts are constantly struggling to meet the growing demand for space and resources. 
   I also support the greening of our schools. I'm a cosponsor of H.R. 6065, which will provide schools with small grants to make green and energy efficient improvements for their schools. 
   Much as I would like to join the supporters of H.R. 3021, let me remind them of the promises that we've already made to schools, but yet not met. In 1975, in passing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, Congress made a commitment to fund 40 percent of the cost of educating children with disabilities. Yet for fiscal year 2008, Congress appropriated only $11.3 billion for this purpose, a mere 17 percent of the funds originally promised.     
   Is this an anomaly? Not at all. Congress has never delivered more than 18.5 percent of the money we promised for IDEA. 
   What I hear over and over again from teachers and school boards and administrators in my district is, When are you going to meet your commitments on IDEA and NCLB? How about meeting our commitments under No Child Left Behind? NCLB was authorized at $25 billion, but Congress has just provided less than $14 billion. 
   Despite these unmet commitments, Congress is positioned today to make another Federal commitment on school spending. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that H.R. 3021 would increase discretionary spending by $20.3 over a 5-year period. With this funding, we could meet our commitments to IDEA and increase funding for NCLB by $5 billion over the next 5 years. I realize this is a back-of-the-envelope calculation. But I think it gives Members a better idea of what we could be accomplishing with this money. 
   As a former school board president, I well know that school construction is the responsibility of State and local governments. I support fiscally responsible proposals to facilitate State and local government investments in school infrastructure, but I cannot support authorizing billions of dollars in new spending when we cannot fulfill our current commitments to schools and children. 
   When Congress has fully funded IDEA and NCLB, I will be very happy to revisit this issue with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But until then, I think the top Federal priorities should be meeting our commitments and improving student achievement.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4, which would provide less choice and no savings. I think my friends on the other side of the aisle failed to mention some of the negative aspects of the veterans drug plan, which they are now highlighting as a model for government negotiation. 
   I know they haven't highlighted the fact that many widely used drugs, including Lipitor, the most widely used drug in America, isn't even available through the VA plan. I wonder if my friends on the other side of the aisle are prepared to tell their seniors why they can't get Lipitor. 
   Are they prepared to tell them they can't go to their local pharmacy, but have to go to a VA pharmacy, which could be hundreds of miles away, or they have to order their drugs through the mail? I wonder why one-third of the veterans have already moved to the part D plan. 
   Personally, I know my seniors would want to be able to choose a drug plan that gets them the best deal for the drugs they use. They don't want to be locked into a one-size-fits-all plan that  doesn't cover their drugs, especially since the CBO says it won't save them any money. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4, which would provide less choice and no savings. 
   This morning, as I reviewed all of the letters of support and opposition on this bill, I was struck by the lack of patient group support for this legislation. I could not find a single letter from the American Cancer Society, any diabetes group, or the American Heart Association supporting government negotiation under Medicare Part D. 
   What I did find was a letter from the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Greater Chicago, in opposition to the bill, which I think represents the views of all these groups. 
   It states, and I quote, ``To date, government interventions in prescription medication pricing, at the federal and state levels, have resulted in policies restricting access to medications.''

   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which will boost economic activity and help strengthen the American housing market. I am pleased that the House and Senate leaders from both sides of the aisle have been able to reach agreement on a well-balanced compromise. I also applaud our colleagues in the Senate for resisting pressure from those who would delay this package with inappropriate changes and unnecessary spending. 
   Hardworking Americans are finding it more and more difficult to provide for their families, and this bill will help to relieve some of the financial strain. And because it is a clean and targeted package, this bill will provide the greater economy with a much-needed jolt of consumer activity. 
   As a member of the Financial Services Committee, I especially appreciate that the Senate preserved the House-passed provisions to increase conforming loan limits for the FHA- and  GSE-backed home mortgages. This is a critical change that will help invigorate the housing market and enable prospective homeowners in higher priced markets like Chicago to take advantage of these prime mortgage products. 
   I think this bill is a testimony of what can be accomplished in Washington when Congress and the administration set aside the partisan rhetoric and work together. 
   And I want to urge my colleagues to turn next to comprehensive FHA reform. I think it's great that Chairman Frank has committed to Ranking Member Bachus that we will be working on the FHA reform. So we took the first steps today by increasing the conforming loan limits, but to truly restore the housing sector, we need to give more consumers an alternative to subprime and predatory products. The FHA can provide that alternative but not until the House and Senate conference their respective FHA reform bills. So by sending this legislation to the President, we can help hundreds of thousands of families facing foreclosure qualify for prime rate refinancing so they can keep their homes. 
   Again, I applaud the bill before us as a truly good step toward restoring vigorous economic growth, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on legislation to address our long-term economic challenges.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like first to thank all of my colleagues and their staffs from both sides of the aisle for working to craft a bipartisan section 8 reform bill that we are considering today. In particular I would like to thank Chairman Frank and Subcommittee Chairwoman Waters for their hard work, committee Ranking Member Bachus for his support, and the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Shays, who joined me as an original cosponsor of this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a bipartisan bill that passed out of our committee by a vote of 52-9. It is similar to the section 8 reform bill that then Chairman Oxley moved through the Financial Services Committee during the last Congress. It was a bipartisan bill then too, passing out of the committee by a voice vote. 
   The section 8, or Housing Choice Voucher Program, is the major Federal program helping the elderly, the disabled and the very low-income families find affordable housing in the private market. Today's housing vouchers are the primary tool of assistance provided under section 8. 
   Many of my colleagues served in this body when housing vouchers were first proposed and implemented under a Republican administration, that of President Reagan. The Section 8 Voucher Program was designed to move people away from large concentrated housing projects, like our Cabrini-Green or Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago. It allows individuals to make decisions about where they want to live, instead of forcing them to live in large public housing projects filled with crime, poverty and despair. 
   For the colleagues on my side of the aisle, I should admit, quite frankly, that this bill is better than I expected it to be. We have been able to get several key issues addressed in this bill that were not addressed in last year's Republican legislation. 
   I want to thank Chairman Waters, who coauthored with me a manager's amendment that the committee accepted during our markup that includes a number of provisions to increase the flexibility of project-based section 8 vouchers. It amended section 8 of the law regarding the use of vouchers to purchase manufactured homes, voucher reserves, portability, performance assessment, disabled vouchers and rent levels. 
   In addition, I am pleased that included in this bill is language that is identical to the Family Self-Sufficiency Act, or FSS, a bill that I introduced as a stand-alone measure. This  bill enhances HUD's FSS program by providing housing authorities with consistent coordinator funding. Housing authorities can then help more individuals move from public assistance to being self-sufficient homeowners. 
   Perhaps most important for Members on my side of the aisle is that this bill includes a significant expansion of Moving to Work, or the MTW program. Members on both sides of the aisle have public housing authorities in their district that seek to become Moving to Work housing authorities. 
   In my district, DuPage Housing Authority would like this status. However, to date, Congress has only authorized 32 housing authorities to be MTWs. During the committee markup, we increased the authorization to a total of 80, which is a remarkable achievement. In addition, the Moving to Work provisions in this bill require HUD to craft standards that will govern eligibility requirements from being considered and/or designated as a Moving to Work authority. This bill includes important tenant protections that make the MTW Program better than it is today. 
   Finally, I am also pleased that we included a provision that will measure the success of the program. Congress created the Moving to Work program in 1996, but it does not require HUD to establish standards and evaluate agencies' performance.     
   Now granted, the administration does not support this bill, nor did it support the Oxley bill last year or in the previous Congress. 
   Why? Well, because in their view, it does not reform the program enough. They believe it moves the program from one that is currently budget based to a unit-based system that Mr. Knollenberg spoke about earlier. But I think that point is subject to interpretation. And politics is the art of the possible; and absent this bill, no reform is possible. 
   This bill does not include everything that I wanted either. The section 8 funding formula my colleagues will recall was changed in the CR earlier this year. I have on several occasions offered amendments in committee to address this formula change, and we did include in the manager's amendment a provision that will provide PHAs a cushion in the transition year so they are not penalized for CR formula change. 
   I believe there is more work to be done. There are 1,200 PHAs. Half of those across the country do not suffer from unjustified and significant funding cuts as a result of the new section 8 funding formula included in the CR. 
   Chairman Frank has agreed to engage in a colloquy with me about this, and I look forward to doing that in a few moments. I hope we will continue to work together as we continue to address the continued shortcomings of this formula. 
   This is a good bill and one deserving of our support, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentlewoman, and I would like to engage in a colloquy with Chairman Frank at this time. 
   Chairman Frank, as you may recall, the section 8 funding formula was changed through provisions in the continuing resolution. I did not support these changes because they did cut about 1,500 public housing authority slots in three counties in my congressional district. And as Chairman Frank can verify, I have on several occasions offered amendments to change this. 
   I am pleased that the manager's amendment includes a provision which addresses this problem. While I am pleased that we can take productive steps towards addressing the shortcomings, I believe we can do more as we move on, and it is my understanding that members of the Appropriations Committee have included a similar provision in the fiscal year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Appropriations bill. Would the chairman consider supporting this?

   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman. 
   Again regarding the rebenchmarking, both the current formula and the one in this bill would base a PHA's annual funding level on a ``snapshot'' of the PHA's use of funds from the previous 12 months. However, I continue to be concerned that his annual benchmarking is unworkable when coupled with the congressional budget cycle. For this reason, I hope we can continue to work together as we move forward to address the continued shortcomings of this formula. PHAs have always stated and continue to argue that their main concern is to have predictability and certainty in funding so they can plan both voucher utilization and staffing. I know they would appreciate more predictability. If the snapshot and the rebenchmarking were done every other year, would the chairman continue to explore with me the benefits of a biennial versus annual rebenchmarking?

   In addition, I would like to ask the chairman to consider other measures to assist PHAs in the transition period and in the subsequent years. For example, I would like the chairman to consider a so-called hold-harmless provision attached to the new section 8 formula. The provision would provide PHAs with an assurance that they would not lose more than a certain percentage of funds in any given year due to the utilization rates in the previous years. The reasons for this are many, but at the heart of the matter is the simple fact that the so-called excess in funds that many PHAs were caught with when the new formula was dropped into the CR were not in fact excess at all but the result of deliberate choices, court-ordered requirements or special set-aside categories of  vouchers. The PHAs should not be losing all of these vouchers in the first year. The percentage could range from perhaps 10 to 25 percent. And again, PHAs deserve stability and predictability in funding. Would the chairman work with me to craft a hold-harmless provision to include in this bill or the appropriations bill?

   The Violence Against Women Act reauthorized and signed into law by President Bush in 2005 ensured that victims of domestic violence would not be evicted from public or section 8 housing for screaming for help, for calling the police or simply for being the victim of a crime. However, one provision of H.R. 1851 inadvertently removes these protections from certain public housing authorities, leaving victims in these housing authorities with inconsistent or no protection. 
   I think that the Housing Innovation Program provisions in SEVRA exempt high-performing public housing authorities from certain Federal regulations, giving them a measure of regulatory reform. Unfortunately, some of the VAWA protections were among those that would no longer apply to these high-performing housing authorities. This would create confusion for public housing authorities and leave victims vulnerable to eviction after an assault. 
   I support the amendment, and appreciate this being added to the bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. I thank the gentlelady for supporting my amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Vel&#225;zquez). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1851, SECTION 8 VOUCHER REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in reluctant opposition to this rule governing the consideration of H.R. 1851. 
   I had hoped that the committee would see the wisdom in providing an important open rule on this important legislation; and in the absence of an open rule, that it would at least make in order those amendments that Members took the time and effort to draft. Unfortunately, of the 23 amendments filed with the Rules Committee, only six were made in order. While I'm pleased that the majority of those amendments are Republican amendments, the other Republican and Democratic amendments deserved to be debated and given a full and fair hearing. 
   Section 8 vouchers are tenant-based as well as project-based subsidies that low-income families use in the private market to lower their rental cost to 30 percent of their incomes. The program has grown to replace public housing as the primary tool for subsidizing the housing costs of low-income families. 
   Through this program, HUD provides portable subsidies to individuals, tenant-based, who are seeking rental housing from qualified and approved owners, and provide subsidies to private property owners who set aside some or all of their units for low-income families. This is project-based. 
   The section 8 program began in 1974 primarily as a project-based rental assistance program. However, in the mid-1980s project-based assistance came under criticism for being too costly and for concentrating poor families in high-poverty areas. Consequently, in 1983, Congress stopped providing new project-based section 8 contracts and created vouchers as a new form of assistance. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill reflects a bipartisan effort led by Chairman Frank, Chairwoman Waters and Republican members of the committee. In fact, this bill enjoyed substantial Republican support in the Financial Services Committee. I am an original cosponsor, along with Mr. Shays. 
   During committee deliberation, we were given the opportunity to debate and consider a variety of issues pertaining to this bill. Members on our side of the aisle had hoped to be given the same opportunity to debate important issues on the House floor. For example, the amendment filed by my colleagues, Mr. Price, Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite, Mrs. Capito and Mr. Campbell, requiring proper documentation when seeking section 8 Federal assistance was not made in order. This is an important amendment, and I would have hoped we would have the opportunity to debate that issue fully. 
   There were other amendments filed my by colleagues, Congressmen CHABOT, KING and WICKER, that I think deserve to be considered by the full House. These Members do not serve on the Financial Services Committee and should have been given the chance to offer amendments crucial to their constituents and districts. 
   Republicans support many aspects of H.R. 1851, but we all deserve the right to participate in the amendment process, whether as members of the committee of jurisdiction or as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Only through an open rule is that possible. For this reason, as a supporter of this legislation, I rise in reluctant opposition to the rule.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman, I don't know how it's possible, but this bill makes a bad sugar program even worse. Chicago was once referred to as the candy capital of the world because of our strong confectionery and manufacturing industry, but thanks to the sugar program and sugar subsidies, nearly one-third of the jobs in the industry have been lost. 
   This farm bill goes backward, not forward. Instead of recognizing the reality that the sugar program has cost American manufacturing jobs, this bill increases sugar price supports and widens the gap between U.S. and world prices. 
   I strongly support Mr. Davis and Mr. Kirk's amendment to keep cane refinery and food manufacturing jobs in the United States. This is a good amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote for its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this nonbinding resolution. I  cannot support it for it neither supports our troops nor offers an alternative plan. It is symbolic, it is partisan, it is cynical, and it is meaningless. 
   The leadership of this body is taking the easy route: criticize the other guy's plan but don't offer your own. Call up your own nonbinding resolution, but don't allow votes on resolutions that actually have substance. Position yourselves for the next elections but not for the next wave of terrorism attacks. Win the White House, but lose the war on terror. 
   There is no doubt that the voters spoke in the last election. They are not happy with the war. Few, if any of us, are satisfied with the progress made in Iraq. I know I am not. Neither are my constituents. Their patience and that of all Americans has run thin. 
   For too long we pursued an open-ended commitment without well-defined goals and clear benchmarks for success. We also pursued a strategy that placed too heavy a burden on our troops and too light an expectation of the Iraqi Government. But I want to remind my colleagues that the voters will speak again if we don't get this right. And I say ``we'' because it is all of us. If we don't put aside the partisan positioning and work together for the good of this country, we all will lose more than just our seats in this body. 
   It is not enough to point the finger and say that the President is wrong, and wait for the returns to come in. It is not enough to disapprove and criticize and say It is not my job. He is the Commander in Chief. And it is not enough to turn around and through this resolution say you support troops that have been or are serving in Iraq, but not those who may go in as replacements, rotations, or as part of the new temporary deployment. This is why we should be using this opportunity, not to take a symbolic vote of no confidence in our Commander in Chief, but to discuss real options for the way forward in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have been there several times. I have been to the red zone, visited the convention center where the Iraqi Parliament meets, and was there as Prime Minister Maliki presented his reconciliation plan. I met with our military commanders. I have listened to our soldiers who patrol the streets in Baghdad, and I have talked with democratically elected Iraqi leaders about their hopes for the future. The one thing that was very clear to me is that only the Iraqi Government can take the tough steps that will achieve reconciliation and an end to sectarian violence. 
   So now Prime Minister Maliki has stepped forward and asked our President for specific assistance in securing Baghdad. In response, President Bush's commanders have drawn up a plan. The President proposed a new commander on the ground, General Petraeus, who was confirmed by the other body in a bipartisan, unanimous vote of 81-0. 
   We urged the creation of a bipartisan Iraqi Study Group comprised of our country's most distinguished and seasoned experts and asked their advice. Among the key items they supported was a temporary surge in troop strength if called for by the commanders on the ground. ``As Baghdad goes, so goes Iraq,'' they pointed out. 
   These are all steps in the right direction. But what would approving this resolution signal to the world? That we tell the Iraqi people to take the tough steps, but then we deny them the support they need to do so? That we urge the creation of a bipartisan commission to give us guidance and then reject its advice? That we unanimously confirm a new general on the ground and then we deny him his plan? That we support our troops, but not their replacements? 
   These are not the messages that I want to send. We owe it to our troops and to those who have given their lives to give the Iraqis one last chance to show that they are willing to fight for and take responsibility for the future of their own country. But we have to exercise our constitutional powers and hold them to it, and we have to stop signaling that the best Congress can offer is a big, nonbinding ``no'' to someone else's plan. 
   So today I am cosponsoring legislation, H.R. 1062, that will do just that: hold the administration, and the Iraqi Government, accountable in achieving clear benchmarks. It requires the President to report to Congress every 30 days on the extent to which the government of Iraq is moving forward on more than a dozen fronts, from troop training and security to rebuilding, reconciliation, international cooperation, and enforcing the rule of law. It also requires progress reports on the implementation of strategies that will prevent Iraqi territory from becoming a safe haven for terrorist activities. 
   Most significantly, H.R. 1062 exercises the full constitutional powers of this body, not through a symbolic expression of discontent, but through vigorous oversight and true accountability. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1062 and reject the resolution before us.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (PROTECT AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a matter of great urgency. In just a few short days, the legislation that permits our intelligence community to monitor terrorist communications will expire. This law, known as the Protect America Act, is a vital tool used by American agents to quickly intercept and act upon electronic communications between foreign terrorists. 
   Just last summer, we passed this law because Congress recognized that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 was not designed to govern the surveillance of modern telecommunications, the same electronic communications that groups like al Qaeda are using to plan attacks against U.S. citizens. I, for one, still believe that intelligence analysts shouldn't need to consult with lawyers every time a suspected terrorist buys a new disposable cell phone. But unless we act before February 1, that is exactly the kind of legal delay that our intelligence agents will face. 
   So let's abandon the partisan rhetoric and enact a long-term reauthorization of this important law, and let's do so without adding new bureaucratic hurdles or exposing private communication companies to unjustified lawsuits. Our men and women on the front lines deserve every tool we can give them to intercept and interrupt terrorist plots. The American people count on them to keep us safe. Let's pass this law.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, Americans across the country and in my congressional district are feeling the pain as a result of the instability in the housing market, and they're feeling the pinch at the pump because of high energy prices. Congress should act responsibly to address both issues. We need a serious energy debate now. The American people cannot wait any longer. At the same time, it is clear that we need to restore investor confidence in the housing market. And that is why we're here today. 
   For starters, we need to pass critical housing reform bills, an effort that could have been a slam-dunk last year. We could have given the regulators some teeth to shore up our financial institutions and prevent similar turbulence in the housing market in the future. But we did not. Instead, critical housing bills were littered with controversial provisions, and the process was drawn out. 
   So here we are today, at a ``take-it-or-leave-it'' moment, considering a number of items that should not be on the table but are, unfortunately, fused to the three most important parts of the housing stimulus legislation. 
   I feel like we're in a catch-22 here, for in order to enact the good, we have to swallow the bad. What is the good? It's restoring investor confidence in the market, plain and simple. It's also GSE reform, FHA reform and increased funding for housing counseling, all of which are badly needed and long overdue. 
   Counselors can help prevent foreclosures by guiding homeowners into a loan that best meets their budget needs. My colleague, Rub&#233;n Hinojosa, and I have been two of the leading advocates in Congress for financial literacy, which includes housing counseling. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of housing counseling for homeowners in trouble or those seeking to purchase a home for the first time. Counselors are working hard in my congressional district helping people save their homes. I would like to thank them and all of the counselors across the country. And I'm hopeful that this bill gives them more tools to accomplish their mission. 
   The FHA and GSE reforms in this bill will add much-needed liquidity to the market while providing consumers with an alternative to bad, subprime loans. 
   I'm also pleased that the FHA reform bill increases the loan limits so that the low- and middle-income Americans living in the high-cost areas like Chicagoland also can secure their piece of the American Dream through FHA-backed mortgages. The GSE reform bill will rein in Fannie and Freddie so that these housing giants will more safely and soundly adhere to their missions to foster affordable housing opportunities for Americans. Are these two reform bills enough? No. But they're a good start. 
   It's too bad that Congress waited so long before agreeing to the significant changes for the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The House began the process 3 years ago when it passed a bill, with my support, that would have improved regulation of these companies and may have averted some of the financial turmoil that they're now experiencing. 
   But now we have to move forward, and we have to move forward in this Congress on a bipartisan basis. I think that the House and Senate have wasted time outbidding each other on how much taxpayer funding to spend on bailing out some of the irresponsible lenders and those who speculated that  the market would go up forever. Now they have run out the clock and Congress is being forced to risk taxpayer dollars in order to avert the economic crisis that could occur if the two companies failed. That kind of leadership is not acceptable. 
   The final version of the bill also includes some measures that I fought against in committee in what amounts to a tax on middle class homeowners. It siphons money from Fannie and Freddie to pay for a new congressional fund for housing programs. The bill also puts into place an FHA refinancing scheme that will benefit lenders and borrowers who acted irresponsibly. The block grant provision has no safeguards and could be ripe for fraud. And the list goes on. 
   Do I think the excess provisions in this bill are necessary to stabilize the housing market? No. Is this Congress mandating that the taxpayers foot the bill for these excesses in order to bring stability to our economy and the housing market? Sadly, yes. 
   However, because of the urgent need to stabilize the marketplace and restore investor confidence, I support the bill, and I congratulate the chairman of the committee for his work on this.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the present-day Veterans of Foreign Wars organization traces its origin to 1899 when two organizations were founded to achieve benefits and recognition for United States veterans of the Spanish-American War. These veterans were committed to ensuring that their efforts in that conflict were recognized, honored, and respected by their government. 
   As the United States became involved in later foreign conflicts, the number of members of the VFW grew. The VFW received its congressional charter in 1936. Currently, there are 2.3 million members of the VFW and the Ladies Auxiliary. Efforts by the VFW were instrumental in establishing a Department of Veterans Affairs, the GI Bill, the national cemetery system, and assisting combat-wounded veterans to receive compensation for their injuries. 
   In recognition of their achievements in peacetime and the role of its members in wartime, I would ask that my colleagues honor the VFW and declare a Veterans of Foreign Wars Day. I urge my colleagues to join in supporting House Resolution 663. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 658, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of designating September 2007 as Federal Credit Union Month. First, I would like to thank the Congresswoman and the Congressman from New York, Mrs. Maloney and Mr. Walsh, for their leadership and for introducing this important resolution. I would also like to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kanjorski) for managing this resolution. 
   Second, I, too, would like to recognize credit unions for the important role that they play in our community. This resolution honors the 5,000 Federal credit unions that serve the financial needs of 50 million Americans, or about 17 percent of all U.S. citizens. Democratic organizations that are run by their members, credit unions have provided millions of Americans the credit and financial services that they need to buy cars, build homes, and pay for education. Of particular importance is that credit unions across the country promote financial education and are a part of our national effort to increase financial literacy rates, especially among our Nation's youth. 
   The mission of credit unions is to serve those of modest means. In my congressional district, the 13th District of Illinois, credit unions serve policemen, teachers, post office employees, airline pilots, and health care professionals. Credit unions also serve scientists, engineers, and their support staff at Argonne National Laboratory, a Department of Energy laboratory that supports cutting-edge basic research and the advanced development of advanced energy technologies ranging from next generation nuclear reactors to fuel cells for hydrogen-powered cars. It could be said that by serving scientists and engineers in my congressional district, credit unions are helping, literally and figuratively, to drive our future. 
   Finally, I would like to recognize all of the credit unions and associations, especially those in Illinois, for their contributions to our communities. Specifically, I would like to recognize and thank the Credit Union National Association, the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, and the Illinois Credit Union League. Last but not least, I would like to thank all of the employees, in particular, Chairwoman JoAnn Johnson, at the National Credit Union Administration, the Federal credit union regulator. 
   Again, I thank the cosponsors of this resolution.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1389, the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission Act. The commission established by this legislation would be responsible for developing programs, observations, and activities commemorating the historic events associated with the War of 1812. The commission would also enhance the visitor experience at the War of 1812 sites and facilitate scholarly research on the people and events associated with the War of 1812. This legislation would provide for appropriate commemorative activities to increase public understanding, particularly that of young people, of the meaning of the War of 1812 and the history of the United States. 
   There is much to be learned about the effect of the War of 1812 on American history, including the victories at Fort McHenry, New Orleans and Plattsburg. As one example, it is often overlooked or even forgotten that Francis Scott Key wrote the Star-Spangled Banner during the War of 1812. 
   The commission is intending to raise public awareness through observations that will bring this important chapter in American history to thousands of visitors. I urge support of this bill.

It is a national crisis affecting thousands of families. I think these families struggle through the loss and pain of losing their loved ones and often need support and guidance during the search for their missing friends or family members. 
   Through effective legislation, grants have been provided to our organizations tasked with tracking missing persons and provide much-needed support services to families. Legislation has also ensured that agencies are able to keep updated databases on missing persons. It's important that we take time to recognize and applaud the work of law enforcement agencies, concerned citizens, and, of course, the families who unite together to find their loved ones and support prevention efforts.

   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1520 establishes two important and historically based commissions. One commission recognizes the explorations of Henry Hudson and Robert Fulton in New York and Vermont, and the other recognizes Samuel de Champlain's discoveries in the same region. The overall goal of the Hudson-Fulton 400th Commemoration Commission is to plan, develop, and perform activities to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson's voyage on the New York river named in his honor and the 200th anniversary of Robert Fulton's voyage. 
   In 1609, Englishman Henry Hudson, under the direction of the Dutch East India Company, was named the first European to sail up the river later to be named for him and his significant exploration. In 1807, Robert Fulton's breakthrough use of commercial steam navigation revolutionized water-based commerce, naval warfare, and international relations. 
   It was these important expeditions which brought about the earliest encounters of Native Americans and Europeans. These voyages introduced new methods of commerce and trade and also introduced new religious beliefs,  cultural exchange, and traditions which extend into the present day. Together, these two historic events will be celebrated through the creation of the Hudson-Fulton 400th Commemoration Commission. The same year of Hudson's exploration, Francis Samuel de Champlain became the first European to discover the New York lake later to be named in his honor. 
   The Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Commission will coordinate its festivities and celebrations with the Hudson-Fulton Commission. These commissions promote continued education and observations of historic events such as these which have helped to make our country what it is today. They influence the culture, heritage, and way of life for all early citizens of America. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 1520.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's second term of office, he decided there should be a way to preserve and maintain official records and artifacts from his Presidency and the Presidency of future generations. Until his Presidency, many historic documents had been damaged, ruined or unaccounted for over the years.     
   President Roosevelt realized the need for preserving these valuable pieces of history and sought a way to make them available to the public. 
   There are currently 12 Presidential libraries, including the Nixon Presidential Materials. Each is funded through private donations, and upon  completion of the library is turned over to the National Archives. These libraries are essentially museums and centers for learning about these Presidents and their terms in office. H.R. 1664 authorizes funding for the establishment of a Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library in his birthplace of Staunton, Virginia. It also states the National Archives and Records Administration will provide a matching grant towards the establishment of the library. The library will coordinate its efforts with other Woodrow Wilson museums to share exhibits and educational services. 
   The Presidency of Woodrow Wilson is known for many achievements, among them are establishing the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Reserve. He served his second term during World War I and worked with European nations on peace negotiations, including the Treaty of Versailles and the creation of the League of Nations. 
   It is critical we preserve the Presidential papers, historical records, and other artifacts of Woodrow Wilson's Presidency as we do with the previous 11 Presidents. These libraries offer citizens the opportunity to learn, study and appreciate an important period of American history. I urge my colleagues to support the passage. I applaud the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) for introducing this bill and urge passage.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank my colleague from Illinois, Danny Davis, for managing this resolution today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 584, which supports the goals and ideals of designating September 2007 as National Life Insurance Awareness Month. I also would like to thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kanjorski), for introducing this resolution with me for the fourth year in a row and for his support on this important issue. Congressman Kanjorski serves with me both on the Financial Services Committee and the Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus and has been an outstanding leader on the important issue of financial security. 
   I would also like to thank the gentleman from California, Chairman Henry Waxman, and the gentleman from Virginia, Tom Davis, for moving this resolution through the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
   And, last, I would like to acknowledge and thank Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia for their contributions to this effort. They worked with those of us on this side of the Capitol to craft identical resolutions that garnered both bipartisan and bicameral support. It's my hope that the Senate will soon pass its version of the resolution soon. 
   Mr. Speaker, life insurance too often is thought of only when it is too late. How many times have we heard friends or loved ones who are sadly reflecting that the deceased had no life insurance or had too little life insurance? Today, only four in 10 adult Americans own an individual life insurance policy; and among those who do have life insurance, the amount often is too small to safeguard the financial future of their loved ones. Because of insufficient coverage, family members often are forced to work extra jobs or longer hours, borrow money, or move to less desirable housing. In short, these outcomes are only symptoms of the crisis of underinsurance that exists in our Nation today. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 584 calls on the Nation to observe the month of September as Life Insurance Awareness Month. The Life and Health Insurance Foundation for Education, the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, the American Council of Life Insurers, and a coalition representing hundreds of leading life insurance providers and advocates have designated September 2007 as Life Insurance Awareness Month. 
   Our collective goal for this month is to make consumers more aware of their life insurance needs, seek professional advice, and take the actions necessary to achieve financial security for their families. Many of my colleagues on both the Financial Services and the Education and Workforce Committees have been working very hard to increase the level of financial literacy and economic education in this Nation. Understanding how financial products work and how they work to build financial security are two important ingredients in a complete financial education. 
   It is my hope that recognizing Life Insurance Awareness Month will motivate Americans to seek out information about the benefits of life insurance so that if premature death of a loved one does occur, they will be spared the economic hardships that often accompany tragedy. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me and support the goals and ideals of designating September National Life Insurance Awareness Month. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

   As co-Chair of the Women's Caucus Business Task Force and as one of only 13 women in the U.S. Congress, including the House and the Senate, who serve on a committee overseeing the financial services sector, I would like to focus my remarks today on women in this industry. 
   As I have learned from my own experience on the Financial Services Committee, women are few and far between in upper-level positions of management and in financial services. This resolution acknowledges this factor and rightly encourages industry to take action to increase diversity. 
   Mr. Speaker, women and minorities are still just that, the minority, in corporate boardrooms throughout the financial services industry. According to a publication called ``Women in Financial Services: The Word on the Street'' released by Catalyst in 2001, women cited a number of reasons why they might be missing at the table. 
   Almost three-quarters of the women surveyed cited a lack of mentors as an obstacle barring them from advancing. Well over 50 percent of the women cited exclusion from informal networks of communication, lack of women role models, failure of senior leadership to assume accountability for women's advancement, and several additional factors as barriers to success. The same report cites that 65 percent of women have to work harder than men to get the same rewards, and that women are paid less for doing similar work. 
   The Government Accountability Office released the report that Mr. Meeks just spoke about revealing that over an 11-year period, the commitment to diversity in the financial services industry was strong. However, the GAO found that this commitment has yet to translate into any real progress for women. 
   The GAO report also said, ``Research reports suggest that minority and women-owned businesses have difficulty obtaining access to capital for several reasons.'' According to another Catalyst study, ``a small minority of women, 18 percent, report that opportunities to advance to senior leadership in their firm have increased over the past 5 years,'' and ``60 percent of women report opportunities to advance to senior leadership have improved somewhat or slightly.'' 
   So, what do we do about the relatively small number of women leaders in the financial services industry? I would suggest that step one is to recognize the problem, which we are doing with this resolution today, and step two is to encourage the financial services industry to take action and explore ways to increase the involvement of women and minorities in the financial services industry. 
   Currently, programs like those sponsored by Girls, Incorporated are working to promote economic and financial literacy among young women. I would like to commend them for their work, and also commend the efforts of all of those involved with Women's Policy Inc., Women Impacting Public Policy, the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, and many others who are promoting women in business. 
   In addition, it is my hope that during this Congress we can go beyond this resolution. I hope that we can examine ways to propel women in business, women in financial services forward and help them secure leadership roles in the industry. 
   As the new ranking member of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, I intend to request that our subcommittee hold a hearing to examine the issues of access to capital for women business owners, especially those in the financial services. I hope that we can hold such a hearing during this Congress. 
   It is important that we continue to examine the barriers confronting women in business and find ways to help them overcome these barriers. I believe that increasing the number of qualified women in leadership roles in the financial services industry will both enrich the industry and make it more competitive. 
   Again, I thank the author of this resolution, Mr. Meeks. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I, too, applaud PETER ROSKAM of Illinois for his introduction of this resolution. He had every intention of being here, but unfortunately he missed his plane, so he is not able to make it at this time. 
   During World War I, Grace Seibold's son, George, served with the British Royal Flying Corps in France. While on combat duty, he regularly sent letters home to his family in Washington, D.C. Around Christmas of 1918, the letters stopped and the Seibold family never heard from him again. Because his military unit was under British control, the U.S. had no information of his whereabouts or safety. After months of waiting, they received notice of his death. 
   Throughout the war, Grace Seibold had been spending her time visiting with soldiers in military hospitals and providing solace and assistance with their recuperation. After her own son's death, she met with fellow mothers of soldiers who had been killed serving their country. 
   The women began to share their grief and quickly found support for each other. Their uncommon bond brought them closer and helped them to heal. The group also encouraged community service by volunteering at local hospitals for veterans. 
   After years of careful planning, in June of 1928, 25 mothers joined in Washington, D.C. to form the American Gold Star Mothers, Incorporated. The mission of the organization is to honor the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country and to assist veterans with processing claims made to the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   The service provided by the Gold Star Mothers does not end there. They inspire patriotism and love of country. They promote peace and goodwill through annual special events. The Gold Star Mothers work in cooperation with all veterans organizations and lend their support giving many hours of volunteer work and personal service to veteran families. It is an organization that inspires community service, honor of country, and takes great pride in having our brave men and women serving in our Armed Forces. 
   I am proud to honor these brave women for their continued efforts and their tireless support of our Nation. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BIGGERT. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>

   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I congratulate Mr. Davis for bringing this important resolution to the floor. 
   This resolution seeks to bring attention to sickle cell disease and to support the designation of September as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month. 
   Sickle cell disease is a deadly genetic blood disorder that strikes primarily people of African descent. Those affected by the disease most often appear to be healthy, but their lives are disturbed by sporadic and painful attacks in their arms, legs, chest and abdomen. SCD also causes the rapid destruction of sickle cells that results in multiple medical complications, including anemia, jaundice, gallstones, strokes, and restricted blood flow causing tissue damage, cardiovascular and organ damage. 
   Approximately 80,000 African Americans suffer from sickle cell disease, and millions are affected worldwide. Statistics shockingly show that one in every 350 African American babies born in the United States has the disease, and one in eight African American babies carry the sickle cell trait. There is a one-in-four chance that a child born to parents who both carry the sickle cell trait will have the disease. Life expectancy is limited, as an average life span for an adult with the disease is only about 45 years. 
   A universal cure, though, remains elusive. However, early diagnosis through newborn screening and education has improved survival and quality of life for those who suffer from SCD. Because SCD affects so many people and research funding is critical to effectively treating and ultimately preventing the disease, we are grateful for organizations such as the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America that continue to shine the light of hope for all of those affected. 
   Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support the designation of the month of September as National Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month so that communities throughout the country will become aware of this disease and the need for additional research, effective treatments and prevention programs that will ultimately lead to a cure. 
   I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 210. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
