<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (WE CANNOT ALLOW OUR DOMESTIC ENERGY SOURCES TO WASTE AWAY -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Speaker, today the House will consider legislation that makes clear that our major obstacle to lowering prices is a shortage of supply. Yet, this House will not act on any legislation that will actually increase our Nation's overall energy supply. 
   It's time for this Congress to get serious about both protecting consumers and taking action on real solutions that will ease the pain at the pump. 
   I hear from West Virginians on a regular basis who can no longer afford the price of gasoline. Just yesterday, I spoke to several West Virginia seniors. They're concerned. They're making tough decisions. And on fixed incomes, they're very troubled when they have to go to the gas station to fill up their cars. 
   West Virginians deserve a truly comprehensive, all-of-the-above approach to our energy challenges to become energy independent. We need legislation that leads to new refineries, new technology, and new energy exploration, not these weak attempts that are only wanting to change the topic. 
   With gas prices at more than $4 a gallon, we simply cannot afford to deliberately allow our domestic energy resources to waste away.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the financial economic stimulus package we have before us. As we know, our economy has begun to slow after a robust growth period of 52 months. It is imperative that we act swiftly in a bipartisan manner. I congratulate the Speaker, the minority leader, and the President for their ability to work together and come forth with this package. 
   We have learned about tax rebates for filers. I think this is good for family budgets. Furthermore, they are targeted to the low- and moderate-income Americans who are most in need. I am also pleased that this package includes important tax incentives for small business growth. In a State like West Virginia, business is small business, and they are the job creators. It is critical that we provide them with the assistance that they need to keep their businesses viable and growing. 
   This agreement includes much-needed incentives to encourage the investment that creates jobs and seeks to maintain our Nation's competitiveness. 
   Lastly, I would like to talk about the long-overdue step toward modernizing the Federal Housing Administration to provide support for Americans who are struggling in this current housing crunch. This bill will make it easier for many Americans to refinance their mortgages and receive the support to do so. Yet while I am encouraged by this step, we must continue to work towards more comprehensive FHA modernization to make sure that this program continues to be the resource for creditworthy borrowers that may not qualify for conventional market loans. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with the chairman and Ranking Member Bachus on this important issue, and our colleagues in the other body, to proceed with negotiations and produce a final product we can all support.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5818, NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. I thank the gentleman for recognizing me. 
   I am on the Financial Services Committee. And we have debated and had many hearings on what we all share is an issue before us with great urgency. We are facing serious challenges here in the housing market, and I think our committee has done great work on a bipartisan basis to pass numerous measures and to listen to the concerns all across the board. 
   But I think the greatest concern for me and for all of us here should be that individual in that home who stays up late at night or can't sleep at night because they can't figure out how they're going to stay in their house and afford to keep their home, keep their family safe in their home, and meet the challenges of either an adjustable rate or a house that maybe has devalued so much that they feel like their only option may be to walk away from their mortgage. 
   So we have two bills before us today. Later on, we're going to be considering H.R. 5818, which is the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008. This doesn't help that individual who can't sleep at night who we're most concerned about. The aim is to help big cities and other urban areas that have foreclosed properties, to revitalize that. That's an issue for another day. In my view, the issue we need to debate today is how we're going to help that individual who can't meet the challenges and wants to stay in their home. 
   And so on the larger bill that we're going to be considering later, unfortunately the bipartisan tone of our committee sort of broke down in the process. We had, I think, very spirited debates in front of our committee where our philosophies were shared and we actually found a lot of common ground, which is the way it should be. Because when an originator came forward with a bad loan or didn't ask for financials or didn't ask for background information on a potential buyer, they didn't ask, are you a Republican or a Democrat? This isn't a partisan issue. That's why I think we should have a full and open debate here, and that's why I advocated for an open rule in front of the Rules Committee. 
   So the solutions that we're offering today are going to be diluted because we're not going to be able to hear the debate on the floor because the Rules Committee has decided, in their infinite wisdom--and I'm a former member of a Rules Committee, so I can say that--that the majority is using a seldom used rule that will really prevent our side from offering even a motion to recommit, where we can at least have our voice heard on this floor. 
   So I'm very disappointed that at this day in time, when we have that person at night staying up, that family wondering how they're going to stay in their home that night, they are not going to be able to see the choices that are before us as a body where we can say, we think this is more helpful, or we think this direction is the way we should go. For that I'm tremendously disappointed, especially in light of the committee that I serve on, Financial Services, where we did have this debate and we had ideas that came forward and more ideas that could come forward on this House today. 
   With that, I oppose this rule.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Chairman, today I want to thank, first of all, the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Housing, of which I'm the ranking member, for her good hard work and dedicated service. We've had a lot of hearings and a lot of information, and I think we all want to try to achieve help for the homeowners or those who are on the edge. 
   But today I rise in opposition to H.R. 5818, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008. We all recognize that we are experiencing a sharp increase in foreclosure statistics and starts. Over the past year alone, approximately 550,000 homeowners with subprime loans began the foreclosure process. 
   However, we shouldn't rush to act. We must guard against adopting policies which create moral hazards and unintended consequences.     
   Unfortunately, we believe H.R. 5818, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008, is a bill which does both. H.R. 5818 is an unnecessary government intervention in the housing market which will bail out real estate speculators, servicers, and lenders while doing nothing to assist hardworking Americans struggling to make their mortgage payments. This bill will not keep one person in their mortgage or in their home. 
   The bill does this through a $15 billion authorization for grants and loans to be used to purchase already foreclosed homes from lenders, servicers, and speculators who have made bad loans or unwise investments. The Neighborhood Stablization Act will allow investors and servicers to unload their foreclosed properties to the government with the taxpayer footing the bill. Servicers and investors might even be encouraged to pursue foreclosure if this bill is enacted. 
   Instead of incentivizing foreclosure, Congress should be encouraging services to engage in voluntary loan work-outs and modifications. Furthermore, this bill calls on States and local governments to convert foreclosed properties into affordable rental and single-family housing. The increase in housing supply and decrease in prices creates housing affordability without government intervention. 
   I'm also concerned that the overly broad income targeting provisions in this bill, which will allow families making 100 percent and 140 percent of area median income respectively, to rent and purchase properties acquired with funds from this act. It is not appropriate for the government to provide housing assistance to individuals who can afford market-rate housing. 
   Congress should focus its efforts on keeping hardworking Americans in their homes. We should not unnecessarily intervene in the housing market in the process of adjustment after years of what has proved to be unsustainable growth. It is imperative that we recognize the primary beneficiaries of this bill will not be the thousands of Americans struggling to hold on to their home, but the lenders, servicers and speculators who bear much of the responsibility for the current housing slump. 
   Putting aside the issue of how massive this new program would be, the bill's ultimate beneficiaries, as I said, could be our lenders and investors and speculators; and indeed the FHA commissioner, Brian Montgomery, stated in testimony before our committee that ``this legislation may have the unintended consequences of making foreclosure a more attractive option for lenders thereby compounding the very problem of rising foreclosures that the bill purports to address.'' 
   Madam Chairman, I oppose this bill, and I would like to reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. CAPITO. I would like to make a comment in reference to the chairman's comments. 
   I live in a small community, just barely over 50,000. And we have local government and State programs in effect right now that deal with foreclosed or blighted projects. They work together with the local nonprofits, with the local land owners and realtors, and we have problems that are moving forward. 
   So to say that we're not in favor of programs that would deal with foreclosure-blighted neighborhoods I think is factually incorrect. 
   I would like now to yield some time to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Feeney), a member of the Financial Services Committee, 3 minutes.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Chairman, I am ready to close. I have no additional speakers as well. 
   I think we have heard a stark difference in opinion on this bill. I would like to make a distinction, as we have heard the discussion going back and forth, and I think the good-natured way that the debate has gone forward but also the intent of this bill is unquestionably a good intent. 
   But I would like to clarify to those who are listening that this bill is separate and apart from that person who can't sleep at night, that family who stays up at night trying to figure out how to meet the high cost of gas, how to meet the higher cost of food, and how to make their mortgage payment. We've been working with FHA to get people to refinance and to redo their loans so they can stay in their house, and I don't want there to be confusion concerning this bill and the next bill that we are going to be considering shortly after this. 
   This bill, separate and apart, is not going to help that family who can't figure out in the middle of the night how they are going to stay in their home, how they are going to pay their mortgage. These properties that we're also discussing are already foreclosed-upon properties. They're owned by investors, speculators, and financial institutions. And that's our objection. I don't believe we are in a position, and I don't think any of the speakers on our side believe we're in a position for a costly bailout for the lenders, servicers, and real estate speculators who have made risky bets on the housing market and who are now going to off-load their properties into a government program. I think that penalizes every single taxpayer, and it really penalizes that person at night who can't figure out how they're going to get up and pay their mortgage the next day, and that's the person we desperately need and we want to help and it's proper that we should help. 
   So I believe that H.R. 5818 is overly broad. It's a new government program that is going to end up creating a moral hazard, and it's going to end up benefiting not individuals, not people who are having trouble making their mortgage payments, not people who find themselves upside down in their house. It's going to end up benefiting, at the cost of the taxpayers, and I repeat again, lenders, servicers, and real estate speculators. 
   And with that, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 5818. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Thank you. 
   While I appreciate the chairwoman's amendment, and I do believe that it does go in a direction that is much better for the bill, I still have, as I have voiced in the earlier debate, serious concerns about the bill in terms of the cost and in terms of taxpayers' dollars bailing out investors and lenders. This does not go to individual homeowners. It does not help somebody in foreclosure, an individual family in foreclosure. 
   And so with that, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Chairman, my amendment is really quite simple. As we have heard myself talking and Members on my side of the aisle talking about the difficulties that we have with the bill, I realize that the odds are with it that it may pass out of this House. With that in mind, I would like to offer this amendment to what I think makes the bill better. 
   My amendment would very simply direct the funds to be administered through the Office of Community Planning and Development of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This office already oversees the HOME and CDBG programs which we are very familiar with. 
   One of the concerns that we had with the bill was creating a whole new bureaucracy within HUD to administer this program if it were to go forward. And that is problematic any time you are creating a new bureaucracy, particularly when you are replicating some of the delivery systems that already exist within HUD. Those delivery systems exist in the Office of Community Planning and Development. 
   So with that, I would like to say that rather than the current language which just merely directs the Secretary to implement the program, I would prefer, and my amendment offers to direct those funds to be administered by the existing Office of Community Planning and Development within HUD which deals, as I said, with the CDBG program which we are all very familiar with working in a lot of our communities. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this no-energy energy bill. We're all for innovation and research for future energy resources, including renewables; but the standard in this bill is a one-size-fits-all mandate that ignores available energy resources and economic needs of individual States. 
   A mandatory renewable energy standard, such as in this bill, picks winners and losers. It excludes nuclear, hydroelectric and clean coal. Technology is giving us ways to use coal more cleanly and efficiently. We just heard coal sequestration mentioned, but where is coal liquification? It is a proven viable fuel for the decades to come. 
   Despite tremendous promise of this and other technologies, this no-energy bill excludes our most abundant domestic resource, coal, from our future energy strategy. 
   A federally mandated renewable electric standard will raise electric prices for all consumers. Think of that senior citizen on a fixed income trying to bear the burden of the new rising energy costs contained in this bill. 
   The cost of energy impacts every job, every family in West Virginia. The rising cost of gasoline is consuming a greater portion of our family budget. This bill is not the answer.

   Mrs. CAPITO. I want to thank Mr. Space for offering his amendment to something that I believe in very much, and that is more funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission. 
   The ARC encompasses all 55 counties of the State of West Virginia and is an important resource to the lower economic communities across Appalachia. Some of the good news is, since the ARC was created, poverty in the region has dropped from 31 percent to 13 percent, and more adults have high school diplomas. The percentage rate has risen to 70 percent. Over 400 rural primary health care facilities have been built. And in my district, three of the counties of my district have recently been removed from the list of economically distressed counties. We have already seen that ARC is a solid investment for our government by leveraging both private and public dollars. 
   The Appalachian region still lags behind the Nation in water and wastewater facilities, health care and poverty. And the ARC is a major part of continuing to address these challenges in my district and across the region. Now is not the time to cut ARC funding. This amendment will simply bring ARC funds back up to last year's level and the President's requested level of $65 million. 
   I look forward to bipartisan support of this amendment.

   As he said, we're not here to say goodbye; we're here to say farewell and Godspeed and good luck. 
   As any ending is, the ending of this year is a new beginning for you all to return to your homes, your families and have a good summer at the same time. 
   I'm very proud of the 70 pages, 33 girls, 37 boys, that represent 26 States and one territory, and I would like to congratulate you on the completion of your Page Program. 
   I asked several pages throughout the day, have you enjoyed your time here? How has it been? And one said to me very poignantly, he said, I have enjoyed every single day. And I think that is shared across the board by the 70 bright smiling faces I see at the back of the Chamber today. 
   It certainly has been a historic year for this Congress under the stewardship of the first woman Speaker of the House of Representatives. So, for all the female pages, it has been a source of great pride for all of us. So I thank you for your leadership. 
   I think it's important to note that not only will we be seeing you again, we'll be seeing you in different iterations of your life, as many former pages are now Members of Congress, Senators, corporate leaders, Governors and future leaders of our States and our Nation. 
   So I say, thank you, from the Cloak Room on the Republican side. Ms. Pat and Ms. Doris say thank you very much for all of the help you gave to them in helping us, and on the other side, I'm sure that's true. 
   So I say, good luck, make sure you don't forget us, and I won't forget the most I think vibrant day in the House of Representatives, which is the day that the President comes to give his State of the Union address, and the first thing I notice is the excitement of the pages, getting to see that for the first time, lined in the back, hoping to catch a glimpse or a handshake or a pat on the back from their President.  
   So good luck to all of you and thank you very much, and I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding.

   Established as a small family business, J.F. Allen Company has grown into one of the largest heavy highway construction firms in our State. The company's contributions can be seen in all corners of my district, including Stonewall Jackson Dam and Interstates 79 and 81. 
   J.F. Allen's contributions to the State are critical to our infrastructure development and maintenance. However, it is their commitment to employee safety that is the most important contribution to West Virginia. Thanks in large part to an award-winning safety program, employees are safe at work, logging 1 million safe hours since 1994.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about two outstanding youths in my district and to highlight, I think, something that we do too rarely here and across America. We talk a lot about our young people in their teens playing video games, not getting involved in their communities, not trying new sports, not enjoying the outdoors. 
   Today I am very privileged to talk about two such individuals in my district who are breaking the mold and are, I think, achieving at high levels, but they are also doing it by enjoying the great outdoors and also bringing strength to their communities. 
   First, I would like to recognize Taylor Sias from Weston, West Virginia, for representing our State in the 2007 Bassmaster CastingKids National Semi-Finals Competition in Gadsden, Alabama. 
   Taylor is a sixth grade student at Robert L. Bland Middle School in Weston and is a three-time State champion. Taylor previously competed in the 2004 semifinals in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and in the 2005 semifinals in Orlando, Florida. The Bassmaster CastingKids challenge is to flip, pitch and cast a hookless lure into a bull's eye target. Sounds kind of hard to me. 
   BASS developed the Bassmaster CastingKids program in 1991, open to young people in two age groups, 7-10 and 11-14. The goals of this competition are to involve America's youth in fishing and to foster in each participant an appreciation and a concern for our outdoors. Participants compete in local events conducted by affiliated BASS federation national clubs. Local event winners proceed to their State finals where each State then determines two to represent their State at the national semifinals. From the national semifinals, only 10 contenders advance on to the national championship. Since its inception, over 1.5 million youth have participated in the program, and over $2 million in cash prizes and scholarships have been awarded. 
   I would again like to congratulate Taylor and thank him for proudly representing West Virginia at the 2007 Bassmaster CastingKids National Semifinals Championship and wish him the best of luck in becoming an accomplished angler. 
   Madam Speaker, the other youth I would like to talk about today is Kevin Templan of Charlestown, West Virginia. Kevin became the first member of Boy Scout Troop 82 to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout. His commitment to family and community and church played an integral part in this achievement. Kevin worked on a beautification project at Saint Peter's Catholic Cemetery for his Eagle Scout project. 
   He is recognized by the Boy Scout National Honor Society, Order of the Arrows, for adhering to the traditions and values of scouting. A senior at Jefferson County High School, Kevin is a drummer in the Cougar Marching Band. He attends Saint James Greater Catholic Church where he will soon be a member of the Knights of Columbus. Kevin enjoys reading, origami and spending time with his younger brother and sister. 
   The Templan family recently moved to my district from Bryan, Texas, and we welcome them. I would like to take this opportunity to extend a warm West Virginia welcome to Kevin and his family. Jefferson County is fortunate to host such an accomplished young leader. It is a pleasure to serve such devoted young citizens like Kevin in West Virginia's Second District.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. I'd like to thank the ranking member for his recognition. 
   Over the past several years, this country has witnessed a series of tragic mining disasters, starting with the 12 miners killed on January 3, 2006 at the Sago Mine in my district. I know the families, I know the communities, and this is a wound that will never heal. This tragedy was followed by more deaths in accidents around the country, and each of these disasters has identified and highlighted deficiencies in the protection afforded miners. 
   In response to Sago and the other mine disasters, Congress enacted the MINER Act. We did it in a bipartisan way. It was a very proud day for me, as a West Virginian, to stand with my fellow West Virginians, several Governors, the President of the United States. Members of my own community, from the Sago community, came to the signing to sign the MINER Act. I'm proud of that effort, and I'm proud of the efforts that the companies have moved forward to improve the safety since the enactment of the MINER Act. It has substantially tightened regulations and enforcement procedures, and the mining industry has made significant changes in operations and equipment to comply with the strengthened requirements. 
   A number of Federal agencies and several State agencies, West Virginia has been very aggressive in this regard, has pushed reforms to better respond to incidents that occur and how we can improve the chances of miners to survive a serious accident. Today more self-contained self-rescuers are being stored underground than in the past, and that is a good positive first step. 
   With the success of the original MINER Act in mind, I do hold some reservations that additional legislation could complicate the safety improvements currently under way, and I am not alone in my concern. I encourage my colleagues to keep this in mind if this legislation moves forward. 
   Unfortunately, the events of Sago serve as a reminder that we must always strive to make America's mines as safe as they can possibly be. 
   This bill is flawed in many ways. The junior Senator from West Virginia has publicly expressed his concern, and I have concern that this bill will hold up some of the progress as it has moved forward. 
   But at the end of the day, for me, this is about those Sago miners, and their tragedies stay with me. My hope is that we can continue the good work that has moved forward as a result of the MINER Act. It is crucial that Congress continue to highlight mine safety so that the tragedies we've seen in West Virginia and across the Nation are not repeated.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to help prevent aliens who lack authorization to work legally from taking Federal jobs. 
   In the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Congress responded to the problem of document verification when hiring folks by establishing three pilot programs for employment eligibility verification. Private employers in selected States could volunteer to participate in these programs. 
   Under a program called the Basic Pilot Program, Social Security numbers and Alien Identification Numbers of new hires are checked against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records. This weeds out fraudulent numbers and assures that new hires are legally eligible to work. 
   A 2001 report on the Basic Pilot Program found 96 percent of employers found it to be an effective tool. 
   In 2003, Congress extended the Basic Pilot Program for another 5 years and made it available to employers nationwide. 
   The 1996 law stipulates that each department of the Federal Government must participate in the Basic Pilot Program. Incredibly, the Departments of Commerce, Justice and State, are currently not participating. 
   My amendment basically says, because I hear from constituents all the time who are angry about those working who do not have legal verification. What message does it send when Federal agencies do not abide by the Federal laws? 
   There's no excuse for having any illegal aliens taking Federal jobs. We have a Basic Pilot Program to stop this from happening. We have a law on the books that requires Federal agencies, including Commerce, Justice and State, to use it for employment verification. 
   My amendment provides that no funds in this appropriation bill shall be spent in contravention of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to enhance America's ability to prosecute and detain illegal aliens around our southwest border. 
   State and local law enforcement agencies along America's southwest border grapple with the serious consequences of our porous border every day. Prosecutors, probation officers, courts and detention facilities are all vital. They process drug and illegal alien cases referred from Federal arrests. 
   Currently, if the Federal Government decides to no longer pursue Federal criminal charges against the defendant, they often turn over the case to local law enforcement agencies. State and local agencies often need to be reimbursed for the costs of prosecution and court costs, as well as pre- and post-trial detention. 
   The Southwest Border Prosecutor Initiative helps relieve border communities of the steep costs of Federal drug prosecutions. Cases involving illegal aliens and drug traffickers are complex and urgent. That's why the Southwest Border Prosecutor Initiative needs and deserves vigorous Federal support. 
   Last year Congress funded this program with $29,617,000. The committee's recommended funding level for this year, 2008, amounts to only a 1 percent increase over last year's appropriation for the Southwest Border Prosecutor Initiative. Meanwhile, the Census Bureau stands to receive over $369 million more than last year. That amounts to an increase of 40 percent for the census. 
   Right now, I, along with the constituents I represent, believe the higher priority for our country must be to get a handle on our borders. Some aliens who illegally enter America only seek jobs, but then there are others who are very, very dangerous. These aliens, especially the drug traffickers, call for extra attention. My amendment would boost funding to the Southwest Border Prosecutor Initiative by $10 million, without costing the taxpayers any more money. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this important amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin, first of all, by thanking the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member for their good, hard work on this bill. They are very dedicated to seeing that we spend our taxpayers' dollars wisely. 
   Today I rise to offer an amendment to help break the cycle of violence against women, especially those living in the rural areas. We are facing an epidemic in this country. Sexual and domestic violence can happen to anyone, regardless of race, age, sexual orientation, religion or gender. One in four women will experience domestic violence during her lifetime. It is a frightening statistic, I think. 
   To be safe in their communities, women need to be safe in their own homes. Of the over 12,000 domestic violence victims reported in my State of West Virginia in 2005, a total of over 8,600, or 68 percent, were victims of intimate partner violence. What used to be called a ``family matter'' is now a crime. The Violence Against Women Act was much-needed landmark legislation that helped transform the perception of domestic abuse as a serious crime and created programs to increase access to services for women and victims. 
   My amendment builds on the successes of the last decade and prevents more women from suffering in silence. Victims of domestic violence and sexual assault in rural and remote communities face unique obstacles in their efforts to escape abusive and dangerous relationships. The geographic isolation, economic structure, and particularly strong cultural pressures and social pressures, and lack of available resources in rural jurisdictions significantly compound the problems confronted by those seeking support and services. Nonreporting of sexual assault in rural areas is a particular problem. 
   Other barriers to domestic violence and sexual assault intervention in rural communities may include gaps in the 911 emergency system that may delay responses, underfunded and understaffed law enforcement agencies that hamper the criminal justice response, and lack of legal representation for protective orders and other civil matters pertaining to domestic violence. 
   Rural Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, Stalking, and Child Abuse Enforcement Assistance Grants fund cooperative efforts between law enforcement, prosecutors, and victim services. They provide treatment, counseling and assistance to victims, and work with rural communities to develop education and prevention strategies. 
   Last year Congress funded this program with $38.8 million. The committee's recommended funding level for this year amounts to only a $1.2 million increase over last year's appropriations for the Rural Domestic Violence Grants program. 
   Meanwhile, the National Science Foundation Agency Operations and Award Management line item, which was the old salary and expense line item, stands to receive $285.59 million. This amounts to an increase of over $37 million, or 13 percent. 
   My amendment would boost funding for the Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement Assistance Grants by $10 million without costing the taxpayers additional money. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this important amendment to help provide victims with the protection and services in the rural areas they need to pursue safe and healthy lives while simultaneously enabling communities to hold offenders accountable for their violence. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend congratulations to Elizabeth Elza of Elkins, West Virginia, who was recently awarded the Most Outstanding Junior Trooper Award in the 11th annual West Virginia State Junior Trooper Academy. Elizabeth's hard work, dedication and outstanding performance contributed to her recognition as the top junior trooper. 
   At the Junior Trooper Academy, junior troopers are trained in law enforcement activities to expose them to the criminal justice and law enforcement career fields during an intensive 5-day period. Candidates are between 14 and 17 years old and must be recommended by a State legislator, school superintendent or uniformed member of the State police. 
   Elizabeth is truly a leader in her community and among her peers. We need more women in leadership positions, and I am pleased to say that Elizabeth is well on her way to being a role model for future young women in West Virginia. Elizabeth is not only a leader in her community, but an accomplished athlete as a member of, get this, the Elkins High School wrestling team. 
   I am pleased to have this opportunity to highlight Elizabeth's accomplishments. Congrats on being the most outstanding junior trooper.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by commending my colleague on the page board, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), for his service to the program, long service to the program, and for the bipartisan manner in which he has handled the legislation before him today. 
   I would also like to thank the Chair and ranking member of the House Administration Committee, and I would like to join my fellow, the ranking member and all of us, really, to say thank you to all the pages who are in the room today, all the pages who are currently serving, and all those pages who have done wonderful service in the past. 
   I am proud to be the original cosponsor of the House Page Board Revision Act and rise to urge my colleagues to support it. I believe my colleagues will support it. 
   The House page program has existed for well over a century and provides teenagers with an incredible opportunity to learn about the legislative process, gain leadership and teamwork skills that can be applied to whatever profession they decide to enter. House pages provide a valuable service to the House of Representatives as well. The page program is truly an asset, both to this body and to the Nation. 
   I guarantee, if you ask any page in this room, present or former, about their experience, there is one word that they always use to describe it when I ask, and that is ``fantastic.'' That is why Members of this House were shocked to learn that a former Congressman's inappropriate interaction with House pages came to light last fall. 
   As a mother, it was very upsetting to find out that children sent to Washington could possibly be preyed upon. As a Member of this House and a member of the page board, I was disappointed that the information regarding those e-mails was not shared with the full page board. 
   But since it is impossible to go back and fix, it is important that the House move forward to make the changes to prevent such an incident or other incidents that could endanger the safety of young people. Certainly, we all know that one of the most important rules of this House is for Members, of course, to conduct themselves in a manner that reflects credibility of the House. 
   But it is imperative that we learn lessons from last year's situation and take the steps necessary to better protect House pages and to ensure that any potential problem is investigated fully. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of the items in this bill are suggestions that I made to the page board in October, and I will include this letter into the RECORD listing my reasons for supporting this. 
   This legislation balances the partisan make-up of the page board by incorporating two pages from each party. I believe this provision is important, not just symbolically but it is also important because it demonstrates that nothing within the page board is ever construed as partisan. 
   It is important that everyone involved, House Members, staff, employees, pages, dorm supervisors alike feel comfortable approaching the page board with any information about possible threats to the safety of the children in this program. Demonstrating that the board is truly bipartisan should make this easier. 
   Expanding membership to include a former page and the parent of a current or recent page will improve discussions on policies for the page program and provide that additional perspective, that additional set of eyes and ears for any problems that may arise. 
   Certainly, regular meetings, I heartily agree, of the page board, will help shed light on any trouble facing our pages, and I am pleased that this provision has been included in the bill. 
   My hope is that other recommendations that have been put forward, such as a peer counseling program, better communications, will strengthen this program as we move forward into the future.  
   I commend the leaders of both parties for agreeing to take action to better protect the pages who serve this House; and, again, I thank Mr. Kildee for offering this bill. This is a good bipartisan piece of legislation, and I ask my colleagues to support it. 
   October 5, 2006. Hon. JOHN SHIMKUS,  Hon. DALE KILDEE,  Mr. Bill Livingood, Sergeant-at-Arms.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my great concern with the proposal pending before the Virginia State Corporation Commission to raise the tolls on the Dulles Greenway. Many of my constituents from the eastern panhandle of West Virginia use this roadway to commute into Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia. 
   The growth of the Washington metropolitan area has extended into the eastern panhandle of West Virginia as many families move into the towns and communities of my district seeking a lower cost of living and the wonderful environment for raising a family we have in West Virginia. Some have chosen to change professions and remain there with their jobs, but many others still commute into Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia every day, and they rely on many forms of transportation, one of which is the Dulles Greenway. 
   The proposed increase represents a 56 percent increase over the next 5 years. The per-mile rate for the increased toll is drastically higher than other toll roads in the area, costing commuters approximately 34 cents per mile. For many families this will be an undue burden. 
   Thankfully, there is a hearing today in Northern Virginia so local citizens can express their concern with this proposal. I hope that the Virginia State Corporation Commission will see the shortsightedness of this proposal  and call for a reasonable toll level for the commuters utilizing the Dulles Greenway.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Today, we are considering a bill to make something the law that is already the law. The majority claims it is necessary to force energy exploration companies to either use or lose leases they hold. However, use it or lose it is already the law. The Secretary of the Interior can already cancel a lease if the lessee fails to comply with the terms. Federal leaseholders are already required to produce oil and/or natural gas within 5 to 10 years of beginning the lease. 
   By blocking some firms from competing for new leases, this legislation could further increase gas prices that are already exceeding $4 per gallon. This is frustrating because I believe West Virginians would rather see us take up legislation that will actually lead to a new and more forward-thinking energy policy rather than waste time passing legislation that is already on the books. That means new exploration, coal-to-liquids, and renewables. 
   If this is the best the majority can do, is to restate current law, that's fine. But I think most Americans and West Virginians understand that the time has come for a more serious and comprehensive debate on this issue. That's what they deserve.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (COMMUNITY BUILDING CODE ADMINISTRATION GRANT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 4461, the Community Building Code Administration Act, authored by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moore). Under current law, there are no dedicated Federal funds for building code administration. Funds from development or hazard mitigation programs have been used  for this purpose in the past. The competition for these funds is intense, and infrastructure projects generally receive preference over building code enforcement. States and local jurisdictions fund local building code enforcement departments without Federal assistance. 
   The legislation offered by Mr. Moore requires the Secretary of HUD to award grants on a competitive basis and with Federal matching funds to qualified local building code enforcement departments. The grants can be used to increase staffing, provide staff training, increase staff competence and professional qualifications, support individual certification or departmental accreditation, or for capital expenditures specifically dedicated to department administration. 
   Both State and local governments that have responsibilities for administering laws and regulations addressing building safety and fire prevention would be eligible for Community Building Code Administration Grants. The bill authorizes $100 million over 5 years. Any grants awarded under this bill would be capped at $1 million. 
   I would like to note that HUD has expressed some reservations regarding this legislation because currently CDBG funds can be used for this exact same purpose. The Department has concerns whether or not it is necessary to dedicate another $100 million for this purpose when it is already an eligible activity under CDBG. 
   I would like to thank Mr. Moore for offering this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3329, the Homes for Heroes Act offered by the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green. 
   In the week after our Nation celebrated its 232nd birthday, it is important that we take time to properly recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's veterans and those service men and women who are currently defending our freedoms and liberties in theaters across the world. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I have been to Walter Reed to visit our wounded warriors who have been injured in battle, and I am always touched by their spirit and courage. It goes without saying that our Nation and government must provide these veterans with the tools to succeed once they leave the military and the benefits they deserve for the sacrifices that they have made in the name of freedom. 
   This legislation improves one important aspect for our veterans, especially those who suffer from long-term physical and mental disabilities: That is access to affordable housing. The Veterans Administration is the only Federal agency that provides substantial hands-on assistance directly to homeless individuals, homeless veterans. Although limited to veterans and their dependants, the VA's major homeless specific programs constitute the largest integrated network of homeless treatment and assistance services in this country. 
   The Department's homeless veterans programs were first authorized in 1987 and have grown and developed during that time. The program offers a number of services that include outreach to veterans living on the streets and who otherwise would not seek assistance, long-term sheltered transitional assistance and supportive permanent housing. 
   According to the VA, about one-third of the adult homeless population are veterans. That is staggering, I believe, with current population estimates suggesting about 154,000 veterans are homeless on any given night. Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because of their poverty, lack of support from family and friends and dismal living conditions in cheap hotels or overcrowded and substandard housing. 
   This legislation requires HUD to create a position within the Department to serve as a liaison to the Veterans Affairs Department. A Special Assistant for Veterans Affairs would ensure veterans receive proper access to HUD's housing assistance programs, coordinate all HUD programs and activities pertaining to veterans, and act as a liaison between HUD and the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   Mr. Green's legislation also requires, as he noted, that HUD provide 20,000 rental vouchers for homeless veterans. It authorizes $200 million in fiscal year 2008 and such sums as may be necessary for each subsequent fiscal year. It also requires the Department to maintain a constant level of funding in coordination with rising home costs. The measure allows family members of a veteran receiving a housing voucher to maintain the voucher and the home after the veteran's death. 
   The bill authorizes grants to nonprofits that sponsor housing projects for veterans making less than 50 percent of the median income of an area, assists veterans in obtaining housing or homeless assistance, and assists veterans with the plan and application process for HUD assistance programs. It also includes language to assure that any voucher program would not inhibit low income tax credits that are already in place. 
   I would like to thank Mr. Green for offering this legislation and for his efforts to improve housing for our veterans. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (ASSET MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6216, the Asset Management Improvement Act, authored by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires). There is general agreement that we need to work with our public housing authorities to improve and refine their asset management policies. The Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act, which was passed by Congress in 1998, included a requirement for a negotiated rulemaking to develop a new public housing operating fund formula. 
   Rulemaking concluded in 2004, after a 3-year, $4 million Operating Cost Study was conducted, and in 2005, HUD issued the Public Housing Operating Fund Final Rule. HUD has agreed to delay the implementation, in an effort to give PHAs additional time to comply with the negotiated rule. This legislation will make further changes to that rule. It is my hope that all parties can continue to work together to make further improvements. 
   The base text of the legislation requires HUD and public housing agencies to negotiate, after April 1, 2009, reasonable property and asset management fees with interested stakeholders. The fees would then be implemented January 1, 2011. 
   The legislation increases, as the chairman said, the number of units public housing agencies can manage to 500, from 250, before they are required to manage their housing portfolios by the new asset management system. It also states that the bill's provisions, including those relating to public housing asset management, do not affect in any way current law regarding tenant participation and tenant opportunities in public housing. 
   As the chairman noted, we have been here before considering similar legislation. Unfortunately, that legislation was pulled from consideration during the motion to recommit that would have preserved the right of law-abiding citizens to own a firearm. I am pleased the authors of this new version included this important provision. 
   In addition, the authors have included the text of the manager's amendment, as well as the Meek amendment, in this new draft. The manager's amendment included language blocking illegal immigrants from eligibility and ensuring that certain agencies that apply to HUD for stop-loss do not have their applications rejected on the basis that the management and related fees they establish pursuant to the bill's provisions are not reasonable as defined by HUD. The Meek amendment provides that the tenant organization protections set forth in HUD's regulations apply to public housing agencies that are placed in receivership by HUD. 
   I would like to thank Mr. Sires for offering this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey and certainly support his bill, but I think it is appropriate when talking about trying to stretch our public housing dollars as much as we can to provide housing and safety and cover and a sense of community to many families, I think it brings to light what many families are thinking about right now, and that is the high price of gasoline, how are they getting to where they need to go, to get to a job, to pick up their children at school, to go to church, to go to the grocery store, all the things of daily living. 
   Many of our public housing situations don't have access to bus routes or any kind of mass transportation, so I think it is incumbent upon this Congress to address this very difficult issue, and I have put forward, as have many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, ways to address this, whether it is more drilling, whether it is coal-to-liquid, whether it is more renewables. But it is certainly not standing still. And as we try to move our dollars into the public housing arena to provide shelter and homes for many, many Americans across this country, I think it is important at the same time when people are figuring out how they are going to pay their rent, they realize how are they going to pay for their gas, how are they going to pay for their food. 
   So I would encourage as we look at housing issues today, we also look at the very important issue of energy in our homes and with our families. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

I also want to thank the chairman of the Small Business Committee and the ranking member of the Small Business Committee for their good hard work on this piece of legislation. I would also like to thank the  Rules Committee, of which I was formerly a member, for making my amendment in order. 
   I rise today to offer a very simple amendment that adds service disabled veterans to the list of targeted groups to receive consideration from the SBIR bill and SBIR board. Currently in the bill, the board, which is authorized to make recommendations to the grant awarding authorities, is directed to develop a means of how to encourage more applications from small business owners who are minorities or women. My amendment will direct the board to include service disabled veterans owners of small businesses to those who will be encouraged to make more applications from a grant pool of over $50 million. 
   We have a lot of our servicemen and women returning with injuries. But we want to encourage them that they can move forward with their lives and invest and prosper in a small business, and this opens up more opportunity for them. 
   Madam Chairman, recent studies have shown that returning veterans face unemployment rates that are nearly four times as high as that of nonmilitary laborers.     
   Our returning veterans should have post-military opportunities that inspire confidence and don't disappoint them. 
   This amendment will extend to service-disabled veterans more opportunities to succeed after serving our Nation so bravely. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Chairman, while not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition.

   There was no objection. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Chairman, I want to take the opportunity to thank the gentlewoman from West Virginia for her efforts to improve this bill. The amendment directs the SBIR advisory boards established under H.R. 5819 to include in their annual report to Congress the number and the dollar amount of SBIR awards made to small businesses and controlled by service-disabled veterans. This is valuable data that Congress should have. Moreover, the collection of this data is likely to encourage Federal agencies to redouble their efforts to publicize the SBIR programs to service-disabled veterans.

   Roughly one in five military personnel returning from active duty suffers from a debilitating condition called post-traumatic stress syndrome. Unfortunately, the effects of PTSD have hit close to home for one family in my district. Their son, Sergeant  Charles Call, of the United States Army, always dreamed of serving his country. He even left his unit, which was not being sent to Iraq, and joined another that was being deployed so he could be with those fighting for our freedom and safety. He loved his country and was willing to make that sacrifice. 
   After returning from Iraq, he developed the symptoms of PTSD. Despite his attempts to seek help from the local veterans hospital, he did not receive the treatment he so desperately needed; and, sadly, Sergeant Call took his own life on February 3, 2006. 
   With the passage of this legislation, we can finally provide a safety net for our veterans coming home and prevent tragedies like that of Sergeant Call. It is crucial that they have the resources needed to pursue healthy lives upon returning to civilian life. Screening of all returning combat veterans and 24-hour access to counseling are just some of the options we must offer. 
   I support this in the name of Sergeant Charles Call.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, floods are amongst the most frequent and costly national disasters in terms of human hardship and economic loss. In fact, 75 percent of Federal disaster declarations are related to flooding. 
   Before I discuss the merits of the legislation, I would like to talk briefly about the process that is being considered. We are debating a huge expansion of an already struggling existing Federal program, and yet we have not been able to have our amendments out on the floor to have an open and frank discussion about this. 
   I would like to accept the chairman's offer to continue to work on the amendments that were not allowed to be offered, and I hope that we can see democracy being served by letting everybody's voice be heard.     
   In 1968, Congress established the National Flood Insurance Program, NFIP. The program is a partnership between the Federal Government and participating communities. If a community adopts and enforces a floodplain management ordinance to reduce future flood risk to new construction, the Federal Government will make flood insurance available to that community. Today, NFIP is the largest single-line property insurer in the Nation, serving nearly 20,000 communities and providing flood insurance coverage for 5.4 million consumers. 
   Mr. Chairman, recent events have underscored the need to reform and modernize certain aspects of the program. While the NFIP is designed to be actuarially sound, it does not collect sufficient premiums to build up reserves for unexpected disasters. Due to the claims resulting from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the NFIP was forced to borrow $7.6 billion from the Treasury, an amount it estimates it will never be able to repay. Consequently, NFIP sits on the GAO's High-Risk Programs list, which recommends increased congressional oversight. Additionally, the 2005 storms shed light on the problem of outdated flood maps, resulting in many homeowners in the gulf region being unaware that their homes were located in floodplains. 
   To address these and other concerns in 2006, the House overwhelmingly passed flood insurance reform legislation. Earlier this year, Chairman Frank and Representative JUDY BIGGERT introduced legislation identical to that bipartisan bill. That bill includes many reforms, including the phasing in of actuarial rates, but unfortunately, the flood insurance bill that the majority chose to move out of the Financial Services Committee was amended to incorporate legislation offered by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor) which expands the NFIP to include coverage for wind events. 
   Mr. Chairman, no Member of this House was more personally affected by the 2005 hurricanes than Congressman Taylor. I do not, and no one questions his sincerity or his commitment to assisting those who have lost everything they owned in these storms. While I share his concern over the rising costs and outright unavailability of homeowners' wind coverage in some areas, I have three principal objections to linking wind insurance to the reform of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
   First, expanding the program increases liabilities for taxpayers while decreasing options for customers or consumers. Properties located along the eastern seaboard and gulf coast represent $19 trillion of insured value. Shifting the risk on even a portion of these properties to the troubled NFIP could expose taxpayers to massive losses. The fact is that insurance will choose not to engage a competitor that does not pay taxes, has subsidized borrowing costs, and is not required to build a reserve surplus and is protected from most lawsuits, State regulation and enforcement. 
   Second, adding wind coverage to the NFIP will exacerbate the program's well-documented administrative problems. Both the Department of Homeland Security and GAO have criticized the NFIP for being understaffed, not having adequate flood maps and not collecting sufficient information on wind payments when claims were submitted for flood damage. Expanding the portfolio further before much-needed reforms are in place is premature. 
   Third, no consensus yet exists about the necessity or desirability of creating a Federal wind insurance program. In testimony before our committee, representatives of flood management groups, the insurance industry, environmental organizations, Treasury and  FEMA all expressed agreement that a comprehensive study of the proposed wind insurance mandate should first be commissioned to provide Congress with a better understanding of the possible implications this expansion could have for consumers, NFIP and the market. 
   Mr. Chairman, we must not let the desire to meet every perceived problem with a new Government program drive us towards premature actions that yield unwanted consequences. The NFIP's mission should not be expanded, exposing taxpayers to massive new risks, until reforms are in place and adequate study has been conducted. 
   In addition to the above reservations, I have serious concerns with the effect the addition of wind coverage will have on communities that are now relying on NFIP. This program is already financially unstable, yet we are about to add $19 trillion of risk. Despite this fiscal instability, States like West Virginia, that I represent, will still rely on the program to provide assistance in the case of serious flooding. There have not been major problems this year, thankfully, but as recently as 2001, FEMA has declared counties in my State national disasters due to flooding and provided $17 million in assistance. These are serious needs across the Nation for the flood insurance program. We should be modernizing NFIP so it can become financially stable. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   In listening to the debate over this amendment, my question becomes, if we move forward and make wind part of one of the insurable events under this program, and then we study, through the gentlelady's amendment, the effect this has on State insurance, and we find out, after it's already been put into effect, that it's too costly or it's damaging the insurability at the State level and other issues, what are we going to do then? 
   This is where it goes to my argument in the beginning that we're really entering into this prematurely, because we have so many unanswered questions.

   Mrs. CAPITO. I would like to ask the author of this amendment a couple of questions just for my own clarification, if I could. 
   First of all, when you're directing FEMA to use the most up-to-date science on global climate change and weather-related issues, does FEMA currently have this technology available? Where does this technology exist for FEMA? And with what type of accuracy can you predict that FEMA will be able to predict? I know FEMA is in the business of declaring where floodplains are; it has a lot of science connected with this. Where is this technology coming from? What sophistication of the equipment exists, and how do you think these will be arrived at? 
   I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.

   Mrs. CAPITO. I think the gentleman's amendment has great merit, but I question the fact that he's already  mentioned that the data that we're using in the future, the data that we're using to come about insurance rates in this flood bill, how can we then add on wind as another peril when we're not sure that the data that we're using to predict future weather forces is accurate at all?

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to this amendment offered by the gentleman from Mississippi. The bill we are debating today is troubled, I think, because of the deeply in-debt flood insurance program, and now we are not debating, because we were unable to debate on the full floor of the House whether we should include wind in this. Wind is in this bill as a peril. But what this amendment does is further expand that coverage that is very debatable, I think premature, has been unstudied, and I believe this would be very unwise to include this amendment as a coverage expansion. 
   We have talked about the fact that the flood insurance program owes the U.S. Treasury $18 billion. We have talked about the fact that at a hearing in July on whether we should add wind to the NFIP, that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, insurance experts, environmental groups, floodplain management groups, Treasury and FEMA all opposed the initial expansion. And suffice it to say they would certainly oppose, or they could certainly oppose, an even further expansion of this that this amendment represents. 
   I think that the wind insurance premiums are supposed to be actuarially sound, and the chairman of the full committee has made that point several times. The majority of the NFIP policies are supposed to be actuarially sound. And yet, the nonpartisan GAO says that they are not actuarially sound. We know that very few government insurance programs are ever actuarially sound. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to avoid a further expansion that this new mandate in this amendment represents. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a bipartisan amendment highlighting the importance and need for an Office of Rural Health within the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   I'd like to commend the chairman and the ranking member for their good, solid, hard work on this bill and the tribute it pays to America's veterans. I would also like to thank Mr. Salazar of Colorado and Mr. Smith of Nebraska for their work on this bipartisan amendment. 
   I was pleased that language was included in the legislation that was signed into law by the President last year calling on the Department of Veterans Affairs to create an Office of Rural Health within the Office of the Under Secretary for Health. However, the Department has yet to make any progress towards establishing this very important office. 
   This is a simple amendment that should encourage the Department to make the Office of Rural Health fully operational as expeditiously as possible, and provide them with the resources needed to do so by rerouting $5 million in the Medical Services Account to help fund the Office of Rural Health, thus making it revenue neutral. 
   Rural Americans face different and unique challenges than our fellow citizens who reside in urban and suburban areas, and this is no different for our veterans and their ability to seek the services and the treatments that they need. For some rural veterans, a simple trip to the doctor can often involve hours of travel to reach the appropriate facility within the veterans health facilities health system. 
   It is my hope that the Office of Rural Health will shed light on many of these challenges, and will be a resource with many new and creative ideas for methods to help our rural veterans receive their much-deserved benefits in a manner that is efficient, and allowing them to stay as close to home as possible. 
   One of the great challenges we are beginning to face is the number of servicemen and -women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who have sustained a traumatic brain injury. The Department of Veterans Affairs has four large polytrauma centers, in Richmond, Tampa, Minneapolis and Palo Alto, California. These facilities provide first-class treatment for veterans suffering polytrauma, and also provide inpatient rehabilitation services. 
   Despite the services provided at these facilities, many veterans will eventually return to their homes in the rural areas of America, but they will still need care and treatment. The Office of Rural Health will be the basis for new ways to provide rural veterans with polytrauma with the care that they need. 
   Another development within the Department of Veterans Affairs that has been going on for a while are the Community-Based Outpatient Clinics, or CBOCs. Often serving rural areas, CBOCs are a tremendous asset to the delivery of care for veterans, allowing them to seek treatment closer to their home. Unfortunately, underserved areas still remain in the rural areas. Again, the Office of Rural Health will be an excellent resource for new ways to provide primary outpatient care. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of this commonsense amendment so that the rural veterans concerns can be appropriately addressed. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the importance of preventive care in the Medicare program. 
   As we all know, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 made many important and much-needed changes to the Medicare program. The creation of the Medicare prescription drug benefit was a critically important modernization of the program and has been especially successful in my home State of West Virginia, with 287,000 beneficiaries. 
   But the prescription drug benefit is just one component of the overall changes in Medicare. If we can encourage more seniors to actually use the preventive benefits, we can help them prevent more costly procedures and longer stays in the hospital. 
   That is why the ``Welcome to Medicare'' screening is so vitally important. Many of the elements that seniors face today can be effectively managed with prescription medicine and regular visits to their physicians. However, disease management is only effective if we catch the disease early. 
   I would like to encourage my colleagues to educate their constituents about these important modernizations to the Medicare program so we can all better serve our senior citizens.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding, and I'd like to thank the leadership on the Transportation Committee for the creative solution that you have brought back with H.R. 1773 because it places important restrictions upon the pilot program planned by the Department of Transportation to allow Mexican trucks to operate across this country. 
   My first concern with the pilot is its impact on the safety of our Nation's highways. This Congress gave this department specific criteria to ensure adequate safety and security measures were taken prior to allowing Mexican trucks to travel on our highways. I believe it is important that all of these criteria are met prior to the start of any pilot project on our Nation's highways. 
   I am also very concerned about the economic consequences of allowing Mexican trucks to operate within the United States. It is my hope that if this pilot program is indeed implemented, the Department will work closely with State and local law enforcement to ensure that the prohibition on point-to-point deliveries within the United States by Mexican trucking companies is enforced. 
   I am especially pleased that this bill will require a plan to enforce existing English proficiency regulations prior to the start of any pilot program. It is critical for the safety of anyone on the road that truckers are able to understand traffic and warning signs and are able to communicate with law enforcement and emergency management officials. 
   It is absolutely critical that we stop the Department from implementing their pilot program until we can ensure the safety of our American motorists and our American highways. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the gentleman for yielding me time. I would like to thank my colleague from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan) for offering this resolution and including me as one of the cosponsors. 
   We are very prideful Mountaineers. As we have heard, our West Virginia Mountaineers football team is something that everyone in the State takes great pride. The Tostitos Fiesta Bowl win was not only an athletic win, but it was a morale-lifting win for everybody in the State of West Virginia. The Oklahoma Sooners are a powerful team, and I congratulate them for their effort. But when mind and body of a Mountaineer gets together, there's hardly any stopping us. I think that is what we found at the game. The team always tries to embody the spirit of the Mountain State, and it is a shining light for the people of West Virginia. The fans, the coaches, the university, the president, the athletic director, and I have to mention the pride of West Virginia, our Mountaineers marching band, are something that I know took our teammates into a very difficult athletic and emotional situation at the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. 
   I also want to congratulate the MVPs, Pat White and Reed Williams. Reed Williams is a native West Virginian. He's from Moorefield, West Virginia. He was valedictorian of his high school class. He is the true embodiment of a student athlete. 
   We have a saying in West Virginia that we like to say whenever we have a great victory, and that is, as we say in West Virginia, ``It's a great day to be a Mountaineer.'' It certainly was on the day that West Virginia won the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in Arizona.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. I thank the gentleman for recognizing me. 
   The Speaker, we just listened to her, and her leadership team had an opportunity to present this House with a truly bipartisan energy bill. Both she and the majority leader have talked about the compromises that they reached and how they worked on a compromise. I don't know who they're compromising with. They're compromising with themselves, negotiating with themselves. 
   Instead, they chose to bring forth what I think is a blatantly partisan bill. It will increase energy costs in my State, and again, essentially ignores West Virginia, its people, its abundant supply of coal.  
   I go back to the fact that I've listened to both the majority leader and the Speaker in their remarks, and not one mention of clean coal in both of their remarks. 
   So let me be clear, in a time when West Virginians are making hard decisions based on their gas, electric and home heating needs, this bill offers them nothing more but Washington. All talk and no action. 
   We know it's going to take a comprehensive plan to wean our Nation off of $700 billion worth of dependence on foreign sources of oil, but this bill just doesn't do the job. 
   It includes a renewable portfolio standard that will send electric costs skyrocketing in a State like West Virginia by mandating difficult standards, all of this at a time when many of my constituents can barely afford gas or their heating bill. 
   This bill doesn't invest in royalties for offshore exploration into alternative energy sources like clean coal or renewable fuels. Coal-to-liquid has great promise to lead this Nation towards our energy independence. 
   The American people gave the leadership of Congress a homework assignment to solve our energy crisis, and they responded by waiting till the last minute, hastily writing their bill, and delivering it late. Sadly, it fully deserves the ``F'' that the American people will be giving it. 
   At a time when a solution demands real bipartisanship, this bill just doesn't cut the muster. I'm on the bipartisan bill. We worked night after night with no lobbyists, no leadership, no special interests, and we found good compromise in that bipartisan bill, and I'm proud of the efforts on both sides of the aisle where we joined together. 
   With this empty shell of an energy bill, I'm afraid I'm disappointed and I'm afraid the American people will be, too.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I represent an energy State, West Virginia. We give every day. We have abundant resources of coal and natural gas. We understand energy. 
   Coal is one of our Nation's most abundant resources, and any truly comprehensive energy policy must include coal. This bill does not. It is not all-of-the-above. 
   We have more coal under our feet than the Middle East has oil. I've sponsored legislation, coal-to-liquid. It holds great promise for helping us towards our energy independence, but such investment received lip service from the leadership of this Congress. In fact, the disdain for coal among congressional leadership is well known across this Nation. 
   It's time we stood up and had a vote on a real bipartisan energy bill that includes coal as part of the solution. 
   You know what? The American public is frustrated. They're tired of this bickering. They want us to work as Republicans and Democrats in a bipartisan way to solve this issue. We need an energy plan that works for the American people. We also need an energy plan that's actually going to get signed into law. This one doesn't have a bit of hope.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Chairman, I would like to first thank my good friend the gentlewoman from Illinois for yielding to me and also for her leadership as the ranking member on the Housing Subcommittee. She has left big shoes for me to fill, but I know she is not going to be too far away on the committee, so I can lean on her for help. 
   I also look forward to working with Chairwoman Waters on this committee. I know we will work well together as you all have set up a great pattern of bipartisanship on the Housing Subcommittee. So thank you very much for your leadership. 
   The legislation we are considering today is an important step towards stabilizing a housing market that has been in a steady decline over this past year. While many of us were working in our districts over the recess period, our financial systems were experiencing a bit of a credit crunch, due in part to the problems in the subprime housing markets. 
   Many of the problems we are facing in the housing market are due to individuals with credit challenges and inexperienced first-time home buyers utilizing very complex and creative financing tools to allow them to purchase a home which they would otherwise not be able to do. 
   Homeownership is something that we all aspire to, and I am proud to say that my State of West Virginia has some of the highest homeownership in the country, over 70 percent, because with homeownership comes solid community involvement, comes better economic health, and also better socialization and education levels. 
   The use of interest-only and adjustable-rate mortgages is now causing problems as these mortgages is now resetting at much higher rates, frequently unaffordable rates causing an increase in foreclosures. 
   The reforms to the FHA will help provide stability in the housing market by providing greater assistance to new and riskier home buyers. Some of the reforms I would like to highlight are the extension of the maximum length for an FHA loan from 35 to 40 years; directing the FHA to serve high-risk home buyers while lowering upfront fees for high-risk buyers; allowing for a zero down payment for first-time home buyers, and I'm hearing today also for those who are FHA qualified; and authorizing an increase in FHA loan limits for both rural and urban areas. 
   The final component is especially important because in many areas the current loan limits are outpriced by many larger metropolitan areas. These expanded limits will help many buyers access stable and secure loans so they can achieve the goal of homeownership. 
   Each of these reforms has bipartisan support, and we must continue to work together in order to provide much-needed assistance to our struggling homeowners. 
   Again, I would like to thank Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member Biggert for their hard work on this critical legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. I want to thank the ranking member for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation to raise the Federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour. It has been 10 years since Congress passed legislation to increase the minimum wage, and I am pleased that we are going to pass such an increase today. 
   I have supported an increase in the minimum wage since coming to Congress, and I have voted for it both as part of a package including a permanent solution to the death tax. And I will vote for it as a stand-alone bill. The minimum wage in my home State of West Virginia is $5.85 an hour, with recent increases already scheduled to be $6.55 this June and then $7.25 in June 2008. Twenty-eight other States have enacted minimum wages that are higher than the Federal minimum wage, and I am pleased today that we will vote to increase the minimum wage for workers across the country. 
   I will vote for H.R. 2 because it will improve the quality of life for low-wage workers in my congressional district and across the Nation. This legislation would be much better, however, if it included the elements of the Republican alternative offered by Ranking Member MCKEON and Ranking Member MCCRERY.     
   Millions of small business employees across the country lack health insurance. It is probably the largest segment of working Americans who are unable to afford and cannot find health insurance, a vitally important part of leading a good-quality life here in the United States. 
   We should authorize association health plans, allowing small companies to bind together through trade associations to create the economies of scales necessary to reduce the cost of health care. This is essential. It makes certain that we should act to offer affordable health care coverage for workers at the same time we are increasing the minimum wage. 
   The Republican substitute, by offering tax relief that would lead to new job creation and by offering affordable health care in addition to increasing the minimum wage, would help millions more Americans than the bill we are considering today, and I regret we are not taking the more comprehensive approach. 
   Nonetheless, this legislation will help many women and men across the country, and I intend to support it.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of increasing Pell Grants, which we have done over the past 12 years, contrary to what we heard earlier. This action would have the greatest impact on helping lower-income students afford a college education. 
   Later today, the House will consider legislation that is intended to increase college access by temporarily reducing subsidized student loan interest rates, a helpful measure. But I suggest to my colleagues that an average 18-year-old student will not base whether they can go to college on whether their percentage of interest rate is 6.8 today or 6.14 for the 2007 year. What would make a difference is the amount of aid, either grants or loans, that is immediately available to help them afford school. To make college accessible, we should focus on what we can do now for students, not when they graduate. 
   Regardless of how you feel today, we need to work together on a bipartisan basis to increase Pell Grants to ensure that they are sufficient to help students to afford a higher education. This would be a very effective way to help students from low- and middle-income families afford college.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the ranking member for yielding to me; I would like to thank the Rules Committee for making my amendment in order; and I would like to thank the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the ranking member for making this an en bloc amendment. 
   Each of our veterans who have served this country deserves to be honored by a grateful Nation. I come to the floor today to offer an amendment that provides funding for the Authorized Provider Partnership Program, otherwise known as AP3. 
   Before the 2000 national defense authorization, veterans who had fully retired from the military were normally not afforded a traditional military funeral. The 2000 National Defense Authorization Act then established the AP3 program, which required the Department of Defense to provide at least the folding and presentation of a flag,  the playing of taps, and to assist with any transportation or miscellaneous expenses. 
   The original provisions of this bill allow the Department of Defense to waive the obligation, which has resulted now in their funding being cut from this program. My amendment will reinstate the funding specifically for AP3 to $3 million, $1 million for the three branches of the military, to continue funeral honor services. 
   Our veterans have served our country bravely and were prepared to take the ultimate sacrifice. We owe it to them to give them a proper and fitting sendoff in the recognition that they have served this country with honor. Their love of country will not go unrecognized. 
   I would like to say, each of us members have attended funerals of our veterans as they passed away, and there is very compelling and very stirring of patriotism to see our older veterans pay tribute to them by honor guard or folding or presentation of the flag. It is critical we continue this, and I hope that this amendment will be passed.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (CODE TALKERS RECOGNITION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4544, the Code Talkers Recognition Act of 2008, introduced by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Boren). 
   This legislation honoring the Native American code talkers, who served this country so honorably in the First and Second World Wars, is long overdue. 
   Mr. Speaker, the history of Native American code talkers is long and honorable. And I'm going to go through a little bit of this, beginning with their striking display of patriotism. 
   When the First World War broke out, Native Americans were technically not citizens of the United States--hard to believe, really; nevertheless, many enlisted and fought honorably as part of the American Expeditionary Force that helped to defeat the German armies. 
   In those days, as the technology of warfare changed and the size of the battlefields grew, it was necessary to transmit tactical information over what we would consider rudimentary and very unsecure communications methods that in many cases were easy for the enemy to intercept. 
   During the Second Battle of the Somme in September of 1918, and later during the Meuse-Argonne campaign in the waning days of the war, Cherokee and Choctaw natives used their own language to communicate tactical information. Since their languages were not related to any European language, the Germans intercepting it were baffled, even though the code itself was rather simple--a tank was a turtle, for example. 
   Again, in the Second World War, Native Americans signed up in large numbers to fight in both Europe and in the Pacific theater. The best known of these were the Navajos, who worked with the Marines in the Pacific. But considering both wars, code talkers came from as many as 17 different tribes. 
   Interestingly, the code talkers weren't used much in the European theater until D-day, because it was known that Adolf Hitler had been aware of the code talkers' successful role in World War I and had sent teams of German anthropologists to learn Native American languages before the start of the Second World War. The effort was largely unsuccessful, though, because there were so many different languages and dialects of those languages. 
   The role of the code talkers was largely unknown until 1968, when the story was declassified. Since then, President Reagan declared a ``Code Talkers Day,'' and in 2001 President Bush presented the Congressional Gold Medal to several Navajo code talkers.     
   Unfortunately, the bill authorizing that medal did not acknowledge the role of Code Talker heroes from other tribes in the First World War as well as the second. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has taken nearly a decade to address this oversight, and through the hard work of the gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Granger, and most recently Mr. Boren, bills were introduced to do so in each Congress since the original legislation passed. We are now at the historic point, thanks to Mr. Boren's legislation, that we can move to recognize the other heroes from the other tribes. I urge my colleagues to support this bill enthusiastically. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6950, the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Gift of Life Medal Act of 2008. 
   As everyone in this Chamber knows, the late Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones was a wonderful woman and was a tireless public servant. She sought to use her time each day to serve the people of her district and of this Nation, and the extraordinary generosity she exhibited in so many of her actions proves to be one of her lasting legacies. She was also a very joyful woman, and she brought much joy to all of those who were fortunate enough to know her. I include myself in that group. 
   However, nowhere have her selfless nature and leadership qualities been more apparent than in her decision to be an organ donor. Her untimely death was a tragedy, but because of her decision, others will be fortunate to enjoy the gift of life. 
   Currently, there are close to 100,000 individuals on the national transplant waiting list. Each hour, this number increases, adding a new name approximately every 16 minutes. Yet, despite how sobering this statistic is and the even harsher statistic that my colleague mentioned, more sobering is the number of people who die while waiting for a life-saving organ transplant. This number is 16 people per day. Understanding that reality, Representative Tubbs Jones did what she always did. She volunteered to give to those in need. 
   This legislation honors her actions. The bill before us today would establish a Stephanie Tubbs Jones Gift of Life Medal, and it would make any organ donor or family of the organ donor eligible to receive the honor. The legislation empowers the Secretary of Health and Human Services to direct the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to establish an application and assessment process for donors in order to receive the award.  
   By agreeing to this legislation, this Congress honors the actions of Representative Tubbs Jones and the actions of so many others who sought to give what they could to those in need. This is an important action, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6894, the Defense Production Act Extension and Reauthorization of 2008. 
   In 1950, at the outset of the Korean war and at the behest of President Truman, Congress acted to give the President the ability to meet a specific national security need should we have a shortfall in supplies. 
   The ability of this Nation to call on private industry to meet the demands of securing a nation are just as prominent today as they were over a half century ago when Congress first enacted this law. In an uncertain world where we face constantly changing threats and remain vulnerable to national disaster, the ability of military and civilian agencies to be given priority service to aid the American people is paramount. 
   Today, with American soldiers fighting so courageously abroad, we have the same imperative: they must have the resources and equipment they need when they need them. 
   Similarly, this country has seen the toll natural disasters can take on the Nation. Within the last weeks alone, we have seen Hurricanes Gustav, Hanna and Ike bring destruction to this Nation's shores. Responding to the needs of the families affected should be a priority, and this legislation reauthorizes the President's ability to effectively respond to those needs with priority purchases of supplies, be they water or equipment, to repair damaged railroad switches. 
   The authorities in this act are too important to be allowed to expire for any amount of time. Yet, Mr. Speaker, without the Congress acting today, these authorities will expire on September 30. The legislation before us would reauthorize the Defense Production Act in its current form, for 1 year, with no other changes to the DPA's powers. This 1-year extension will continue these authorities while providing the Congress a window to consider any need for updating this act. A recently issued GAO report on the authorities, as well as volumes of other information, will ensure engagement in an important dialogue on how to improve on this authority's taking place. Passing this law today ensures that that debate takes place without the impending pressure of adjournment. 
   I hope, Mr. Speaker, that we can undertake any needed updates of the act at the beginning of the first session of the next Congress and then extend the authorization for multiple years at that point so that these important authorities remain available to protect America, Americans and American interests, uninterrupted. 
   In closing, I would like to thank Chairman LUIS GUTIERREZ and full committee Chairman BARNEY FRANK for authoring this bipartisan legislation. Because of their leadership on this issue, Congress has before it today a bill to ensure the American people and their security interests are well served. With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 6894. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (EXTENDING THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in reluctant support really of H.R. 6965 to extend the authorization of the National Flood Insurance Program. I would prefer that this would be a debate on a consensus reform package that would put the National Flood Insurance Program on a more actuarially sound footing. 
   Both the House and Senate have passed separate bills that include important and necessary reforms. However, there are significant differences between the two packages. And, unfortunately, we have been unable to reach a compromise on our differences. 
   Although there are differences in the two approaches, there are some similarities. For instance, both measures would reauthorize the flood program for 5 years and include important reforms to phase out premium subsidies and require more realistic pricing that is actuarially sound and based on the actual risk of flooding. Both bills would also phase out rate subsidies for nonresidential properties and non-primary residences. 
   One of the great challenges for this program is the debt, which presents an ongoing challenge and stands at $17.4 billion resulting from the 2005 hurricanes. Any flood program reform package has to address the NFIP's debt, the interest payments on that debt and the net impact that they have on the budget. 
   We also have to face the reality of new claims in the pipeline to cover losses from Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, as well as the flooding in the Midwest earlier this summer. 
   Both bills contain strong and prudent reforms designed to strengthen the flood program, phase out subsidies, and encourage a premium pricing structure that is based on the actual risk of property loss from flooding. 
   The National Flood Insurance Program is currently set to expire on September 30. For this reason we are today considering a simple 7-month extension designed to keep the flood insurance program up and running past the September 30 deadline. Allowing the flood insurance program to expire could cause serious disruptions to the mortgage market and we could not afford to let that happen, especially in light of our current financial instabilities. A 7-month extension would allow Congress time to complete their work on a comprehensive reform package. 
   I want my colleagues in the House to know that the Republican members on the Financial Services Committee remain committed to enacting comprehensive reforms that not only modernize the National Flood Insurance Program so that homeowners will continue to have access to flood insurance, but also to protect the American taxpayer at the same time. I urge passage of this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time, although I have no further speakers.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this misguided energy bill, or the ``energy without half the lights on'' bill. 
   There's a saying in West Virginia that coal keeps the lights on, but H.R. 3321 effectively turns off the lights on the country's energy supply. It's important to our economy, to family budgets, and to businesses across the country that we increase our supply of domestically produced energy of all types. That includes energy from renewable sources, like wind, but it should also include more traditional energy sources like clean coal and natural gas that provide the bulk of our country's energy. 
   We need to take advantage of our own natural resources to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. Yet the bill we consider today does nothing to support clean coal to liquid fuels. This country has a 240-year supply of coal that could be used to replace some of the imported oil we currently use for transportation fuel. Coal provides over one-half of our Nation's electricity and well over 95 percent of the power in my State of West Virginia.     
   Where is it in this bill? This is the ``no energy'' energy bill. Clean coal has the potential to be a major part of the solution in reducing our reliance on foreign oil through many technologies, among those, coal-to-liquid. 
   Besides being a major coal producer, my State of West Virginia also has a large oil and gas business and a large chemical industry that relies on natural gas as a feedstock. This bill's provisions will likely delay or reduce access to a significant portion of our natural gas reserves. 
   Increasing natural gas prices will drive up the cost of chemical manufacturing and cost more workers in this industry their jobs. An economist in my local paper this morning said, ``The fewer lands open for drilling, the higher the price for natural gas. It's not a good thing for consumers.'' 
   It simply defies logic that this House, on one hand, can condemn the high cost of energy price at the pump, heating and cooling, while on the other hand refuse to act on clean coal legislation, coal liquefaction, and cut off access to domestic oil shale and natural gas. 
   If the new direction in domestic policy means turning our back on domestic coal or turning off half our lights and if it means cutting off our access to our own natural gas and oil shale so we can be held hostage by foreign countries for energy or if it turns out half the lights or 95 percent of the lights in my State of West Virginia, I want no part of it. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this energy legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, calling for expanded domestic energy exploration and for a truly comprehensive energy policy, including renewables. 
   Access to oil and natural gas resources from Federal lands and waters is critical to the energy supply of West Virginia consumers, businesses, and homeowners. Specifically, the Outer Continental Shelf will be increasingly important to our Nation's energy future. Approximately 25 percent of U.S. oil and natural gas production comes from offshore areas. Technology has allowed the industry to explore deeper in the Gulf of Mexico and to make many new discoveries. 
   However, current policy unnecessarily keeps many promising prospects off limits, restraining additional growth and supplies. Congress and past Presidents have put a stop to offshore drilling and development. This must end. With gas prices at more than $4 a gallon and filling up the minivan at $70, we simply cannot afford to deliberately ignore our abundant resources. It is time to use our resources and to use our common sense.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of representing one of the largest congressional districts east of the Mississippi, the West Virginia Second District. 
   Some of the best-kept secrets in West Virginia, and certainly my district, are the wonderful small towns and the sense of community they provide. Treasures like these are worth celebrating every single day. 
   Last Sunday, the city of Ripley in Jackson County, West Virginia, celebrated its 175th anniversary, and I had the privilege of attending the celebration with the mayor and many fine citizens of Ripley. 
   I thought it was very fitting to read the city's motto, ``Ripley: Proud of our past--Excited about our future.'' 
   Much has changed in America since 1832 when Ripley was founded, but the fact is that Ripley remains one of the best small towns in the country. 
   In fact, when the President was looking for a place to celebrate our Nation's birthday in 2002, he looked no further than Ripley, West Virginia. It was a great decision. Every year, Ripley has the largest Independence Day celebration of any small town in America. We welcomed the President, and he enjoyed his West Virginia visit. 
   Let us all remember that small towns are truly the heart and soul of America, just as they were in 1832 at Ripley's founding. I am honored to represent them here in Washington.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Speaker, I rise today because high gas prices are placing an increasingly heavy burden on everyone, including my fellow West Virginians. As gas prices continue to spike, we deserve a sound energy policy that creates new domestic sources of energy, increases supply and puts downward pressure on gas prices. 
   I've supported anti-gouging legislation and called on the President to halt shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which could increase supply and possibly save as much as 24 cents from the price of a gallon of gas. 
   We've also increased fuel economy standards to make each gallon stretch a little further. Yet West Virginians deserve a more comprehensive, long-term solution that provides real stability and actually leads to the creation of new energy. 
   From clean coal to oil exploration and drilling to our desperate need for new refineries to expanded natural gas exploration, we have a wide range of options and ways to make a difference. Unfortunately, many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have stood in the way of a truly comprehensive energy policy. 
   It's time that Congress stop the rhetoric and work for real solutions.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my colleague from Florida and her amendment that will enhance the ability to secure our borders. 
   The enactment of the Secure Fence Act last year was a step in the right direction because this act recognized that most illegal immigrants do enter from the southern border. The Secure Fence Act directs the Department of Homeland Security to construct hundreds of miles of reinforced fencing, not just fencing, but additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras and sensors along that southwest border. 
   Building the fence is a very expensive and urgent construction project. My constituents in West Virginia, who do not have a border, say, What is taking so long, and why are so many people still able to enter our country illegally? Unfortunately, part of it has been a lack of funding. 
   So with this amendment, I think the gentlewoman from Florida has put forth a good-faith effort to see that this fence not only is built, but is built quicker and that the border becomes more secure. 
   I support her amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. I would like to join in the chorus of support. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we have heard, the section 811 program provides housing assistance and supportive services for persons with disabilities. I have seen firsthand in my own district the good works that this program provides, and I am sure it is the same for members across the Nation. 
   The timing of the passage of this legislation is especially significant, as the House just passed the Americans with Disabilities Act amendments earlier today. It is appropriate that we would now consider legislation to improve our housing programs for those with disabilities who choose to live independently. 
   We have heard a good review, I believe, of the program. We know that it allows persons with disabilities to live independently. I think that's important to emphasize the independent nature of the 811 program. It is also the only Federal program that is solely dedicated to very low-income folks with serious or long-term disabilities. Unfortunately, sometimes those are coupled together because you have a serious or long-term disability, which sometimes prevents you from working, and it puts you into that low or very low-income bracket. 
   We have talked about some of the revisions, programatic issues and changes that have been made, terminating 811's Mainstream Tenant-Based Rental Assistance Program and transferring those vouchers to section 8, modernizing the Capital Advance Program, establishing a project rental assistance demonstration program and revising the definitions of ``group home,'' ``people with disabilities,'' ``supportive housing for persons with disabilities.'' 
   Also in this bill, we repeal the authority of the Secretary to waive size limitations on group homes and individual living facilities. These improvements to the program will help provide a better life for individuals with disabilities and their families. 
   The ability to live independently with the assistance of supportive services is critical to improving the lives of the disabled and allowing them to be active participants in their communities. 
   I join in thanking Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus. I would like to particularly thank Mr. Murphy for his leadership on this issue and Mrs. Biggert for her leadership as well.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (PRESERVING AND EXPANDING MINORITY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 4043, the Preserving and Expanding Minority Depository Institutions Act of 2007. This bipartisan legislation, introduced by Chairman Watt and Ranking Member Miller of the Financial Services Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee is intended to support our Nation's minority banks. The bill includes new reporting requirements which will help gauge the effectiveness of government programs that assist minority banks. Like other community banks, minority banks may confront unique challenges because of their smaller size. 
   Section 308 of FIRREA, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, mandates that the FDIC in conjunction with the Office of Thrift Supervision work to preserve existing minority banks, promote the creation of new minority banks, and provide technical assistance and training. Although not required to do so, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve also provide assistance to minority banks. 
   H.R. 4043 will codify the advisory role of the OCC and the Federal Reserve by expanding section 308 of FIRREA to include both of these agencies. Additionally, the legislation directs all four banking regulators to report annually to Congress on their efforts to preserve, promote, and assist minority banks. 
   At an October 30 Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing on minority banks, the OCC and Federal Reserve did not object to being covered by section 308 of FIRREA, and all four regulators stated that they would also not object to the annual reporting requirement since most of them already include minority bank information in reports they currently submit to Congress. 
   At that same hearing, the subcommittee heard testimony that many of the regulators' programs are underutilized by the minority banks they are designed to help. According to a report issued by the Government Accountability Office last year, most of the banks that did participate found these programs very, very useful. Minority banks should be encouraged to use any and all the tools provided to them by the Federal regulators. 
   I, too, join with my colleague Congressman Watt in extending our deep sympathy and great caring for our colleague Congressman Miller while he's going through the tragedy in his family. We miss him here, but his imprint is being felt through this legislation today, and we wish him God's help in dealing with this crisis.     
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of the bill, H.R. 3526, a bill that is intended to provide financial consumers with additional regulatory protections against unfair and deceptive trade policies. This measure, which the Financial Services Committee approved by voice vote, expands the range of financial regulators, as the chairman has just explained, with the authority to promulgate regulations that identify and restrict such practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. 
   Today only the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the National Credit Union Administration have this authority. This bill expands that list to  include the other Federal banking regulators, namely the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 
   The legislation also mandates that regulations promulgated under the relevant section of the FTC Act be prescribed ``jointly by such agencies to the extent practicable,'' in consultation with the FTC. And it requires the GAO to report on the status of the regulations of the Federal banking agencies and the NCUA regarding unfair and deceptive acts. 
   In testimony before our committee earlier this year, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Chair of the FDIC recommended that the committee make these changes, which also are supported by consumer advocates. This bill merits our support, and I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (SECTION 202 SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 2930, the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act of 2007. I would like to thank my colleague from Florida for all of his good, hard work and the leadership of the committee, the Financial Services Committee, for the work they have done on this. 
   Affordable housing with supportive services is a key component for seniors seeking to stay in their homes and to ``age in place.'' The section 202 housing for the elderly program is the primary HUD program that provides housing exclusively for low-income elderly households. H.R. 2930 reforms the section 202 elderly housing program making it more effective and efficient and better able to meet the housing needs of our elderly. 
   Today, we are facing a growing elderly housing crisis in this country. According to the 2005 census data, there are approximately 3.6 million seniors living below the poverty line. Among senior renters, 1.29 million have worst case housing needs, meaning they spend over 50 percent of their income on housing. 
   The section 202 program has been an important tool in addressing these serious housing needs by providing capital advance grants to nonprofit housing sponsors to build new elderly housing facilities and project rental assistance contracts to subsidize very low-income elderly residents of these facilities. Many nonprofit sponsors are faith-based organizations with a mission to serve the elderly. As a condition of receiving a capital advance, which does not have to be repaid, a nonprofit sponsor must make housing available for a period of no less than 40 years. As a result of these efforts, the section 202 program currently supplies over 320,000 units of housing to very low-income elderly citizens. 
   While the section 202 program has been successful at providing much-needed housing resources to our very low-income seniors, it is estimated that 10 seniors are waiting for each unit that becomes available. Participants and developers of the section 202 housing program maintain that the current regulation and HUD administration of the program can be time consuming and bureaucratic. H.R. 2930 will improve the section 202 elderly housing program by streamlining and simplifying the development and preservation of HUD's section 202 properties and by increasing participation by not-for-profit developers, private lenders, investors and State and local funding agencies. 
   I do want to point out to my colleagues that the bill we are considering  on the floor today includes several changes to the bill reported out of the Committee on Financial Services on September 25. While the bill as reported did have a $94 million cost for fiscal year 2008 and a $212 million cost over 5 years, those costs have been removed by the elimination of the mortgage sale demonstration program and the subordination or assumption of existing debt provisions. The Congressional Budget Office now reports the costs associated with this bill to be insignificant. 
   I would also like to thank my colleagues and Chairman Frank in particular for his willingness to work with me on a provision to resolve a problem that non-metropolitan States like my home State of West Virginia have experienced when attempting to qualify for funds under the section 202 program. It is important to recognize that the need for housing for the very low-income elderly extends beyond metropolitan areas and it needs the flexibility for rural and suburban areas to be able to qualify for these funds. The very low-income elderly of rural West Virginia deserve the very same resources available to the elderly in the larger areas. 
   H.R. 2930 now includes provisions to establish a national competition for non-metro elderly housing funds and will allow regional offices to administer elderly housing allocations. This greater flexibility will help create more elderly housing units in rural States like mine. 
   I would like to pause and thank the housing advocates in my State of West Virginia for bringing this issue before me in a very timely manner so we could fix this while we are dealing with the section 202 program. So I want to thank my fellow West Virginians for helping us out here. 
   Mr. Speaker, the affordable rental housing crisis in America is having a profound effect on renters of all ages, especially our seniors, and this bill will help ease some of the affordability problems plaguing our senior population. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2930, the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act of 2007. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. CAPITO. I would like to thank the ranking member for yielding me time, even though we happen to disagree on this issue. I would also like to thank the chairman for his dedication to affordable housing. 
   I rise today in support of the creation of the affordable housing trust fund. Many States and communities across the Nation have already created State housing trust funds. 
   My home State of West Virginia is one of those, and what we've seen in the creation of that West Virginia housing trust fund is the flexibility in the ability to target certain funds to certain projects, and it becomes a very workable and a very adaptable program. 
   The creation of a national trust fund will continue the good work of providing low-income folks with rental assistance, new construction, preservation of existing units, homeownership assistance and many other important programs. 
   This trust fund will provide State and local housing authorities with the funding and flexibility to best address the unique housing needs of their communities. Certainly the needs of communities in my home State of West Virginia are drastically different than those in the larger urban areas. For instance, in West Virginia we have a high homeownership, but we also have a definite question about the quality of the housing that people are living in and the rehabilitation of those homes is extremely important. 
   We also have an aging population where the different needs and different  housing situations change, and I don't think we are addressing those needs, and I think this Federal housing trust fund could help with us with that. 
   So today I applaud this bill. I applaud the flexibility and adaptability in it, and I'm very much in favor of the ability that this trust fund is going to have to be able to adapt and create housing opportunities for those who need it.

   I have a very simple amendment today expressing the sense of Congress that the Arlington National Cemetery shall provide a site for a memorial marker to honor the lives of United States Armed Forces members who died in an air crash at Bakers Creek, Australia, on June 14, 1943. The amendment provides that the Secretary of the Army shall have the exclusive authority over the design of the memorial and the selection of the site. 
   This little-known tragedy occurred during World War II, a conflict that was fought and won by what has been called America's Greatest Generation. Unfortunately, the men who died in the Bakers Creek crash were never recognized as belonging to that group of great American heroes. During their service in the South Pacific, they were on a routine flight from Australia, returning from a week's leave for R&R. The plane crashed in Bakers Creek, Australia. Unfortunately, due to orders to keep the Allied presence in Australia a secret, the crash was kept a secret by the military. 
   Thankfully, many of the families, some of whom live in my district, now know the true story of how their relatives died. My amendment would merely recognize their sacrifice by honoring their service with a memorial marker at Arlington National Cemetery.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of S. 496, the Appalachian Regional Development Act Amendments of 2008. I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman NORTON, Ranking Member Mica, Ranking Member Graves and also my colleague from Ohio, Representative Space, for their steadfast support of the Commission and for the people of Appalachia. 
   As a Member of Congress from West Virginia, I can attest to the tremendous work the Appalachian Regional Commission, or the ARC as it is called, has done to bring clean water, safe roads, new jobs and a better quality of life to millions of people in the Appalachian region. 
   Over the last few years, the ARC has made a number of investments in my district, including an economic development strategy and business incubator in Elkins, a child care facility in Moorefield, and the new Corridor H highway. 
   The Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 established the ARC to promote regional coordination and develop projects that will trigger jobs, economic growth, and a better quality of life. The Commission is led by two co-chairmen. One is Presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed, and the other is selected by the Governors of the participating States. As my colleague mentioned, the Commission includes all or part of 13 States, including the entire State of West Virginia, parts of Tennessee, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and Mississippi. The House companion bill passed the House last year. The Senate bill we are considering today includes an amendment that reflects our agreement with the Senate on the differences. 
   The bill reauthorizes the Commission for 5 years. In addition, the bill amends current law to allow the Commission to cover up to 70 percent of costs for projects that address problems in communities at risk of becoming distressed in the region. These programs include infrastructure projects, demonstration health projects, housing projects and initiatives for telecommunications, technology and entrepreneurship. 
   This bill also authorizes the creation, as my colleague mentioned, of the Economic and Energy Development Initiative, which I think is a great addition, which will provide grants to develop new alternatives for utilizing our vast conventional energy resources. I'm also pleased that this compromise includes language from the House bill which would discourage earmarking projects in future appropriation bills. 
   Leveraging Federal funds in West Virginia and the other Appalachian States has helped dramatically improve our communities over the years. The investment has resulted in a reduction of poverty, the creation of jobs, and the improvement of health and education. We still have a ways to go. And that is why I think this bill is extremely important for reauthorization today. 
   The work of the Commission is an example of the Federal and State partnership that has promoted economic growth in needed areas and distressed areas of high unemployment and high poverty so that these communities can begin to prosper independently in the future. 
   Thank you again. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   This part of our country has historically struggled, and with the current energy issues that we have before us and the high price of gasoline, we are an energy-rich region of this country. We can contribute to the solutions through either coal to liquid and our natural gas reserves and other things that need to be added to a comprehensive, all-of-the-above energy plan for this country.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Earth Day in support of H.R. 5151, the Wild Monongahela Act: A National Legacy for West Virginia's Special Places, introduced by my colleague from West Virginia's Third District and the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, Congressman Nick Rahall. 
   I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation, and I  commend the chairman for all of his hard work on this bill. 
   In 1964, Congress enacted the Wilderness Act that permanently protected some of the most natural and undisturbed places in America. Today the U.S. Forest Service preserves the natural and cultural resources and values of the forest system, including those of the Monongahela National Forest for the enjoyment, education and inspiration of this and future generations. 
   West Virginia's wilderness is part of our history and heritage, and it is passed on as a legacy. This bipartisan bill will protect approximately 38,000 acres of the Mon Forest in West Virginia through the designation of three additional wilderness areas and expansion of three existing Federal wilderness areas including: Big Draft, Cranberry Expansion, Dolly Sods Expansion, Dry Fork Expansion, Roaring Plains West and Spice Run. 
   West Virginia's national forest provides an excellent outdoor experience with our State's majestic mountains, winding rivers and superb hunting, camping, fishing, backpacking and other activities. Protecting these additional acres of pristine forest will ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy the natural beauty of our home State of West Virginia. 
   Over the last several months I've engaged in discussion with many of my constituents, many whom are avid hunters, anglers, mountain bikers and outdoorsmen who have a unique and vested interest in the impact of the wilderness designation on their local community. The people of this area are well acquainted with wilderness, and H.R. 5151 reflects their desire to preserve their natural treasures, while maintaining important flexibility for the local residents. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is vitally important to guaranteeing that future generations of Americans can experience the natural wonder and beauty of West Virginia. I applaud Chairman Rahall and his staff for all of their hard work on this bill and all those in West Virginia who have seen it come to this point. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support the legislation, and I encourage each of them to experience firsthand the pristine natural beauty of West Virginia and the Mon National Forest.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, ``hero'' is not a label that should be employed carelessly, and in a time when our country has many heroes serving abroad, I rise today to honor a hero at home: Corporal Ronald Fletcher. 
   A member of the Jefferson County Sheriffs Department, Corporal Fletcher was pursuing a burglary suspect into a home last month when he was shot twice in the chest and once in the arm. 
   At only 26 years old, he lay seriously wounded in the house with the suspect until his fellow deputies were able to remove him safely. 
   Today, just one short month after the incident, I am proud to share that Corporal Fletcher is home and well on his way to recovery. As a testimony to his profound sense of duty, he recently complained about being bored in his home full of fruit baskets and is eager to return to service. 
   Mr. Speaker, I salute the heroism of Corporal Fletcher and the valor of the Jefferson County Sheriffs Department. West Virginia is sincerely grateful for their service.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize February as National Heart Month. Heart disease is the number one killer of women in America, taking the lives of nearly half a million women a year. That is one per minute. 
   It claims the lives of more women than the next five causes of death. In my home State of West Virginia, heart disease kills 12 women per day. That is 31 percent of all female deaths between the years of 1999 to 2003. 
   On February 2, people from across the Nation participated in Go Red for Women Day to support the fight against heart disease. Go Red for Women is the American Heart Association's nationwide movement that celebrates the energy, passion and power we have as women to band together and fight this disease. 
   Too few people realize the threat associated with heart disease. The good news is that heart disease can largely be prevented. By learning all of the serious health threats such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, we can work to reduce our risks. 
   Go Red for Women is an innovative way to raise awareness of heart disease, and 64 percent of women who died of coronary heart disease had no symptoms. We have to take action for our hearts. By joining together across America, we can help support ongoing research and education about women and heart disease. When we wear our red, it reminds us of our responsibility. 
   I urge my colleagues to join together in celebrating National Heart Health Month.

   Jeremiah achieved a new title at the end of a 7-year career in Boy Scout Troop 88, which is chartered by the Elkins United Methodist Church. He served as an assistant patrol leader and bugler, and was elected patrol leader. 
   Jeremiah performed many community service projects, including Adopt-a-Highway and other community beautification projects. Boy Scout Troop 88 also organized a ``Scouting For Food'' project at Elkins, which is a national Boy Scout activity where members of the troop collect food donations from their community to allocate to food banks. For his Eagle Scout project, he cleared and finished an area in Riverbend Park for the public to use. 
   Jeremiah is a student at Elkins High School, where he is president of the Future Farmers of America chapter. He is a member of the National Honor Society and is on the wrestling team and participates in the band. 
   I am proud to recognize Jeremiah on his accomplishments. Randolph County and the State of West Virginia are fortunate to have him as a leader and a volunteer in his community.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1615, Securing Aircraft Cockpits Against Lasers Act of 2007. 
   The bill amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft or at the flight of an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States. 
   In the last 15 years, the FAA reports over 500 incidents where people have aimed lasers into airplane cockpits. FAA research has shown that laser illuminations can temporarily disorient or disable a pilot during critical stages of a flight such as landing or take-off, and in some cases, may cause permanent damage. 
   This type of interference cannot be tolerated. This is a good, commonsense measure aimed at deterring and prosecuting those who commit a senseless act of potential sabotage. 
   I congratulate Congressman Keller, the sponsor of this legislation, for his leadership and dedication to this issue. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (SECTION 515 RURAL HOUSING PROPERTY TRANSFER IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3873, the 515 Rural Housing Property Transfer Improvement Act of 2007, which would expedite the transfer of ownership of rural multifamily housing projects with loans made and ensured under section 515 of the Housing Act. 
   First, I would like to commend my colleague from New Hampshire (Mr. Hodes) for his dedication to rural housing issues and for the bipartisan way that this bill has come to the floor. I would also like to thank the chairman of the full committee. Since he's sitting there, I want to thank him. 
   The result of these bipartisan efforts is a bill that represents a sound approach to improving the administration of the Department of Agriculture's section 515 program. 
   Section 515 is a direct loan program administered by the USDA that provides low-interest loans to construct and renovate affordable multifamily housing. While this program has provided numerous benefits, as my colleague has enumerated, to low-income rural families, the process by which the USDA's State rural development offices considers requests to transfer ownership must be improved. 
   Section 515 owners may wish to transfer the project to other entities during the terms of their loan for a variety of reasons, including changes in owner circumstances or changes in local market conditions. Transfers of ownership in section 515 can be beneficial for all parties, as it presents an opportunity to recapitalize a project for better maintenance, rehabilitation and improved management. 
   Unfortunately, the transfer application process is time-consuming, and many of the rural development offices do not process these applications in a timely fashion simply because they are probably overwhelmed with the process. Certain RD offices have been slow in approving transfer requests, leading to a number of problems, including inaccurate appraisals and expiration of outside financing rate guarantees and bond and tax credit deadlines. This nonaction has been a major source of irritation for owners of 515s and groups representing section 515 tenants. 
   H.R. 3873 would fix these impediments by directing the USDA Secretary to streamline the application process, require applications to be processed within a timely deadline, and to transfer any applications not processed within that deadline to the Office of Rental Housing Preservation that would then have sole review authority. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill was approved, as my colleague mentioned, by a voice vote in the Financial Services Committee and makes commonsense changes to section 515 that would improve the ownership transfer process. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. I would like to thank the gentleman from Alabama for recognizing me and yielding me the time, and I greatly appreciate the leadership of the chairman and ranking member on the Committee of Financial Services for bringing this important legislation before the House today. 
   The legislation before us is a bipartisan response to a problem that is affecting every congressional district across this Nation, the rising number of foreclosures and a large number of impending alternative mortgage resets, combined with a large number of delinquencies in mortgage payments. It is very important for Members to look at this legislation in its entirety.  
   When combined on the whole, the components of this legislation will provide consumers with the necessary tools and protections to hopefully avoid another housing crisis like we are experiencing, but also realize the importance of not clamping down so hard, and we have heard some folks express concern about this, that we still have the innovations and we still have the ability of subprime mortgages for those who are now living because of the benefits that subprime benefits allows them. 
   In this bill, we require the registration of all originators under a national registry will be established by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators. These new licensing requirements, coupled with the national registry, will make it much more difficult for fraudulent originators to bounce from State to State. This is a problem my State of West Virginia has expressed concern about. 
   Another component that Mrs. Biggert talked about in her statement is to provide consumers with greater access to housing counseling. The availability of counseling will help individuals learn and understand the complicated financial disclosures, all of the paperwork and technical languages that come along with securing and purchasing a mortgage. 
   Another important reform that was adopted during our committee markup is the inclusion of a one-page estimate outlining the total cost and potential changes in the cost for the consumer over the life of the mortgage product. I have been lucky enough to be a homeowner, and I know when we go in to close at the time to secure our mortgage, the amount of paper and signatures that you have to go through to try to figure out what you are doing is very intimidating. So to have this one-page disclosure I think gives the consumer the ability to have this information right in front of them so they can know what they are getting into and making this process easier. 
   This legislation also provides more certainty and clarity for the liability of the entities that purchase mortgages on the secondary market. 
   I would like to particularly thank the chairman of the committee for helping me work through the technicalities of this language to explain to my local newspaper and my local consumer advocates what this language means in the bill. We live in a national economy and must recognize the need for consistency across the board. 
   In addition to the bipartisan underlying legislation, we will also be considering I think a very important addition to this bill, an amendment I have worked on with Mr. Kanjorski and Mrs. Biggert that will provide additional protection for consumers. This amendment will now require escrow accounts for some mortgages and will provide borrowers with the budgeting tools necessary to properly manage taxes and insurances on their property. This amendment will also include Federal appraisal standards with serious penalties. 
   I fully support this bill and thank the chairman and the ranking member.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 289, which is intended to raise awareness of the problem of sexual assault in the United States and encourage ways to prevent it. 
   The statistics outlined in the resolution speak for themselves and are nothing less than horrific. A person is sexually assaulted in the United States every 2 1/2 minutes. Children and young adults are the most at risk. Forty-four percent of sexual assault victims are under the age of 18. 
   The emotional and physical scars from sexual assaults exact a terrible toll on our loved ones, our families, our communities, and our country. In my view, we can and we must do better. We have made important strides in this battle. We have expanded the use of DNA to solve sexual assault crimes, reduced the backlog in the testing of rape cases, and solved more sexual assault crimes, and ensuring that those who commit these heinous offense are put behind bars. 
   Last year, we passed the Adam Walsh Act to protect our children from sexual predators. Over 100,000 sex offenders were lost or unaccounted for by the States. The Adam Walsh Act will fix that problem and make sure that sex offenders are registered, that the public is aware of sex offenders in their communities, and help parents protect their children. 
   In my home State of West Virginia, domestic violence complaints have increased 400 percent since 1989. More and more, victims are feeling empowered to approach law enforcement officers with these problems. Although we all would like to see an end to domestic violence, it is a good step that more and more victims are reporting the crimes committed against them, allowing the perpetrators to be tried for their crimes. We must continue to work with victims, helping them come forward with their complaints. This can often be a difficult task, especially when the person committing the crime is a spouse, companion or family member, which is sadly often the case. 
   Madam Speaker, this resolution recognizes the important role that awareness and prevention can play in reducing the incidence of sexual assault. The crime of sexual assault is so hurtful and so tragic, we must redouble our efforts and make sure that we use every tool at our disposal to protect everyone from this horrible crime. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 119, honoring National Crime Victims' Rights Week. This resolution supports the missions and goals of National Crime Victims' Rights Week to increase public awareness of the rights, needs, and concerns of crime victims in the United States during this week and throughout the year. 
   The theme of the 2007 National Crime Victims' Rights Week is ``Victims Rights: Every Victim, Every Time.'' In honor of every victim, we renew our commitment to protecting the rights of crime victims and to providing them effective assistance programs. We also commend the countless numbers of professionals and volunteers who dedicate their lives to helping victims and survivors of crime. 
   This week is marked by many special events held across the Nation, including the national observance and candlelight ceremony held here in Washington, DC, a 5K run/walk and Victims' Rights Fair in Sierra Vista, Arizona, a Crime Victims' Rights Rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and many more. 
   While these events provide excellent opportunities to focus on victims rights, this is an issue that requires our utmost attention year-round. That is why it is encouraging that there are over 10,000 victims assistance programs providing emotional, financial, physical and spiritual support every day. 
   As the gentleman from Virginia said, a week honoring the victims and survivors of crime is especially poignant following last week's tragedy at Virginia Tech. The loss of innocent lives affects so many others who are left behind. The outpouring of prayers and condolences reminds us that victims and survivors of crime will not be forgotten and will continue to receive much needed community support. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Madam Speaker, S. 521 is a companion bill to H.R. 187 which was introduced by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar). This bill designates the Federal building and United States courthouse and customhouse at 515 West First Street in Duluth, Minnesota, as the Gerald W. Heaney Federal Building and United States Courthouse and Customhouse. The bill honors Judge Heaney's dedication to public service. 
   As we have heard previously, after serving in the Army during World War II and acquiring a law degree from the University of Minnesota Law School, Judge Gerald Heaney entered into the private practice of law from 1946 to 1966. Judge Heaney's career as a judge began in 1966 with an appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit by President Lyndon Johnson. 
   Judge Heaney had a reputation for championing equal justice for underprivileged and vulnerable citizens. He retired after 40 years of service on August 31, 2006.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Missouri. I look forward to our second debate, our second civil debate on a new topic. 
   Before we move to the subject at hand, I would like to join with my colleagues in expressing my deep sorrow at the passing of our colleague, JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. Just briefly, she was a kind and gentle person. She was a great advocate for many things that she believed in. She was a pioneer. But, for me, she was just a very helpful and warm and friendly person. 
   When I came to Congress, she had already been here for several years. She was the chairman of the Caucus on Women's Issues, and I was the vice chair for the Republican side. JUANITA was always very helpful, always very concerned that I was making my way in my first several months in Congress, and I think the way she crossed the aisle, the way that she treated me with kid gloves, so-to-speak, in the beginning of my term, is something that I will never forget. So my thoughts and prayers are with her. Bless her family during this very tough time, and know that she will be missed. 
   I would also like to express publicly before this body and before this Nation my deep sadness over the tragic events at Virginia Tech last week. I haven't spoken publicly on the House floor about this, but it is deeply crushing to all of us, has been, and it has sort of set a pall or a feeling of helplessness for all of us. 
   I have college age children. I can't imagine the despair the families are feeling who have lost a loved one, to realize that that phone call that you are waiting for is never going to come. 
   So, to my friends in the Virginia Tech community, many West Virginians attend Virginia Tech. We have a great fondness for Virginia Tech, except possibly when we are playing them in football. But certainly our collective hearts go out to them during this difficult time. 
   I yield back to my friend from Missouri, and we will kick off the evening.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Thank you, I appreciate your opening statements. This may be a very civil debate because I couldn't agree with you more in that our civil justice system should be readily available, should be the place for the individual to seek redress when they have been wronged by either a corporation or corporate injustice or product failure. And I think that is the intent of our court system. 
   However, what we are experiencing now in the United States is an overabundance, a glut of lawsuits that are clogging our courts, that are in some cases awarding outrageous jackpot types of awards, and because of that, because of that jackpot sort of mentality, many people with their legal assistance are clogging the courts so that those people who have suffered injustices and those people who are due awards are unable to get there. 
   One of the issues that I think is extremely important is the cost to our economy. We talk all of the time on the floor about the importance of small businesses in the United States. I come from a small State, and I think small business comprises close to 90 percent of the businesses in our State. When you look at the burden of the current tort system on our small businesses, we are breaking the backs of our small business people. 
   I would like to refer to my chart over here: effect on small business, the tort liability price tag for small businesses in America is $88 billion a year. 
   Small businesses bear 68 percent of business tort liability costs, but only take in 28 percent of business revenue. And for the very small businesses, the tort liability price tag is $33 billion. 
   These are statistics that show, and this is from an independent resource, it is not from a group that is shaded one way or the other. It has shown the rise in the cost of tort claims in this country. 
   Very small businesses pay 44 percent of tort liability costs out of pocket as opposed to through insurance. And so what happens is a lot of times small businesses, one small business is one large case or one frivolous lawsuit away from having to close their doors. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from Missouri to see if he has a reaction to that.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. I am glad you brought up medical malpractice reform because in West Virginia we have lived this subject since I have been in Congress. In the campaign of 2002, many doctors were leaving the State of West Virginia, closing up shop, early retirement, choosing to try another State because of either the unavailability of medical malpractice insurance or the astronomically skyrocketing escalation of medical liability reform. 
   So an interesting thing happened. West Virginia is known to be a State that is very tort friendly. So people asked me how did the State legislature, which is predominantly Democratic, and the Governor, who was Democrat, how were they able to pass with relative ease such massive medical malpractice reform legislation. I know exactly how because I was in that campaign in the 2002 year.     
   It was people coming up to you on the street saying my doctor's leaving. It was grandparents, it was seniors, it was pediatricians, OB/GYNs, neurologists, trauma specialists. Our largest hospital in my community had to close and be downgraded in terms of their trauma because the trauma surgeons left because of the high cost of medical liability reform causing, in one case, a young child in Putnam County, which is like 30 minutes away, had to drive all the way to Cincinnati, he and his parents, 4 hours away, to have a penny removed from his windpipe because there was no one to do it in our local area. That could have been a life-ending experience for that family, a very, very tragic one, and actually had a happy ending. 
   So the legislature got on board, the Governor got on board and passed State medical malpractice reform with a cap. I believe it is a half million dollars on noneconomic damages. I am not 100 percent sure. There was a debate on 250 or 500, but I think it was 500. They created a West Virginia Mutual Insurance Company, and according to the statistics that I have in front of me, those medical malpractice premiums have gone down 5 percent in not only general practice but also in the specialties. 
   The large hospital I referred to earlier, where they could not recruit and retain physicians, they now are adding 49 and 50 new positions a year, whereas before they were afraid they were not even going to be able to attract 15 or 20. 
   So this medical liability reform has had a phenomenal effect in our State of West Virginia. And if I can get my other chart out here real quick, this shows some States that are considered to be in crisis, which I notice your State is in crisis over here, and West Virginia would have been in the red, in the crisis area, but we moved ourselves out to caution. We are in the yellow area, where we were actually considered one of the most difficult climates for practitioners of medicine to come. We are not a State where we are able to retain and control, and it is directly attributable to the medical liability reform bill that we passed, that the State passed in 2003.

   Mrs. CAPITO. You have skyrocketing costs of your medical liability. A lot of doctors, and I am sure you have had this conversation with the doctors, they practice basically with one arm tied behind their back because they are practicing medicine defensively. Nearly 80 percent of the doctors say they order unnecessary tests, and 74 percent say they make unnecessary referrals to specialists due to the fear of being sued. A lot of doctors are practicing defensive medicine, ordering many more medical procedures and tests to cover themselves in the case of a legal test or a lawsuit, and that raises the cost of not only their insurance but it also raises the cost of every individual's health insurance because it raises the cost of practicing medicine or delivering health care in a general sense. 
   I think that a comprehensive solution is certainly part of what we need  to look at here, and that does include the insurance companies most certainly, but it also includes looking at what has happened in some manufacturing segments that have had extreme loss of jobs; 52,000 to 60,000 jobs have been lost in the manufacturing segment of this country because of bankruptcies being caused by massive and huge tort lawsuits. And so I think that there is a median here, there is an easy median that we can find here. 
   But I would recommend to you that the experience that we had in West Virginia with medical liability reform, across the board, bringing more specialists in as a result, bringing the cost of medical liability insurance down, recruitment and retention of physicians is something that we need to look at nationwide, and that is why I support a Federal medical liability reform which I am sure is no surprise to you that I would support that and have been pushing for it over the last 7 years. 
   But I think there is also a cost to just the individual person as we inflate the cost of defending ourselves, businesses defending themselves, doctors defending themselves, hospitals defending themselves. 
   My final chart here, and I do not know if you can read it or not, but I will read the bottom line here. It shows that in 2005, the U.S. population being approximately 296 million, that the tort cost per capita for each individual is $880.     
   Whereas when you were talking about 1990 with the physicians, in 1990, that cost was only $522, which is still too much. So I think that we need to find a medium here where we can control frivolous lawsuits, where we can control the ability of people to have mass torte actions and seek friendly environments for those torte actions. And we tried to address that in Congress with a class action reform. And we need to make sure that those people that are damaged, hurt, have access to court, but also in a timely manner. With all this massive torte legislation or lawsuits in our courts, it is bogging up the courts and it is really hurting those people who are genuinely hurt and need to have remedies.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Well, I think you are getting to the point here where you are talking about the difference between a legitimate claim and a frivolous claim. 
   I don't have statistics in front of me, but I know they exist in every court in America where certain frivolous lawsuits are put out on the table, they overreach in terms of not only are they suing maybe a business, but they are going to sue the manufacturer, they are going to sue the car they rode to go to work in, they are going to sue, you know, anybody with deep pockets is going to get sued for an alleged wrong. And it is absolutely a fact that some of these cases and more and more of these cases are not founded in legitimate fact. They are frivolous. They are trying to get into the system to get a quick fix, to get a lottery mentality, to have the corporation settle, or whoever settle, so they can get in and get out of the court system, and then have their attorney take a 40 or 50 percent cut from that. 
   I had a very startling thing happen to me. A gentleman approached me at a political gathering a couple of years ago. He had oxygen, he was walking very slowly. And he came up to me and he said, I have asbestosis, and I have lung disease from that. And I took my case to court with my lawyer. And he didn't tell me how much he was awarded, but he was awarded some remedy for that. And it was very obvious that he had difficulty breathing, and it was very obvious that he needed some help, a lot of help. 
   But what he wanted to show me that day was the invoice. He got a settlement every month or every two months, a pay-out, or it might have even been every year. But he showed me how much he got, and I think it was around $1,500. And every single time he gets that he has to take off 40 percent of that, or 45 percent of that, I think it was 40 percent in this case, for his attorney. Every single time he gets a payment, his attorney gets 40 percent. And this guy was on oxygen, could barely walk. And I think, you know, there is something wrong with the system where the harmed person who needs the help and has a legitimate claim, and certainly I know lawyers take risks by taking cases, I understand that part of it, but sometimes it just seems astronomical to me that the fees are 40, by the time you get expenses, and 50 percent of what the court has determined that victim is due and willing. I think that is an injustice in the system, along with the frivolous lawsuits that we see clogging up our courts so this gentleman can get his case heard.

   I think we have talked a lot about our different perspectives on tort reform. I have talked about the need to rein in the system, because we are losing jobs. We are costing the American public, each individual, $880 is the cost for every individual for the lawsuit glut that we have in this country. Unfortunately, some of those who are damaged or who are due and willing are unable to get into a clogged-up court system. 
   We are losing jobs in some of our manufacturing segment because of the exorbitant cost of litigation. In many States, we have a medical liability crisis where physicians are paying exorbitant amounts of their hard-earned dollars for the cost of medical liability insurance, and it has proven in my State, at least, if you pass good sense medical liability insurance reform, you can rein in the cost of insurance and can make the system better. I understand there are other players at the table here. There is the Bar, there is the individual, there is certainly the business community and there is the insurance community. 
   I think the best solution to this enormous problem, this very costly problem to the American economy, is to get everybody at the table for common sense reform. We passed class action reform, and it is helping to weed out some of those large and unwieldy cases and make them adhere to more stringent requirements. 
   With that, I yield back to the gentleman from Missouri to close on this topic.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for participating tonight. He is a very able debater. I learned in our first debate when we debated tax reform that you are a wonderful closer too, so I hate to close. 
   But I would like to talk a little bit about civility, because it is very important to me. It is about being polite. It is understanding that we have different views and that we don't disrespect one another because of that. It is about believing that our ideas, yes, we believe our ideas are the right ideas, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the opposite ideas or a different idea doesn't have merit. It also doesn't mean that because we are in different parties, we don't have a lot of to give and we don't have a lot to share. I think a lot of that gets lost here on the floor of the House. 
   My great fear is because of the partisanship and the evolved incivility of our debate, that when that person turns on that TV or that young person turns on C-SPAN to watch debate, they see the rancor and they see the acrimonious debate and some of the language that is used, and what do they do? They turn it off. And then what are they doing? They are not listening to the merits of the topic. They are not listening to tax reform ideas or medical malpractice reform ideas or the war in Iraq differing ideas, because of the tone, and the way it is delivered and the words that are used have lost their way and have turned the American public off. 
   Now, when I go and speak to people in my district and I begin to talk like that, people start nodding their heads, you are right. We do stop listening. We are no longer interested. 
   So I think while these hallowed halls have had more than their share of vigorous debate, there is a good way to do it, and there is a good way to convey our ideas in a very civil way. 
   I really appreciate the way, when you said that Gerald Ford and Hale Boggs used to drive over together and then have lunch afterwards, I think it is a little late for lunch tonight, so I think we will have to do that another time. But I have enjoyed debating this topic. I look forward to the next topic that we debate. I hope that when we get together again, maybe we can get some of our other colleagues here and have more of a round-robin so we can get our colleagues not only involved in the debate on the topic, but also demonstrating a civil way to present ideas to the American public.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (HOMEOWNERS' DEFENSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, I would like to thank the two gentlemen from Financial Services from Florida for bringing this bill forward. 
   Mr. Chairman, we are all concerned about insurance rates that are increasing in Florida and other States. Representatives Brown-Waite, Putnam, Buchanan and Feeney have all been very effective and passionate advocates for their constituencies, and I would like to commend them for their hard work. 
   We can all agree that many States are facing considerable problems with the affordability of homeowners insurance. However, at this point, there is no consensus that H.R. 3355 is the best solution to the problem. In fact, there is quite a bit of disagreement amongst a broad spectrum as to what is the best manner to address this problem. Instead of granting long-term relief to middle-income coastal homeowners confronted with rising insurance costs, this bill could potentially place taxpayers at risk for bailing out insolvent State insurance companies. 
   In the past few years, some of the largest hurricanes on record tore through the gulf coast and coastal Florida. Some of the affected States have tried to protect their local markets, to limit rate increases, force coverage, or restrict market freedom. Unfortunately, these efforts have had severe unintended consequences and have done little to lower the cost of insurance for consumers. Competition has been reduced and homeowners have been left with fewer choices. Ironically, State initiatives designed to secure more coverage for their constituents have resulted in less affordability. 
   Florida created Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in 2002 because private insurers have reservations about insuring risky coastal development. While Citizens was supposed to be an insurer of last resort, it is now Florida's largest insurer, with over 1.3 million policyholders, and a total exposure of $434 billion, yet only enough funding to pay approximately $9.4 billion in claims. This undercapitalization means that if a major hurricane hits Florida, Citizens could be bankrupt by hundreds of billions of dollars. 
   To bring down the cost of insurance even more, Florida created a State reinsurance fund to sell inexpensive reinsurance to private companies to encourage them to write more business in the State. This fund has never had enough cash on hand to pay claims and has driven out the global reinsurance market, recouping losses through taxpayer assessments. According to a Georgetown University report released last summer, the Florida catastrophe fund offers $32 billion in coverage and has $1 billion on hand. 
   Of the two main titles of the bill, H.R. 3355, the first doesn't add anything new that States cannot already do on their own. The second one makes inexpensive federally subsidized loans available to State insurance companies that are curtailing the private market, resulting in less competition and higher costs to the customer. And I will add here that anytime you're federally subsidizing somebody, that's a cost to every single taxpayer in the country. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that over the next 5 years implementing this bill would cost $75 million, but even this number seriously underestimates the true cost to the American taxpayers. CBO concluded that few States would actually be interested in these loans and that they would only be made on rare occasions. Nevertheless, taxpayers could potentially be exposed to billions of dollars, leaving them with an enormous cost of capital for the loan's duration and subjecting leaders here in Congress to the inevitable pressure to later forgive loans at the taxpayers' expense. 
   Mr. Chairman, the federally headed consortium provided for in this bill, while a novel approach, likely offers nothing but an implicit Federal backing for any insured securities, much like the GSEs; not to mention States already have the ability to engage in these pooling arrangements at this day. Further emphasized in the President's Statement of Administration Policy on this bill: ``There is no need for a Federal role because States are currently free to associate to address catastrophic risk.'' 
   It is also debatable whether securitization represents any significant advantages over the sophisticated private reinsurance markets. According to the Georgetown Environmental Law and Policy Institute: ``The mere creation of this consortium would likely skew insurance premiums and encourage unwise development.'' 
   Of concern as well is that the Treasury would make loans to State catastrophe programs. Florida is currently the only State with a reinsurance fund that would qualify for these loans, but there is no doubt that this bill would encourage other States to create these programs, most likely in the Florida mode, further undermining the private market. 
   The legislation at hand even allows an interim period where other state-run insurers, such as the financially troubled Citizens in Florida, could receive these loans. We should think twice about bankrolling State insurance companies. A Federal loan to an insolvent State catastrophe fund sounds eerily similar to me to the Federal Government's ongoing loan to the  National Flood Insurance Program, which is currently carrying $18 billion in debt. 
   Republicans will offer a number of critical amendments today to try to steer this debate towards fiscal responsibility, mitigation, and free market competition. We will consider an amendment by Congressman Shays to replace the text of the bill with a bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission to report to Congress specific proposals to improve the affordability and availability of national catastrophe insurance. It would be very prudent of this body to take a step back, allow for further study, and gain a consensus that we do not have on this proposal before us today. 
   Mr. Chairman, we need to be careful when confronting this very complex issue affecting millions of homeowners that could expose all American taxpayers to huge liabilities, and we shouldn't rush to judgment for an appropriate response. 
   All of us Members of Congress here know that natural disasters can strike anywhere and everywhere in this country; and by no means are we saying, in opposition to this bill, that we shouldn't have the American response of a helping hand. We just don't feel that this is the right way to do it. We need to work together on bipartisan reforms to address market dysfunction. I think H.R. 3355 falls short on that standard. 
   There will be many productive ideas put forward this afternoon that will improve the legislation that we're considering; however, if these are not adopted, I would urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out a couple of things. I represent the State of West Virginia. In our home State for many, many, many years we had a state-run workers comp program, which caused businesses to leave, which caused workers comp rates to rise because of the nature of a state-run insurance company. Maybe this is what is going on in Florida to a certain degree with the catastrophic insurance situation and the state-run insurance company. 
   The solution we went to in West Virginia is to move workers comp to the private sector to incent private markets to come into our State. Starting January 1, we are going to have competitive bidding on our workers comp and workers comp rate. They are beginning to slide now, and our great hope is that it will become more reasonable as time goes on. 
   One concern I think that I ought to also raise and that has been raised to me, the Wildlife Federation opposes this bill because of the concerns the gentleman from Ohio alluded to in his statements in terms of the environmental aspects of this bill. Are we encouraging redevelopment in areas, particularly in our very fragile coastal areas, that are in dangerous kinds of environmental situations but also maybe were developed under less stringent rules and regulations? 
   What kind of protections do we have for our fragile coastal regions in this bill? I think it's a logical question to ask and one that has been brought forth to all of us in the Committee on Financial Services. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, as I have said in my opening statement and some of my comments, I think that this bill presents an implicit Federal backstop for catastrophe insurance to spread the risk. It has potential to cost the taxpayers of this country enormous amounts of money. 
   Let's just do a scenario where, say in Florida, hopefully this never happens, there is a catastrophe of a hurricane of very large proportions, and Florida goes through all the insurance that is available to them and comes to the Federal Government and asks for a loan. Let's say this catastrophe is of such proportions that Florida looks to their lawmakers and looks to their taxpayers and realizes they can't pay this loan back. What are we going to do here in the United States Congress? We know what we are going to do: we are going to forgive the loan. 
   I think therein lies one of the big problems in this bill, that it does go to every taxpayer in this country, it does have a formal liability to every taxpayer. Whether it says it explicitly in the bill, it is going to result in that. 
   My suggestion and some of the suggestions coming from my side of the aisle are going to be, let's step back. Let's do a study. Let's look at this. Let's make sure we have mitigation and let's make sure we are doing this responsibly. 
   I don't happen to live in Florida, and there are many times during the year when I really wish I did. Although I love living in West Virginia, many West Virginians do live in Florida, by the way, during certain parts of the year, and I know how difficult some of the catastrophes that Floridians suffer are, as well as across the coastline and across the Nation. 
   This is not about shutting them out or making them not have the ability to be able to insure their properties and live a good, wonderful life in the State of Florida. This is about finding the best solution, not only for Floridians but for the rest of the Nation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Mr. Roskam's very thoughtful amendment. I feel that it helps to work this bill, which I have obviously voiced some questions about, because it would simply require States to pay their fair share before tapping into a Federal line of credit. This will encourage State funds to handle a predictable level of loss before putting Federal dollars and Federal taxpayers on the hook for what could be billions of dollars in catastrophic loans. 
   Very briefly, I would like to say, without loss requirements, State reinsurance funds will have no incentive to actuarially price their risk since they will be getting cheap loans to assist them in paying their claims. I would like to voice support for the Roskam amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I have no opposition to Mr. Matheson's amendment. 
   I just want to go back to the last point we were taking about with Mr. Manzullo, the gentleman from Illinois. His amendment was putting forth the fact that if there is a loan to the State under these provisions that if they were in default or were not repaying their loan that there shouldn't be any further loans.     
   And the gentleman offered me a clarification by reading me some text. 
   On further looking at the text, yes, the text does say that the Secretary of the Treasury requires full payment of the loan; but it also says that the Secretary can then determine that if full repayment is not made or is unlikely to be made, that the only punishment or the only enforcement mechanism is the Secretary will then submit a report to the Congress explaining why repayment is not being made. It does not state in here, at least to my mind in the way I read it, that that State would be precluded from being able to attain another or further loan under the provisions of this bill. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to make that clarification. I think it strengthens Mr. Manzullo's amendment, which I fully support. And, again, I thank the gentleman for his indulgence.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, valid questions have been asked about this, and this bill could make West Virginians and other taxpayers across America liable for what the bill says itself, hundreds of billions of dollars in loans and subsidized insurance to State insurance companies that are displacing the private sector and charging inadequate rates. 
   It is unclear how much this bill will actually cost the taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office has said at least tens of millions of dollars if fully implemented, and it could have been higher by several magnitudes if they thought that States would actually use the provisions of the bill with any meaningful frequency. Now the manager's amendment has added up to 200 billion more dollars in taxpayer exposures that would not be repaid. There is no sunset on this bill, and this is a permanent liability for the taxpayers. The hard facts are that the bill itself recognizes that taxpayers could be asked to cough up enormous sums of taxpayer dollars. 
   Another consideration is the environment. The National Wildlife Foundation and the Florida Coalition for Preservation oppose this bill because they say it ``would result in continued encouragement of risky development in our Nation's coastal areas and floodplains. With more development in these environmentally sensitive areas, this bill could lead to more loss of life, property, and of wildlife habitat. The safety of our citizens should be the number one priority of any government program dealing with natural disasters.  
   The administration says that H.R. 3355 would ``displace the private market,'' ``clearly result in a subsidy for insurers, State insurance programs, and their policyholders,'' ``undermine economic incentives to mitigate risks,'' ``be fiscally irresponsible as the Federal Government could expect to face steep losses in certain years,'' and that ``financing these losses would require Federal taxpayers to subsidize insurance rates for the benefit of those living in high-risk areas. 
   Mr. Speaker, this amendment simply says, if we are going to put taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars in loans Treasury will be forced to give under this bill, then we should also make a commitment that homeowners who do not live on the coast will not have to pay for this subsidy in the form of increased insurance rates. One group of taxpayers should not be compelled to cover the inherent costs of risky, high-priced coastal development for developers. 
   Without this amendment, homeowners, who are taxpayers too, would be hit twice. First, they would essentially guarantee these loans in the event States default, and according to Treasury, ``it is more than likely that there will be significant pressures to forgive outstanding debt in the case of a huge catastrophe'' and that ``taxpayers nationwide subsidize insurance rates in high-risk areas, which would be both costly and unfair.'' 
   Second, the extension of these loans will implicitly subsidize high-risk areas at the expense of other homeowners. When a State repays these loans, it could assess a fee or tax on all homeowners in the State, including those who don't receive the benefit of this subsidy. Also, the State insurance companies that stand to gain from this bill squeeze out private insurers, meaning less competition for consumers, higher prices, and fewer choices.     
   On October 10, a Wall Street Journal editorial put it this way: Congress is volunteering ``middle-class taxpayers nationwide as the financial backstop for beachfront properties.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill does nothing to address the development and zoning that could be encouraged with these new programs. We can add mitigation and other requirements. The fact is, if the Federal Government is making something cheaper, you're probably going to buy more of it and do more of it. 
   Today, with this bill, we are giving a gift to coastal development and dysfunctional State agencies at the expense of Middle America. Homeowners all over the country have been hit hard lately; and for the millions of taxpayers who do not live in these areas, this bill would be another blow. My amendment simply ensures that we will be mindful of the vast majority of homeowners and taxpayers who, like West Virginians, do not stand to benefit from this bill at all. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2786 which would reauthorize the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act, NAHASDA. 
   This bill reflects a bipartisan effort led by Chairman Frank and Representative Waters. I would also like to thank Representative Kildee and Representative STEVE PEARCE in their efforts to reauthorize NAHASDA which is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. I'm confident that the legislation being considered today will go a long way to address the housing needs in Indian country. 
   This legislation being considered under suspension today is similar to H.R. 2786 which passed the House on  September 6 by a vote of 333 to 75. The major differences from the House bill passed include new compromise language on the Cherokee Freedman issue, removal of the reauthorization of the Native Hawaiian Housing program, and inclusion of the House-passed immigration language and House-passed GAO study. 
   Native Americans in this country are facing serious housing problems. Last year the Financial Services Committee held several hearings to investigate these problems, which are the result of widespread poverty, high unemployment, homelessness and lack of affordable housing on Native American land. The reauthorization of NAHASDA is an important step in addressing many of these issues. 
   Currently there are 562 federally recognized tribes in the United States representing approximately 2.5 million Native Americans. Of that 2.5 million, about 750,000 Native Americans live on reservations or in other tribal areas. According to Census data, the poverty rate for Native Americans is approximately 26 percent. Twenty-six percent is more than twice the average for all Americans. While 5.8 percent of the general population of the United States is unemployed, the current unemployment rate of the reservation workforce is 13.6 percent. In tribal areas, 14.7 percent of homes are overcrowded, compared to just 5.7 percent of homes in the general U.S. population. On Native American lands, 11.7 percent of residents lack complete plumbing facilities, and 6.9 percent lack, get this, telephone service. This, coupled with the price of a new home and the lack of existing housing, has created a dire situation on reservations in terms of availability and quality of housing units. 
   The legislation before us today would provide greater autonomy to Native Americans in using NAHASDA grant funds and would provide tribes more resources and flexibility to meet their affordable housing needs. This is good legislation that would help improve living conditions for Native Americans in this country. 
   I urge its passage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, rarely, and rightly it is rare, do we honor one of our own with the highest civilian honor we can bestow, the Congressional Gold Medal. But rules are made to be broken, and just as Ed Brooke broke an unwritten rule and became the first African American popularly elected to the Senate since Reconstruction, we should break another and honor his courage and achievements. 
   Just as it may be hard for college students of today to imagine segregated bathrooms and drinking fountains, it is hard for all of us to imagine a Congress without African Americans and others of color. So it is especially important to think back to the historic day when this humble man took the oath of office in the Senate 41 years ago on January 3, 1967. The America of that time, as my colleague has noted, was not far past the struggles that led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act, which this Chamber voted a couple of months ago to honor with a commemorative coin. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of us know the general outline of Ed Brooke's life: a soldier in the Second World War, a lawyer whose 1966 book ``The Challenge of Change'' focused on African Americans in the United States and on politics. I doubt that many Members know though that he was actually a native of the District of Columbia, as the gentlewoman noted. 
   Born here October 26, 1919, he was a graduate of both Harvard and Boston University and followed in his father's footsteps as a lawyer before being elected Massachusetts Attorney General and then on to the United States Senate, where he served two terms. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill was sponsored by our colleague in the Senate, Senator Ted Kennedy, also of Massachusetts, with 67 cosponsors, and he assured its passage before his unfortunate illness. We hope for him and his family the very best. Our prayers are with them. Here in the House a companion bill, H.R. 1000, was sponsored by our colleague Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton, and she has collected 290 cosponsors. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill honors a man, Senator Ed Brooke, but it also honors an idea and an achievement, that we are all equal, and that election to the United States Senate is open to any American who can prove to the voters that his or her ideas and character are appropriate and best represent their State, regardless of race, creed or religion. We should take this opportunity to celebrate that notion. 
   I urge immediate passage.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from New York (Mrs. Maloney) for her support of this bill, and I am very excited it is before the House today. 
   There is a very special bond that exists between mothers and their children that words cannot describe. For the lucky ones among us, a mother--our, someone else's, or a mother figure such as a grandmother--has made all of the difference in our lives. The tender care, unending support, and the unconditional love of a mother truly are life's greatest blessing for a child. 
   Every year on the second Sunday in May this Nation honors its mothers. We seek to acknowledge their tireless support and their enduring love. My colleague has spoken about how this tradition began, but I would like to go over it because it is a proud history of tradition for our State of West Virginia. 
   In 1868, Anna Reeves Jarvis organized a committee in her home town of Grafton, West Virginia, to sponsor a mother's friendship day. The purpose was to reunite families that had been divided during the Civil War. However, Anna Reeves Jarvis' dream of an annual memorial Mother's Day commemorating each mother for the service she renders to humanity had not gained wide-spread support during her lifetime. 
   However, her daughter, Anna M. Jarvis, took on her mother's cause. On May 9, 1907, the second anniversary of her mother's death, Anna invited friends to her home and outlined her plan to make her mother's dream of a nationwide day in honor of mothers a reality. 
   Within a year, working with Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church, progress was made and on Sunday, May 10, 1908, church services were held in which mothers were honored. They were held in Grafton, West Virginia, and in Philadelphia. 
   This initial celebration was only the beginning. Jarvis worked for years to popularize her idea. She wrote letters to churches and business leaders, to newspaper editors and to Members of Congress. She was even able to bring the drive for a Mother's Day observance to the attention of the President of the United States. 
   Her efforts were rewarded. In 1910, the governor of West Virginia, William Glassock, issued a Mother's Day proclamation. By the next year, Mother's Day services were held in all States of the Union. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson, responding to a joint resolution in Congress, issued a proclamation setting aside the second Sunday every May for ``displaying the American flag as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country.'' 
   Today, Mother's Day is celebrated throughout the world. In the United States, the President and governors issue proclamations recognizing mothers, churches perform services in honor of mothers everywhere, and the hearts of all are filled with all of our love for our mothers. 
   This bill would authorize the minting of silver $1 coins in honor of the women who have sacrificed so much for their children. It is a small token of our love and admiration, but one that will hopefully express the love we hold for our mothers. Surcharges of the sale of the coins, as my colleague mentioned, will go to the Susan G. Komen Foundation and the National Osteoporosis Foundation for research. 
   I chose both of these foundations because I have great admiration for the work they do for men and women, but particularly for women as we battle the difficult tragedies of breast cancer and the growing difficulties associated with osteoporosis which over 80 percent of the people it strikes are women. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this resolution, but I would like to take this opportunity to thank my mother. She has made a difference in my life. I appreciate her unconditional love and  support, her willingness to help me when I fell, and to push me forward when I could not find the strength myself. 
   I love you, Mom, and thanks. 
   With that, being from West Virginia, I would like to say, too, that our sense of community and family is very strong. We are so very proud of Anna Jarvis' vision, her idea and her dedication to celebrate her own mother, and we are proud to be known as the birthplace of Mother's Day. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.

   Today more than 90 million Americans are members of a credit union.

   I would like to recognize credit unions for the important role they play in many distressed urban and rural areas. Many constituents have told me that they would not have been able to afford their own homes, start new business or even attend college without the help of their credit unions. I am also impressed by credit unions' commitment to financial literacy, which has helped credit union members become better educated consumers of financial services.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1010, which recognizes the importance of manufactured housing in the United States. 
   Manufactured housing plays an important role in meeting this country's housing needs and is an important source of quality, affordable housing, including both homeownership and rental housing. In recent years, manufactured housing placements accounted for more than one-quarter of all new housing starts. 
   Despite the country's overall drop in home prices, the need for quality, affordable housing has never been greater. Because it is an important source of affordable housing, manufactured housing should be viewed as a critical part of the solution to the ongoing troubles in our housing market. 
   Today's manufactured homes can deliver quality dwellings and at prices ranging from 10 to 35 percent less per square foot than conventional site-built homes. These savings allow more and more Americans to own their own home or access affordable rental housing units. 
   The manufactured housing industry has evolved in the last decade to deliver a better quality, more affordable product. The affordability of manufactured housing is mainly attributable to the efficiency of the factory process. The controlled environment and assembly-line techniques remove many of the problems of the site-built sector, such as poor weather, theft, vandalism, and damage to building products and materials stored onsite. Also, factory employees are trained, scheduled, and managed by one employer as opposed to the system of contracted labor on a site-built sector. 
   As a Congress, we must do all we can do encourage affordable rental and homeownership opportunities for all Americans. Today's manufactured housing industry helps build communities and supports innovation, consumer safety, efficiency, and quality while preserving the affordability and customization of its housing units. 
   The legislation before us recognizes and fully supports the goals and ideals of Manufactured Housing Week, and I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (NATIONAL INFANTRY MUSEUM AND SOLDIER CENTER COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3229, the National Infantry Museum and Soldier Center Commemorative Coin Act sponsored by our colleague from Georgia, Representative Westmoreland, and urge its immediate passage. 
   This legislation, as we have heard, authorizes the minting and sale of up to 350,000 silver $1 coins in the year 2012, with surcharges on the sale of the coin going to fund work on the National Infantry Museum and Soldier Center being built in Patriot Park at Fort Benning near Columbus, Georgia.  
   The new National Infantry Museum will honor the legacy of the United States infantry on a 200-acre site that links Columbus, Georgia, with Fort Benning, the home of the infantry. The museum's galleries will trace infantry history from colonial times to the present and be designed to attract and educate all segments of the population with interactive learning, opportunities, high-tech classrooms, theatres and dramatic venues for sacred ceremonies. 
   An active education program will make the venue a must-see attraction for school groups and students of all ages. The focus of the educational effort will be to teach history, as the history of the United States Army Infantry parallels the history and growth of our country. Additional instruction will focus on leadership skills and the Army values of loyalty, duty, selfless service, respect, honor, integrity and personal courage. Research done by an internationally known museum planning firm estimates annual visitation of up to 400,000, which will make it one of Georgia's top tourist attractions. 
   In addition to the museum, there will be a 7-acre parade field for infantry and basic training graduations and change-of-command ceremonies. A Walk of Honor flanked by gardens and memorials will lead visitors to the museum and a recreated World War II-era Company Street, featuring the headquarters and sleeping quarters used by General George S. Patton in 1941 will take visitors back to the scenes of our country's largest wartime buildup. The facility will include a 3-D IMAX theater restaurant and museum store. 
   Visitors to this museum that is scheduled to open in just over a year will meet the infantryman face-to-face and join him on his journey. They will come to understand why an infantryman does what he does, why he puts himself in harm's way in defense of an idea. Surcharges on the sale of these coins will raise funds for a long-term endowment to ensure the maintenance of this important facility. 
   The infantryman is historic, and it is a heroic idea to build this museum to the infantry. I urge passage of this legislation, commend my colleague for offering it, and reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPITO. (TO AWARD POSTHUMOUSLY A CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO CONSTANTINO BRUMIDI -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 254, a bill to award a Congressional Gold Medal honoring the great artistic work of Constantino Brumidi on this great Capitol building. The bill was introduced by Senator Enzi and has 99 cosponsors in the Senate, and in the House, a companion bill was introduced by our colleague, Mr. Pascrell, which has 307 cosponsors. 
   As we've heard much of Mr. Brumidi's history, he created artworks in the House of Representatives Chamber, many committee rooms, the President's Room, the Senate Chamber, and throughout the corridors of the Capitol. His most famous work within these halls is ``The Apotheosis of George Washington,'' which appears on the Capitol dome in the Rotunda. Mr. Brumidi painted these hallowed halls, and in so doing, he depicted the narrative that is the vivid history of these United States. 
   Born in Italy in 1805, Constantino Brumidi studied at the Italian Academy of the Arts. In 1852, at the age of 47, he emigrated to America and devoted the rest of his years completing frescoes, sculptures, and paintings in the Capitol Building. 
   The story of Constantino Brumidi is important not only because he was the artist who gave life to these walls, but because his story is the American story. He was an immigrant to this country, and he used the skill that he had to contribute what he could. In the process, he, like millions of others, built this country into what it is today. Immigrants built this Nation's building, constructed its factories, fed its people, and when called upon, defended its sovereignty. Men and women from this great Nation's inception contributed whatever they could to make this Nation better. 
   Constantino Brumidi contributed his talents as an artist. And now, because of his efforts, we and all who walk through the Capitol may see not only his talent but this country's history and be filled with the same sense of awe and hope that filled those who walked these halls before us. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a wonderful gift. 
   On February 19, 1880, at the age of 74, Constantino Brumidi died four-and-a-half months after falling from a scaffolding while working on the Rotunda frieze that chronicles the history of America. He spent his entire time in this country contributing and attempting to fulfill his life's goal. He said, ``My one ambition and my daily prayer is that I may live long enough to make beautiful the Capitol of the one country on Earth in which there is liberty.'' 
   As we stand here today and walk these halls, it is clear to all that Constantino Brumidi accomplished his goal. 
   This bill awards Constantino Brumidi the Congressional Gold Medal for his contribution. The medal will be displayed in the Capitol Visitor's Center as part of a display honoring his work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge the bill's immediate passage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. CAPITO. (HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CAPITO. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Today's HOPE VI program is the direct result of the 1992 report submitted to Congress by the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing that said approximately 6 percent of the 1.4 million existing public housing apartments were severely distressed and recommended that they be removed from the housing stock. 
   Since Congress began appropriating funds for HOPE VI in 1992, the program has been revitalizing and replacing some of the most dangerous and dilapidated public housing units in the country with mixed-income communities. These grants play a vital role in a community's redevelopment and have changed the physical characteristics of public housing from high-rise tenements to attractive, marketable units that blend in with the surrounding neighborhood and help residents attain self-sufficiency.  
   While the goals of the program are to be commended, and HOPE VI projects remain popular with many Members of Congress, it is not without faults. The HOPE VI program has been criticized by the administration, which argues that grantees spend their money too slowly, and by tenant advocates, who claim the program displaces more families than it houses in new developments. Also, there are those who argue that HOPE VI is not an efficient method for meeting the current and future capital needs of public housing programs. 
   The bill we are considering today, H.R. 3524, makes several significant changes to the underlying program. I want to commend Chairman Frank, Chairwoman Waters, and Congressman Shays for their bipartisan work on this bill. I know that Congressman Shays has worked hard to address some of the concerns raised by HUD and by those on this side of the aisle regarding the bill. Certainly, the manager's amendment moves in the right direction. However, there are still several areas of disagreement on this legislation, such as the elimination of demolition-only grants, implementing one-for-one replacement requirements, and mandating HOPE VI developers comply with the Green Communities Green Building Rating System. 
   The HOPE VI program has been a program that has worked. Through public-private partnerships, we have changed the physical shape of public housing by establishing positive incentives for resident self-sufficiency and comprehensive services that empower residents. We must take care not to make this program so prescriptive that developers and nonprofits find the program too difficult in which to participate. 
   Several years ago, I spoke at the opening ceremonies at Orchard Manor in Charleston, West Virginia. Orchard Manor is now a beautiful complex of townhouses, duplexes and apartments that began its transformation from a rundown public housing project with the removal of 230 out of the existing 360 units under a HUD HOPE VI demolition-only grant. Following the initial demolition, additional units were constructed using replacement housing funds until the complex reached its present state. Orchard Manor is a shining example of the importance and significance of using demolition-only grants as part of HOPE VI. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) has an amendment that will reinstate HUD's ability to fund demolition-only grants, and I urge its adoption so future successful projects, such as Orchard Manor, can receive that funding. 
   Finally, I plan to offer an amendment that I believe is a commonsense approach to green building requirements outlined in this legislation. I am concerned that Congress is attempting to mandate this program. Building green is a good thing. Mandating how to do it by a private building standard, I believe there are other ways to do it, which is essentially the heart of my amendment. 
   Specifically, the green building requirements in the bill could lead to fewer affordable housing units being built. My amendment still requires minimum green building standards, but it directs the Secretary to select an appropriate green building rating system standard or code that addresses environmental soundness but leaves that flexibility for the Secretary to determine other criteria as appropriate. 
   We are currently experiencing rapid development in our definition of what constitutes a legitimate ``green building standard'' through the competition of differing ideas. This competition is a healthy one, and we should not cut short through a hasty endorsement of one of the competing proprietary standards as our definition. 
   In closing, the HOPE VI program is not a cure-all for the rehabilitation and capital improvement needs of public housing units. However, this House has the opportunity with this bill, through several amendments, to further develop a program that rehabilitates our public housing into affordable, mixed-income communities. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. CAPITO. I would like to respond just a little bit to the gentleman's comments on the amendment I'm going to put forward. I don't want the misunderstanding of the Members to think that my amendment would remove green building from any of the HOPE VI projects. It's a different philosophy in how we're putting forth the idea to meet green standards. And he clarified that. His is a mandatory. Mine is a flexible, one among many. But I do believe in the philosophy of building more green and more efficient buildings, we've got new technology coming online. Why tie ourselves to a certain standard?

   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Chairman, I would like to thank all the speakers for discussing what I think is a good program, HOPE VI. On this side of the aisle, even though the chairmen of the full committee and subcommittee have made great strides in terms of the manager's amendment in terms of answering some of our concerns, but we still have some concerns. And you are going to hear this through the amendment process, whether it's one-on-one replacement, demolition only, and my amendment on the green communities. 
   So I appreciate HOPE VI's successes. I think we have heard from a lot of Members who have had individual successes in their own districts. I reiterate the success in my district was from a demolition-only grant, and I've seen how the community can benefit and the housing conditions can improve and the quality of life improve at the same time.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank the chairman and the chairwoman of the subcommittee, Ms. Waters, for reaching across the aisle and working on some of the very serious concerns that we had about the original bill. 
   I would like to speak specifically about one area, the one-for-one replacement. We have heard a lot of discussion about that on the floor in the beginning arguments. But in this manager's amendment, there is much more flexibility in the one-for-one replacement. It also allows the Secretary to have some flexibility, and I think that means we will have more meaningful housing, housing with more vision on how to improve family and home life. 
   Another thing is the development timeline. In the original bill, the development timeline was 12 months. I can't imagine myself trying to build large projects such as these and have everything in 12 months. So that deadline was extended to 54 months, which I think was a very good move. 
   Also on the green building requirements, I have an amendment coming forward to ask for flexibility again in the green building requirements. But in the manager's amendment, some revisions were made, and I think it's moving us a step in the right direction. 
   I myself support the manager's amendment. I think that a lot of the changes that were made were made in response to what we were hearing in our various offices from not only individuals but various groups their concern for the best way to put forward affordable housing, HOPE VI, and make sure that what we build stands up to the challenges of the future. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment to the HOPE VI bill, and I would like to talk about first of all what this amendment does not do because my fear is the argument on the other side is going to distort what I really think the core of the discussion between my amendment and those opposed should be. 
   This amendment in no way is an advocate for destroying or throwing out the window environmental or green building standards. That is not my goal or my intention with this amendment. It retains requirements for green building standards, but it looks at how we build green in a different way. 
   In the bill presently, there is a mandatory building standard that has been a criteria that has been developed by a proprietary preference for one organization. My amendment would simply move this out of a mandated into the green communities specifically mandated criteria, and move it into a more flexible situation where the Secretary would then choose an appropriate green building standard, green building rating system and code that would address environmental considerations, and leaves flexibility for the Secretary, this Secretary and secretaries to follow, to be able to determine that criteria. 
   We are going to be building these HOPE VI projects all across this Nation, and I think it is important to note that there should be some geographic considerations for green building standards across the country. 
   We are also trying to find the best way to use our Federal dollars, to maximize the number of Federal housing units, while still adhering to good environmental standards. 
   I have listened a lot over the last 60 years to housing projects that have been made, destroyed and rebuilt and why some of them haven't lasted as long as they should. I think by putting this amendment forward, I think I am taking into consideration that what we know today to be a good green building standard and to be in the best interest of an environment or a community or a quality of life in 3 years may be outdated. The technology may not be in front of us now that says if you look at your water this way or your air this way or your environmental considerations for the landscaping, that there is going to be a better way in 3 years. 
   In this bill, I think we are locking down a certain proprietarily developed standard for green building. I think in selecting appropriate green building criteria, this gives HUD the ability to choose a green building system, a standard or code, in an open, consensus-based way. That is why I put forward this amendment to give HUD the flexibility not only for today but for the future. 
   Again, I want to reiterate what this amendment does not do. It does not have a goal in mind of undercutting green building in an environmentally stable way to create new HOPE VI projects. Also in this amendment, it also requires the Secretary to conduct a review once every 5 years to determine if the chosen system and standard or code is still relevant, and I think that is appropriate in terms of innovation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   And when the gentleman just briefly says that the LEED standards were removed from the commercial building, yes, they were removed. Why? Because the union of carpenters that we heard about earlier were raising Cain because they were going to have to get their wood from imported wood to be able to meet these standards. That goes right to my point. We need to be reasonable, but we also need to make sure that we protect our environment and move forward with the best communities we can.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support for the reauthorization of the Water Resources Development Act. I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, Subcommittee Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Baker for their hard work in getting this legislation to the floor. 
   It has been too long since the water resources bill has become law, and it is important that we continue to move this and make this reauthorization a reality. Projects authorized in this bill are critical to our national waterways transportation system that businesses and industry in every State and congressional district rely on to move their products.  
   In my State of West Virginia, a well-maintained system of navigable waterways is crucial to moving coal from our mines to plants across the country to power this Nation's economy. The bill addresses local needs. I am pleased that this legislation recognizes the important water and wastewater challenges in West Virginia by continuing the authorization for the Central West Virginia Environmental Infrastructure Program.     
   This program has provided access to clean water and wastewater treatment to many rural West Virginians who otherwise would be without these critical utilities. I am pleased that this Corps of Engineers program will be able to continue assisting local public service districts to address these important community needs. 
   I want to thank the committee for their hard work. I look forward to the final passage and the President's signature on this bill.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Concurrent Resolution 124 authorizes the use of the Capitol grounds for the annual National Peace Officers' Memorial Service to be held Tuesday May 17, 2007. The Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary annually sponsor this event honoring some of America's bravest men and women. 
   Since the first recorded police death in 1792, there have been more than 17,900 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. The memorial service will honor the 145 Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who made the ultimate sacrifice while protecting their communities in 2006, as well as all law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty. 
   This will be the 26th time that this event has been held on the grounds of the Capitol. This memorial service is part of National Police Week, which was created by law in 1962 and runs this year from May 8 through May 15. 
   Police Week draws officers, their families and survivors of fallen officers from around the country and includes such events as the Blue Mass at St. Patrick's Catholic Church, the candlelight vigil at the National Law Enforcement Memorial, and a police unity tour featuring officers and historic vehicles. 
   The memorial service begins at noon on Tuesday. Following the ceremony on the Capitol Hill grounds, there will be a procession to the Law Enforcement Memorial and a wreath-laying ceremony. 
   I encourage my colleagues to attend this much deserved memorial service and honor those who protect our communities on the front lines. 
   I support the measure and encourage my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Speaker, I rise today because gas prices at the pump are just a symptom of our growing addiction to foreign oil and inaction by this House leadership. 
   For our wallets and for our national security, we need to become more energy independent. Congress should start now to develop more of our domestic energy supply. And one of those more affordable and abundant supplies of energy we have now is coal. With over 250 years of reserves, the United States has the world's largest coal reserves. 
   Last night I introduced H.R. 6170, the Clean Coal-Derived Fuels for Energy Security Act, to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. My bill is clear: It will establish and mandate 6 billion gallons of clean coal-to-liquid fuel by the year 2022. Coal can be converted through proven, existing modern technology into clean, synthetic oil and be economically viable, resulting in lower prices at the gas pump. 
   We need to be serious about becoming more energy independent. West Virginians deserve a comprehensive long-term solution that provides real stability and actually leads to the creation of new energy. Coal-to-liquid fuel will create an investment in rural communities, good-paying jobs for Americans, and cheaper energy for Americans.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to fully support SAFE TEA-LU funding at its authorized level for fiscal year 2007. 
   If, as expected, the House passes a joint resolution extending funding for government programs through October 1, it is important that we allow the highway funds to increase from the 2006 level to the authorized 2007 level. 
   Federal highway funding is very important to all States, and my State of West Virginia is no exception. Significant progress is being made on construction of a new four-lane U.S. 35 and on Corridor H, and transportation improvements are needed across everyone's district. 
   Keeping highway funding steady at the 2006 level would stop a scheduled $3.4 billion increase that State highway departments, workers and motorists have planned on and expected for this year. 
   The President's fiscal year 2007 budget, the House-passed transportation appropriation bill and the Senate appropriation bill called for $39.1 billion for highway construction. Failing to allow an increase would cost West Virginia $57.7 million, and 2,740 construction jobs.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for recognizing me. 
   Today, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4. When I first ran for Congress, this was one of the largest issues, prescription drug plans, for seniors. Sixty percent of the senior women in America are on Medicare right now, and they have available to them a prescription drug plan that they have never had in the past. Congress delivered this plan, and people in my district are pleased. Over 80 percent of the seniors on part D are pleased with this plan, and 91 percent of West Virginia seniors are now participating. 
   The prescription drug plan is one of the rare government programs that is actually costing less than anticipated, both for the government and for the seniors. One reason is that seniors have access to the drugs and pharmacy of their choice. Yet, today, my colleagues on the other side appear to be willing to sacrifice that access to their drugs and their pharmacies. 
   Yesterday, the Director of the West Virginia Chapter of the American Diabetes Association wrote and asked that I personally oppose this legislation because of its potential to decrease access to important medications for such diseases as diabetes, one of the most deadly and far-reaching diseases in this country. 
   I oppose this. I think it will result in higher prices for our seniors.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPITO. I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today realizing the seriousness of this resolution and the importance of the debate on the war in Iraq. 
   As we continue this debate, I hope that all of us remember we have serious disagreements about what this resolution says or intends to do, but that we cannot and should not besmirch one another's opinions and the right to that opinion and belief. 
   I would also like to say how proud I am to be an American, to realize the bounty of our Nation, to appreciate the strength of our forefathers, and to stand in awe of our democracy. 
   As the daughter of a World War II Purple Heart veteran, I have a great understanding of the sacrifices that have been made in the past to allow us to live freely. I understand and fullly appreciate the men and women who have so bravely put themselves on the frontline to protect our country. 
   I have thought a great deal about what I want to say today and how I want to say it. When the President announced his plan for a troop surge last month, I expressed my disagreement. And as we debate this resolution today, I still harbor those grave concerns. While I have voiced a disagreement over tactics on how to achieve success in Iraq, the fact remains that I have not backed away from my belief that success in Iraq is vital, and that leaving Iraq prematurely would be disastrous for our Nation's security and the stability of the Middle East. 
   And let me stress that I will never back away from my commitment to the men and women who serve in our military, and I will not support anything that I believe endangers their safety while they serve in harm's way to protect our country. 
   So I rise today in opposition to this resolution. My opposition lies not in what this resolution says, but what it intends to do; and that is, to lay the foundation to begin cutting funding for our troops as they fight the radical jihadists who want to destroy our Nation. My fear is not based on wild assumptions or partisan politics, but what leaders are already saying they are planning to do. 
   The passage of this resolution has been called a baseline. And the Speaker of the House has called it a first step. And then she added that approval of this resolution will set the stage for additional Iraq legislation which is set to come before the House.     
   Leaders have been tight lipped about the pending legislation. But we have learned that what they want to do is set the stage for legislation that will fence off and limit funding by tying the hands of our commanders on the ground, by presenting benchmarks that will be written so that certainly those funds cannot be spent. To be sure, such actions would restrict funds and tie the hands of our commanders in Iraq. I cannot and will not support any effort to systematically disassemble our greater effort, to defend our liberties and our way of life, and to provide our enemies with a breath of hope that we have lost our will. 
   Let me be very clear to my constituents and the men and women in uniform. I will never vote to cut funding for our troops, nor will I allow my vote on a symbolic resolution, one that has the force of politics and not the force of law, to be used as a baseline or a first step towards cutting funding for our troops. 
   I will assertively maintain my support for the troops in my words and my vote, and I will continue to analyze how I can best help achieve success in Iraq so that we may begin to bring our men and women home. 
   In that spirit I plan to vote against this resolution.

   Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Speaker, I encourage our discussion on flood insurance. But like my colleagues, I am very frustrated with the high price of gasoline. And I believe that West Virginians deserve a comprehensive all-of-the-above approach. 
   I had a lot of conversations just last night with West Virginians, and they had wonderful, creative solutions. They had amazing ideas: Let's use algae, let's use cooking oil, let's use biomass; and, of course from West Virginia, let's use coal. 
   We also had a gentleman who offered a great national call for conservation, that we would incorporate our youth  through education and other methods to get involved with how we can conserve. But the most thing I heard was the question of frustration, and why are we not doing anything? 
   Unfortunately, this House has yet to act on any legislation that will actually make a difference. And it is time for a change. It is time for this Congress to get serious about protecting consumers and taking action on real solutions. 
   West Virginians are less concerned, as the previous speaker said, about the political battles that are encompassing Capitol Hill. We are more concerned about a bipartisan breakthrough that actually increases supply and makes our Nation more self-reliant.
