<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (OUR DOMESTIC AUTO INDUSTRY -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, there has been a great deal of talk over the years that the Big 3 domestic auto companies have been too generous in providing pay and benefits to their workers which has made them less competitive. 
   I think it is wrong that these companies that helped, literally helped, create the American middle class have been attacked in such a way, but detractors of our domestic auto industry fail to understand that blatant cheating by foreign competitors and foreign governments on such matters as currency manipulation and piracy of intellectual property distort the marketplace and give foreign companies a competitive advantage. Detractors now want to expand the attack on our domestic auto industry by imposing draconian fuel economy standards that will benefit foreign companies and cost American jobs. 
   Enough is enough. The American auto companies and the UAW are poised to revolutionize the way health care and other benefits are delivered to autoworkers, retirees, and their family members; and, at the same time, the companies and their incredible scientists are working on new technologies for the vehicles of the future that will significantly reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Now is not the time for increased government regulation that will simply kill American jobs.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (AUTO INDUSTRY MOVING TOWARD A BRIGHTER FUTURE -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, the recent contract negotiated by General Motors and the United Auto Workers was really a historic watershed for the domestic auto industry. 
   By tackling the very tough issues of pension reform and job security and, most importantly, health care reform, the industry is now poised to compete and win against foreign competitors. 
   The domestic auto industry has momentum in moving toward a brighter future, a future that will include high-tech alternative fuel vehicles that will help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
   I had the opportunity actually last week to check out one of these vehicles. This was the Ford Edge powered by a lithium ion battery. This is a vehicle that uses no gas and its only emission is actually water. 
   That is the future if we join the cause. This Congress needs to partner with the domestic auto industry and the UAW to ensure that we produce those automobiles right here in America. 
   What we should not do is enact draconian fuel economy standards that will stifle innovation, assist our foreign competitors and kill American jobs. Both management and labor are doing their jobs to strengthen the industry. Now is the time for Congress to step up and do ours. Focus on the future, focus on technology, and focus on American jobs.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding his time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in very strong, strong support of this resolution. 
   You know, it has been said that no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy, and I believe that that is true. That's why our military must constantly plan for every eventuality in warfare, because failure to do so can cost lives. 
   The situation in Iraq is no different. We must prepare for every contingency. The day is coming when our brave men and women in uniform will leave Iraq, hopefully very, very soon. In fact, General Petraeus in his testimony last month spoke of the possibility that some of our troops will leave Iraq very soon, perhaps within weeks. 
   In order to facilitate a very safe and orderly withdrawal, it is important that our military leaders plan appropriately, and they must also consult with the Congress so that we can provide the needed support to ensure that our troops are safe and that our vital national interests are protected. 
   Prudent planning leads to success and provides the ability to react quickly to events on the ground. I believe that this resolution encourages such prudent planning. That's why I supported it when it came before the House Armed Services Committee, when it was debated then, and why I would urge the entire House to support it today. As was just mentioned by the chairman, it was a bipartisan vote and it passed 55-2. 
   The issue of our troop presence in Iraq has caused great debate across our country, has polarized this Congress, and I believe that this resolution is a demonstration that a bipartisan way forward can be achieved, that it can happen. In fact, it must happen for our Nation to move forward. 
   I certainly want to express my appreciation to the sponsors of this bill. I want to express my appreciation and deep regard and respect for the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mr. Skelton, as well as our ranking member, Duncan Hunter, great American patriots, all of them. 
   Let us hope that the day is coming soon when our troops will come home with honor, with honor, our brave men and women who so proudly and bravely have protected and exported liberty and freedom, democracy.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, our entire Nation honors the brave men and women in our armed services who have sacrificed so greatly in the effort to bring freedom and liberty to the people of Iraq, and we also recognize the sacrifice of the American taxpayers, who have shouldered the financial burden of this effort to protect America. 
   It is now time for Iraq to stand up and shoulder the burden of protecting their own freedoms, and it is long past time for Iraq to start paying its own way. With the cost of oil, and the money that Iraq is making on their oil, they need to be paying, at a minimum, entirely for their own reconstruction. 
   As we continue to transition from American forces to Iraqi security forces, we also need to quickly transition from the American taxpayer footing the entire bill to the now free country of Iraq paying to protect their own freedom and rebuilding their own country. 
   Americans understand that freedom is not free, and the Iraqi people need to understand that securing their own freedom will require their own investment.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5749, EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I certainly appreciate the gentleman yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise to support the rule, but I strongly support the underlying bill.  
   We are back here again today because this House, in my estimation, must act to give those who are struggling in our challenging economy the help that they need. Too many working families in my district, in my home State of Michigan are having serious difficulties finding work and making ends meet. 
   Not only have too many workers lost their jobs, but other factors have stymied their efforts to find work. Gas prices of over $4 a gallon are making it increasingly difficult to travel longer differences to find work. The housing crisis, which is particularly acute in my home State of Michigan, has made it nearly impossible for families to sell their homes, which would allow them to move closer to areas where jobs could perhaps be found. 
   Some have argued that this bill would alter very long-standing Federal policy as a reason to vote against it and perhaps it does, but that is no comfort to those who cannot find work. They are not interested in Federal policy changes, they are interested in keeping their homes or feeding their families or having money to buy gas so that they can go out and find a job. I understand some of the concerns about granting this extension of benefits, but I believe strongly that those concerns are far outweighed by the needs of struggling American families. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join together and to take this important step to provide a helping hand to fellow Americans in need. 
   Again, I oppose this rule, but I strongly support the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. 
   There certainly is no question that the American economy is struggling, and that is certainly true for my home State of Michigan. Michigan working families have been hit very, very hard by the restructuring, the economic transition that's happening in the domestic auto industry which has cost thousands of jobs and closing of factories. 
   A collapse in the housing market and skyrocketing gas prices have restricted mobility, making it much more difficult for people to find work. 
   And some would argue against this bill by saying that it's an impediment  to urging people to actually find work. I would say that argument is nonsense. People cannot find work if they can't even sell their house. People cannot travel long distances to find a job if they can't afford $4 per gallon for gasoline. People cannot find a job if there are no jobs to be found. 
   This legislation will provide all unemployed workers 13 extra weeks of benefits as a bridge to better times, and it will give workers in hard-hit areas, like my home State of Michigan, an additional 13 weeks beyond that. 
   I believe that this is a very appropriate and compassionate action for this Congress to take, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I certainly appreciate the gentleman yielding time to me. 
   Madam Speaker, I am opposed to the rule, but I do wholeheartedly support the underlying bill. 
   As my colleague said, my dad was an aeronautical engineer and actually worked for the Chrysler missile plant that was down at Redstone with Wernher von Braun and was one of the original rocket scientists. So I certainly have always marveled at everything that NASA has done. 
   I do support this bill, H.R. 6063, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008. I think a strong and a vital space program is absolutely crucial to ensuring America's place at the forefront of technological advancement. Most people today take for granted so many of the incredible contributions that our space program had made toward improving the quality of our every day lives. 
   Many of them have been articulated today, but we certainly recognize GPS, global positioning systems, and weather forecasting and advanced medicine, cell phones or BlackBerries, satellite TV and even microwave ovens. They all exist today in large measure due to America's space program. 
   From Mercury, to Gemini, to Apollo, to the Skylab, to the space shuttle, to the International Space Station, NASA has led the way in sending Americans from the earth to the moon and our technology to heights unimagined, I think, by previous generations. 
   We currently are on the edge of a very exciting new scientific breakthrough as NASA begins to shift, really, to the technologically advanced Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and to the new Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle, which could eventually lead to a manned mission to Mars. 
   And I recognize that while some might debate the cost of the space program, or they might argue that money can be better spent elsewhere, I would also respond with the fact that those same arguments were presented more than a generation ago. Where would we be today if in the 1960s America had not answered President Kennedy's call to reach for the stars? 
   In fact, I would bet that Columbus may have had some debate with the Queen of Spain that the Spanish Treasury needed to finance his exploration of the New World when everybody was absolutely convinced that the world was, in fact, flat. 
   So who knows what discoveries or advances to the world that we might miss if we do not continue to challenge the scientific and creative imaginations of the entire world? I absolutely believe that it is in the best interest of this Nation to continue our commitment to space exploration, and I wholeheartedly support this bill. 
   Again, I do oppose the rule. I am distressed that it has been brought to the floor like this, but I certainly would urge all of my colleagues to support the underlying legislation and to continue to reach for the stars.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (NATIONAL SILVER ALERT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Silver Alert Act. 
   As a society we are judged by how we care for our most vulnerable in our community--our young children and our senior citizens. 
   This legislation, the National Silver Alert Act, is replicating an issue we have had remarkable success with--the Amber Alert for missing children. The Amber Alert for missing children has allowed 420 children to return safely to their homes. 
   It is time we replicate this success for our seniors. 
   Sixty percent of people with Alzheimer's or dementia will wander away at some point, and half of those who aren't found in the first 24 hours will be injured or die. This statistic is all too real for those across the Nation who have experienced the fear of losing a loved one first hand. 
   I know full well about this--last year an elderly man near Green Bay, Wisconsin, got in his car for what was supposed to be a short trip to the convenience store. Nearly 8 hours and 490 miles later, he stopped at a local grocery store in my district, disoriented, and confused. Luckily a Macomb county sheriff located this man's son in Wisconsin and the man returned home safely. 
   However, for a few frantic hours, his family in Wisconsin had no idea if he was lost, in an accident, or worse. 
   Just imagine if this system was in place last year. Maybe a motorist or a police officer would have seen this man's car driving along the expressway and got him assistance before he made it all the way to Michigan. 
   Situations like these happen across America--and it is important that we fund programs like the National Silver Alert act to properly locate our seniors who have gone missing. 
   By creating a national communications network to assist in efforts to locate missing senior citizens, we are improving the likelihood that they remain free of harm. 
   As a cosponsor of the National Silver Alert Act, I ask my colleagues to join me in protecting our senior citizens and implementing this very important program.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (THE BIG THREE: MODEL CORPORATE CITIZENS -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle are often quick to criticize corporate America for everything from outsourcing jobs to poor health care and retirement benefits for their workers. However, we have some very responsible corporate citizens that we call the Big Three. And over the last century, the Big Three have been the leaders in providing health care benefits and retirement benefits as well for their workers. These efforts were actually crucial in building up the American middle class. GM, for example, spent $3.3 billion last year on health  benefits for their 432,000 retirees. In comparison, non-U.S. auto manufacturers spent roughly just $23 million for their 1,200 American workers and American retirees. 
   And one would think that after decades of commitment the Big Three have shown to the American worker that that would earn them the admiration and the sympathy of the Democratic leadership. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case. The Democratic leadership that should be holding up the domestic auto industry as models of corporate responsibility are instead trying to ram through increased CAFE standards that will put U.S. auto workers in the unemployment line and likely bankrupt U.S auto companies. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject these policies which will help our foreign competitors, and instead stand up for American jobs.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I was appalled last week by the words of the Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid asking Senators to vote for a job-killing fuel economy standards bill for cars by asking them to, ``speak for the American people, not for the three car companies that are closing plants and laying off people.'' 
   Well, the last time I looked, the over 1 million people who work directly for the big three are actually American citizens, and millions of others whose jobs are supported by the big three are Americans as well, the last time I looked. Everyone knows that the biggest producer of CO  
   2 emissions is electricity production, and yet I didn't hear the Senate majority leader volunteer to make the blazing neon blazing casinos in his home State of Nevada more energy efficient. How about we regulate their energy consumption?
   Let's hope that the Democratic leaders in this House understand that millions of American workers and their jobs are worth protecting and don't follow the Senate's lead in their attempt to destroy them.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (RECOGNIZING THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to fully support this resolution, which speaks to this Congress, appropriately recognizing and honoring the brave Americans, the great patriots, who work to protect us all through their service at the Department of Homeland Security. 
   And I believe that the first and foremost responsibility of the Federal Government is to provide for the national defense. That is actually in the preamble of our Constitution. Additionally, for all of us who have the honor to serve in this House, protecting our homeland and securing our borders against those who would harm us is something that we all take an oath to do. 
   Before those horrific attacks on our Nation on 9/11, we thought about national defense more in terms of having a strong military, the best trained, the best resourced, facing down enemies overseas in conflicts where we had a national interest in spots around the world. We didn't usually think in terms of actually being attacked or continuing to be threatened with attacks on American soil here in our homeland.     
   9/11 changed all of our lives, as on that day cowardly terrorists murdered nearly 3,000 of our fellow Americans, innocent people who were just going about their daily lives. And the terrorists used the tools of our own freedoms against us. And why? Because they hate us, and they especially hate our freedoms. 
   They sought to weaken us, to destroy us, and instead they united us. They awoke us, and instead, made us begin to take the necessary steps to protect ourselves from future attacks. 
   We knew we had to change the way we practiced security measures at our airports, on our railways, on our roadways, at our ports, and at our border crossings. We knew we had to secure our infrastructure, that we had to better prepare our first responders and local emergency management agencies, that we had to share intelligence, that we had to tear down silo mentalities and do a much better job of sharing intelligence and resources. 
   And we also knew we had to create an agency here at the Federal level and task them with implementing this seemingly impossible job. And so the Department of Homeland Security was created 5 years ago, and what a remarkable success story it has been. 
   The brave men and women of the 22 agencies, more than 213,000 individuals that make up the department, deserve our respect, and they deserve our gratitude. We have not had another successful attack on our shores since that day, in no small part due to the vigilance and the hard work of the Department of Homeland Security and their efforts to provide for our common defense against America's enemies, against the enemies of freedom, those who are truly cowards, those who hide in the shadows and who prey on the innocent. 
   Mr. Speaker, as Congress recognizes and pays tribute to the Department of Homeland Security for the dedication and the commitment they have made to our homeland security during the past 5 years that they have been in existence, we also look forward to standing shoulder to shoulder with them as we look towards the future. 
   We understand that we need to do more to clearly define the lines of congressional committee jurisdiction, to streamline, to make more effective and cost efficient many of the department's missions. We recognize that the largest room is always the room for improvement, and that the department is looking to Congress to continue to assist them and not to hobble them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am a new member of the Committee on Homeland Security, and I am proud to represent my district in Michigan, a border State with many unique dynamics, such as the first and second busiest international border crossings on the northern tier and the busiest rail entry in the country, the magnificent Great Lakes, fully one-fifth of the freshwater supply of the entire planet, a long liquid border that we share with our wonderful neighbors, the Canadians. 
   These are issues and items that require the attention of the Department of Homeland Security, and yet, Mr. Speaker, every Member, every Member of this House, could tell us of particular dynamics in their district, or their State, or their region of the country that also require the attention of the department. 
   Identifying and dealing with the threats to our homeland are done each and every day, 24/7, by the remarkable men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. And it is certainly appropriate that we honor those who serve us so well, that we thank them for their vigilance, we salute them for their dedication, we appreciate their commitment to democracy and liberty and freedom. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass the resolution before us and formally thank the great Americans who make up the Department of Homeland Security for keeping our Nation safe. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, hopefully in the very near future Congress will be ready to vote on a new farm bill, one that would help our farmers and our agricultural community continue to do what they do so very well, feed America and help feed the entire world. 
   We recognize and we encourage the very hard work and the ongoing negotiations between the House, the Senate and the administration as we face the expiration of the current farm bill on April 18. But planting season is here, and our farmers are faced with difficult decisions about what crops to plant and how much without knowing what direction the Federal Government is moving, and yet we look to our farmers to provide us with a stable food supply. There are many issues affecting the development of every farmer's business plan this year and into the next, certainly the rising prices of fuel and other costs as well, but the uncertainty of the national farm program needs to be resolved as quickly as possible. 
   I look forward to working together with our House and our Senate leaders and the administration on a successful piece of legislation that will serve our farmers and all Americans fairly and well.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I certainly rise in very strong support of this resolution to honor and to celebrate America's firefighters. 
   Wherever and whatever the danger, every American knows that America's firefighters are just moments away from coming to their rescue, putting their lives on the line to save and protect others in their communities. And no one will ever forget the very vivid example of the bravery of our firefighters that was exhibited on September 11, 2001. 
   On that horrific day, as thousands were fleeing for their lives and running from buildings, we witnessed firefighters actually running towards the danger. As others were running away from the danger, which is a natural human instinct, the firefighters and first responders were running towards the danger and running into these buildings. And they did this knowing that many would most likely not come out. But these brave men and women are professionals who understood that it was their duty to protect their fellow citizens, and they did so. Their  brave actions on that day no doubt saved countless lives, and through those actions they earned the gratitude of those who were saved and the respect of the entire world. 
   Throughout this country, firefighters perform similar acts of heroism every day. And although we can never properly repay them for their dedicated service to our communities, we should take action to honor them for their hard work, their bravery and their dedication. Firefighters should never doubt that they have the eternal gratitude and respect of the American people that they serve so faithfully. 
   The establishment of a National Firefighter Appreciation Day will help remind everyone of the tremendous work that our firefighters do each and every day, and we should take the time to recognize those efforts. 
   Mr. Speaker, they prevent tragedies from happening, they respond instantly when tragedies occur, and they help pick up the pieces in tragedy's aftermath. They are there to help in some of the worst times in people's lives, guiding them through with their brave helping hands. 
   I certainly appreciate the work of the sponsors of this bill in bringing it to the floor. And I urge all of my colleagues to support the adoption of this important resolution so that we, the assembled Representatives of the American citizens, can show America's firefighters the support of a grateful Nation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (TURRILL POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I appreciate the gentleman's yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a representative in this House for the great community of Lapeer, Michigan, I rise in very, very strong support of this resolution to honor one of the founding families of this great community. Lapeer, Michigan, is truly an all-American city. Its population is just under 10,000 people, and it serves as the county seat for the County of Lapeer. The community is located at the base of Michigan's Thumb, and its heritage is deeply based in the agricultural tradition of Michigan. In fact, it is home to mainly family farms. Families have tilled the fertile soil of this area since the community's founding, and today these farms continue to serve as an important part of our breadbasket in Michigan. The community has always been home to the pioneering spirit and the can-do attitude that exemplifies America. And no family represents the spirit of this great community more than the Turrill family. 
   In 1832, 5 years before Michigan joined the Union as a State, Dr. Miner Turrill settled in Lapeer with his elderly parents, and the Turrills became the third known family, actually, to settle in that area. Dr. Turrill and his family quickly became respected leaders in the community, and upon the opening of the Lapeer United States Post Office in 1833, Dr. Turrill became the area's first postmaster. For that alone it is fitting that the Lapeer Post Office be named in their honor. But the Turrills gave back so much more to this fine community. 
   During the Civil War, many members of the Turrill family served the cause of freedom on behalf of the Union. This included Captain J.H. Turrill, who made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of the Union when he was killed in action at Antietam in 1862. In fact, the Lapeer Post of the Grand Army of the Republic was named in his honor and served as a gathering point for all of the veterans of that conflict from the area. 
   In 1869, Lapeer was incorporated as a city in Michigan, and the voters elected James Turrill to serve as the first mayor of this community. The Turrills continued throughout the years to provide leadership to this great community, and they have been honored in many ways. Today you can drive on Turrill Avenue in Lapeer. Or you might live in Turrill Estates. And your children might attend the Turrill Elementary School in the Lapeer community schools. The people of this community have always honored the dedication to community and the contributions made by the Turrill family. 
   Earlier this year, Mr. Speaker, I contacted the Lapeer County Historical Society, and I spoke to them about my desire to name the post office in Lapeer after a distinguished citizen from the community worthy of the honor. And I asked for their guidance and assistance on who was deserving of such an honor, and this was their response: 
   ``The Lapeer County Historical Society recommends that the Lapeer Post Office be named the Turrill Post Office. The Turrill family dates back to the earliest settlement in the Lapeer area. They have always been remembered as honest, hardworking farmers and leaders of the Lapeer community ..... A committee was appointed and met on July 6 to review a 2-page list of names. Turrill was the unanimous choice.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, it is entirely appropriate that this House take this action today to honor one of the pioneering families in a great Michigan community, a family that worked hard to give back to the community, a family that took a leadership role in shaping the community, earned its respect, and has a highly valued place in the history of Lapeer, Michigan. 
   I want to thank the members of the Lapeer Historical Society for their assistance and their guidance in this effort. And I thank the leadership today for bringing this legislation to the floor, and I will thank the Members of this House for their expected support in honoring this great family. And I certainly thank the members of the Turrill family who did so much to make Lapeer the wonderful community that it has become.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I certainly appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I intend to vote ``no'' on this rule as well as the underlying bill, and I want my reasons for doing so to be a matter of public record, because I believe that this vote will come back to haunt many Members, maybe in 3 years, maybe in 5, maybe in 10, but at some point. 
   This is actually not an energy bill, it is simply a CAFE bill, and so it should rightly be called the ``how Congress destroyed the domestic auto industry bill.'' 
   Let's consider for a moment that the domestic auto industry is the only carbon-restricted industry in our Nation, and this bill certainly continues that unfairness. In fact, under this legislation, the domestic auto industry will almost entirely shoulder the burden for this Congress so that we can say we are reducing CO  
   2 emissions, even though the auto industry is responsible for less than 20 percent of that. 
   This bill attacks the domestic auto industry because they are a very easy target. In fact, it is just the ``weak chicken'' scenario, and all the other chickens in the barnyard, including the oil industry and the natural gas and the utilities and coal, are all pecking the domestic auto industry to death, because by doing so they can avert any such government sanctions against themselves. And I mean that literally, because it is estimated that the cost to comply with this energy bill with these new CAFE mandates, it is going to cost the domestic auto industry $85 billion. $85 billion from an industry that is struggling just to survive right now with all the unfair trade practices and the legacy costs that they face. And if you don't believe me, just read the Detroit papers today to get a clear vision of exactly what is happening in the domestic auto industry. 
   But instead of spending all of those dollars on R&D and manufacturing vehicles that will truly reduce our addiction on foreign oil, like lithium ion batteries, or flex-fuel or hydrogen fuel cells, we are going to mandate higher CAFE standards, continuing to use an antiquated approach and an antiquated model that we started in the 1970s. The result of that has actually been that our consumption of oil since we have had these CAFE standards has doubled. It is very hard to say the CAFE mandates have been a success. Really, so what if thousands of jobs are lost in the domestic auto industry? Some in this Congress would say that we did it to ourselves. 
   And this bill will allow some to thump their chest. But, Mr. Speaker, it is a very hollow thumping, just to say they are green, because we should remember the entire history of the domestic auto industry and what it has meant for this country. Not just because it created the middle class in a State like Michigan, or because after Ð9/11 when the domestic auto manufacturers immediately offered zero-interest financing to keep the plants running and people buying cars so that our national economy would not succumb to the terrorists as they had hoped. But also because during World War II, Michigan was known as the ``arsenal of democracy,'' because we had the manufacturing capability to build the armaments that literally led the world to peace and to keep our Nation free.     
   We didn't even build cars for 2 years then because we were so busy building tanks and planes and Jeeps. We were totally engaged in the war effort and protecting freedom and liberty and democracy. And in the future when our  country needs that capacity again, and we will, we will find that we will be at the mercy of countries who either manufacture their vehicles cheaply in their own countries and import them to us, or they will build their product here but, the company's ownership is foreign, countries like Japan or Korea or China. And will our national interests match theirs? We had better hope so. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule and on the underlying energy bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Speaker, as we approach the Fourth of July holiday, many Americans who would use this long weekend to vacation or to perhaps spend time with their family will have to weigh their options as they struggle with gas prices that have risen to over $4 a gallon. As the worldwide demand for oil has contributed to the rise in prices that affects families all across America, we have actually restricted our supply here at home. America, unfortunately, has become more dependent than ever on more expensive foreign sources of energy, and not taking advantage of our own energy sources is economic suicide. 
   That is why I am cosponsoring the No More Excuses Energy Act. It would lift the moratorium on exploring for oil on the Outer Continental Shelf, open up the ANWR in Alaska for natural gas exploration and oil exploration, and it would also provide incentives to build more refineries right here at home. 
   This legislation would provide incentives and tax credits to assist in researching and in using alternative forms of energy like wind power and nuclear energies. This commonsense approach to energy can help our Nation meet the challenges that we face in the future and can hold down the costs to consumers. 
   It is time to get to work.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, in spite of the fact that the American people have been begging, literally begging this Congress to act on the energy crisis, all we've heard from the majority are excuses for why we cannot access our own domestic supplies of energy. They say that we cannot drill in the ANWR because it will adversely affect the caribou. This despite the fact that the caribou have literally flourished along the north slope of Alaska since the introduction of the pipeline. 
   They say we cannot drill offshore because of environmental threats. This despite the fact that offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico have survived both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita with very limited or no environmental damage. 
   The majority continues to offer excuse after excuse but offers nothing to the American consumers who want some relief at the pump. With gas prices crashing through $4 per gallon  now and rising at an alarming rate, the time for excuses is over. It is time for action. Many of us saw this coming and have tried to expand supply here at home. 
   It is time for the majority to recognize this fact and show more concern for the American consumers than for the caribou.

   And you might ask, who are the Thunder Chickens? Well, they're a great group of students from the Utica Community Schools in my district who were part of a winning team at the First National Robotics Championship held this past weekend at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. 
   Out of 340 competitors, the Thunder Chickens team built a robot that won a race, ran around a track, knocked plastic balls off a 6-foot overpass, picked the balls up and threw them back over an overpass. This was a robot that they designed. 
   The Thunder Chickens victory proves once again that the innovative spirit is in the State of Michigan. My congratulations to the mentor, the team's lead engineer, and to the entire team for a job well done. And I have no doubt that in the future we will see some of these Thunder Chickens grow up to be engineers who invent the fuel efficient vehicles of the future. 
   So when you think of Michigan innovators in the future, remember Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, and now think of the Thunder Chickens from Utica Community Schools.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2830, COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I would like to associate myself with his opening comments in regards to both the previous question as well as the rule. However, I'd like to speak to the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Authorization Act. I believe this legislation is of tremendous importance for our magnificent Great Lakes actually because of title V which at long last provides for Federal regulations of ballast water in the lakes. 
   And why is this important? Because since the Great Lakes were opened to international shipping in the fifties and the sixties, many invasive species have entered the lakes through the untreated ballast water of the oceangoing freighters, also known as salties. 
   Let me just share with you some of these species and the problems that they have caused on the very delicate ecosystem of our Great Lakes. 
   The round goby was introduced to the Great Lakes in the late eighties through untreated ballast water. This fish is an aggressive and voracious feeder that can forage in total darkness. They can take over prime spawning grounds for native fish and upset the ecosystem. These unwanted invaders are flourishing in the Great Lakes and they are causing great damage, Mr. Speaker. 
   The ruffe entered the lakes in 1986 through untreated ballast water from Eurasia. This spiny perch is capable of explosive population growth that threatens native fish like walleye and pike, and their spiny gills make them very difficult for native predators to eat. 
   Another species, the spiny water flea, also entered the lakes around 1986 from its home in Great Britain and Northern Europe from untreated ballast water. These are actually not insects, but they're tiny crustaceans that have resource managers very worried because they compete for food directly with young native perch and other small fish. It also makes it very difficult for small fish to consume, so only larger fish can actually feed on them, again leading to explosive growth of this invasive species. 
   Another species, the zebra mussel, which was first discovered in 1988 and introduced into Lake St. Clair actually by the Caspian Sea, again from untreated ballast water. These species have had a tremendously negative impact on recreational watercraft and drinking water intake pipes throughout Southeast Michigan, and now have spread throughout the entire Great Lakes. 
   In addition, they have filtered the water to such a degree that when combined with the historic low lake levels that we are currently experiencing, and increased nutrients in the water, it's led to very destructive and dangerous algae blooms throughout the lakes, which are causing beach closures and all kinds of other problems. 
   These unwanted species have cost State and local governments tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to combat the damage that they have caused. And all of this is why I have been fighting for ballast water regulation since I came to the Congress, and why I worked very hard to see that it was included in this important legislation. 
   The passage of this legislation will place new requirements on oceangoing vessels entering the Great Lakes. Vessels operating in United States waters will be required to operate ballast water treatment systems that meet interim standards beginning next year, and more stringent standards will take effect in the year 2012. 
   Until ballast water treatment systems are installed, vessels bound for United States ports must exchange their ballast water and perform salt water flushing. 
   And States like my State of Michigan, which have grown tired of waiting for Federal action, and have actually initiated their own ballast requirements, will be able to operate our own programs until the final Federal standards do take effect. 
   I certainly want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica for their leadership on this issue. Again, I oppose this rule; however, I do support the underlying legislation. I think it is long past time to act on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support the Coast Guard Authorization piece of legislation that will greatly assist in protection of a great national treasure, our magnificent Great Lakes.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I have a very easy question: What does support for spinach farmers have to do with fighting the war in Iraq and Afghanistan? The easy answer is: Nothing. 
   But in the emergency war supplemental appropriation bill that we are considering this week, spinach farmers will be getting support. In fact, there is over $21 billion of unrelated spending in the bill; pork, pure and simple. And the purpose is simply to buy votes. 
   I thought the Democrats promised to stop all of this. I thought they said they were going to clean up Washington and not waste taxpayers' money. This is hypocrisy, and you have to ask why they need to buy votes if they are so confident in their slow-bleed strategy. 
   I said during the debate on this nonbinding resolution that the House considered a few weeks ago that micromanagement from the White House is wrong and micromanagement from the floor of this House is worse. 
   The emergency supplemental is not nonbinding, it is for real, and many Democrats will be joining Republicans to vote to let the generals run the war, not politicians, regardless of money for spinach farmers.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Speaker, 30 years ago, Congress established CAFE standards to lower our dependence on foreign oil. And the cost? Hundreds of billions of dollars to comply with the regulation, hundreds of thousands of auto jobs lost, and dependence on foreign oil has gone up over 100 percent. 
   CAFE has not worked. It's an antiquated model, and we should be pursuing new technologies instead. But Democratic leaders are pushing even more stringent CAFE. Democrats are telling auto companies to produce more hybrids and other unprofitable vehicles to comply with new regulations. 
   A recent JD Power survey shows consumer demand is dropping for hybrids, forcing costly incentives to move these expensive vehicles. Even Honda is discontinuing its Accord hybrid because of poor sales. 
   If we worked with the domestic auto industry to develop leap-ahead technologies and make them affordable for all consumers instead of overregulating, we could achieve breakthroughs to reach our goals and to protect American jobs, but instead, the Democratic leadership has made a conscious decision to bankrupt Michigan.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 187. 
   Madam Speaker, throughout my career as a public servant, a principal advocacy of mine has always been to improve the quality of our precious Great Lakes, our magnificent Great Lakes, which are actually 20 percent of the fresh water supply of the entire planet. That is one-fifth of all of the fresh water in the entire world. 
   We have seen efforts at the local and State and Federal levels to prevent industrial pollution, to stop water diversion, to eliminate sewage discharges and to fight invasive species so that future generations can enjoy the beauty of our magnificent Great Lakes. 
   In fact, this House has passed many important bills that have helped make those goals a reality. And though we have made tremendous progress, there are still so many challenges facing the Great Lakes. We need to continue to fight to protect the Great Lakes. 
   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, it seems not everyone shares this vision. As has been discussed, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management recently issued a wastewater permit to a British Petroleum refinery on the coast of Lake Michigan which will actually allow BP to increase the amount of ammonia and total suspended solids discharged into Lake Michigan. This is crazy. This is nuts. 
   This permit flies in the face of everything that we in this body, and numerous individuals in groups outside of this body, have attempted to achieve. Instead of increasing our efforts in creating more stringent regulations, this permit marks a huge step backwards in our efforts to keep our Great Lakes clean. 
   And although BP might argue that they have followed the law in this process to secure their permit, I would say it does not make their actions right. 
   The resolution before us expresses Congress's disapproval of this permit and urges the EPA to reject increased  dumping of chemicals and pollutants into our Great Lakes. This Congress must speak up for the Great Lakes. We owe it to our children, to our grandchildren, and for every generation that will follow. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, yesterday I went to the Rules Committee to offer an amendment to this bill that would have given the people of Michigan and other Great Lakes States fundamental fairness in the Federal flood insurance program. Unfortunately, the Democrat majority on the Rules Committee did not allow the people of Michigan to have their case heard on the floor of this House. I want to stress what I do understand about this bill; that this is an insurance program and that some will pay more than they take out, and that the idea is to have a broad spectrum of the Nation share the risk of natural disasters. 
   But when it comes to States like Michigan and the Federal flood insurance program, the people of my State are repeatedly being sucked dry by a mandated program that forces so many property owners into floodplains and into the program when they never, or almost never, flood. The net result is that Michigan property owners, by far, pay much, much more than their fair share. 
   Recent hurricanes, of course, have depleted FEMA funds. The Federal Government appropriately has stood up to help these States recover. But now the Federal flood insurance program is looking for even more money. And people in Michigan, where natural disasters are rare, are being forced to kick in more than their fair share. 
   I would say this, if it is the policy of the United States Government to continue to encourage property owners to live in areas that repeatedly suffer from natural disasters by offering heavily subsidized insurance, then we should just set up a fund for that purpose. We should not have property owners, like people that live in my State of Michigan, carry the burden of that policy. In fact, water levels in our magnificent Great Lakes are at historic lows. If you believe in the climate change theory, those levels are going to continue to fall. Yet property owners currently in floodplains are faced with increased premiums, and new maps will force even more homeowners in areas where we have never seen a flood into this plan. One thing about Michigan is that, instead of other States where they actually look up at the water, in Michigan, we look down at the water. 
   I would certainly agree that FEMA needs to do what Congress has asked them to do, to update the maps utilizing satellite and digitized elevation. They need to use the new technology. But we should base elevations on sound science. That is not being done now. Currently, the baseline for the FEMA plan is based on 1986 lake levels, which was at a time of historically high lake levels; 20-year-old data is what they are going to base this on now. I would simply suggest that we wait until the International Joint Commission, the IJC, completes its very extensive and exhaustive study that they are currently doing of the lake levels. I think they are now into the third or fourth year of a 5-year study. Then FEMA will have sound science to use on which to base their floodplain maps. 
   Mr. Speaker, because the Rules Committee would not allow my amendment to be heard, I intend to vote against this rule. I urge all of my colleagues to also oppose the rule. I will also be recommending to our Governor in the great State of Michigan to consider options that are fair to the residents of the State of Michigan, like self-insuring or actually opting out of the Federal flood insurance program.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my wholehearted support of honoring members of the United States Armed Forces who were held as prisoners of war during the Vietnam conflict and to ask for a full accounting of those great Americans still listed as missing in action. 
   The hardship bestowed upon our men and women in the Vietnam war prison camps is well documented. I have two dear friends who spent years as prisoners of war in Vietnam. One is a constituent of mine named Digger O'Dell who spent more than 5 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. The other, my colleague in the House, Congressman Sam Johnson. 
   Their bravery, their commitment to our nation and their desire to fight for the freedom of every individual is unquestionable. I rise today in tribute to the service and sacrifice of Digger O'Dell, Sam Johnson, and that of their fellow POWs whose bravery under incredible circumstances did great honor to America. 
   Additionally, we can never forget the 1,729 members of our Armed Forces that remain unaccounted for from this conflict. This is unacceptable to me. This number represents families, loved ones, and comrades who have been left wondering about their fate for the past 30 plus years. 
   Those families that still await word of the fate of their loved ones deserve the sense of closure this information would bring. I feel that it is our duty as Members of Congress to at the very least work to provide them the opportunity for that closure. 
   My district is home to thousands of veterans of the Vietnam war and my husband is a member of one of the largest chapter of Vietnam Vets in the Nation. Each time I see a veteran of that conflict I say ``Welcome Home'' because too many were not welcomed properly when they returned from Vietnam. 
   That ``Welcome Home'' means even more to those who spent time in captivity and endured unspeakable abuses because upon their release they returned to the loving embrace of family and friends. And they did so with their honor intact and love of country strengthened. 
   For those who never returned and whose fate is unknown, we must never stop in our effort to leave no one behind. 
   I urge you as my friends and colleagues to join me in honoring the courage and sacrifice of all those members of our Armed Services who valiantly served our great Nation in Vietnam. And to every Vietnam Veteran--Welcome Home.

It is important that today every American take time to pause and reflect upon those who we lost on that day and those whose heroism and bravery vividly showed the indomitable American spirit.

But that enemy has found that the will of the American people is impossible to defeat. That the vigilance and dedication of those in law enforcement who protect our communities is unending. That the bravery and commitment to the cause of freedom of the American Armed Forces is unmatched in the world. 
   So on this solemn day it is appropriate to mourn those who were lost. To say a prayer for their memory and for their families. And to give thanks to those who so bravely continue to protect our freedom. May God continue to bless this great Nation.

We all want the legislative process to be open and be accessible to the American people. 
   So this week the Democrats get to take a swing at making good on their promises of transparency and accountability, and they're already striking out with their secret slush funds. 
   By deciding not to include any earmarks in the appropriation bills and instead to slip them in by the dark of night into conference reports, preventing anyone from questioning or challenging their earmarks, they have completely shut off the legislative process to the American people. 
   Now, let me make it clear that I am not against earmarks. I am more than willing to get up here on the floor and defend each and every earmark that I have ever gotten or tried to get for my district. And I think that all Members should have the opportunity to defend their projects and their requests, but more importantly, tax paying citizens have the right to know exactly how their hard-earned dollars are being spent.

   Native Americans have played an important role throughout the history of our Nation, so it is certainly appropriate that we honor them and their accomplishments as well. In fact, were it not for some great Native Americans, America as we know it today might look quite a bit different. 
   Think about Squanto and Somerset, who helped the Pilgrims survive their very first winter in the New World; or Sakakawea, who guided Lewis and Clark across the unexplored North American continent; or Jim Thorpe, the athlete who thrilled millions, really, across the globe with his exploits in baseball and football and the Olympics, where he won a gold medal; or the Navajo code talkers who broke the Japanese code, which was a key moment in the Allied forces prevailing over Japan during World War II. 
   These individuals and many others like them have made invaluable contributions to the survival and to the character of these United States. 
   This legislation will require the Secretary of Treasury to mint and issue coins in commemoration of Native Americans and the important contributions made by Indian tribes and individual Native Americans to the development and the history, the very rich history, of the United States. 
   These coins will serve as an important reminder to all Americans of the important role that Native Americans have played in our Nation's history, the things they are achieving today, and the goals that they will meet in the future. Native Americans will be involved in the design selection process as well, which will also remind them of their important historical contributions.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of H. Res. 386, commending the efforts of the United States Coast Guard, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, and the National Safe Boating Council for their efforts to promote National Safe Boating Week. 
   I actually grew up in the boating industry. My family was in the marine business and still today our family hobby is boating. As well, I serve as cochair of the Congressional Boating Caucus, and I know firsthand the benefits and enjoyment to be had from boating, but also the serious risks associated with irresponsible boating practices. 
   While my home State of Michigan actually has the third most registered boats of any State in the Nation, unfortunately that great enjoyment of our nautical culture goes hand in hand with the many stories each year of boating accidents. We hear about persons lost overboard, or collisions or just reckless boating which results in accidents each year, many of them sadly ending in death that occurred while individuals were enjoying their favorite activity out on the water. 
   The Coast Guard, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, and the National Safe Boating Council have taken it upon themselves to promote safe boating practices every day of the year, but especially they emphasize these goals during National Safe Boating Week. House Resolution 386 commends these groups for their service in this field. 
   Mr. Speaker, some of the principles that are espoused by the National Safe Boating Week include the proper use of personal flotation devices or observing the rules of the road like who has the right-of-way, just understanding port from starboard, attending a boating education course, and avoiding the use of alcohol while operating a boat. All of these things can significantly cut down on the number of on-the-water accidents and help everybody enjoy their time on the lakes, rivers, bays, and oceans we are absolutely so very blessed to have in our great country. 
   It is my pleasure to support this resolution, as well as all of the groups that it commends. In fact, I want to make note that my congressional district is a shoreline district and I also want to say thanks as well to all of the sheriff's marine divisions that operate not only in my counties but all around the Great Lakes basin and throughout our great Nation as well. They play a critical role in keeping our waterways safe. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I appreciate the gentleman yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 1773, the Safe American Roads Act. This legislation sets out very, very stringent, quantifiable safety standards which the Department of Transportation must meet before permitting Mexican-based trucks to operate through the United States. 
   Before coming to Congress, I had the pleasure of serving for 8 years as the Michigan Secretary of State with a principal responsibility of being that State's chief motor vehicle administrator. I was also the chairman of the Traffic Safety Commission of my State, and so I had the responsibility for all licensing, commercial drivers licenses as well as hazardous material endorsements. So I had immediate concerns about how the DOT pilot program might compromise the safety of our roads. Here in the United States, we have reciprocity amongst the States so we can share driving records across State lines.     
   In Mexico, licensing requirements are very poor, and it's well-known that fraud in their system runs rampant. In fact, the Transportation Committee heard in testimony from the DOT's Inspector General that one in five Mexican driving records contained an error of some type. Mr. Speaker, if we had a 20 percent error rate in the United States we would consider it a crisis, and I actually believe that was a very low estimate. 
   There are also concerns about the insurance provisions of this program. American truckers must carry very expensive insurance policies in the event that they are in an accident. What if it happens that a Mexican truck has an accident somewhere in the United States? Good luck to the victims of that accident who will try to collect on damages from a Mexican company. 
   I believe that if we let these Mexican truckers into our country with questionable identification and insurance, it exposes American drivers to more dangerous conditions on our roadways. 
   First of all, because the Mexican drivers are allowed to work far longer hours than our truckers; and secondly, it is well-known that there's widespread drug use in this profession, as the chairman of our subcommittee has already articulated. Presently, there is no system under which secure testing could take place. In fact, it's been said that there is a not a single testing lab in Mexico to ensure that the drivers coming into our country are drug free. 
   The numbers I think are the easiest way to tell whether or not this proposal is a fair deal for the United States. As soon as this pilot program was announced, 800 Mexican trucking companies lined up to come into the United States. By contrast, only two American companies desired to deliver into Mexico. I think those numbers are very indicative of whether or not this is a fair agreement for the United States. 
   Because of all of these problems, groups like the Teamsters, as well as the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, also the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety have all come out in opposition to this proposal. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to ensure the program can only take place once these trucks and drivers from Mexico can meet the same standards that American trucks and drivers do. Trucks participating in the pilot program will be subject to rigorous safety inspections limited to a total of 1,000. Their drivers must also demonstrate clean driving records and have a proficiency in English. 
   This legislation as well would require extensive oversight and review of the pilot program from an independent review panel. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlelady yielding, and I certainly rise in strong support of House Resolution 343, which commemorates the marinas of the United States and expresses support for the sixth annual National Marina Day. 
   The purpose of National Marina Day is to inform the public about the important role that marinas do play in our local communities by providing a very safe, family-friendly venue to encourage the recreational boating industry, which can generate literally millions and billions of dollars in economic activity. The positive spin-off effects of marinas encourage the development of all kinds of businesses and restaurants to supplement the marinas' putting people to work. 
   Actually, in my home municipality of Harrison Township, Michigan, a huge part of our commercial tax base is marinas and recreational oriented businesses, and my congressional district is a shoreline waterfront district as well and our marinas play a very large role in the very identity of our region. 
   In the Great Lakes region alone, boating and marinas generate $4.3 billion annually. Actually, I grew up in the marina business. It was our family business as well as our hobby. So I know firsthand that marinas also provide an essential venue for recreational boating, which is an important part in creating a very high quality of life in a community. 
   While increasing access to our Nation's water resources, marinas also play an important role in keeping our Nation's water clean. Marinas provide an appropriate place to dispose of waste materials so that they are not discharged out into the waterways. Operators of marinas often play an important role in organizing cleanup efforts to collect marine debris to keep our waters clean. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, marinas are playing a very important role as well in the defense of our Nation. I say that because they have been partnering with the United States Coast Guard, and the marina operators and their customers are staying vigilant and keeping their eyes open for suspicious activity. Just as our truck drivers are our eyes and ears on the interstate, marina operators and their customers are really our eyes and ears on the waterway as well. Marina operators fill a critical role in keeping our Nation secure along our liquid borders, such as the one that my home State of Michigan shares with our great neighbors of Canada. 
   So I would certainly urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Speaker, the Democrats in the campaign last fall said they only wanted to raise taxes on the rich. But I think it is interesting how they define the rich. Take, for instance, the fact that they call for the lowest tax bracket of 10 percent to rise to 15 percent. Madam Speaker, the rich are not a part of the 10 percent bracket. 
   They are going to resurrect the marriage penalty tax, costing the average married couple $466 a year more in taxes. They are going to cut the child tax credit in half, costing 31 million American families more in taxes. And if the Democrats are only raising taxes on the rich, it does seem that their definition of ``rich'' is anyone who is married or has children. In fact, anyone who gets a paycheck. 
   They said they only wanted to raise taxes as a last resort. But with the budget we will be voting on today, they have just made reservations for a long stay, with the American taxpayers footing the nearly $400 billion bill, the largest tax increase in American history. 
   That didn't take long.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (DON'T OUTSOURCE AMERICAN JOBS TO IMPORT LESS OIL -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, let's talk just for a moment about what the impact would be if the Democrats' plan to arbitrarily impose draconian fuel standards on our domestic automobile industry were to be enacted. First of all, our cars would get smaller, less safe, more expensive and more likely to be built in foreign countries. 
   Because American automobile companies lose money on every American-built small car, these vehicles would have to be built in low-wage foreign countries like Mexico, China, Korea or Japan. More American automobile workers will lose their jobs. In order to meet the new Federal regulations, experts suggest prices will be going up by more than $6,000 per vehicle. 
   The Democrats' CAFE proposal is nothing more than a stealth tax on American families and businesses. It will put smaller, less safe cars on our roadways, increasing traffic injuries and deaths, and the efforts to reduce our dependence on foreign oil will be outsourced to cheap foreign labor. Does that sound like a good plan to you?

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, at this moment in Detroit the leaders of the UAW and the domestic auto industry, the Big 3, are busy at the negotiating table trying to come to agreement on a new contract. In these negotiations, both sides will be making tremendous concessions in the effort to restore the industry to profitability and to protect jobs. They are dealing with very difficult issues like retiree health care as well as pension reform. 
   I wish them luck, sincere good luck, because the future of my home State of Michigan and of manufacturing in America are at stake as are literally millions of American jobs. We should all support them in their efforts to strengthen this vital industry. What we should not do is pull the rug out from under them by enacting draconian and arbitrary fuel efficiency standards that would kill jobs while doing nothing to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Both management and labor are making hard choices. They are working together to build a better future and a better industry. And in the same spirit, we here at the Federal Government should partner with our auto industry to help move forward technology that would actually solve the problems and create new jobs. 
   While those involved in negotiations are trying to find common ground to save jobs, Congress should not be working to destroy them.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, throughout my career, I have been a strong supporter of workers' rights to bargain collectively with their employers. And while I believe every worker should have the right to bargain collectively, I think there are few who have more earned that right than our Nation's first responders. 
   Historically, Congress has given States and localities wide discretion in determining how to negotiate with their public safety employees. The result of this has been a myriad of different rights for different workers depending on where they serve. Some States have very strong rules to protect collective bargaining. Other States have none at all. 
   Today, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act gives us an opportunity to ensure that our first responders have a minimum collective bargaining rights no matter what jurisdiction they serve. 
   This bill would ensure that police officers and firefighters have the basic rights to bargain over wages, hours, and working conditions. The bill also provides for a mediation or arbitration process to resolve disputes. 
   This legislation strikes the proper balance by prohibiting strikes and lockouts and does not infringe upon existing collective bargaining agreements. 
   Our Nation's police officers and fire fighters lay their lives on the line every day. At a moment's notice, they are ready to protect us from crime, fire, natural disasters, and, regrettably, from terrorists. And too often they offer their lives in the process. 
   Though we can never properly repay them for the things they do, this bill will ensure that their collective voice is heard at the bargaining table. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, currency manipulation by our foreign competitors is creating difficult challenges for our country's manufacturing base, particularly our domestic auto industry. 
   The Wall Street Journal reported in June that ``a cheap yen is making it advantageous for Toyota to increase manufacturing capability and to export cars from Japan, and that it is much more profitable to produce cars in Japan and ship them all to the United States right now.'' 
   And what is the response of the Congress to this threat against the American automotive industry which is directly responsible for the employment of millions of American jobs? 
   Well, the Democrats control the Congress, and the Democratic leadership has decided that Detroit doesn't have enough on its plate right now. Instead of trying to level the playing field, Democrats want to pile on unworkable new CAFE standards on the domestic auto industry. 
   Higher CAFE standards will not reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but they will steal investment dollars from technologies that could transform the entire automobile industry and level the global automotive market. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this misguided policy and stand up for American manufacturing companies, stand up for American jobs.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, the Democratic leadership in both this House and the United States Senate have made a conscious decision to bankrupt the domestic United States auto industry by forcing an antiquated CAFE standard on them. 
   And I just want to remind my colleagues what this industry has meant to America. 
   Over 100 years ago, Henry Ford built the Model T, which brought automobiles to the masses, created opportunities that built America's middle class, and fundamentally changed our Nation. 
   During World War II, Michigan was known as the Arsenal of Democracy because we had the manufacturing capability to build the armaments that literally led the world to peace. For 2 years we didn't even build automobiles because we were building tanks and jeeps and B-24 bombers. And as we surrender our manufacturing capabilities to Japan and China, we had better hope that we never need the ability again to build armaments because we will be at the mercy of these foreign countries. 
   After 9/11, when everyone was concerned that our economy would go into a tailspin, the American automobile industry, the domestic auto industry,  offered zero interest financing, which, as GM said, has kept America rolling. 
   I will never apologize for defending the domestic auto industry against the Democratic leadership.

   When Ukraine declared her independence in 1990 from the Soviet Union, she stated her desire to be a member of the community of free nations. 
   As this young democracy matures, it is incumbent upon the nation members of NATO to not only support their development, but ally with them to ensure the commitment to freedom. 
   The United States has enjoyed a strong relationship with the Ukraine and it is my hope that this relationship grows even stronger with time as both of our countries work to improve stability around the world. 
   It is regrettable that the objections seem to come from the very country that once held the Ukraine under their absolute control. In my opinion the objections of Russia are not sufficient to deny NATO membership for Ukraine. 
   As someone who represents a great many citizens of Ukrainian descent I understand well the desire of the Ukrainian people for freedom. 
   America has always answered the call to support and defend those who yearn to be free and it is time to answer the call of Ukraine.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the rule, and as well as I am in opposition of the underlying bill that we are considering today, and I do so because I am a strict constructionist. I am a believer and I am a defender of the Constitution. In fact, when I came to Congress, like all of us did, I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, and I intend to do so. And I believe that what the House is considering passing today in this legislation is simply unconstitutional. 
   Let me just say, I am not against the citizens of the District of Columbia having the right to vote for a Member of the House of Representatives. In fact, before I came to Congress, I had the privilege and pleasure to serve as the Michigan secretary of state for 8 years, and that is the chief elections officer in my State, and a principal advocacy of mine then as it is now was registering as many citizens who were eligible to vote, and then trying to get as many who were registered to actually participate in the elections process. 
   However, under the Constitution of the United States, it explicitly declares that representation in Congress can only be granted to States. Article I, section 2 states clearly that: Representatives shall be apportioned among several States. 
   Interestingly enough, even the District of Columbia recently argued that it was not a State and shouldn't be treated like one. And I am referring to the recent District Court of Appeals case about the long-time D.C. gun ban when the District argued that the second amendment did not apply to them because they are not a State. And I am not sure if the District actually believes that other parts of the Constitution don't apply to them for the same reasons. For instance, they might think that the first amendment doesn't apply to them. I am not sure. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, the Constitution applies to every American wherever you live, the first amendment, the second amendment, and the section that precludes the District from having a vote in this Chamber. 
   And if we are going to sacrifice the Constitution on the altar of politics, why are we stopping with just giving D.C. a vote in the House? Why not give them two Senators like every other State has? How about a Governor? A statehouse? A State senate as well as all the other constitutional officers that other States have, like the attorney general or secretary of state or whatever? 
   Also, by trying to buy a few votes by saying that we will expand the membership of this Chamber by giving D.C. one Member and Utah one Member so that we will hopefully have one Democratic vote or one Republican vote; since we are being completely political and arbitrary, how about just one vote for the District, and then give whatever Member has the most Republican district in the Nation, give them two votes? 
   Mr. Speaker, I cannot vote for a bill that clearly violates the Constitution. It will never be upheld by the courts. The District should either go back to being a part of the State of Maryland, as they were at our Nation's founding, or we should amend the Constitution. Asking Members to vote to violate our Nation's Constitution, I believe, is absolutely the wrong approach. I would urge a ``no'' vote on this rule and a ``no'' vote on the underlying bill.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the gentleman for yielding and I appreciate his very hard work on this bill, as well as the chairperson of T & I, who, unfortunately, as has been mentioned, has not been able to be with us today. But we have got great leadership, and to the chairperson of the Water Resources Subcommittee as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my incredible disappointment of the President's veto of the Water Resources Development Act because there was an enormous amount of bipartisan work that went into crafting this bill, as was demonstrated actually by the overwhelming support it received in both Chambers for final passage. 
   The President says this bill spends too much. Well, fair enough, until you consider that this bill actually spends nothing; it simply authorizes, and the actual appropriations for every project will have plenty of time for discussion on the merits before approval. 
   The Congress has not passed a WRDA bill since 1999. It is long overdue, and it addresses critical water projects and related infrastructure throughout our Nation that I believe we need to invest in to keep America strong and healthy. 
   Members are talking today about various projects in their part of the country, so let me just mention a few in my area. The great State of Michigan, also known as the Great Lakes State, not just because our magnificent Great Lakes are a huge economic impetus for us or because our quality of life is predicated on them, but, in fact, because they are our very identity. 
   Keep in mind that the Great Lakes actually comprise 20 percent, or one-fifth, of the fresh water supply on the entire planet and that they are facing historic low water levels, that they are being inundated with invasive species, and that they are suffering from chemical spills and billions of gallons of raw sewage that are being dumped into them. 
   This bill authorizes funding for the Lake St. Clair-St. Clair River Management Plan. It authorizes building an electronic barrier at the Chicago Diversionary Canal to keep the Asian carp from coming in to Lake Michigan from the Mississippi River. It authorizes funding to stop the spread of VHS, which is an Ebola-like virus that is infecting some of the fish in the Great Lakes. And it authorizes studies on how water diversions may be contributing to the historic low lake levels. 
   Mr. Speaker, I like to think of myself as a fiscal conservative, but part of that, I believe, means being able to clearly make choices about priority spending. In my mind these types of projects are priorities for our Nation. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote to override the President's veto.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I don't think you can find a single Member in this House who does not want the war in Iraq to end. We pray every day, every day that the war ends. And we are all so very proud of the brave men and women who serve us in the Armed Forces. We all want them to come home to their families safe and secure. 
   But unfortunately, the terrorists don't really care what we want. Like it or not, the terrorists' war against us is going to continue through the end of this administration and into the next. Whatever you think of George W. Bush, after his time is up, this war will not end. 
   I can understand the consternation that some have for the way the Bush administration has prosecuted this war. I can understand the desire of some who want to tie his hands. But for the life of me, I cannot understand why we would want to tie the hands of the next administration, of the next President, as he, or she, takes on the mantle of responsibility to lead our Armed Forces as Commander in Chief. 
   In fact, I just heard the other day one of the major Democrat Presidential contenders, Senator Obama, who said that as President he might order an invasion into Pakistan. This, of course, would be a major escalation of the war. How would this legislation affect his ability to do that? What impact would it have on our troops, because this legislation only refers to Iraq deployments. 
   Could some troops who just returned from Iraq, could they immediately be deployed to Pakistan by ``President Obama''. I believe it would allow that, regardless of their need for dwell time. 
   All of us need to think through everything we are doing and how our actions affect our troops and their families. Military families should not be given false hope of decreased deployments and longer dwell times, because any President forced to take on the tremendous responsibility of leading our Armed Forces in this war will just utilize the waiver provisions in this bill and make it meaningless. 
   You would think any President would just give their Secretary of Defense a blanket waiver. So really, what is the point of this legislation? 
   Mr. Speaker, in September, General Petraeus will be coming to Congress with his unvarnished assessment in his report on progress in Iraq. Recent reports fortunately have been more positive about the progress being made by our military; although, I will note that the lack of progress by the Iraqi Government on the political front remains a huge problem. The fact that the Iraqi Parliament is taking a recess is cause for great consternation.  
   But let us all pray that real progress is happening which will allow our troops to come home, and complete their mission and come home soon. I would ask my colleagues to wait to hear the assessment from General Petraeus and then make a judgment on how to move forward in Iraq. I don't believe this legislation is fair to our troops. 
   And I also want to make a point that I have very high regard and respect for my colleague, the gentlewoman from California, who brings this to the floor today. I do not question her motives for a moment on this, but I do urge my colleagues to defeat this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I certainly appreciate the gentleman yielding time to me. 
   This rule allows us to proceed, and I wish to speak in strong support of the underlying bill, and I rise in very strong support of H.R. 2176, which is sponsored by Mr. BART STUPAK of Michigan and cosponsored by myself and also the companion bill, H.R. 4115, sponsored by Mr. Dingell, because these bills impact only three congressional districts in this House, only three, period. And those districts are Mr. Stupak's and my district and Mr. Dingell's. 
   These bills are offered in the spirit of bipartisanship, and they are offered to settle a land claim that has existed in our State of Michigan, actually, for well over 100 years, about 150 years, when the State literally stole land from the Indians. 
   And after the Indians spent decades seeking justice, the land claim settlement was negotiated by former Governor John Engler, and here is what he had to say about it, Mr. Speaker. 
   He said: ``As Governor of Michigan, it was my duty to negotiate the land settlement agreements between the State of Michigan and Bay Mills and the Sault Tribe in 2002 ..... In December of 2002, I signed the agreement with the Sault Tribe. I am proud that every concerned party involved in this settlement supports this agreement. This is a true example of a State and the Tribes promoting cooperation rather than conflict.'' 
   I think it is important to note that these bills are supported by every elected official who represents the City of Port Huron, including the current Governor, Jennifer Granholm, both United States Senators, myself, the State senator there, the State representatives, all of the county commissioners, the entire city council, and most importantly, the citizens themselves who voted ``yes'' on a city-wide referendum. 
   It is supported by civic groups. It is supported by educational leaders, by labor leaders like the UAW, by every law enforcement officer in the county, including the county sheriff, the county prosecutor, and the police chiefs. 
   It is about fairness and opportunity for one of the most economically distressed areas in the Nation, where the current unemployment rate, by best estimates, is somewhere between 14 to 16 percent. 
   And it has been very unfortunate, in my opinion, that the opponents have been so untruthful about their opposition to these bills. 
   For instance, they say that it is precedent setting, and yet the truth is in this bill. In section 3(b), the bill states the following: ``The provisions contained in the Settlement of Land Claim are unique and shall not be considered precedent for any future agreement between any tribe and State.'' 
   The opponents also say that it allows for off-reservation gaming. Yet the truth is in section 2(a)(2) of the bill. It states: ``The alternative lands shall become part of the Community's reservation immediately upon attaining trust status.'' 
   And they also say it violates a 2004 Michigan referendum.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The truth is that it actually, the referendum--and as a former Secretary of State, I understand what ballot language actually says--it says, ``Specify that voter approval requirement does not apply to Indian Tribal gaming.'' 
   So clearly, most of the opposition, Mr. Speaker, to these bills comes from those who already have theirs, and they don't want anybody else to have it.     
   They don't want competition. And I think that is un-American. This bill is about fairness and opportunity for an area that desperately needs it. It is about justice. 
   The city of Port Huron is home to the Blue Water Bridge, which is the second busiest commercial artery on the Northern Tier. It is the only international crossing where there is a gaming facility on the Canadian side and there is not one on the U.S. side. And if you were a very good golfer--maybe not me, but a good golfer--you could hit a golf ball and hit that Canadian casino facility right now where 80 percent of the revenues comes from America. Those are U.S. dollars and U.S. jobs that are being sent right across the river.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the gentleman, my distinguished colleague from Alaska, for yielding and for his complimentary remarks. 
   Mr. Speaker, this issue has been waiting for a congressional vote for many, many years but not for as long as our Nation's history of sometimes mistreating Native Americans. 
   This case settles a land claim from over 100 years ago, at a time when our country treated Native Americans terribly and at a time when the State of Michigan, as has been said, literally stole this land from the Indians. 
   Throughout the decades that followed, Native Americans sought justice. Finally, former Michigan Governor John Engler negotiated a settlement that was agreed to by everyone involved. Let me just read briefly a section from his letter. 
   ``As Governor of Michigan, it was my duty to negotiate the land settlement agreements between the State of Michigan and Bay Mills and the Sault Tribe in 2002 ..... I am proud that every concerned party involved in this settlement supports this agreement. This is a true example of a State and the tribes promoting cooperation rather than conflict.'' 
   This land claim settlement is unique to Michigan, and it does not impact any other congressional district other than the three congressional districts of the people who are supporting it here who have spoken today, as have been mentioned. That is myself, Mr. Stupak, and Mr. Dingell. I would point out that, in a time of hyper partisanship, this is a wonderful example, I believe, of bipartisanship. 
   I would note that much of the opposition to this bill comes from Members of Congress who already have gaming in their districts, districts like Las Vegas or like the city of Detroit, and that their opposition is not based on ideology but on, rather, their not wanting any honest competition. I reject this on its face because I believe in the free market, and I believe in free market principles. 
   Some have said that this is stuffing a tribal land claim down the throat of a community that doesn't welcome it. Actually, the opposite is true. This legislation is supported by every elected official who represents the city of Port Huron in any capacity and at any level of government. As has been mentioned, there is the former Governor, John Engler; the current Governor, Jennifer Granholm; both United States Senators; myself, as a Member in the U.S. House here; the State senator; the State representatives; the county commissioners, and the entire city council. 
   Additionally, it has the support of civic groups, of business groups like the Chamber of Commerce, of educational leaders, and of labor unions like the UAW. 
   For those who might be concerned about what law enforcement thinks, we have letters here of support from the county sheriff, from the county prosecutor and from all of the police chiefs. Most importantly, it has the support of the citizens of the city, as evidenced by a citywide referendum vote in support. 
   The opponents of this legislation have said, first of all, that they don't want any competition. Therefore, they hope this bill will die. They have said, even though their communities and their districts have economic development, they need to protect that and that the citizens--the good Americans of a community like mine--cannot have fairness or economic opportunity. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is un-American, and I would hope that my fair-minded colleagues would reject that out of hand. 
   The opponents of this have also stated several outright untruths about this bill. They say that this bill will set a precedent, and that is false. In fact, in section 3(b) of this bill, it states the following: ``The provisions contained in the Settlement of Land Claim are unique and shall not be considered precedent for any future agreement between any tribe and State.'' 
   The opponents also say that this bill will allow for off-reservation gaming. This is also false. In fact, section 2(a)(2) of the bill states the following: ``The alternative lands shall become part of the community's reservation immediately upon attaining trust status.'' 
   In fact, this site was not reservation shopping, as Mr. Stupak has pointed out. It was specifically chosen because it is the only community with an international border crossing where there is already casino gaming on one side and not on the U.S. side.  
   They have also said that this legislation violates the process under the National Environmental Policy Act, also known as NEPA. Yet the legislation makes it very, very clear that the land cannot be taken into trust until it is determined that the land complies with NEPA. 
   They also say that this bill would violate the will of the people of Michigan because of a referendum that was passed in 2004, which required statewide voter approval for any expansion of gaming. This is completely false. As a former Secretary of State, I know a little bit about ballot language, and this is what the ballot language actually says: ``Specify that voter approval requirement does not apply to Indian tribal gaming,'' which is exactly what this bill does. 
   I would offer as proof of this that, since the referendum passed in Michigan, several tribal casinos that are operated by some of the richest tribal opponents of this bill have actually opened facilities. Now, apparently, they didn't violate the will of the voters as long as they could make money. Yet they want to stop our communities, again, from fair competition. I would say please spare me the righteous indignation. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that my beautiful State of Michigan, that our beautiful State of Michigan, is suffering terrible, terrible economic challenges. We have the highest unemployment in the Nation. We have the lowest personal income growth in the Nation. We have the highest foreclosure rate in the Nation. We have the largest exodus of our young people. Our population is moving to other States to seek economic opportunity. 
   The city of Port Huron, that I represent, actually has one of the highest unemployment rates, not only in the State but in the entire Nation.     
   By the best estimates right now, it's anywhere from 14 to 16 percent. Some have said it could be even higher. And yet we try to pay our taxes. We educate our children. We always legitimately think of ourselves as patriotic Americans. We are proud, and we have never asked for a handout, and today we are only asking for Congress to ratify the compacts of our Governors so that we can help ourselves. 
   For those who think that a vote today against this bill will stop gaming in this community, let me just point out this photo here behind me, which is of a Canadian casino, which is about 282 yards away. Now, a good golfer, not me, but a good golfer could hit this Canadian casino. It's right across the St. Clair River, a short trip over the Blue Water Bridge, and about 80 percent of all of their revenues comes from American citizens. Mr. Speaker, I would say that those dollars should be spent in an American facility to help Americans get jobs. 
   This bill is all about fairness and opportunity, and I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''; ``yes'' for private property rights, ``yes'' for the rights of States to negotiate in good faith and for the good of their State, and ``yes'' for Americans to have fairness and opportunity to compete with our wonderful Canadian neighbors for jobs in a community where the jobs are desperately needed. 
   And I would just close on a note: I have heard that there is a number of family values-type groups who are opposed to this. Let me just show you an example of a recent mailing ostensibly from a group called Michigan Family Alert.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. This is a so-called Michigan Family Alert, and, of course, it's saying that they are opposed to these casinos, and, if you're a family values person, you had better to be opposed too. And yet from Business Week what they have said is: ``As it turns out, Gambling Watch is a tiny operation financed by MGM Mirage, one of the world's largest gaming companies, locked in a bitter dispute with two Native American Indian tribes that hope to open casinos in Michigan. The Las Vegas company inaugurated a new $800 million casino in downtown Detroit in October and is not in the mood for any competition.''

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, the campaign of BARACK OBAMA cannot refute Governor Sarah Palin's record of change and reform as Governor of Alaska. She took on the ``Old Boy Network'' in Alaska and she won. She took on corruption throughout State government and rooted it out. She took on Big Oil and made it serve the interests of her State. She is a true agent of change. 
   So now the Obama campaign has decided that the way to get at Sarah Palin is through personal attacks and sexist insults. Yesterday, the Associated Press quoted the following: `` `You can put lipstick on a pig,' Obama said to an outbreak of laughter, shouts and raucous applause from his audience, clearly drawing a connection to Palin's joke. `It's still a pig.' '' 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, Senator Obama might find such jokes funny, but women will only find them insulting. American women also understand that if this is the kind of change that Senator Obama is offering to America, it is really no change at all. Senator Obama owes Governor Palin and the women of America an apology.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, yesterday in this House, we took a great first step forward, I think, in finding bipartisan common ground on the way forward in Iraq with the passage of H.R. 3087. 
   The issue of our troop presence in Iraq has caused great debate across our country; it has polarized this Congress and our Nation. I believe this first step is a demonstration that a bipartisan way forward can happen. In fact, it must happen for the good of our Nation and our ultimate success in Iraq. We can draw that day closer if we in this Congress and we in America continue to work together to forge consensus instead of resorting to partisan attacks. 
   The report of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker last month has given us reason for hope that progress is being made and our troops can begin returning home. As our troops so bravely continue their mission, let us continue ours and build upon the momentum that we started yesterday in this House. Let us all hope that the day is coming soon when our troops, who have protected our Nation and exported liberty, freedom and democracy, will come home. We owe them nothing less than our best effort to make this hope a reality.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (WATER QUALITY INVESTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I certainly appreciate the gentleman for yielding some time to me here today. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in very strong, extremely strong support of this particular piece of legislation we are looking at today, the Water Quality Investment Act of 2007. I am actually a brand new member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee this term, but I have wanted to get on this committee ever since I came to Congress, and it is particularly because of issues like this that we are talking about today. 
   My home State of Michigan actually has more shoreline than any other State in the Nation, except Alaska. If you think of the mitten of Michigan and think of the Great Lakes, of course, surrounding, fresh water and clean water and the Great Lakes, I mean, we are the Great Lakes State. It is an economic impetus for us. It really is our very identity. 
   In fact, the Great Lakes system is actually one-fifth of the fresh water supply of the entire planet. Sometimes people don't recognize that, but they are one-fifth of the fresh water supply of the world. In my area, in the Detroit area, actually, there are over 5 million Americans just right there in southeast Michigan who are drafting their fresh water supply from the Great Lakes, and, of course, the Canadians on the other side, our great neighbors to the north as well. But these waters are absolutely a national treasure, and I think we need to do everything that we possibly can within our power to preserve them and to protect them. 
   Of course, one of the great problems is that many of the communities along the shoreline have very, very old, very antiquated infrastructure. It is decaying infrastructure; it is not right sized. It has all the problems that are not particularly inherent to a city like Detroit or an area like southeast Michigan. 
   We see it all around the Nation, particularly in our industrialized areas there, and we have not been capable, or we have not had the political will, I should say, of spending the dollars to keep up with the growth with our underground infrastructure. Of course, people don't see the underground infrastructure a lot of times. We are not thinking about it as we should. 
   Local communities, of course, are struggling with declining tax dollars. In Michigan, we are having a huge amount of decline in State revenue sharing as well. They have very tight budgets, and even though they have had their best efforts, they just have not, the local communities in the State, have not been able to keep up with the infrastructure needs to keep our water quality clean. 
   We in this Congress have invested tax dollars in so many things that our constituents have questions. Somebody was just mentioning we maybe spent more money on water systems and infrastructure in the country of Iraq than we have in our own Nation in recent years. Some would say that some of the things we do here are not in the national interest. But that is not the case, not the case with this very, very important piece of legislation. 
   I believe that this legislation will provide vital assistance to States and local communities throughout our entire Nation to meet the critical need,  to keep our water clean and pure. That is a charter that we all share. 
   Whatever our constituency is, we are the stewards of this fantastic country and magnificent treasures like the Great Lakes or so many other areas around the country, and we need to make sure that we do keep our water clean and pure for our generation as well as the next. 
   In fact, and let me just mention, several months ago, actually with a Canadian-based research group, we do a lot of work, as you might imagine, in Michigan with our Canadian counterparts there. They were calculating that the United States and Canadian cities dump a combined 24 billion gallons of municipal sewage directly into the water systems each and every year, which is the equivalent of more than 100 Olympic-size swimming pools full of raw sewage each and every day.     
   In fact, they characterized the study as we were treating our Great Lakes like a toilet is what they said; and, unfortunately, there is a very choking grain of truth to that. 
   So I certainly support the legislation. I want to commend Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica for bringing it forward. I urge all of my colleagues to support this very bipartisan piece of legislation that is so important to our Nation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (ENERGY BILL IS A TERRIBLE DEAL FOR AMERICANS -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Speaker, three things are certain to occur because of the Democrat's energy bill: First of all, it's going to make cars more expensive, it will force taxes to be raised, and it will cost American jobs. 
   The imposition of higher CAFE standards combined with a regulatory nightmare of the EPA regulating tail pipe emissions and NHTSA regulating fuel economy will force the domestic auto companies to expend billions on regulatory compliance with the cost passed along to consumers, of course. 
   Some estimate that the cost of this will be as much as $85 billion. This means that the cost of an American automobile will rise as much as $5,000 to $10,000 per vehicle. And worst of all, the new mandates will actually force automakers to outsource more vehicle production in an effort to reduce their costs and to remain competitive, which will cost more American jobs. 
   This is simply a terrible deal for American consumers, American taxpayers, and American workers. It will result in a hidden tax on cars, higher taxes on gas, and less jobs in America. Our Nation needs a comprehensive energy policy, but this bill misses the mark badly.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, it has been six years since September 11, 2001 when radical Islamic terrorists attacked and murdered nearly 3,000 of our fellow Americans. 
   On that horrible day the seriousness of the terrorist's war against us became clear. Because of their hatred of our freedom and liberty--these deranged individuals would murder innocent men, women and children to make their point. 
   On that day our hearts were broken--and for many who lost friends and loved ones on that fateful day their hearts will never be mended. 
   In the days immediately following 9/11 our nation was unified. 
   Unified in the resolve to strike back against those who murdered our fellow Americans. 
   Unified to do what was necessary to defend our citizens from future attacks. 
   Unified to defend our freedom and to stamp out those who would seek to take it from us. 
   Unfortunately, since that time our unity has faded, but the danger has not. 
   The terrorist's war against us is not about a single American President or ideology. The focus of the terrorist's hatred is every American. 
   On this sixth anniversary of that horrific day every American should reflect upon that day and its place in our nation's history. 
   One thing is certain--freedom is not free. And free people face a constant challenge to preserve that freedom. 
   The terrorist's war against us is a profound test of our ability to preserve the liberty we hold so dear. Our commitment to meet that challenge must rise above petty politics. We must return to the unity of the days following 9/11 because this war is long from over and the danger is real. 
   I have no doubts about the capabilities of our great nation. 
   We threw off tyranny to proclaim our independence behind the idea that all men are created equal. 
   We made that idea a reality by fighting a civil war to bring freedom to every American. 
   We sustained our freedom through two world wars and a cold war. 
   Through it all America has stood tall. 
   America has stood for freedom. 
   And just as we stood together on 9/11 we must stand together today to ensure that the horrors of that day become even more distant memories and the future is a place where every American can enjoy the benefits of our hard won and tenaciously defended freedom.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call the attention of the Congress to a very serious problem that is affecting our magnificent Great Lakes, and that is historic low lake levels. 
   Just as we are seeing low lake and water levels around other parts of the country, the Great Lakes, which, remember, comprise actually one-fifth or fully 20 percent of the fresh water supply of the entire world, are losing water at alarming rates. And these low lake levels are having a significantly negative impact on millions that live in the Great Lakes Basin who make their living on the lakes or simply use them to recreate on. 
   For example, millions of recreational boaters are running aground or they can't keep their boats in marinas. Lake freighters are not being able to load up the way that they need to because the low lake levels are causing untold millions of dollars of losses for the shipping industry, and the very fragile environmental habitats of many species of fish and waterfowl and other species have been negatively impacted as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, much of what is happening to the Great Lakes can be attributed certainly to weather changes. We have had some warmer winters. Therefore, you have less ice cover so evaporation is occurring all year long. 
   As this Congress considers funding for other national environmental treasures, let us remember our magnificent Great Lakes.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (ESTABLISHING PROGRAM TO MAKE GRANTS REGARDING BACKUP PAPER BALLOTS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I appreciate the gentleman yielding the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, as was mentioned, actually for 8 years I had the distinct honor and privilege really to serve as Michigan's Secretary of State. And in that role, a principal responsibility of mine was to serve as the State's chief elections officer. And I was blessed with an absolutely outstanding professional staff that helped to ensure that not only were our elections open, free and fair, but also that everyone in Michigan who was eligible and properly registered to vote had an opportunity to vote and that every one of those votes was counted. 
   After the 2000 election, naturally, the Ford-Carter Commission on National Election Reform cited Michigan's Qualified Voter File, a file that we built in Michigan, as a national model,  a attribute to Michigan's well-run elections. That report also cited the need for each State to establish a uniform voting system, a process that we had already been studying in Michigan. We were prepared with a uniform voting plan as soon as this Congress passed the HAVA Act, the Help America Vote Act. 
   And as a result, today Michigan has an optical scan uniform voting system, and we have experienced little or no problems with that system. And this was due to careful, long-term planning and professional work by our State elections bureau working in partnership with local election clerks. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, the bill that we are considering today will provide Federal grants for States to do contingency planning for this year's election. Well, here is our Michigan contingency plan, a plan that I believe is also in place right now by the huge overwhelming majority of the States in our Nation. We require that optical scan ballots be printed for 100 percent of all registered voters. If an optical scan precinct tabulator malfunctions on Election Day, the clerks allow voters to continue, and then they have voters deposit their ballots in the auxiliary bin of the ballot box which they can count later. Plan complete, at no cost to the Federal taxpayers. And as I understand it, this bill actually has a cost associated with it of I believe $75 million. 
   The proponents of this bill note that they have had some support of the National Council of State Legislatures as well as the National Association of County Officials. And they cite that as good reasons to support this legislation. Well, I would respectfully point out that these officials have no responsibility in the actual administering of elections. And I would note that the National Association of Secretaries of State, of which I was proud to be a member, and now I'm an honorary member, and also the NASS-ED, which is the association of State elections directors, neither of those two national election associations are up here on Capitol Hill advocating for this legislation. 
   And these are the two groups, as I say, which are totally made up of those who are responsible for the administration of elections in our Nation, and those who also do the contingency planning. If those responsible, Mr. Speaker, for planning and administering elections are not asking for this bill, I would ask why is it being offered? 
   I would urge my colleagues to defeat this needless bill and allow our elections officials across our Nation to continue their diligent work in preparing for this fall's election.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Thank you. I certainly appreciate the gentleman yielding time to me. 
   Madam Speaker, my home State of Michigan shares a very long liquid border with the nation of Canada. We have a very strong and we have a positive relationship with our neighbors to the north; but one issue that has festered in recent years is the fact that Canada has made Michigan a dumping ground for their trash. In fact, all of the municipal waste from the city of Toronto, 100 percent of it all, is carried across the border and dumped in our home State of Michigan. I do not find this to be very neighborly. In fact, if you come to the Blue Water Bridge in St. Clair County, which is in my district, you can literally see, sometimes as far as the eye can see, these trucks lined up to enter into our country just brimming with Canadian trash. They are obviously congesting our roads, they are clogging this very vital border crossing, they are tearing up our highways, and they are threatening the safety of our drivers. 
   Pine Tree Acres, which is one of the largest landfills in Michigan, is in my district, it's in Lenox Township, and every day you can drive down and see a mountain of trash that is growing higher and higher because of all of the influx of Canadian trash that is being dumped there. And most Michigan communities plan very prudently to meet the solid waste needs of our citizens. We all took a lot of pride in planning for that. But now with the influx of all of this foreign trash, the Canadian trash, landfills across the State are overflowing and they are reaching their capacity years sooner than was ever anticipated by the local municipalities. 
   Much of this trash presents enormous health and safety hazards to our communities as well, and to our residents. Some of the trucks have even been found to be ferrying illegal drugs into our communities. And just to give one example of the kind of dangerous trash that is being imported, just last year a Canadian truck spilled human waste, which I think Mr. Rogers referred to as well, all the way along a highway in our State, and this is simply unacceptable. In fact, I find it rather ironic that Canada has a reputation of being environmentally conscious because it seems they are employing something of a double standard here. They find it perfectly acceptable to use Michigan as their own personal garbage can for their waste, but God forbid that they would pollute their own environment and endanger their own citizens with this trash.  
   Madam Speaker, the people of Michigan have had enough, but presently they have no ability to stop the flow of foreign trash, and this legislation does give them that ability. So I would urge all of my colleagues to stand with the people of Michigan and every community in our Nation, to give them the ability to protect our environment and to control the flow of foreign trash into our landfills by supporting this very important legislation. 
   Again, I appreciate our colleagues' responsible action on this.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, as a member from the Michigan Congressional Delegation I am proud to honor today one of our State's favorite sons, the 38th President of the United States Gerald R. Ford. 
   President Ford is the only person in the history of our Nation to ascend to presidency having never sought either the presidency or the vice presidency. And he did so at one of the most difficult moments in our Nation since the Civil War. 
   Upon assuming office he acknowledged that he had not been elected through the votes of the American people but simply asked for his confirmation through their prayers. 
   He was the right man, for the right office at the right time for our Nation. 
   He made policy decisions not based on political calculation, but on what he believed was in the `` best interests of the Nation. 
   He was not afraid to reach across party lines to find solutions to the myriad of challenges which faced our Nation. 
   He was a man of unquestionable character. 
   Prior to coming to Congress I had the honor to serve as Michigan's Secretary of State and as such served as our State's official historian. 
   During my term in office I had the privilege to place a historic marker at the newly renovated boyhood home of President Ford. 
   On that day he spoke of the values instilled in him in that home, in his community and in our great State of Michigan. 
   These were values that served him well throughout his life and certainly when he assumed the presidency. 
   Values like honesty. Integrity. Treating every person with respect and dignity. Love of country and a commitment to freedom. 
   His commitment to these values was evident throughout his public service. 
   As a military officer in the Pacific in World War II. 
   As a member of this House of Representatives for nearly three decades. 
   As the leader of the Republican minority in the House where he proudly voted for and sought votes for landmark legislation like the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. 
   And as Vice President and President of the United States where he helped America recover from what he called our long National nightmare of Watergate and where he concluded the war in Vietnam. 
   Simply put, Gerald R. Ford was a great American worthy of our honor and respect. 
   Our condolences go out to his wonderful and courageous wife Betty and to the entire Ford Family. 
   A grateful Nation owes a debt of gratitude to President Ford for his lifetime of honorable service. 
   May he rest in peace.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (SECTION 515 RURAL HOUSING PROPERTY TRANSFER IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. 
   This measure corrects a problem which has been culminating since 1974 when the National Flood Insurance Program began subsidizing flood insurance rates. These rates were designed to encourage participation in the program and to generate sufficient income to pay anticipated claims on these properties. Originally, Congress had expected that over time the percentage of these structures would decline and that most of them would be subject to actuarial rates. However that has not occurred. 
   This bill corrects this problem by removing subsidies for properties that are purchased in excess of a half of a million dollars. 
   Sadly, this is just one of the many problems the National Flood Insurance Program faces. Currently, FEMA is engaged in efforts to modernize flood maps throughout the country, which in many places, are horribly outdated. Utilizing antiquated data impacts millions of property owners, property owners that live on, near or around the Upper Great Lakes, which is essentially everything in the Great Lakes Basin upstream from Niagara Falls. So Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron and Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair and the St. Mary's River, St. Clair River, the Detroit River and the Niagara River. 
   Unfortunately, FEMA's efforts in the upper Great Lakes are being conducted with flawed and outdated data. The data currently being used is from when Great Lakes water levels were at an all time high, and in the 20 years since this study was completed, lake levels have fallen for 11 years. 
   Let me use St. Clair County in my district as an example. In St. Clair County, FEMA is abusing the authority Congress granted them through management of the National Flood Insurance Program. As the agency continues to modernize the maps in the county, the effects will double the number of county residents who will be forced to purchase flood insurance even though they are at virtually no risk of flooding. More specifically, Lake St. Clair is currently more than 55 inches below the current flood level, and over 6 feet below FEMA's proposed flood level. This means that St. Clair County alone has subsidized the flood insurance program to the tune of $8.2 million. Using such flawed data is nothing more than a waste of FEMA's time and money not to mention the waste of taxpayer dollars. 
   How can the FEMA justify doing this? The agency claims these residents are at a higher risk of a flood and wants to raise the base flood elevation which determines the boundaries of the 100-year flood zone. As a result, states like Michigan become ATMs for FEMA to withdraw money and spend it in regions of the country that experience high levels of repeated flooding. In Michigan, we look down at the water, not up. 
   Certainly we can all agree that using sound science in this instance--when hundreds of millions of dollars are about to be assessed against American property owners--is the most prudent course of action. It is time that FEMA stop using antiquated data and forcing the American people into purchasing a product that some don't need.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I certainly thank the gentleman for yielding and certainly appreciate his work and the chairman's very, very diligent work on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of the 2007 farm bill. This bipartisan legislation will ensure a secure food supply and the continuance of a strong agricultural sector. A very important part of that agricultural sector in my district, actually, is the production of sugar beets, which is helped greatly by this bill.     
   The increase in sugar loan rates, the first since 1985, is widely supported by Michigan farmers. 
   Also including sugar producers in the development of alternative energies I think is very important and can help to make them an integral part of developing energy resources that will only help consumers and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy. 
   While the sugar program faces some criticism, which we have all heard on the floor today, I think it is important that Members be reminded that this program comes at little or no cost to the taxpayers. 
   As well, our specialty crop farmers will also be protected in this bill while ensuring that the wealthiest farmers are not receiving government subsidies. 
   I don't believe anyone understands more about how to strengthen our agricultural sector than farmers themselves, so I certainly listened, as I am sure all Members did, to our local farmers while this bill was being negotiated and I sought their input and their counsel, and I am glad that much of what they stated was needed was included in this legislation and they strongly support this final product. 
   I believe this bill is a great example of bipartisan compromise, and I also believe it is good for the future of American agriculture and thereby our entire Nation. I would urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, first I would like to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague from Michigan (Mr. Levin) and Macomb County. We share a county together. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this rule and in very, very strong support of the underlying legislation. Today this House is beginning to take action to provide our domestic auto industry with a bridge loan to help them through these very difficult times. 
   Some of my colleagues engaged in this debate have described this as a bridge loan to nowhere. Well, it is my opinion that those Members have a very bad map, a very, very bad map. In fact, these are bridge loans to better times, to a stronger auto industry that will build the high-tech vehicles of the future and will protect millions of good jobs in America. 
   What Members should know is that the road of inaction is a road to economic abyss; the road to the loss of as many as 3 million jobs; the road to the destruction of the domestic manufacturing base which has formed the arsenal of democracy; a road to a deeper and more protracted recession that will negatively impact every community across this Nation. As was said, this is not just a Detroit problem, a Michigan problem; this is an American problem. And a detour from the bridge loan of assistance to the domestic auto industry to the road of inaction, that is a dead end. 
   I will choose the bridge to more jobs, the bridge to advanced technology, the bridge to a vital industry base and to a brighter future, and I urge my colleagues to join me on that trip. I urge them to support this rule, to support the underlying bill, and to demonstrate that this Congress does care about Main Street, not just Wall Street.

Mr. Speaker, you know, after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, this Congress passed well over $133 billion of assistance to that region, and we did so because Americans were hurting and they needed assistance. And we also did it because that region was vital to our energy industry that plays such a critical role in our national economy.

Credit is simply not available to enough consumers to keep the cash flow our automakers need and, because of this, millions of jobs across this Nation are at risk. And I cannot believe that this Congress will allow the backbone of our manufacturing and industrial sector to be swept away, because  I believe that most Members will agree that America cannot be a great Nation without a strong industrial base. 
   Think about the millions of Americans who are asking us to do the right thing, and support this vital legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this rule, because we do need to act to support our domestic auto industry, and failure to act by Congress on bridge loans to our domestic auto industry will have catastrophic effects on our workers, on our economy, as well as our national security. Inaction is simply not an option. 
   In recent years, the domestic auto industry has been undergoing significant restructuring in an effort to become more competitive with foreign automakers. More needs to be done certainly, but to suggest that nothing has been done is inaccurate and does not recognize the significant sacrifices made by workers and the tough decisions made by the Big Three. 
   They are also changing their product mix to better reflect the current marketplace demand for more fuel efficient vehicles. It is not Toyota that offers the most models that get over 30 miles per gallon. It is General Motors. It is not Honda that makes the highest mileage SUV in the world. It is Ford with the Ford Escape. 
   We cannot forget the domestic auto industry and what they have meant to America. In fact, during World War II, southeast Michigan was known as the ``arsenal of democracy'' because we literally had the manufacturing capability that led the world to peace by building those armaments, and we expanded freedom across the globe. 
   Then on September 11, 2001, that horrific day when the terrorists murdered nearly 3,000 of our fellow Americans, they had an additional goal, and that was to destroy our economy. At that time, while the Federal Government was properly providing bailout support to the devastated airlines, it was the domestic auto industry, led by General Motors and their Keep America Rolling Program, which kept customers in the showrooms, workers on the factory floors, and did indeed keep America rolling. 
   The cost to our economy of failure of one or more of these companies will be stark. Experts have indicated that this would cause a cascade of bankruptcies across the economy and lead to the loss of as many as 3 million jobs. The cost of this calamity to the taxpayers would be multiple times greater than the cost of these bridge loans. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to look beyond the super-heated rhetoric here and support me in joining this rule and this vital industry.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Speaker, my home State of Michigan is currently experiencing really hard economic times. We have the highest unemployment in the Nation. We have the lowest personal income growth in the Nation, dropping home values, tightening family budgets. 
   Government overspending, combined with declining revenue from the soft job market, has forced my State into a fiscal crisis, and our Democrat Governor thinks that the way to solve the problem is by raising taxes and increasing government spending. 
   Here in Washington, we also have a spending problem and a deficit that is too large. So what do the Democrats offer? The largest tax increase in American history, almost $400 billion, and massive new government spending. 
   The Democrats are also pushing arbitrary and draconian fuel economy standards that could decimate our domestic auto industry and cost even more Michigan jobs. 
   Madam Speaker, the people of Michigan just cannot take it anymore. They do not need bigger government. They need bigger paychecks, and I ask the Democrat leaders to take pity on the citizens of Michigan. Please just give Michigan a break.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1538, WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the gentleman yielding; and although I do question as well this very restrictive rule, I rise to speak in very strong support of the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Nation is blessed, indeed blessed, that we have produced the incredible men and women who defend our freedom through their service and through their sacrifice in our military, and every one of those who serve do so voluntarily and out of a deep love of America and a commitment to the freedom that our Nation bestows. They deserve every last measure of support to ensure that when they are wounded they receive the best possible care. 
   And let me say this. The military medical corps has in large measure provided absolutely incredible care to those wounded in battle. The advancements in battlefield medicine and the care of our wounded warriors after they are removed from the battlefield has allowed countless of our soldiers to survive and to recover fully who in past conflicts may not have survived. In fact, the statistics that are coming out of theater are really a remarkable tribute to the doctors and to the nurses who are engaged there, and those who provide care to our soldiers deserve our thanks and our praise and our gratitude. 
   However, the recent discoveries at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital were disturbing and totally unacceptable. We cannot allow any more Building 18 incidents to occur, and we must do everything that we possibly can to ensure that it does not. 
   This legislation that we are going to be debating shortly is a huge step in the right direction. It will begin to streamline the bureaucracy of the military medical systems and lighten the caseload of case managers by providing more assistance. It will provide a hotline for those receiving substandard care to report the problems so that those situations can be dealt with quickly and that the patients receive the care that they deserve when they need it. And it will provide for a smooth transition from the Department of Defense health system to the Department of Veterans Affairs, cutting more red tape so that the focus can be on the patient and not on the paperwork. 
   We cannot allow those who have fought our foreign enemies in the defense of freedom to come home and fight the Federal bureaucracy to get the health care that they need. 
   As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am very proud to support this important piece of legislation that our committee produced in a bipartisan way, and I certainly want to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter, who are both patriots and veterans who have served the cause of freedom, for their dedication to the care of our troops and for their work in bringing this legislation forward to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support passage of the underlying bill, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act. Our brave men and women wounded in defense of liberty, democracy and freedom deserve no less.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (CAFE STANDARDS AND ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon I will have an opportunity to talk about the war resolution, but this morning I would like to just talk for a second about energy independence. 
   Several weeks ago we heard the President announce part of his agenda for making America more energy independent. But the real question is, how do we get there? The President laid out a plan to place new draconian fuel-efficiency standards on our domestic automakers, which I believe is the wrong approach to energy independence. 
   It is the wrong approach because it would force our domestic automakers to invest in old technology and to stifle very exciting new technologies. Our domestic auto industry is nearing innovative breakthroughs, such as the usage of alternative fuels, new battery technology, and advanced hybrid vehicles. 
   I believe it is in our national interest to provide Federal support to advance the auto technologies of the future to help achieve energy savings. Both General Motors and Ford recently unveiled advanced plug-in hybrids that use a lithium ion battery. Helping that technology become commercially viable will advance our efforts to conserve energy by light years and to create great new jobs here in America. 
   If my colleagues want true energy independence and a thriving domestic auto industry, we must focus on the technology of the future.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I am proud to be yielded time from a true American hero. 
   If at any time while I am in the Congress and I am asked to vote to authorize war, I will ask myself two fundamental questions, two caveats to such action. Number one, what are the United States' vital interests? How are our vital interests being advanced? Number two, what is the mission and how is the mission being defined? 
   I was not in the Congress when the vote to give the President the authority to go to war in Iraq was taken, but as I remember the debate during that vote, it was heavily predicated on the fact that we thought that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and the mission seemed to be principally defined as finding WMDs. It is clear that he had them at one time because he used them on his own people. 
   However, since we have gone into Iraq, whether it is because they have transited the country or they were destroyed, or whatever the reason, we have not found them. 
   Then the mission was defined as toppling the oppressor, the butcher of Baghdad, Saddam Hussein. And we have done so. We let the Iraqi courts exercise their due diligence in a court of law, and he is dead now. Good riddance, and hanging was too good for him. 
   Then we defined the mission as providing a stable framework that would allow the Iraqis to build a democracy because we can all agree that having a democracy in an Arab country in the Middle East would be optimal for the entire world. They have had their elections. They have adopted a Constitution, and they have elected leadership that is in place. 
   Again, I ask about the United States' vital interests and how we are defining the mission because, Madam Speaker, the mission needs to be understood. It is important that those of us in Congress can understand it, of course. It is important that the American people can understand it. But most importantly, the brave men and women who wear the uniform and are in theater risking their lives and their limbs need to be able to understand the mission. 
   President Bush has said that the mission is to achieve stability in Iraq, to train the Iraqi forces so that they will be able to stand up so that we will be able to stand down. He says that the so-called surge is a necessary thing to do. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have listened to the testimony from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense as well, about how this surge will work, and in my mind, a surge is a quick, overwhelming show of force. However, as it has been explained to me, this action will have two of a total of five brigades begin to deploy to Baghdad and the Anbar province and then gradually the other three brigades will be deployed as an assessment can be made on how the first two are doing. 
   I will note that I have read that General Schoomaker, Army Chief of Staff, has said in a closed door hearing that he thought the surge had a 50-50 chance of success. 
   Madam Speaker, our troops have done everything that we have asked them to do and more, and you cannot blame America for the Iraqis' failure to stop killing one another in a religious frenzy. 
   I am a product of the Vietnam era. My husband was an Air Force pilot in Vietnam. My county has the largest chapter of Vietnam veterans in the entire Nation, and although I have resisted making any analogy from Iraq to Vietnam, I will make this one personal observation. 
   From the very beginning of the Iraq conflict, we should have allowed our troops to go in and use overwhelming force; but we were told, no, that we had enough. Those that suggested otherwise were dismissed, and so they micromanaged from the White House, and now I think they are doing the same with this surge. Our troops can win, but they are being held back. They are being micromanaged by our politicians. We are not letting them win, and this is the lesson that I learned from Vietnam. 
   In Vietnam, we used a graduated response. We held back our troops. We did not use overwhelming force, and after many died, we left the field and I cannot believe in my lifetime that once again we are repeating this mistake. 
   I support the troops and I support victory. I recognize how incredibly complex this situation is. I recognize that having our troops leave will probably result in a loss of human life that will be horrifying. I recognize that leaving will probably encourage the neighbors to move in to protect their own interests, and I recognize that the war on terror will follow us if we leave. 
   Yet, recognizing all of this, since the Iraqis will, for whatever reason, not stand up to ensure their own freedom, how can we ask Americans and for how long to continue to do so for them? Either use overwhelming force to win, or get out and do not continue to ask our troops to fight with one hand behind their backs. 
   Mistakes have been made, as they always are in war; but another lesson that I learned from Vietnam is that the only thing worse than micromanaging a war from the White House is micromanaging it from here in Congress. And this is a time when every Member in this House needs to dig down deep and vote their conscience, knowing that sending the right message to the administration has the very real consequence of sending the wrong message to the troops who so bravely and professionally fight for freedom and liberty and democracy. 
   Vote ``no'' on this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (AMENDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 TO RESTORE THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND BALANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in very strong support of this legislation which will ensure that the Federal Government is simply able to meet the commitments that we have already made to both the States and the American people. Specifically, this bill will simply return the $8 billion to the highway trust fund that was taken from it several years ago. 
   And with rising construction costs and fuel receipts due to Americans driving less, the trust fund is projected to be unable to meet the funding that has been guaranteed to the Departments of Transportation all across our country. These agencies draw up their plans years in advance, and failure by the Federal Government to provide that funding at the very last minute I think is simply irresponsible. 
   As important as it is to point out why we should pass this legislation, I think we must also be very cognizant of the consequences for failing to act. 
   In my State of Michigan alone, failure to shore up the trust fund will mean a 34 percent cut in funding, money that the State of Michigan is already counting on. Michigan's Federal highway dollars will be cut actually by $245 million, and would result in a loss of 8,500 jobs, and that is in a State that has the highest unemployment in the Nation already at 8.5 percent. 
   The impact of this nationally would rival, I think, the impact of the economic downturn that we are already experiencing. Failure to pass this bill would effectively negate any positive impact that came out of the economic stimulus package that this Congress has already passed. 
   This vote, as well, Madam Speaker, comes at a unique time in history when you have other nations like China and India who understand how important it is for them to invest in their infrastructure. We in the United States cannot afford to be economically disadvantaged as well. 
   So we have a choice before us. We can vote ``yes'' and make sure that we simply try to keep pace; or we can vote ``no'' and put people out of work, stop construction projects all across the country and put America at a further disadvantage in the global economy. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation and vote ``yes.''

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Chairman, my amendment is very simple, very straightforward. I will just take a few minutes to explain it. But it deals with the issue of how, as our Nation undertakes critical bridge reconstruction, that we make sure to use the very newest and the best technology available in our construction methods. 
   Specifically, I am talking about carbon fiber, which is a very, very lightweight material. It is sturdier. It is less susceptible to corrosion, and it actually is more durable than steel. 
   Right now we use steel rerods in bridge construction, and regular steel rerods can take up to 60,000 pounds per square inch. But carbon fiber rods, like this one that I hold in my hand, can actually take up to 240,000 pounds per square inch. That makes it actually four to five times stronger than steel. As well, it is 8 times lighter than steel, making it very much, much easier to transport and install as well. 
   Also, steel fatigues from the pressure of repetitive use, and carbon fiber does not. By using carbon fiber, in addition to some of the new strength concretes that are out there, I think we could conceivably build a 100-year sustainable structure. 
   In my home State of Michigan, we have already built one bridge using carbon fiber technology, and we are planning on building and reconstruction of three more bridges during the next 2 years. 
   Madam Chairman, my amendment directs the Secretary of Transportation to study the cost benefits of using carbon fiber composite materials and that technology. And then it would require the findings of the study to be returned to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, as well as to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee within 180 days of the bill that we are discussing tonight, within 180 days of the enactment of this bill. This would give Congress adequate time to review those findings and to determine if it would be appropriate to incorporate any action related to the findings into next year's highway reauthorization bill. 
   So I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Chairman, I certainly appreciate the chairman's words. 
   And in Michigan we like to think we are on the leading edge of all kinds of technology. And carbon fiber is one thing, but as the chairman knows, we also have the first mile of concrete ever laid in the United States, in the city limits of Detroit, about Six Mile Road. So we like to think of ourselves as ahead of the curve. 
   But I will close by saying that I certainly enjoy serving on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. And one of the principal reasons I enjoy the work so much is because of the leadership and the vision of our chairman. He is certainly internationally recognized as a leader on transportation and infrastructure issues, as well as our ranking member. And so I appreciate that.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I certainly appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 2537, the Beach Protection Act, and I want to applaud Chairman Oberstar for his leadership in bringing this to the floor and working with Ranking Member Mica. Certainly our subcommittee Chair, Eddie Bernice Johnson, has done extraordinary work on this, and our ranking member on the subcommittee, Mr. Boozman, as well, for bringing it to the floor, I think, in a very bipartisan way. 
   I actually was not in the Congress in 2000 when the original BEACH Act became law, but I really feel this program could have been designed with my district in mind. In Michigan, we are unbelievably blessed to be surrounded by the Great Lakes which provide incredible recreational opportunities for boating or fishing or swimming. 
   Millions of Michigan residents from all over the world come to Michigan to enjoy our magnificent Great Lakes. In fact, there are more than 30 million people who find their way every year to our beaches. 
   We also have some especially unique challenges in the Great Lakes region in regards to quality. Unfortunately, due to inadequate underground infrastructure, many areas suffer from combined sewer overflows during our wet weather events. We often see sewage discharges right into the Great Lakes, right along the beaches near big cities like Detroit or Chicago, other populated areas. 
   My district faces additional challenges in that we have a very long liquid border that we share with Canada. In fact, on the Canadian side of the river next to my district is an area which we call Chemical Valley, which is the largest concentration of petrochemical manufacturing plants in North America. So we need to worry not only about discharges on the American side, but on the Canadian side of the border as well. 
   Frequent and proper monitoring is a critical tool in this area to ensure that those who come to enjoy our State's natural beauty can do so knowing that the waters are clean and pure. 
   The BEACH Act has provided resources to help State and local governments ensure that our beaches are safe for recreational activity. In many ways, the BEACH Act has been successful and this reauthorization bill and the bipartisan cooperation that went into it has improved an already outstanding Federal program, but I do believe that we can do better. 
   A 2007 GAO report about the impact of the BEACH Act on the Great Lakes noted that there were some important successes, but also some areas where we need to improve. First, the GAO found that the formula EPA has used to distribute the BEACH Act grants does not accurately reflect the monitoring needs of the respective States. The EPA takes into account three factors to determine the allocation of these grants: beach season length, beach miles, and then beach usage. 
   At the current funding levels, the beach season factor has a much greater influence than the factors of beach miles and coastal population. Great Lakes States, which have beach seasons of little longer than 4 months, lose out when compared to southern and western States, of course, that have a full year season, even though the number of people who use the beaches might be similar. 
   Just an example, my home State of Michigan is disadvantaged by the minimal consideration given to beach miles. In 2006, Michigan, that has 3,224 shoreline miles, received a grant out allocation of only $278,000. By contrast, one of our neighboring States, that has only 63 shoreline miles, received $243,000. Due in part to this funding disparity, Michigan is only able to monitor 212 of its 905 beaches. 
   I am glad that this legislation helps address this problem by requiring the EPA to conduct a study of the formula for the distribution of grants in accordance with the needs of the States. EPA must report their findings back to the Congress and suggest possible revisions for a more equitable distribution of the funds. 
   A second recommendation from the GAO report was that Congress should consider providing more flexibility for the grant so that they could be used to investigate and remediate contamination sources. Because of the increased monitoring, we are better able to predict which beaches would be contaminated. 
   But most cases local officials do not know the source of the contamination and are unable to take the action to address the cause. If they did they would still not have adequate funds to address the issue. 
   This legislation will allow States to use their BEACH Act grants to track sources of pollution. This change will provide the valuable information that we need to help clean up our waters and reduce pollution before it gets into our waters. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6849 and on behalf of Michigan's farmers and agricultural community. 
   When thinking of Michigan, most people automatically think of the automobile industry. However, many people don't realize that agriculture is the second largest industry in the state and in many ways defines us, our culture and our values. 
   Michigan's agriculture industry is made up of small and medium sized farms. However, the family farmer is alive and well in my district. And that is why this bill is so critical to Michigan producers and the rest of the country. 
   This legislation waives the 10 acre provision for farm program eligibility for the 2008 and 2009 crop years. This provision, which was included in the Farm Bill, prevents farmers with less than 10 base acres from receiving a program crop payment such as Direct, Counter-Cyclical, or ACRE payments. 
   There are many producers which are prohibited from receiving the benefits of the Farm Bill because of this provision. It is my sincere belief that farmers that work multiple plots of less than 10 acres were never intended to be denied access to this program. This legislation today will force the USDA to recognize that fact. I am proud to stand in support of this bill and urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this measure.
