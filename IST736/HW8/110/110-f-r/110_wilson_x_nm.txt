<DOCNO>Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I have offered an amendment, and I will tell my colleagues I intend to withdraw it at the end of my presentation, but there is an issue that has been festering between two agencies that I think Congress needs to go ahead and take action to resolve. 
   This amendment ensures that the Department of Energy Office of Science and the Office of Biological and Environmental Research spends $37 million on medical isotope research in an account that is known as Medical Applications and Measurement Science. This would restore the funding to FY 2005 levels. 
   Medical isotopes are used extensively in imaging technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, heart disease, and several neurological disorders. The program that DOE runs funds basic research in new diagnostic and therapeutic applications using nuclear isotopes. This research has identified new metabolic labels and imaging detectors that have helped identify colon cancer, brain tumors, bone cancers and many other cancers. 
   In addition, this research would fund new radiopharmaceuticals to attach to specific cancer cells and treat them and prevent metastasis. 
   Congress reduced this program in fiscal year 2006 by $23 million because of pressures on the other part of the DOE budget, but also directed them to transfer the program over to the National Institutes of Health, particularly the National Cancer Institute. The NIH did not pick up this research; and in a recent meeting with scientists who do this research, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, who is the director at NIH, said NIH does not do this type of research; NIH cannot do this type of research. They don't have the expertise in the nuclear materials required, and also that this research must go forward. 
   The new director of Office of Biological and Environmental Research has said that he understands the need for DOE to conduct this research and has  said he could provide the funding within his own budget within this research at the fiscal year 2005 level if directed to do so by Congress. The National Academy of Sciences is currently conducting a review of this program, and I think this program does need to go forward. 
   The funds in this particular program, in the last year that it was at this level, FY 2005, funded on the basis of competitive grants programs and research projects in 40 different locations, largely universities, some national laboratories, most of them in the State of California, although also at Case Western University in Ohio in New York, and across the country, but it is critical research using radiopharmaceuticals and targets, enriched targets, that really only the Department of Energy works with. For that reason, that's the appropriate place to do this research. 
   Now, for technical and procedural reasons, I understand that there is a legitimate point of order against this particular amendment that's legitimate, but I did want to at least raise this issue and say we need to sort this out, that the appropriate place for this nuclear research is actually in the Department of Energy rather than at the NIH, and the NIH has said, no, we don't have the expertise to do it. 
   We need to sort this out to continue this highly successful research. I strongly support it, and I hope that we would be able to work with the Senate in conference to make sure that this program is appropriately funded through the Office of Science. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the ranking member of the committee.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from New York, Mr. Rangel, says this is not a House bill; and he's right, it isn't. 
   When the House first passed its version of this bill, I opposed it, particularly because it funded that House version of the bill through reductions in Medicare spending. This bill is a compromise. It is a much better bill. It's not a great bill, but it's a good bill. 
   I was a cabinet secretary in New Mexico for children at the time SCHIP was initially implemented. It was established by a Republican Congress and a Democrat President and it works. It gets kids health insurance that they need. 
   We have big challenges in health care, but this isn't one of them. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I would ask my colleagues to join together and to support this bill tonight for the good of all of us.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan, and I think it's important tonight to take a moment to stop for a moment. 
   We've been talking all day and all afternoon about health care, and it is something we both care about, and jobs and education and trying to make our schools better and make sure we have roads that people can drive to work on and that we can build businesses and get products to market. And we're all focused on our lives and trying to raise our kids and do the best we can, but we want to talk about something tonight that's really a serious issue and is something I think worries all of us. But sometimes we just want to set it aside, and we don't want to think about things that could happen to our own families, particularly if we don't feel personally like we can do something about it. 
   But as government leaders there are things that we can do about it. In fact, I think we have a duty. The first duty that we have as Federal officials is to make sure we protect this country. 
   This weekend, I have been a merit badge adviser for citizenship in the Nation in Troop 166 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and had a group of boys that I was just teaching about the Constitution. We were talking about what are the functions of the Federal Government. And I believe that first and foremost our duty is to provide for the common defense. 
   And by that, we don't mean to clean up after the next disaster or support law enforcement if they prosecute people who conducted a terrorist attack. That's not enough, and that shouldn't be the goal of our government. It is to prevent a terrorist attack on this country. It's to prevent the next disaster. It's to prevent you waking up tomorrow morning, as you did 6 years ago, to watch aircraft fly into the sides of buildings. 
   I think in some ways maybe as a people our desire to move on with our lives has caused us to become a little complacent about the threats that we continue to face; and, in fact, I think our greatest accomplishment in the last 6 years has been what has not happened. We have not had another terrorist attack on our soil since that cool September morning, and it's not because they haven't tried. 
   A year ago in August, the British Government arrested 16 people who were within 48 hours of walking on to American airliners at Heathrow Airport and blowing them up simultaneously over the Atlantic. They planned to conceal explosives in things they could carry on in their luggage that looked like toothpaste or hair cream or shampoo, things you'd normally have. That's why all of us now have to put those things in those little quart-size containers so they can make sure there's not enough of anything there that can destroy an airliner, because the people in Heathrow were going to do that. They were going to make the bomb on board. 
   And if we underestimate the hatred and the cruelty of the people that were going to carry this out, think about this: one of them told the police at Heathrow or British police that he intended to bring his wife and his 6-month-old child with him so he wouldn't attract too much suspicion at the airport. Think about that for a second. These people hate Americans so much, they are so determined to inflict mass casualties on us, that they're willing to kill their own 6-month-old child to do it. 
   That's the threat that we continue to face; and on September 6, in this  month, in Germany, they arrested three people who had amassed enough explosive material to cause an explosion larger than the London subway bombs. Their likely targets were U.S. military bases in Germany. 
   Al Qaeda has been successful in the past in conducting a dramatic attack on the United States with mass casualties, huge economic dislocation; and they want to do it again. As Americans we have to accept, perhaps not accept but expect, that it is likely that they will succeed. They may fail in more of their attempts than they succeed at, but they only have to succeed once. America has to get it right 100 percent of the time. They can fail a bunch of times. They just have to get it right once. 
   There's no question in my mind anyway, and in fact bin Laden has said so, they are trying to acquire chemical, biological, and nuclear materials in order to make their attacks on the West even more dramatic, more devastating, more catastrophic. And there is no doubt in my mind that if they had those weapons they would use them.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. And one of the things that's so deeply troubling is they don't even need to get a nuclear weapon to sell terror across a whole region. It is just nuclear material or a suitcase-sized device that could cause tremendous damage and mass casualties, huge economic dislocation; and that is their intent. 
   And sometimes you listen to these tapes from bin Laden, and I was sitting in my office reading over the most recent one that he sent out on 9/11 on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks. You read through this and go, man, this guy is nuts. It just sounds nuts, but he is serious, and he has shown the ability to carry out mass attacks in the United States and to inspire followers to try to do the same. 
   We have to take this threat seriously. So the question is, as a Nation, and this is one of the things I look forward to talking a little bit about with my colleague tonight, all right, if the first duty of the United States Government is to protect America, to protect Americans from all enemies foreign and domestic, so how do we do this? How can we not only be better today than we were 6 years ago on the morning of 9/11? That's not the challenge. How do we be better tomorrow than we are today? 
   I think the greatest accomplishment we've had over the last 6 years is that we've not had another terrorist attack on our soil; but just because we're one step ahead of them today is not good enough. We have to stay one step ahead of them. How do we make sure our government is doing everything it can to keep America safe?

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. One of the things that is hard to understand is just how difficult prevention is when you're facing a terrorist threat compared to what we faced during the Cold War. 
   I served in the military during the Cold War. I served overseas in Europe for most of my time as an officer, graduated from the Air Force Academy and then did my service overseas. 
   In some ways I kind of look back on this and say as an intelligence problem, the Soviet Union was a very convenient enemy. They had their exercises the same time every year. They came out of the same barracks. They had tables of equipment and standard organizational charts. They used the same radio frequencies, the same rail lines. They were a very predictable, potential enemy. Had they ever attacked us, they would have been very difficult to defeat, but we had no doubt about where they were and what they were doing pretty much, and we had huge systems set up for what we called indications and warning, ballistic missile early warning systems and systems that would launch our air interceptors if bombers came close to the United States. We were very good at looking at what the Soviet Union was doing to immediately protect America.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. The intelligence problem with terrorism is much different. It is more like a Where's Waldo problem. They are hiding among us. They don't have set tables of equipment, they don't have their own dedicated radio systems. They don't live in barracks. They don't have exercises that we can catch or plan for or listen to. But if we can find them, we can stop them. And that is why I believe that good intelligence is the first line of defense on the war on terror.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. My colleague from Michigan and I are talking tonight about something that is pretty important and something perhaps that gets not enough time or attention these days, and that is, how do we better prevent a successful attack on the United States, a successful terrorist attack in particular? 
   One of our strongest tools in this fight is good intelligence. Now, America spies on its enemies.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. That is exactly what we do. Other governments try to hide what they are doing and terrorist organizations try to hide what they are doing, and we try to steal those secrets. That is what good intelligence does. We steal those secrets so that we can find out the plans and the capabilities and the intentions of groups that might want to kill us or attack us so that we can stop them.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. And probably one of the best ways that we have to get a handle, particularly on the terrorist threats, is what they call communications intelligence. We try to listen to people talking to each other. If you are trying to get people's plans and their intentions, understand more about them, you listen to them when they are talking to each other. That is what communications intelligence does. And we have been trying to collect communications intelligence since we started technical intelligence since the invention of the telegraph. 
   There were spies during the Civil War. We tried to read communications telegrams, intercept international telegrams during the First World War. So we have been trying to intercept communications to be able to tell what is the enemy going to do. 
   In New Mexico, probably the best example and the one that people know today is what we tried to do to protect our own communications. Particularly in the Pacific, in the Marine Corps, because we knew the Japanese were listening to our guys in the field talk to each other on the radios back and forth on where they were going and what hill they were going to, what their plans were. They used Navajo communicators because nobody in Japan could translate the Navajo code talkers. So we try to protect our own communications. We also try to intercept those of the enemy, both on the battlefield and more globally. 
   One of the challenges that we face and one of the things that the gentleman from Michigan and I have been working on for close to 2 years is that our laws for communications, particularly for gathering foreign intelligence from within the United States, have become outdated. There is a law called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which was initially put in place in 1978. Before that, there was really no statute that dealt with any limitations at all on how you collect foreign intelligence, foreign communications intelligence if you are based here in the United States. That law was a response to excesses of the intelligence community in the 1950s and the 1960s, and Congress put some limitations in place. They said, we are going to have some procedures on how we gather foreign intelligence in the United States. 
   Now, think about this. 1978. 1978 was the year I graduated from high school. The telephone was on the wall in the kitchen and it had an extra long extension cord. The Internet was not a word in the dictionary. Cell phones were only on Star Trek, and the first personal computer, the first IBM personal computer was invented in 1982, so 4 years after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was put in place. 
   So the threat was different. We were looking at collecting foreign intelligence mostly on diplomats who were hiding as spies in embassies like the Soviet embassy here in Washington. So it was a more static enemy and more static communications. 
   In 1978, almost all long-haul communication went over the air; it was bounced off satellites. Almost all short-haul communication, local calls, were over a wire. When we wrote the law, or when the Congress wrote the law in 1978, it was technology specific. It said, you don't have to do anything special if you are just gathering signals over the air if it is a radio signal or satellite signal. You can tune it in on your tuner similar to your car radio. There is no special privacy protections there. But if you touch a wire, you have to do some special things. So it was technology specific. 
   Since 1978, we have gone through a revolution in communications technology so that now the situation is completely reversed. Now, almost all long-haul communications that would be of foreign intelligence interest are on a wire; and almost all, or a vast percentage, of short-haul communications are over the air. There are 230 million cell phone customers just in the United States. 
   This change in technology meant that the foreign intelligence surveillance law was getting more and more out of date, at the same time the threats to the United States were changing, requiring America to be more agile in its intelligence collection than we had to be when faced with the former Soviet Union and the Soviet threats. 
   I yield back to my colleague from Michigan.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. And one of the ironies here is that because of this law, if we're trying to listen to a foreigner in a foreign country, and we take tremendous risks with our members of the intelligence community and collect that communication overseas, maybe at high risk, may not work, and we collect that communication overseas, you don't have to ask permission from anybody in the American judiciary. You're out there trying to do your job as a military officer or a civilian in the intelligence agencies, trying to steal secrets, listen to communications overseas. 
   But America dominates telecommunications. It used to be that if somebody from northern Spain was calling southern Spain, the route of that communication went directly from northern Spain to southern Spain. Now, because of global telecommunications networks, that call will go on the least restrictive, fastest path. And these efficiencies are running all of the time, and that call from northern Spain to southern Spain could route all the way around the world, through the United States, through whatever the system figures is the best, fastest path. So we may have situations where somebody in a foreign country is talking to somebody else in the same foreign country, and the communication might be routed through the United States. 
   And yet just because you touch, when you touch a wire in the United States, under the old law, you had to get a warrant from a court, even if you're listening to a foreigner in a foreign country, even if there are U.S. military forces in that country hunting down insurgents who are trying to kill Americans. It just doesn't make any sense at all. 
   And as one military officer said recently in Iraq, this doesn't make any sense. If I see an insurgent on the telephone, I can shoot him, but I can't listen to him. That was the problem with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that we sought to get fixed.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. The other irony of this is that it depended on what technology they were using to talk to each other. If the terrorists or insurgents trying to kill your military unit in the mountains of Afghanistan were using push-to-talk radios, you could listen to them. But if they were on a wire line phone and you were listening, trying to tap into that communication, if it transited the United States, you needed a warrant from somebody in Washington, D.C. This makes no sense. And it was compromising our ability to protect this country, and it was putting our soldiers in danger overseas. 
   Now there's one provision I want to talk about because I think it is sometimes misrepresented and given as an excuse for not making any updates to the law, and that's the emergency provision in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. In the 1978 law, there was an emergency provision that said, in case of an emergency, the Attorney General can stand in the shoes of the FISA Court and can approve wiretapping in the United States, and then get 72 hours to go in front of the court and make their case and get the warrant. The problem is that the Attorney General really does stand in the shoes of the court. 
   The Director of National Intelligence has testified in open session that an average FISA warrant takes 200 man-hours to complete the packet, which is about two or three inches thick, to show probable cause in order to get a warrant. But it's worse than that. If we're talking in the United States, there are things that you can do. If I think that my colleague from Michigan is affiliated with a terrorist organization, the FBI can go out and talk to his neighbors. We can show what kind of affiliations he has with others, who he's communicating with us and so on. 
   But if you're on the Horn of Africa and you think a particular guy is affiliated with al Qaeda, it's not as though you have a lot of resources there to build your case for probable cause to satisfy some judge in Washington, D.C. And so the standard was not even being met in some cases where we had very good reason to believe that someone was affiliated with a terrorist organization. But everybody, all our analysts are back here, with the limited number of analysts we have with expertise in particular terrorist cells, trying to develop cases to convince judges to allow wiretaps on foreigners in foreign countries simply because the point of access to the communication was in the United States.  
   And the emergency provision really requires the Attorney General to stand in the shoes of the judge. He has to certify that the probable cause standard is met, that it's all the work to get to that probable cause standard that takes the time in the first place. And in the real world the time has taken too long in cases of real emergencies.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. And some of my colleagues have said, well, you know, there are some commonsense cases, I mean, where you should just, you know, we're all reasonable people here. There's some commonsense situations where if you've got insurgents who've captured American soldiers, gee, start listening to their communications and we'll take care of the paper work later. That's a felony under the old foreign intelligence surveillance law. So who in a bureaucracy is willing to commit a felony on the hope that some judge will give them mercy? And I look at this and I think, this is nuts. It is the United States Congress' responsibility to make sure we have the laws in place so that the people who are trying to protect us can prevent the next terrorist attack. We shouldn't have lawyers in Washington going in front of judges or making late-night calls to the Attorney General with somebody overseas on the line trying to explain why Abu terrorist really is an agent of a foreign power.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. There is no common sense exception. And there is no start listening now and then do all the paperwork later. The paperwork has to be done before the Attorney General says, okay, go ahead; put the alligator clips on the wire. Then all that's left is to get the judge's signature on all of that close-to-200 man-hours on average of paperwork. 
   So what we did, and what we, and I actually think this year the problem got worse. It got worse for a couple of reasons. One of them was that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court kept looking at more and more issues, and they found that their court was becoming clogged with huge requests for foreigners, for people who are in foreign countries talking to other people in foreign countries. That is not what this law was for. This law needed to be revised to take it back to its original intent, which was to protect the civil liberties of people in the United States. There are no fourth amendment protections under the Constitution of somebody who's not in the United States, not even related in any way to the United States. That's been long established in law and policy. So why are we wasting all this time with lawyers in Washington getting warrants for foreigners in foreign countries just because they happen to be talking on a wire that transits the United States?

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. In fact, they are much more explicit than they are in criminal law. Think about this. If the FBI thinks that somebody is running a drug cartel and they have got a wiretap on that person, that person may be calling some of his criminal associates, but he also bumps into hundreds of people who are completely innocent. He calls his kid's teacher at school. He may call a cousin. He may talk to his barber. All those people are innocent. You don't have to go out and get warrants on the innocent people. So, yes, wiretaps bump into innocent people. Intelligence agencies bump into innocent Americans overseas. 
   I was stationed in Vienna briefly when I was an Air Force captain, and one of my jobs was doing negotiations with the Soviets at the time. We all knew who the guy in the Soviet delegation who was the KGB guy. He came to my apartment for a reception with all the diplomatic corps. And if he had happened to communicate back to Moscow and we were listening in on that conversation and he reported on Captain Wilson and what she was like and whether she would like champagne and strawberries or what she talked about and the American intelligence agencies bumped into that, they would have minimized my participation. If it had no intelligence value, it was completely destroyed. But if it had some, with respect to this KGB guy, they would minimize it. They would hide my identity in a way that they are required to do both by statute and by regulation. And that is a long-established practice in foreign intelligence

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. One of the ironies here is that some of our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee who were worried about this new law said well, can you tell us how often you collect information that is to, from, or about Americans in the normal intelligence collection? Well, that would require the intelligence agencies to go back and mine their databases, much of which, frankly, is not even touched and actually probably violate the privacy of Americans in ways that they do not now do so in order to make a report to the Congress about collection of information that happened to be incidentally about Americans. If the North Koreans called the, pick one, Iranians and are talking about one of our colleagues in the Congress, that's a conversation about an American.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. But if the gentleman will yield, it's even worse than that. If the limitation in law said you can only listen to foreign-to-foreign communications and I am trying to listen to your cell phone, how do I know who you are going to call next before you call me? So if you are a foreigner and you call another foreigner, that's fine. But if you call into the United States, I have committed a felony because you just called the United States. 
   You cannot possibly technically, with very rare exceptions, be able to screen out all communications that a foreign target might do calling into the United States before the communication takes place.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. But to me it's even worse than that that my colleague from Connecticut mentions, because somebody who is a criminal in the United States has rights under our Constitution; a terrorist outside of the United States does not. They have no protections under the first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights, and those things. We seek to steal secrets from people who are trying to kill us. We seek to listen to the radio communications of our enemies on the battlefield, and yet if those enemies are now using a phone, a communication on a wire to the United States, we are tying ourselves up in court in Washington, D.C. while they are killing our people. It sets a standard which is completely unreasonable. 
   Now, the Director of National Intelligence came to us in April of this year and said, I have a problem, a very serious problem. We are starting to go deaf because the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has not been updated. He testified in open session last week about the Protect America Act, which must be made permanent. This fix to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act we passed in August and the President has signed. And he said unless we make this law permanent, we will lose between one-half and two-thirds of our intelligence against the terrorist target. Let me say that again. Unless we make this act permanent, we will lose between one-half and two-thirds of our intelligence on the terrorist target. 
   Think about that. Are you willing to say two of three conversations from terrorists trying to kill us, that it is okay not to listen to them, it is okay that we go deaf with respect to protecting this country against terrorists? I am not. I believe it's possible to protect the civil liberties of Americans and focus our resources there with respect to the courts while listening to people who are reasonably believed to be in foreign countries who are not Americans, and that is what the Protect America Act did.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, in January of this year, I introduced the companion to the Senate measure that we're considering today, and I wanted to thank both my colleagues from New Mexico, Mr. Pearce and Mr. Udall, for their support of that legislation. 
   I'm very happy today that the House is taking up the Senate version of this bill, which is supported both by Senator Bingaman and by Senator Domenici. I am also very pleased that the governor of New Mexico, Governor Richardson, and a wide variety of veterans' organizations in New Mexico, have supported this legislation. 
   Jerry Murphy passed away on April of this year, on Good Friday. He was a hero in Korea, as my colleagues have pointed out, but it's the way he chose to spend the rest of his life that makes him so special to New Mexico's veterans. He was a Second Lieutenant in the Marine Corps Reserves. He volunteered to go into the Marine Corps when it looked as though he was going to be drafted and sent to Korea in the Army and he thought the Marine Corps might suit him better. In 1952, he commanded an infantry platoon in the Fifth Marines in Seoul, Korea, and was a recipient of the Silver Star. 
   In February of 1953, he positioned his unit about the Imjin River facing the Chinese Communist troops. Their job was to continually push the Chinese lines to keep them from getting too dug in. He was commanding the reserve platoon, and as the battle went on and he sensed that the operation was not being executed as planned because there were no wounded coming back to the lines, he decided he had to go forward and find out what was going on. When he took his platoon forward, he found that all the officers and the noncommissioned officers of the two assault platoons were dead or wounded, and there was mass confusion among the troops. 
   He very quickly took command, and in the midst of machine gun fire, he ordered his men to find their comrades and evacuate the area. He made several trips in the midst of heavy gunfire to rescue casualties. At one point, he was helping to lift a stretcher and he was hit in the back by the fragments of an enemy grenade. He refused medical attention and continued to lead his men to rescue their wounded comrades. 
   As he continued to command his reserves, he came face to face with two Chinese soldiers, and he killed them both. The Chinese entered the trenches as the last American wounded troops were being evacuated. Jerry Murphy picked up an automatic rifle and held off the Chinese Communist forces until all of the marines were safe. 
   He then went and counted all his marines. He noticed he had a handful still missing, and he went back to the top of the hill with a search team. He located the bodies of a machine gun crew and took them down the hill.     
   At this point, he was wounded a second time. He again refused medical treatment until all his men had preceded him into the main line. He eventually received treatment and returned to America. 
   In October, 1953, when he was in graduate school, Jerry Murphy was awarded the Medal of Honor. It was presented to him by President Eisenhower on October 27, 1953. 
   For more than 20 years after Jerry Murphy left the service, he dedicated his life to serving New Mexico veterans. He served at the VA hospital as Director for Veterans Services. For 23 years, he provided lots of support to all kinds of veterans in New Mexico. The neat thing is that even after he retired from the VA, he continued to volunteer at the VA hospital. 
   One of the VA hospital employees once told me that Jerry Murphy was a volunteer; he had his turquoise smock on, and he would push veterans to and from their appointments at the VA hospital. The veterans had no idea who it was that was pushing them around in their wheelchairs. He was always a humble servant. That is the kind of man he was: A quiet, humble servant, soft-spoken, a modest man who was concerned with his fellow soldiers. His humility really never ended. You know, if you think about this guy, he was a Marine, a Medal of Honor winner, and he chose to be put to rest wearing his VA volunteer smock. He will be missed by his family and his wife, Mary Ann. 
   I want to commend Senators DOMENICI and BINGAMAN for sponsoring this legislation and ushering it through the  Senate; my colleagues, Mr. Pearce and Mr. Udall, for cosponsoring the House version of the bill; Secretary John Garcia of New Mexico for first suggesting to all of us that it might be appropriate to name the VA medical center after Jerry; the chairman and ranking member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Mr. Buyer and Mr. Filner, for their leadership and willingness to bring this legislation forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, if the previous question is defeated today, we will offer an immediate amendment to reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   The reform is very, very simple. It doesn't affect most programs, but all it does is say that you do not need a warrant to listen to foreign communications by foreigners who are in foreign countries. That is all it says. But it is critical that we make this change, and it is critical that we make this change immediately. 
   I would say to my colleagues and to those Members of congressional staffs who are monitoring the proceedings on the floor here today, I have served in this Congress for 9 years. I served as a United States Air Force officer for 7 years and on the national security staff at the White House for 2. In my 9 years in the Congress, I have never been more concerned about Congress's failure to act than I am today. 
   This is absolutely critical to the country to fix, and the only people that can fix it are Members of the United States Congress. We cannot work around this law. We have to fix this law, and it is squarely in our laps to fix it. 
   The leadership on both sides of the aisle and the Committee on Intelligence on both sides of the aisle have been briefed in detail about the problems our intelligence community is facing, that we have blinded them and forced them to stick their fingers in their ears because of anomalies in technology that have changed faster than we have been willing to change  the law. And every one of us knows that it has already imperiled American lives. And yet this House sits here and does nothing, absolutely nothing, when we know that lives are at risk. We must allow our intelligence agencies to monitor terrorist communications without a warrant in the United States when they are listening to foreign communications. 
   How the heck did we get ourselves in this place in the first place? In 1978, almost all long-haul communications were over the air, and for foreign intelligence collection, you didn't need a warrant; almost all short-haul communications, local calls, were over a wire, and you did. 
   Now, because the technology has changed, the situation is completely reversed. Almost all local calls are over the air. There are 230 million cell phones in this country. But that is not where the foreign intelligence is. Now almost all long-haul communications are over a wire, and we are forcing our intelligence agencies to go to judges to get probable cause on some terrorist who is overseas communicating with another terrorist overseas just because the point of the wiretap is in the United States. This is stupid and it is imperiling American lives. 
   The danger is very serious. The Director of National Intelligence, Mr. McConnell, testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee recently that ``We are actually missing a significant portion of what we should be getting.'' 
   We all remember where we were the morning of 9/11. We remember whom we were with, what we were wearing, what we had for breakfast. But I wager nobody in this room remembers where they were when the British Government arrested 16 terrorists who were within 48 hours of walking onto airliners at Heathrow and blowing them up over the Atlantic. That happened a year ago in August. Within 48 hours, they were within 48 hours, and the tragedy would have been greater than on 9/11. It didn't happen and you don't remember it because American, British, and Pakistani intelligence detected the plot before it was carried out. 
   I have pleaded with my colleagues on the Intelligence Committee and with the leadership on both sides of the aisle in this House, and I pray to God that we will not need another 9/11 Commission after another national tragedy and they will be looking back and saying, Why didn't the Congress do something? They knew and they failed to act. 
   Today you have an opportunity to insist that this body act because we do know we are failing to protect this country. 
   I would urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and to immediately consider amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. I want to make sure I understand something here, because I think you said something that's important. If the United States Government inadvertently collects a phone call that involves an American, if Osama bin Laden himself calls into the United States on a new phone line, and we had no idea, we didn't expect him to call in to America, and he has got a new phone number, he has got one of those disposable phones, he calls in and we get lucky and we pick it up, and that phone call says to one of his cells in the United States, ``Tomorrow is the day. Blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago,'' is it my understanding that under this bill they have put forward the intelligence agents couldn't even tell law enforcement about that? They would be prohibited from that?

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. I thank the gentleman for clarifying that, because I think it's an important provision, and I think it is being added into what is being called the RESTORE Act very late in the game before it was pulled from the House floor last week. It is a provision that is deadly dangerous to the security of this country. 
   The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was set up to protect the civil liberties of Americans, and it has done that effectively. But because of changes in technology over the last decade in particular, there are more and more conversations that are foreign conversations, international conversations that happen to transit the United States. Under the old law, before we fixed this in early August, you needed a warrant to touch a wire inside the United States even if the person you are targeting is overseas. 
   Earlier this year, because of some court decisions, this became completely unmanageable, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court became almost completely nonfunctional, with backlogs, with requests for warrants, people who couldn't develop probable cause, because, you think about this, you have got some guy on the Horn of Africa that you suspect of being affiliated with al Qaeda. It's not as if the FBI can go and talk to their neighbors and develop probable cause for a warrant in order to touch a wire in the United States, and yet our intelligence capability is much enhanced if we can touch that wire in the United States.     
   So you have an odd situation where we're having intelligence agents take tremendous risks to try to collect intelligence overseas, while we're tying our own hands here in the United States. The law that we passed in early August addresses this problem. 
   The act that was pulled from the floor, so-called RESTORE Act, last week would only have restored the ability of terrorists to plot to kill Americans. It would be suicide for the  United States to intentionally, intentionally cut off our ability to try to listen to the communications of the terrorists who are trying to kill Americans or anybody else. 
   I would be happy to yield to my colleague from New York.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. If the gentleman would yield, the issue of foreign-to-foreign communications is in the bill. But here's the problem. We can put in law that you don't need a warrant to listen to foreign-to-foreign communications, but you're never targeting a communication between two points. You're always looking at one target. And if I am targeting you in Afghanistan, I don't know who you're going to pick up the phone and call next. If it is a felony to listen to a conversation between a foreigner and a U.S. person without a warrant, as soon as that foreigner picks up the phone and dials an American number, you've created a situation where an intelligence agent is a felon. As a result, if you have that provision in the bill, they must get warrants on every foreigner. And that is the situation we were in earlier this year that completely crippled our intelligence collection.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. One of the things my colleague from New York said was, well, there are these minimization procedures, and that's true. There are minimization procedures under current law, which means that if you gather information that involves innocent people, you mask their identity, you don't disseminate things that don't matter, and you protect people's privacy. If it only went that far, that would be fine. The problem is the rest of the paragraph that my colleague from California mentioned, which actually prohibits dissemination of information that could be critical to this country. 
   It is astounding to me that we might actually intercept a conversation involving Osama bin Laden himself that reveals where he is going to be tomorrow and we would prohibit our intelligence agencies from telling the military where he is so they could target him.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Absolute prohibition. 
   And I think we need to get back to some basics here, which is, number one, the current law requires that you need a warrant to wiretap a U.S. person for the purposes of collection of foreign intelligence. That's what the whole Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was about. But it also makes clear under the law that we passed in the  first week of August that you do not need a warrant to listen to foreigners reasonably believed to be in a foreign country. 
   America spies. We try to discover the secrets of people who are not our friends, some of whom are trying to kill large numbers of Americans. We do everything we can to find out what their plans and capabilities and intentions are so we can prevent another terrorist attack. That is what our intelligence community does. And to somehow tie this up in red tape with a bunch of lawyers and judges makes no sense to me at all when we are trying to find out the secrets they are desperately trying to protect from us. 
   I have to say, there is a question, how many lawyers should it take to be allowed to listen to Osama bin Laden? The answer should be zero. That's what the answer should be. We shouldn't involve lawyers and judges in trying to intercept his communications, even if he is talking to an American.

   We all remember where we were the morning of 9/11. We remember what we were wearing, what we had for breakfast, whom we were with, and that is seared into our memories. 
   Very few Americans remember where they were when the British Government arrested 16 people who were within 48 hours of walking onto airliners at Heathrow and blowing them up simultaneously over the Atlantic. We don't remember it because it didn't happen. And it didn't happen because American, British, and Pakistani intelligence were working together to disrupt the plot and prevent the terrorist attack. 
   That is what matters here. We want to stop those memories from being created before the event happens.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I want to bring to the attention of the House something that is being done in this bill that I think has received insufficient discussion and debate. 
   This Energy and Water appropriations bill includes in it the most radical shift in U.S. policy on nuclear weapons that I have seen at least since the mid-1990s, that will lead us either to be forced to return to nuclear testing or to abandon nuclear deterrence because we stop maintaining the stockpile. 
   Without any debate, we have made this drastic change in this bill that is devastating to American nuclear weapons capabilities and will significantly change our policy on nuclear weapons without any discussion at all of any substance. 
   In 1992, the United States stopped nuclear testing. In 1996 we joined the moratorium on nuclear testing and said we will continue to maintain the stockpile through something called science-based stockpile stewardship. It is kind of like if you had a car that was a 1980s car and you said okay, we are never going to turn the key, but every year through science and engineering we are going to be able to tell the President, if we turned the key we believe it would be safe, secure and reliable. 
   The car would go on. It won't be turned on unless we turn the key; and, Mr. President, we are confident of that.     
   This bill devastates that capability with respect to our nuclear weapons. It has a 20-percent reduction in 1 year in the engineering laboratory that is solely responsible for over 6,000 parts in our nuclear weapons. It has a 40-percent reduction at Los Alamos National Lab's nuclear weapons program. And 80 percent of the existing stockpile is designed by Los Alamos. They are responsible for being able to tell us if these weapons are safe, secure and reliable. 
   What does this mean? It means we will not be able to achieve the stockpile reductions we're trying to achieve because the labs will not have the sense of reliability of the stockpile. Your percentage of reliability determines how low you can bring the stockpile. 
   Second, we are increasing the likelihood of the need to go back to underground testing, because at some point in the future, the lab directors will not be able to certify the reliability of the stockpile. There will be a problem, as there is every year; and they won't have the tools to be able to assess that problem without nuclear testing. 
   And, third, you are undermining allied confidence in the American nuclear umbrella. Mr. Obey, my colleague, said they're devastating this program because there's been no strategy for post-Cold War nuclear weapons. That is a complete fallacy. It is rubbish. We signed the Moscow treaty to reduce the size of our deployed stockpile. We have gone to a policy of no underground testing. We have gone to a policy of science-based stockpile stewardship and the majority in this House is moving toward a nuclear freeze and unilateral disarmament without any debate whatsoever. 
   I would urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to remember only three things about this motion to recommit: 
   First, it happens immediately. This is ``forthwith'' so we can do this tonight. Don't send it back to committee. We can do it right now. 
   Second, it substitutes the Senate bill that is supported by 245 different organizations, including the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the American Psychological Association and numerous others. It's a bipartisan bill that passed unanimously in the United States Senate. It has the parity provisions very similar to the ones that Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ramstad have brought forward, but an important policy difference. The Ramstad-Kennedy bill does not require employers to cover mental health care. It says, if they do offer it, it must include every diagnosis in the DSM-IV manual, everything. No other, including the Federal employees health plan, goes that far. I think that the likely result of that will be what we all don't want to see, which is employers drop mental health coverage completely. That's why organizations like the National Alliance on Mental Illness support the Senate bill and not the House bill. They want to see an expansion of coverage for the mentally ill, not a loss of coverage for 18 million seriously ill Americans. 
   The third thing that I want you to remember is this: There's been a lot of discussion about the pay-for in the bill we're asked to vote on here on the floor tonight. This motion to recommit would defeat the provision that will close physician-owned hospitals, including a lot of them in rural areas of America as a different pay-for that extends a successful pilot project for electronic verification of assets for Medicaid eligibility. 
   So three things. We can do it tonight, it doesn't go back to committee. It is better policy which will extend greater coverage for those who are mentally ill. And the pay-for doesn't hurt our rural, physician-owned hospitals.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. I thank my colleague from Texas, and I also thank him for his leadership on this issue. It has been a tremendous help to this body to have people who have actually worked and tried to enact and implement the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to come and be able to explain why it doesn't work in the way it is intended to work in a time of terror. 
   I think it is important for people to understand, what is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and why do we  have it. In the 1950s and the 1960s, there were abuses by our intelligence agencies where they were wiretapping Americans without warrants. In fact, a friend of mine gave me a copy once of a declassified memorandum signed by Robert Kennedy and J. Edgar Hoover that authorized the wiretapping of Martin Luther King. So there were abuses in the 1950s and 1960s, and the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was put in place. The intention of it was to say if you want to collect foreign intelligence in the United States, and there are reasons to do so, you go to a special court called the FISA Court and get a warrant. 
   There are folks we suspect of being spies who are here in the United States, people working for the Soviet Union, at that time, or Cuba or China, and you want to be able to go to a court and get a warrant to listen to someone in the United States. And the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Court was set up for that purpose. But it was written in a way that was technology specific. 
   In 1978, that was the year I graduated from high school. The telephone was on the wall in the kitchen, and it still had a dialy-thing in the middle. It wasn't even a push-button phone at my house. The Internet didn't exist. Cell phones were Buck Rogers stuff. So the law was written in a technology-specific way that said over-the-air communications you can listen to, you don't need a warrant for that. And at the time, almost all international calls were over the air. They were bounced over a satellite. But to touch a wire in the United States, it is presumed to be a local call and you need a warrant. 
   Of course today, the situation is reversed. There are over 200 million cell phones in America, and all of that communication is bouncing over the air. But that is not what we need for foreign intelligence and to prevent another terrorist attack. 
   So, ironically, we now have a law written specific to 1978 technology which does not protect local calls and does protect international calls. Why, because today almost all international calls are over a wire or a fiberoptic cable. And because of the way that global telecommunications is now routed, telecommunications now follow the path of least resistance, and it is entirely probable that a phone call from northern Spain to southern Spain may transit the United States because that might be the path of least resistance. Likewise, a call from Afghanistan to Pakistan or a call from the Horn of Africa to Saudi Arabia may well transit the United States. But in order to listen to that communication, if you touch a wire in the United States, our courts were saying you have to have a warrant. 
   So we now have the situation that was building up last year where we had intelligence agencies trying to develop statements of probable cause to get a warrant to touch a wire in the United States to listen to foreigners in foreign countries principally for the issue of preventing terrorism because terrorists use commercial communications. And so we had this huge backlog of requests. And it is worse than just the time it takes to develop a case for probable cause or to go to the courts and the time it takes our experts to be able to take time away from actually listening to terrorists to explain to other lawyers and judges why they believe someone is affiliated with a terrorist group. Sometimes you can't meet that high standard of probable cause. 
   Think about this for a second. If we are trying to get a warrant on someone here in the United States because we believe they are involved with organized crime, you have all of law enforcement to go out and look at what they are doing and talk to their neighbors and so on. If you have someone who is a suspected terrorist living in the Horn of Africa, you can't send the FBI out to talk to their neighbors. Sometimes the probable cause standard is too high to meet; and as a result, by the middle of last year, we had lost two-thirds of our intelligence collection on terrorism. The law had to be changed. 
   In the first week of August we changed it with the Protect America Act. Eighteen days ago that act expired. Now, to their credit, they worked through the backlog in that 6 months and they were able to get collections started on that whole backlog of intelligence collection related to terrorism. Those won't expire for a year. But here's the problem. New tips come in every day. 
   I sometimes go out and visit our intelligence agencies in my role as the ranking member of the Technical and Tactical Intelligence Subcommittee. Sometimes the director of that particular agency will say, Congresswoman, I know you are here to get a briefing on such and such a program, but I want you to know the threats we are following today. This is who we are looking for today. This is the tip we got yesterday that we are trying to track down. We have 12 terrorists who transited Madrid who just finished training in Pakistan. We are trying to figure out where they are going. We think we know the throw-away cell phone numbers that they picked up in the rail station in Bonn. We need to listen to them to figure out their plans, capabilities, and intentions. Are they going to kill Americans tomorrow? 
   That's why this is so important. We have to match 
   the terrorists stride for stride, and we can't afford to have delays in intelligence collection when we are trying to prevent another terrorist attack.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. If the gentleman would yield, there are some fallacies about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that I think we need to put to rest. 
   One is there is an emergency provision, you can just listen to this stuff and go to the court 72 hours from now. You have an emergency provision. It is true there is an emergency provision, but you have to develop the whole case for probable cause and present it to the Attorney General who has to stand in the shoes of the judge. So you have to get all of the work done; you just don't have the final signoff for a judge. And the time problem occurs before you get to that point. It is to develop the whole case for probable cause. 
   I have seen one of these packets. It is sometimes close to 2 inches thick of paper that explains how you meet all of the requirements of the act. When it really matters, when we had three soldiers who were kidnapped in Iraq, it took over 24 hours to get an emergency warrant. 
   I don't know whether that would have saved our soldiers or not. We thought we had a tip on who it was that had kidnapped them. I don't know if it would have been fast enough even if we would have been able to turn it on immediately. But I know if they were my kids, a 24-hour delay is not good enough, and we should expect more from our Government.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. I thank my colleague. 
   In fact, one of the reasons that attorney generals and the Fraternal Order of Police are so strongly in support of this legislation is that they worry that what's happening to our telecommunication companies because of their cooperation with the government on terrorism will also extend and poison the relationship between law enforcement and our telephone companies. 
   There are at least 15 States where we have over 25 lawsuits, some of them against telephone companies that weren't even involved, and those who are involved can't defend themselves in civil court without revealing to the terrorists how we're collecting intelligence on them and compromising our national security. I'm convinced, having looked at this, that they actually have immunity. They just can't prove it. And it is up to this Congress to clarify that companies that cooperated with the U.S. Government in helping us prevent terrorism through electronic surveillance are immune from civil liability lawsuits. I think the law is clear. It's up to the Congress to step up and reaffirm it quite clearly. 
   My colleague from Georgia says, and he's right, that this is kind of a difficult-to-understand technical subject in some respects. But there are some things that aren't difficult to understand. I mean, we all remember where we were the morning of 9/11. We remember who we were with, what we had for breakfast, what we were wearing, who we called first to check to see if they were okay. 
   Very few Americans remember where they were in August of 2006 when the British government arrested 16 people who were within 48 hours of walking onto airliners at Heathrow and blowing them up simultaneously over the Atlantic. One of the terrorists that was involved intended to bring his wife and his 6-month-old baby with him so that they'd all die together. Comprehend that evil for a moment. You're willing to kill your own 6-month-old child in order to blow up an airliner. If that had happened, more people would have died that day than died on the morning of 9/11. But you don't remember it because it didn't happen. And it didn't happen because of cooperation between the British, American and Pakistani intelligence services. Forty-eight hours. They were within 48 hours. 
   How much time should we wait while lawyers gather in Washington to develop cases for probable cause to get a warrant on a foreigner in a foreign country? 
   I yield back to my colleague from Texas.

This is a bill that passed with 68 votes in the Senate. It's pending on the floor of this House. The liberal Democratic leadership who, to a person, opposed the Protect America Act in August is blocking the will of the majority of the House of Representatives that wants to protect this country. They're standing in the way of protecting this country and letting the majority work its will. 
   Why? Because they're concerned about lawsuits against telephone companies and the deep pockets of the telecommunications industry, with trial lawyers saying, hey, aren't you with us.

   But one of the points that hasn't been made is that the Senate bill that has passed, that's pending on this floor, actually has stronger civil liberties protections for Americans than in the original 1978 law. In fact, Admiral McConnell and Attorney General Mukasey said in a letter on the 22nd of February, ``We note that the privacy protections for Americans in the Senate bill exceed the protections contained in both the Protect America Act and the House bill.'' 
   So, in fact, one of the things that has changed under this new piece of Senate legislation is that if you are an American, wherever you are in the world, if you're known to be an American, you have the protections of the American Constitution. That's not the case under the 1978 FISA law. So, there is actually more civil liberties protections for Americans on the bill that is on the floor of the House than there is under existing statute. 
   And the second thing that I think is worth pointing out is that after 9/11 the President turned to his advisers and everyone in all the intelligence agencies and said, you know, what tools do we have? How can we prevent another terrorist attack? How can we find out what their plans and capabilities and intentions are? The fact is that the terrorist threat is much different than the threat that we faced in the height of the Cold War. I was an Air Force officer in Europe during the Cold War. And the Soviets were a very convenient enemy from an intelligence point of view. They had a very big footprint. We knew where they were. We knew what they had. They had exercises the same time every year out of the same barracks using the same radio frequencies. They would have been very difficult to defeat, but we knew where they were. 
   With the terrorist threat, the problem is completely reversed. If we can find them, we can stop them. The problem is finding them. And, in general, they are using commercial communications. So, instead of being one ugly monster in the forest where you know where they are like the Soviets were, it's more like a ``Where's Waldo'' problem. Can you find the person in the clutter of everything else? That puts the premium on good intelligence. 
   And particularly, in the case of terrorism, electronic surveillance has been one of our most important tools because they are hiding and using commercial communications. That has been one of our strongest tools in preventing terrorist attacks for the last 6 years. And I must say that I believe that the greatest accomplishment of the last 6 1/2 years has been what has not happened. We have not had another terrorist attack on our soil since the morning of 9/11. And they have tried. It has been good intelligence that has kept this country safe. And for the last 18 days, we have been building another intelligence gap, and this body must act to close it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I will be asking for a recorded vote on the previous question today, and the reason is that the House majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, has just announced that the House will not take up the electronic surveillance bill this week, further delaying any decisions in the closing of an important intelligence gap. We have now gone 18 days since the expiration of the Protect America Act. If the previous question is defeated, we will immediately bring up the Senate legislation to close that gap. 
   I also rise today to oppose this rule. I commend Mr. Ramstad and Mr. Kennedy for their work on mental health parity. In the past, I have been a cosponsor of their legislation. But I offered a substitute amendment in the Rules Committee last night which was not ruled in order. The alternative is supported by 285 organizations that support the Senate version of the mental health parity bill which passed the United States Senate unanimously in September. The differences are on policy, and my amendment was not made in order. Instead, we have the 50th closed rule of this Congress. No amendments. This floor can't stomach debate on policy issues, and I think that is a sad commentary on the way this House is being run. 
   This is a major bill, one of the most important, I think, we will consider this year. I believe very strongly that mental illness and a disease of the brain is a medical condition that should be treated as seriously as a disease of the heart or the liver or the lungs. 
   The amendment that I offered, the substitute, is a bipartisan compromise that was worked out in negotiations lasting over 2 years. It is supported by mental health providers, the mental health community, business and the insurance industry.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of passage of H.R. 5710, the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System Authorization Act, which will establish the Ute water pipeline. This bill authorizes construction of a pipeline from the Ute Reservoir that will carry water to several communities in Curry and Roosevelt counties. 
   Under the proposed bill, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is authorized to spend up to $327 million to assist the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority (ENMRWA) in the construction of the pipeline. The State of New Mexico and the ENMRWA, which represents communities in eastern New Mexico that will benefit from the pipeline, will contribute 25 percent of the cost of construction. ENMRWA will operate and maintain the pipeline. 
   Construction of this pipeline is essential as communities in eastern New Mexico try to meet future demand for water. It will provide a critical supply of water to growing communities and create certainty in these communities that safe, clean water will continue to be available long into the future. 
   The Ute Reservoir was built on the Canadian River in 1959 as a sustainable water supply for eastern New Mexico. It has been nearly 40 years since Congress authorized the study of a pipeline to transfer water to communities in eastern New Mexico, but only in the past few years have the affected New Mexico communities began planning for the pipeline. 
   Communities that will be served by the Ute pipeline include Grady, Clovis, Melrose, Texico, Portales and Elida, as well as Cannon Air Force Base. 
   I am a cosponsor of this important legislation and urge its swift passage.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill for FY 08. My amendment would devote $2 million dollars from the Department Administration General Operations Expenses Account, of the nearly $1.6 billion appropriated in this bill, to the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans. The intent of my amendment is that the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans would establish a commission to evaluate and make recommendations for improvements to the VA system so that it can better meet health care needs of women veterans. 
   In 1978, I purchased a one-way ticket to Colorado Springs, Colorado to enroll at the Air Force Academy. I was in the third class that accepted women into our service academies. I am the only woman veteran serving in the Congress. Women face different obstacles than men when trying to receive care from the VA. To start with, many women who have served in the military don't call themselves ``veterans'' and many women don't think of the VA as ``their'' system. 
   A larger number of women are serving in military and in the future we will see a higher number of women veterans. One in seven Americans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan is a woman. 
   My goal in proposing this amendment is to bring together a group of people who can truly devote the time and effort to study the needs and examine the challenges our women veterans face. They then can report to Congress their finding and recommendations so that we, as a body, can evaluate these findings and implement improvements and initiatives to ensure women receive the care they have earned. 
   I introduced legislation similar to my amendment, H.R. 2394, the Bipartisan Commission on Wounded Women Veterans. This amendment would fund the commission envisioned in H.R. 2394. 
   I am grateful to all who serve their nation and we as a Congress have a responsibility to ensure they receive the best possible care. In this war on terrorism, the greatest burdens have fallen on the shoulders of a relatively small number of Americans who have volunteered to take great risks on our behalf. Events over the last few years have made a new generation of Americans realize just how precious our freedoms really are. We owe our freedom fighters--past, present, and future--a debt of gratitude for their selflessness and sacrifice. I will continue to fight to ensure that our veterans get the benefits they were promised, the health care they deserve, and the recognition that our Nation owes them. 
   Thank you for the time and I ask for a yes vote on my amendment.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill this year. 
   My amendment would designate and devote $2 million from the Department of Administration general operations expenses account. This is a very large account. The President requested $1.4 billion for that account. This body is appropriating $1.6 billion for that account, and what it does is fence that money and say that $2 million of this must be devoted and appropriated to the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans. 
   The intent of this amendment is that the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans would undertake a special effort, through a task force or special commission, to study and make recommendations on the health care needs of women veterans. All of us are concerned about whether the veterans health care system is meeting the needs of this newest generation of veterans. But there is a special category of veterans that I think sometimes gets overlooked. 
   In 1978, I got a one-way ticket to Colorado Springs, Colorado, in the third class with women at the United States Air Force Academy. And I walked up a ramp, and over that ramp was a big sign in aluminum letters that said, ``Bring Me Men.'' That sign stayed there for 20 years after women were admitted to the Air Force Academy. It's gone now, but some of us as women veterans feel that maybe the VA hospitals have a similar sign over their doors, if not literally, then certainly figuratively. 
   I am the only woman veteran serving in the Congress. And women veterans face different obstacles than men and have different health care needs than men when they start to get care from the VA. To start with, many women don't even consider themselves or call themselves veterans, and they don't think of the VA as their system. 
   A larger number of women are serving in the military, and in the future we are going to see higher numbers of women veterans, and they will face different problems and challenges as they age. One in seven veterans of the current war on terrorism, one in seven Americans who are deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan is a woman, and yet the VA health care system is very oriented towards the health care needs of men. 
   Just let me give you one example. If you are a veteran and you go to the VA for a clinic on PTSD, if everyone else in that group is a guy, are you really getting the care that is appropriate to you? A lot of women veterans don't feel comfortable in those settings. They are not sure that the OB/GYN care is what  they need. If they face osteoporosis, they're not sure that the VA is where they should be. Or if they face problems with cancers particular to women, is the VA going to meet their needs? 
   My goal in proposing this amendment is to get the VA to bring together a group of people who can truly devote the time and effort needed to study the needs of women veterans and examine the care that is available to our women veterans and the challenges that we face so that they can report their findings to Congress and to the VA so that we as a body can evaluate and adjust the system so that all of our veterans get the care that they have earned. 
   I am very grateful, and I think all Americans are, to those who serve our Nation, and we have a responsibility to make sure that they receive the best possible care. The burdens of this war on terrorism has fallen on the shoulders of a relatively small number of Americans who have volunteered to take great risks on our behalf. We owe them, our veterans past, present and future, a debt of gratitude for their selflessness and for their service. We need to make sure that our veterans get the benefits they were promised, the health care they deserve, and the recognition that our Nation owes them. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, one of the most important laws that is preventing another terrorist attack in this country will expire on Friday. It expires on Friday. 
   My colleague from New York says, well, we just need to take enough time and be deliberative and so on. My colleague from New York didn't vote for the temporary fix that we passed in August. In fact, in an exchange with him that I remember so well, he questioned whether we should extend the constitutional protections of the fourth amendment to people who are foreigners in a foreign country talking to each other. 
   The temporary fix that we made in August needs to be made permanent, and we need to move forward with a permanent law that allows our intelligence agencies to listen to foreigners in foreign countries without a warrant while protecting the civil liberties of Americans. That's what we passed in August. That's what the Rockefeller-Bond bill does from the Senate, and they passed it last night. We passed a 6-month bill in August. We had 6 months to review this. And then when that deadline passed on the 1st of February, they said, well, just give us another 15 days. We gave them another 15 days and they said, well, we really haven't had the time to look at this paper. 
   You've had almost 7 months. The time is now to get serious about our national security and giving our intelligence agencies the tools they need to prevent the next terrorist attack. 
   The Senate passed the Rockefeller-Bond bill last night by a vote of 68-29. It makes permanent the authorities that we passed in August of last year to listen to foreigners in foreign countries without a warrant. We spy on our enemies. We try to find out what their plans are so that we can stop them from killing Americans. 
   That Rockefeller-Bond bill also provides protection from lawsuits for the American companies that stepped up to the plate when this country was in crisis. In good faith, those American companies partnered with the U.S. Government, under instructions from that government, from our own government, to move forward and to help us to prevent another terrorist attack. And, ironically, they cannot defend themselves against lawsuits because the government says to do so would violate state secrets. It would give away secrets to our enemies. So they're stuck in court not even being able to defend themselves. 
   The cooperation that is being protected here in the Rockefeller-Bond bill is long established in criminal law and should certainly extend to the national security realm. 
   Today, I circulated a letter from 21 bipartisan attorneys general supporting these lawsuit protection provisions. Our intelligence agencies and their partners in private industry need certainty, the telecommunications companies whom we depend upon to cooperate need certainty, and our intelligence agents need certainty that we're not going to keep operating our intelligence community on a month-to-month basis. 
   In August we closed an intelligence gap, a vital gap that has been now closed, and the changes that we made have already provided intelligence that the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Mike McConnell, has said  have helped us to disrupt terrorist attacks. 
   Intelligence is the first line of defense in protecting this country against terrorism. I would urge my colleagues to allow a vote today on the Rockefeller-Bond legislation, do not allow this bill to expire, and stand up and protect this country.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, the important thing about this resolution, to me, is that the Air Force and celebrating its anniversary is about the people who have served, those who've worn the uniform. 
   In 1916, at the age of 17, my grandfather lied about his age and joined the Royal Flying Corps. He flew DH-7s and DH-9s and did sub search in the Irish Sea during World War I. 
   And after the First World War, there weren't many jobs to be had, so he came to America in 1922 and became a barnstormer in the early days of civil aviation, really the heyday of civil aviation, as new airplanes, new records, new payloads for speed and distance were being set across America. 
   In World War II, he towed targets and ferried parts and developed a system to Medivac soldiers out of the China, Burma, India theater of operations. Then it was B-72s and B-25s, P-38s and Corsairs. 
   In 1943, as a boy of 13, my father started taking flying lessons, traded them for time as a line boy down at the airport. And after World War II, and before Korea, my dad joined the Army Air Corps, which while he was in service became the United States Air Force. He was a crew chief at Walker Field in Roswell, New Mexico, taking care of, I think, F-86s at that time, although the hot plane was the F-100. 
   He left the Air Force and came home to be a commercial pilot. He taught my mom to fly. And in our 2-bedroom house we had three kids, two dogs, a den that was full of airplane. 
   In 1976, when I was a junior in high school, I was in my mother's bedroom when there was a television story on her little black and white portable TV that said that the Air Force Academy was opening its doors to women. 
   Well, my grandfather had had two sons, five grandsons and me. I went to see him and told him I was thinking about maybe going to the Air Force Academy, and he said, well, I flew with some women in World War II and they were pretty good sticks, so I guess that'd be okay. 
   My grandfather started to fly shortly after the Wright brothers first took to the air, and he lived to see a man walk on the Moon. It has been a remarkable century of aviation, and the Air Force has been part of it. 
   Next year, after 33 years of service, active, Guard and Reserve, my husband will retire from the United States Air Force. 
   Generations have been inspired and protected by air warriors who broke the sound barrier, who tested rocket sleds, who trained as astronauts, who became aces and supported those who were, names we know like Billie Mitchell and Jimmy Doolittle, Lance Sijan, Hap Arnold, Bud Day, Clarence Kelly Johnson, and names we don't know of airmen and women called to serve and inspired by the thrill of flight.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. For those of you sitting in your offices tonight, and for those staff members who are watching this debate, I'd like you to listen real carefully to what I have to say because I think it's important, probably more important than many of the things that we do around here. 
   We are going to have a vote tonight on the previous question on this rule. And if the previous question is defeated, I will immediately bring to the floor an amendment that will update important elements of the foreign intelligence surveillance law. 
   On May 1, in an unclassified session in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Admiral Mike McConnell, who's the Director of National Intelligence, urged the Congress to modernize this law. And he said this: ``We are actually missing a significant portion of what we should be getting.'' 
   And today the Attorney General of the United States wrote to the Congress and said that merely adding resources will not solve the critical problem that we face. 
   We are providing protections to foreign targets overseas. The law in this country should not require a warrant to use our communications systems to protect this country, and the irony is that is exactly what we're doing. Terrorists who are trying to kill Americans are using our communications networks, and we are forcing our intelligence agency to jump through hoops and get warrants to listen to foreigners in foreign countries communicating with each other. 
   We must update this law to protect Americans. Intelligence is our first line of defense in the war on terrorism. The administration has told us it is critical. The Members, Democrat and Republican, in the intelligence committees know that I'm telling the truth, and the leadership, both Democrat and Republican, know the same thing. 
   I would urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question, to immediately change these laws, and to protect Americans from terrorist attack.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, I would like to tell you about one of my constituents.  Her name is Mary Padilla, and she runs Roadrunner Transmission in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She has five employees, and she has been in business for 7 years, and she provides health insurance for every one of those five employees. Mary tells me that if we raise the minimum wage, she is going to have a tough time continuing to provide health insurance for her employees, and she may have to make a choice that she doesn't want to make. 
   Mary is not alone. More than 3 million Americans have gotten new jobs in the last 36 months with small businesses. The toughest thing for a small business person to do is to make the payroll and provide health insurance. 
   This motion to recommit would add one provision into this bill on the minimum wage. It would say, if you are an employer who is providing health insurance for your employees, that benefit is worth more than the bump up in the minimum wage, and you would not have to comply with these new rules with respect to the minimum wage. It would stay where it is for your small business. 
   One of the biggest problems we face as a country is the uninsured population. In my State, about one in four people doesn't have health insurance. This provision would encourage more small and medium-sized businesses to provide health insurance for their employees. A paycheck matters, a paycheck that makes it through the whole week, but it also matters if you are a parent who has to worry every night whether the kids are going to get sick when you cannot pay for it, because you don't have insurance with your job. 
   I would encourage all of you to support the motion to recommit and support small business health insurance for every employee in America.

   This bill is also an example of the wisdom of the Constitution that was written so many years ago, and we would be well advised to respect the wisdom of that Constitution that separates the powers among the branches. 
   We need to understand our role here as a Congress. It is not to micromanage dwell times and to put limits on deployments so that the sergeants and the captains who are jumping through enough hoops as it is have one more set of hoops to jump through, courtesy of the United States Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for people to understand why we are here tonight. In April of this year, the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Mike McConnell, came to the Congress and said, we have a problem, and the only thing that can fix that problem is legislation. We have an intelligence gap. There are things that we should be listening to that we are missing. Over the intervening months, we came to discover that the gap was larger than any of us suspected. 
   FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, is frozen in time in 1978. While it has been updated since then in some respects, the basic structure of treating wire communications differently than over-the-air communications is still there. In 1978, the phone was on the wall in the kitchen, and blackberries grew on bushes. Technology has changed, and we have not kept pace by changing the law. 
   FISA was never intended to acquire warrants for foreigners in foreign countries just because the point of access was in the United States. And FISA court judges have told us and expressed frustration that they are spending so much of their time dealing with foreigners in foreign countries. We need to update this law. 
   The bill before us would continue to require warrants on people in the United States. Let me say that again. The bill before us would continue to require warrants on people in the United States. It would stop requiring warrants on people reasonably believed to be outside of the United States. 
   That is the problem. 
   There are procedures in the bill that must be reviewed by the FISA court for compliance with the law and reasonableness. It has a 180-sunset, which puts the obligation on us as a Congress to review the implementation of this law, to learn from that experience, to see if it works, and to monitor implementation. 
   Now, we do not all agree in this House. That is very natural for our self-governing Republic. But on the floor tonight and yesterday, there are some Members who have questioned the integrity and the independence of the Director of National Intelligence. He is a retired admiral of 40 years' service who has come back to take a job, at a considerable pay cut probably, to serve his country. And while it may not violate the rules of the House to question his integrity and his independence, those words do bring discredit to this House. 
   The bill we have before us tonight got 60 votes in the United States Senate, 16 from Democrats. The Director of National Intelligence has told us that it will close the gap that must be closed to give our intelligence community the tools they need to keep us safe. I would ask my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, today we will pass the Senate version of a bill to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Because I have been actively involved in the crafting of this legislation and the review of the FISA law over the last two years, I feel it is important to be very clear about our legislative intent on some key points. 
   The legislation is intended to make clear that our intelligence agencies do not need a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to target people for electronic surveillance who are reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States. 
   While the law prior to these amendments does not require warrants on communications between foreigners in foreign countries, because technology has changed, it is only in rare circumstances that our agencies can tell in advance that there is no chance that a target will not call a number in America. Because they can't tell in advance that the targeted communication is not to an American and there is no ``safe harbor'' in the current law, they are forced to get warrants to avoid potentially committing a crime. As a result, increasingly, our intelligence agencies have been forced to get warrants on foreign targets in foreign countries. The foreign intelligence surveillance court is increasingly spending time approving warrants on people who have no privacy rights under our Constitution in the first place. 
   Because of recent court decisions relying on the statute, this problem has become worse. This bill was intended to not require warrants if the target is reasonably believed to be located outside the United States even if the point of the intercept or the technology used to intercept the communication is inside the United States. What matters is the location of the person who is communicating, not the location of the communications device or the interception technology. 
   The bill is also intended to retain very important protections of American civil liberties. If the target of a collection is a person in the United States, the government must get a warrant to intercept the content of that communication, as required by current law. 
   There was some concern during work on the bill about ``reverse targeting''. In its simplest form, this could be ``targeting'' a foreign number frequently called by an American so that the government could collect the content of the American's conversation. It is our intention that this ``reverse targeting'' would be illegal under the statute. If the intent is to collect the content of communications of a U.S. person who has an expectation of privacy, a warrant is required, even if the number targeted for that collection is a foreign number. 
   With this new legislation, the role of the FISA Court is limited to reviewing the new procedures for collection, not approving individual warrants or micromanaging collection. The intention is to have the Court review the process, the protections of privacy and the audits in place to determine that they are satisfactory and in compliance with the law. The Court may also issue orders to assist the Government in obtaining compliance with lawful directives to provide assistance under the bill, and review challenges to the legality of such directives. 
   The legislation provides for compulsion certifications for telecommunications carriers. These compulsion certifications are intended to provide the same degree of legal protection as a FISA court order. 
   This is a narrowly crafted change to FISA that fixes an immediate problem. The bill contains a sunset and we must review how the law is being implemented during the early months to determine what, if any, other provisions need to be changed. 
   There are issues we must address when we reauthorize this legislation, including how the Congress should provide immunity, including retroactive immunity, for telecommunications carriers that are parties to lawsuits based on allegations that they assisted the government.

The negotiations are going on between the Democrat leadership and the conservative Democrats that want to pass a bipartisan Senate bill and have written a letter to your leadership about it. 
   We are now on day 25 when we have had the Protect America Act expire. All we need to do is to be able to listen to foreigners in foreign countries without a warrant. The Senate bill has unprecedented protections for Americans' civil liberties, more than are in the 1978 law that all of us in this House support. But, instead, the liberal Democratic leadership is blocking the will of the majority of this House. 
   It is time for Democrats to stand up to your own leadership and demand that the protection of this country is more important than special interest groups that have a hold on the Democratic leadership. 
   Security must come first.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. I thank my colleague from California. 
   This is something we've been trying to get addressed since April, since the Director of National Intelligence came to this Congress and said we need to fix the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. There are things we should be listening to that we are not listening to, that we are missing, and it is hurting the security of this country. It continues to imperil the security of this country, and it is only because we are now forcing the Democrats to deal with this publicly that we may be making progress on this issue. 
   I am disappointed, though, to hear some of my colleagues in this House suggest in these negotiations that we should have a judge overseeing foreign intelligence collection overseas that does not involve any Americans. That has never been the role of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The whole point in making these changes is to make sure that we don't have counterterrorism analysts who are very valuable, highly trained people, expert in languages in regions, in organizations, spending their time developing probable cause statements for foreigners in foreign countries who are communicating with other foreigners. There's absolutely no reason for any court to be involved in that kind of an effort. 
   Speed matters. It matters in a war on terrorism where terrorists are using our communications networks in order to try to kill us. It is vital, absolutely vital that we fix the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act before the House adjourns for the August recess.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, we now have 2 days left before the August break, and I would ask my colleagues to oppose the previous question on this conference report so that we may immediately address the problems in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   We have now reached a point where the majority is committed to bring legislation to the floor, and that is a very big step forward, and I regret that it has taken so much public pressure to get us to this point. I am actually a believer that intelligence matters are best dealt with quietly, but when quiet encouragement does not work and national security is at stake, we have an obligation to increase the public pressure in order to get a political decision to move and get things done when it is important to this country. 
   Now that that political decision has been made and the majority has said they will bring legislation to the floor, we need to make sure that that legislation fixes the problem. In other words, we have to get this right. It is critical to get this right. Several Democrat leaders have put forward some ideas, but there are two of them that don't make any sense to me.     
   They want, first, only temporary authority to listen to foreigners in foreign countries. And, second, they want to still be in a situation where you have to get a court order to approve eavesdropping on foreigners in foreign countries. 
   Let's look at that for a second. My colleagues want two things. They want only temporary authority to listen to foreigners in foreign countries. The war on terrorism is not a temporary thing, and spying is not new. As early as the invention of the telegraph and reading people's mail during World War I that was going back and forth to Europe, in World War II much of the war was won because we broke codes that the Germans and Japanese were using and listened to their communications. During the Cold War we listened to our enemies. We have a foreign intelligence apparatus, and we spy on our enemies. Foreign intelligence collection is not new, and it is not temporary. We need to fix this law and get it right now. 
   Secondly, several of my Democrat colleagues have put forward the idea that you should still need court approval to eavesdrop on foreigners in foreign countries. It takes about 200 man-hours to develop a probable cause statement, a packet to go to the court, it's about that thick, to get approval from a court to do a wiretap. 
   Now, these people who have to put these together are not clerks or even lawyers. They are experts in counterterrorism, and their time is much better spent tracking these people than putting together paperwork. 
   More importantly, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was never intended to put a U.S. judge in charge of deciding whether we can listen to foreigners in foreign countries. That is why we spy and what we do. We don't need judges to be considering those kinds of things. And the only reason they are is because technology has changed faster than the law. 
   FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was never intended to require warrants to listen to foreigners in foreign countries. In 1978, when the law was written, almost all long-haul communications were over the air. That's where international calls were. Almost all local calls were on a wire. When they wrote the act, they froze the law in time. They required a warrant for anything on a wire. And over-the-air communications didn't require a warrant at all because that's where we collect foreign intelligence. 
   In a bill that comes to this floor, we need to do two things. First, no warrant or court intervention should be required to listen to foreign terrorists in foreign countries. Speed matters. And, second, we must continue to require warrants to listen to people in the United States. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance law was intended to protect the civil liberties of Americans. It was intended, and has done actually a very good job at rolling back the abuses that the intelligence community was involved in in the 1950s and 1960s. 
   Let's get this court back to focusing what it was intended to do, which is to protect the civil liberties of Americans, and allow our intelligence community to do what they are intended to do, which is to keep this country safe and prevent the next terrorist attack.

   All of us remember where we were on the morning of 9/11, remember who we were with, what we were wearing, what we had for breakfast. 
   I would guess that nobody listening to me here today, or very few, remember where they were the day that the British Government arrested 16 people who were within 48 hours of walking on to airliners at Heathrow and blowing them up over the Atlantic. It was successful intelligence cooperation between the British, Pakistani and American Governments that prevented that  attack. And you don't remember it because it didn't happen. 
   Intelligence is the first line of defense in the war on terror, and we must fix this law and get it right.

<DOCNO>Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor here today, disappointed. Over the next few months, the United States will make some very important decisions, probably the most important national security decisions that we will make in this decade. These decisions are going to affect the size and the composition and the equipment of our military. It will impact our relationships with our allies, the perception of our enemies, and the stability of the Persian Gulf region. These are serious and difficult issues that demand thoughtful leadership and the careful exercise of our considerable responsibilities under the Constitution. 
   The resolution that we have before us today is not binding in a legal sense. We are not exercising any real power here. But I think it is worse than that. The words in these two brief sentences are vague enough to allow people with very different views on what we should do to feel satisfied whichever way they vote. The language in this resolution is clever, but this isn't a time for clever. Whether I support this resolution or oppose it, this body should say something, say something that matters about what our vital national interests are, about how we should pursue those interests, about what the risks are, what the trade-offs are and the potential consequences. We should say whether we intend to buy the bullets and the body armor for those who are about to deploy and take on the challenges that we face as a Nation. 
   With power comes responsibility. And rather than do the hard work of building a consensus here in the House and leading the way, it is easier to punt, to be vague and clever, to frame political issues rather than confront forthrightly the difficult problems that we face as a Nation. For that reason I believe this resolution represents a lost opportunity that we cannot afford to lose. 
   I believe that too often in the last 3 1/2 years our goals in Iraq have been described in the lofty and idealistic terms that go far beyond America's vital national interests. There has been a tendency to move beyond the hard-nosed and clear-eyed view of what America's national interests are in Iraq and we have come to emphasize the loftier dreams for the American people. 
   To be sure, I am glad that Saddam Hussein is dead and gone. And I hope that the Iraqi people seize this opportunity to create a unified state that respects minorities and has robust democratic institutions. But there is a difference between what we would wish for the Iraqi people and what is vital for America's national security. 
   In thinking about America's vital interests in Iraq, I think it really boils down to two things: First, Iraq must not become a safe haven for al Qaeda; and, second, Iraq must not be a source of instability in the region. These vital interests are actually quite narrow. Some might argue that they are too narrow. But they are most notable for what they do not include. Perhaps most significantly, I don't believe it is vital to America's national interests to stop all sectarian violence in Iraq. 
   We admire our military because they are forward leading and ``can do'' people. But in this instance we cannot do for the Iraqis what they will not do for themselves. 
   The President is sending an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq. The problem isn't the numbers. The problem is the mission and setting the conditions to be able to accomplish that mission. Some of these troops are going to Anbar, and I think that we do need to enforce our troops in the Sunni heartland to fight al Qaeda and to make it less likely that they will be welcomed there for the long term. But I am skeptical about the Baghdad mission. Operation Together Forward, the effort to secure Baghdad last year, failed. The idea was to clear, hold, and build; but the Iraqi units did not show up in enough numbers to be able to hold what America had cleared. In the early days of this surge in Baghdad, there are too many indications that this will be happening again. 
   The resolution we are considering this week contains only two thoughts. It is only two sentences long. First, that we oppose increasing troop levels in Iraq by 20,000. As I have said, I support increasing troops in Anbar, even though I am skeptical about the likelihood of success in Baghdad.     
   But the second thought is notable for what it omits. The resolution says that this House will fund our soldiers and our veterans if they are there now or if they have been there before. 
   This begs the most important question about our real power here in the Congress. What about the five brigades of young Americans who are now preparing their families and packing their gear to deploy? What about them? What are you saying to them? Will we buy body armor for them? Will we have armored Humvees for them? Will they have trucks to take them to their assigned place of action? Will they get the bullets and the night scopes and the sleeping bags and the chow? What about them? Will they get their combat pay? Will they get their family separation allowance? 
   I believe that the majority in this House and the sponsors of this resolution would support a clear statement that we will fund the troops and the mission they are being ordered to undertake. But, of course, perhaps half of the Democrats in the Congress, from the far left of America's political spectrum, want to stop the funding. 
   In this war on terrorism, the greatest burdens have fallen on the shoulders of the relatively small number of Americans who have volunteered to take great risks on our behalf. As leaders of this Nation, this House abdicates its responsibility if we fail to make clear to them that they will have the equipment they need to do the job and come  home again. The short two sentence resolution we will vote on here this week doesn't address any of these important issues. 
   If you are asking the wrong question, perhaps any answer will do. But we will vote anyway, and it will make headlines, and it will accomplish nothing of the hard work we have in front of us. What are our vital national interests in Iraq, and what is not vital? What strategies can we use to protect and promote those vital interests? What are the resources that are required to pursue those strategies? What are the risks and the costs and the choices we must make? Are there ways to mitigate those risks? 
   These are the important questions, and in the short two-sentence resolution, they remain unresolved, leaving the House with nothing very important to say about what matters to America and what we should do. 
   I have made my position clear in ways that this resolution fails to do. I will seek to provide leadership in this House to address these important questions, to influence this administration and to focus on what is vital to America. It is for these reasons that I must oppose the resolution in front of us today.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I was listening to this debate and my colleagues. I am a big believer in equal pay for equal work, particularly when it comes to women, because that determines what I get in my packet at the end of the week. 
   But I have to say, I don't like this bill. The reason is, I am sitting here thinking, if you can go back 20 years and say I was discriminated against 20 years ago, we are talking about my first job out of college, and how that may have been, or I am a former small business owner as well. There are folks that I probably don't even remember employing who could come back and start suing me for what I did in small business 20 years ago. I just don't think that's the right way to solve the problem. 
   I am strongly for equal pay for equal work and have fought for it and have given it to employees. I just don't think this is the way to do it, by retroactively allowing people to sue.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for yielding, and I thank him for being here tonight. 
   I would urge all of my colleagues to defeat the previous question on the rule here tonight. 
   We now have 4 legislative days before the Congress recesses in August. In the middle of April, the Director of National Intelligence wrote to this body with draft legislation saying we needed to change the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He wrote a letter to this Congress last week saying that there is an ``intelligence gap.'' We have an intelligence gap, and we need to fix it. He has proposed a much smaller piece of legislation which he sent to the Congress last Friday night, saying it is critical that we fix this problem before the House goes on recess for the month of August. 
   If the previous question is defeated, we will immediately bring legislation to the floor to solve this intelligence gap. 
   Technology has outstripped the law in the field of signals intelligence. We are now in the odd situation where we require our intelligence community to go to judges in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to get warrants on foreigners in foreign countries. This doesn't make any sense, and it wasn't what the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was set up to do. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was written in 1978 to protect the civil liberties of Americans. It wasn't intended to be a barrier for American intelligence to protect terrorists overseas who are plotting to kill us. But because of changes in technology, that is where we find ourselves today. 
   The Director of National Intelligence has told us the situation is critical, that we must fix this intelligence gap. And yet for over 3 months now, this Congress has done nothing. 
   We cannot afford to wait. We must act and fix the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act so that we do not require a warrant to listen to foreigners in foreign countries communicating with other foreigners and plotting to kill us. 
   Mr. Speaker, all of us remember where we were the morning of September 11. We remember whom we were with, what we were wearing, what we had for breakfast. None of us in this room, I would wager, remember where we were when the British Government arrested 16 people who were within 48 hours of walking onto airliners at Heathrow Airport and blowing them up over the Atlantic. The reason we don't remember it is because it didn't happen. It didn't happen because the British, American, and Pakistani intelligence services detected the plot before it was carried out. 
   Intelligence is the first line of defense in the war on terror, and our Director of National Intelligence has told us in black and white that we have an intelligence gap, that there are things we should be listening to that we are missing. 
   It is up to us in this House to act this week to close that intelligence gap and protect the country.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, that is the anomaly of the law. In 1978 your telephone was hooked to a wire on a kitchen wall. Blackberries grew on bushes, the Internet didn't exist, and almost all long-haul communications went over the air. They were bounced off satellites. And those are completely excluded from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act because we wanted to protect our ability to collect foreign intelligence, but you were required to have a warrant if you touched a wire in the United States. Almost all short-haul communications were over wires. 
   Now the situation is completely reversed. The majority of local calls now are over cell phones, 230 million cell phone users. They are all radio, or the equivalent. Almost all long-haul communications, international communications, are now over wires or over fiber-optic cables.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, that is the circumstance in which we find ourselves, and it is a tragic one because I  think people ignore problems until there is a crisis and then they say, Why didn't you do something? Why didn't you fix it when you knew there was a problem? 
   I pray that we will never have to have another 9/11 Commission. We passed a 9/11 Commission bill last week that had the remaining elements of pieces of legislation we have been working on for 5 years, and in it we didn't take care of the most pressing problem that is squarely in our lap, which is that we know that technology has outpaced the law. Now, there have been amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance law since 1978, but the basic structure of the law and the problem has not changed, which is if you touch a wire in the United States, you have got to get a warrant. That is the irony here. 
   We are taking tremendous risks overseas to keep this country safe and to spy on our enemies. But we are tying our hands when we own the infrastructure. They are using the communications systems that we built, as the greatest country in the world, to plot and plan and target to kill us, and this body will do nothing about it. 
   We have 4 days, 4 days, until we are out of town for another month, another month being deaf and blind in a time of heightened threat. 
   I would ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question on the rule, to vote ``no'' on the previous question on the rule, and to immediately take up this critical piece of legislation so that we can protect this country

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from California has said that we are trying to work  something out on FISA, and the majority has been trying to engage the minority on FISA and it is really too bad we won't participate. 
   I have to tell my colleague from California that I am the ranking member on the Technical and Tactical Intelligence Subcommittee, and I have been invited to no meetings. The ranking member of the entire House Committee on Intelligence has been invited to no meetings. And the reason is that there has been no motion to go to conference on the FISA bill, and there is a difference within the Democratic Caucus. You can't even come talk to us until you resolve your own problems internally, because the reality is that a majority of this body, Democrats and Republicans, want to immediately take up this bill that will close the gap in our intelligence collection that has existed now for 11 days. 
   The rule that we are being asked to consider today actually tables the FISA legislation. And if the rule is defeated, we will immediately bring up the Senate bill that closes this critical intelligence gap. 
   You don't have to believe me. Senator Rockefeller, on the floor of the United States Senate 12 days ago, said, ``People have to understand around here that the quality of intelligence we are going to be receiving is going to be degraded. Is going to be degraded. It's already going to be degraded.'' 
   The Senate bill will reestablish the procedures that we set up in August to listen to foreigners in foreign countries without a warrant, to require warrants for Americans, and put in place stronger civil liberty protections than we had in the base bill that has been in existence since 1978, and will provide liability protection for our partners in this effort and tools to compel assistance similar to those that are under the criminal wiretap procedures. 
   Americans need to understand that the Senate has passed a bill to close this intelligence gap. That bill could be passed on the floor of this House today and the President would sign it. We are operating today under outdated procedures that are delaying our ability to listen rapidly to new tips that come in today. 
   I have been out to our intelligence agencies, and sometimes they start out by saying, Congresswoman, I know you are here to look at a particular program, but I want you to look at what we are tracking today. This is what we are trying to find out today. Here are the five people we are worried about most today. Here are the terrorists that we think are transiting Madrid. They have just come from Pakistan. We don't know where they are going and what they are planning. 
   We are trying to disrupt and stop terrorist attacks every single day in this country, and the minority, the Democrat liberal leadership of this House, refuses to bring to the floor of this House a bill that will close that gap, and you are compromising the security of this country by doing so. I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, the Democrat leadership has blocked several important amendments on this bill, and I will oppose this rule. But there is one that they block that makes absolutely no sense, and it really calls into question the priorities of the majority on the Rules Committee. 
   There are 2 million women in this country's history who have served in uniform. All of them have been volunteers, and I was one of them. I am the only woman veteran serving in the United States Congress. 
   One in seven Americans serving in Iraq or Afghanistan are women, and the challenges that they face when they come home are often different than their male counterparts, particularly when accessing health care from both DOD facilities and VA facilities. Many women veterans don't even call themselves veterans and don't know that they are eligible for care, and care is not always available that is appropriate for women in the VA system. 
   I offered an amendment that was noncontroversial, and it wasn't even particularly aggressive. All it said was that we should have a bipartisan commission to make some recommendations to us to get a group of people together, including women veterans, to make recommendations to this House on how we can make this system better for women veterans so they can get the health care that they need, and all of us have seen the problems that women veterans are facing. 
   The amendment wasn't made in order. 
   Now, I know, like everyone else, that time on the floor is limited, and we can't do everything. But I would note that an amendment was made in order for a study in Ms. Slaughter's district, the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, for a plan for Niagara Air Reserve Base in her district. So we have got time on the floor to have an amendment for a study for Ms. Slaughter, but 2 million women veterans don't count as much. 
   So I would ask my colleague here from Florida, who is here defending the decision of the Rules Committee, why did you, in your committee, think it was more important to allow an amendment for a study of Niagara Air Reserve Base in Ms. Slaughter's district and to turn your back on 2 million women veterans? 
   I yield 30 seconds to get an answer from the Rules Committee. Why is the Niagara Air Reserve Base study more important than helping 2 million women veterans get their health care? You didn't rule my amendment in order. What's your excuse?

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California. I very much appreciate his hosting this Special Order this evening. 
   Mr. Speaker, before the August break we fixed a problem. It was a problem that grew worse over the course of this year in that we were increasingly hampered in our ability to prevent another terrorist attack on this country because of the change in telecommunications and a law that was woefully outdated. 
   It's called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It was put in place in 1978 to protect the civil liberties of Americans. Think about it. 1978 was the year that I graduated from high school. The telephone hung on the wall in the kitchen. Cell phones had not been invented. The word ``Internet'' did not even exist. Technology has changed since 1978, and the law had not kept pace. 
   In 1978, almost all long-haul communications went over the air. Almost all international communications went over the air, and they were explicitly exempted from the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Our intelligence community folks would go ahead and collect those communications if they had foreign intelligence value. They minimized or suppressed any involvement of Americans who were innocent and just happened to be referred to in a conversation or  something. But there were no restrictions on foreign intelligence collection. 
   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, technology has now changed, and what used to be over the air is now almost all on a wire. The courts have found that under the old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, before we changed it in August of this year, that if you touched a wire in the United States, even if you were targeting a foreign terrorist talking to another foreign terrorist who had no connection to the United States at all, then you needed a warrant. This began very rapidly to cripple our intelligence capability with respect to terrorism in particular. 
   The Director for National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell, has testified in open session that without the changes, without keeping the changes, making them permanent, that we put in place in August, we will lose between one-half and two-thirds of our intelligence collection on terrorism. Think about this for a second. 
   Now we all remember where we were on the morning of September 11, remember who we were with, what we were wearing, what we had for breakfast. Most Americans don't remember where they were when the British Government 
   arrested 16 people who were within 48 hours of walking onto airliners at Heathrow Airport and blowing them up simultaneously over the Atlantic. They don't remember it because it didn't happen. 
   The American people want us to prevent the next terrorist attack. They don't want to have to remember where they were when a preventable disaster happened. That is what intelligence gives us, and that is why the Protect America Act is so important and why we have to make it permanent. 
   Sadly, the Democratic majority is going to bring a bill to the House this week which will gut the progress that we made in early August. They say things in this bill that, on its face, initially you think, well, that makes sense. One of them is you would not need a warrant for any foreign-to-foreign communication. 
   Well, doesn't that solve the problem? Wait a second. If Mr. Lungren, my colleague from California, was a foreign terrorist, just for the purposes of discussion, how do I know who he is going to call next? I don't. And if the law says that it is a felony to listen to the conversation of someone who is a foreigner calling into the United States, that means as soon as I collect that conversation, as soon as that terrorist makes a phone call into the United States, I become a felon. As a result, you have to have warrants on everyone. 
   It doesn't relieve the system of this huge legal bureaucracy. It means they have to get warrants on every foreigner in foreign countries, even if they are only talking to foreigners, because they might some day pick up the phone and call an American. And, oh, by the way, that is the conversation we want to be listening to. If we have a terrorist affiliated with al Qaeda calling into the United States, you bet we should be on that conversation. We should be all over that like white on rice. We shouldn't be waiting to get a warrant from a judge in Washington, D.C. 
   But it gets worse than that. They also put in this bill some things called blanket warrants.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. If the gentleman would yield further, that is exactly right. There is already a provision in the law and was in 1978 that if it was foreign-to-foreign communication, you didn't need a warrant. 
   There are some circumstances where you are tapping into a line that is between a command headquarters of the former Soviet Army and one of their missile silos where it is a dedicated line. But modern telecommunications don't operate that way, and the terrorists who are trying to kill us are using modern commercial telecommunications. They are not using dedicated lines between headquarters. They don't even have headquarters.

Stay away from the Sears Tower tomorrow.'' Whoever in the intelligence community gets that communication is barred by law from giving it to anyone who can take any action to prevent a terrorist attack on this country.

   But the threat is immediate. We cannot have our intelligence agencies tied up in legal redtape when they are the first line of defense for this country in the war on terrorism. 
   I am appalled that we have people in this body who put forward legislation who seem to be more concerned about protecting the civil liberties of terrorists overseas than they are about protecting Americans here at home and preventing the next terrorist attack.  
   This would be an unprecedented extension of judicial oversight into foreign intelligence operations. We don't even do this in criminal cases, and my colleague is much more experienced in criminal law than I am.

   There are some in this body who may believe we shouldn't have intelligence services. I believe it was Hoover who said that gentlemen shouldn't read each other's mail. Well, we are not dealing with gentlemen here. We are dealing with terrorists who are trying to kill Americans and are using commercial communications to talk to each other. We must do everything we can to prevent that terrorist attack, and that means listening to their conversations if we get an opportunity to do so.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. I don't think anybody believes that the threat of Islamic terrorism to the United States, or other foreign threats, are somehow going to go away in the next 18 months. That is just not going to happen. What is even worse about this bill, while they set up some system of blanket warrants with respect to some national security matters, they do not allow any so-called blanket warrants for things that are outside of direct threats to the United States, which is unprecedented in foreign intelligence collection. 
   That means if we are trying to listen to Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, or we are trying to figure out whether the leader of Sudan is about to launch another wave of genocide in Darfur, or we want to listen in to what the Chinese or the North Koreans are talking to each other about with respect to the Six-Party Talks and the potential for weapons of mass destruction on the Korean Peninsula, we are absolutely prohibited from listening to those conversations without a warrant from a court in the United States of America. The courts have never been involved in that way. Never in the history of this country, nor should they be. Foreign intelligence collection of foreigners in foreign countries has never been subject to warrants here in the United States.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. There is historical precedent for this, one of a Pakistani who ran a criminal enterprise, an international network that was selling nuclear materials and the capability to build nuclear weapons to people and countries around the world. While he was Pakistani by nationality and had helped with the Pakistan Government's weapons program, there was no question that he wasn't acting as an agent of Pakistan, at least I don't think there was. He was running a criminal enterprise for money, and we should be able to listen in and track people like that. 
   Likewise, I think our foreign intelligence should be able to listen to narco-rings in Burma and be able to detect whether there are cocaine smugglers who are trying to ship drugs into the United States. 
   These are all foreigners who are doing things that we do not like that are not in our interests and our intelligence capabilities should be used to disrupt those things. This law would shut that down. Shut it down. And Admiral McConnell has been very clear on that.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. That is exactly how this law works. If the target is an American, you need a warrant. If the target is a foreigner, you don't need a warrant; foreigner in a foreign country. 
   I think one of the things that is important to remember here, something that has been the greatest accomplishment in the last 6 years in this country has been what has not happened. We have not had another terrorist attack on our soil. And it is not because they haven't tried. 
   Osama bin Laden and al-Zawahiri have been very clear: they want to kill millions of Americans, and they will do it if they can. 
   The question is whether we will use the tools at our disposal, entirely constitutional and legal tools, in order to prevent the next terrorist attack, to stop the attack on the USS Cole, to prevent the planes from taking off from Heathrow to kill thousands of innocent Americans. Intelligence is the first line of defense in the war on terrorism. It is possible to provide our intelligence community with the tools to keep us safe while protecting the civil liberties of Americans, and that is the perspective that the Democrat majority has lost.  
   When Admiral McConnell appeared before the Judiciary Committee, he wanted to make clear our understanding of the technology of the capture of conversations. And he put it this way: he said when you are conducting surveillance in the context of electronic surveillance, you can only target one end of the conversation. So you have no control over who that number might call or who they might receive a call from. He then went on to say if you require a warrant in circumstances that we have never required before, as is the implication of the bill to be brought before us, he said if you have to predetermine it is a foreign-to-foreign before you do it, it is impossible. That's the point. You can only target one. If you are going to target, you have to program some equipment to say I am going to look at number 1, 2, 3. So targeting in this sense, you are targeting a phone number that is foreign. So that's the target. The point is you have no control over who that target might call or who might call that target. 
   Is that consistent with your understanding in the years you have been on the Intelligence Committee and the years you have looked at this issue?

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. That is exactly right. The biggest problem is that the terrorists who are trying to attack us, and even foreign governments, are increasingly using commercial communications. So they don't have dedicated lines between a couple of government buildings. In modern communications, those communications will flow wherever it is fastest to get to wherever they are calling to. Sometimes that call will transit the United States, and we shouldn't require a warrant just because the point of access to that conversation happens to be within the United States.

People seem to think that somehow this impacts the civil liberties of Americans. No, this bill that the Democrats are bringing to the floor this week will extend civil liberties protections to foreigners trying to kill Americans. It will make it harder for our soldiers and our law enforcement folks and our intelligence community to find out when the next attack is coming in order to prevent it. 
   I don't understand why they are going in this direction. Sometimes I don't think they really understand what they are doing here. Sometimes I think it is not entirely intentional on the part of some of these folks, that they really do not understand how this works and how badly they are crippling American intelligence if they pass this law.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. If you think about how the challenge has changed since the Cold War, in the Cold War, we had early warning systems. We had Cheyenne Mountain that was watching early warning systems to see if Soviet bombers were heading towards us or missile systems had launched, immediately scrambling airplanes and taking immediate action to protect this country.     
   And we had intelligence systems set up to be able to detect and give us that early warning. The problem has changed, but the need for early warning is still there. 
   Now, what we didn't do when we got a detection that bombers were coming towards the United States was call the lawyers in Washington to see if we could launch our airplanes to protect us. The system was set up to be fast and immediately responsive. 
   What the Democrats are going to do this week is to say if you get a detection, if you believe you have early warning, that the terrorists are coming to destroy Americans or attack Americans, put that on hold while you go get a warrant, talk to judges, take hours to decide whether we can respond. That will not allow us to protect America.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, I have some sympathy with those on the Democrat side of the aisle tonight because you made a promise. You said you were going to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and now you have to at least appear to make good on that promise even if it doesn't make any sense. So you have come up with a way to do so that really doesn't implement or address the real  concerns of the 9/11 Commission, but is actually going to make things a whole lot worse around here in terms of intelligence oversight. 
   The 9/11 Commission recommended streamlining and combining oversight functions and budgeting functions and giving a single committee the power of the purse and the power to oversee our intelligence community. 
   Now, the 9/11 Commission, in my view, had some good ideas and we implemented them, particularly in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act of 2005, which was the most comprehensive reorganization of the intelligence community since the creation of the CIA in 1948. 
   But they also came up with some ideas, as commissions do, that weren't such great ideas. They recommended putting the Director of National Intelligence inside the political ring of the White House. I think that is a terrible idea for independence of intelligence and keeping intelligence from being influenced by political considerations. They recommended that we reveal the size of the intelligence budget, which has always been secret. Both of those were bad ideas. 
   I think there is also a danger in eliminating the checks and balances that are inherent in the fact that we separate appropriations from authorizing, particularly in a realm where almost everything is done in secret. The existence of those checks and balances within this institution is actually healthy with respect to oversight of the intelligence community. 
   But they came up with a solution in this resolution that doesn't even do what the 9/11 Commission decided was the real problem. We have two boxes on the chart overseeing the intelligence community, so the resolution creates three. How does that streamline anything? And by adding these, when we add these boxes to the organization chart, we don't even in this resolution clarify who is responsible for what. So if you are interested in a particular program, its challenges, its prospects, its importance, who do I go to? The chairman of the intel community? The chairman of defense approps? The chairman of this new community that doesn't seem to have much authority at all? 
   We have now divided it and made it even more confusing and messed up than the 9/11 Commission said it was in the first place. At least my colleague from Wisconsin was honest enough to admit this isn't what the 9/11 Commission recommended. In fact, they are probably rolling their eyes as we speak. 
   We have tied the intelligence oversight in knots with this proposal; and I would urge my colleagues if they can't stomach rejecting it now, at least fix it later when nobody else is looking.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rhode Island talked about the importance of upholding the Constitution, and there is something in the manager's amendment to this bill that was inserted without any hearing in the committee that I don't understand, that makes no sense to me. It is a provision that says, very plainly: This act and the amendments made by this act shall not be construed to prohibit surveillance of, or grant any rights to, an alien not permitted to be in or remain in the United States. 
   Now, I think there are probably a lot of people on this side of the aisle who don't have a problem with that provision. What I don't understand is why you all are proposing it. 
   Here is the irony here. This bill will extend rights under our Constitution to foreigners in foreign countries, while denying the protections of the Constitution to some 12 million people who are not legally in the United States, when the case law is clear that they do have rights. Whether we think they should have rights or not, the case law is absolutely clear. So we will deny those rights to people in the United States while extending them to people in foreign countries? 
   I think we should be clear with the American people why we insisted on fixing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and did so successfully in August. We had soldiers who were kidnapped in Iraq by insurgents.     
   And because of changes in technology and the demands of the court, the American military had to go to lawyers in the United States to get a warrant to try to intercept the communications of the terrorists trying to kill them. That took time, too much time. And the law had to be fixed. 
   Soldiers should not need an army of lawyers in Washington to listen to the communications of the enemy that's trying to kill them. This needed to be fixed, and we fixed it the first week of August. 
   We all remember where we were on the morning of 9/11. We remember who we were with, what we were wearing, what we ate for breakfast.  
   But people don't remember where they were the day that the British Government arrested 16 people who were within 48 hours of walking on to airliners and blowing them up simultaneously over the Atlantic. We don't remember it because it didn't happen. And the reason it didn't happen is because of exceptional intelligence and the cooperation of the British, Pakistani and American Governments.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity  to talk to folks this evening about something that's critical to our country. Ten days ago a very important law was allowed to expire. It's called the Protect America Act, and it made changes to our foreign intelligence surveillance laws. 
   We passed the Protect America Act in August of this last year to close a gap in our intelligence collection caused by changes in technology. Unfortunately, that law had a sunset in it. It expired after 6 months. 
   The Senate passed a bill, a bipartisan bill, overwhelmingly in the Senate, and sent it over to the House. I believe that that bill, if it were brought up on the floor of this House, would pass overwhelmingly here as well. Consideration of that legislation is being blocked by the liberal Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives, and it is putting all of us as Americans at very serious risk. 
   Ten days. Ten days we've been going without the ability to listen to foreigners in a foreign country without a warrant because the Protect America Act has been allowed to expire. 
   I wanted to take this opportunity tonight, with some of my colleagues, to explain why this matters, what the foreign intelligence surveillance laws are, why we should care. 
   Now, I believe that the greatest accomplishment of the last 6 years has been what has not happened. We've not had another terrorist attack on our soil since the morning of 9/11. And they have tried. 
   The first line of defense against terrorism is good intelligence. The intelligence problem has changed since the Cold War when I served in the military. In the Cold War, our biggest enemy was the Soviet Union, and we had no doubt about where they were. In some ways they were a very convenient enemy. They had exercises from the same barracks every year at the same time using the same ray of lines and the same radio frequencies. They were very easy to find. Had they ever attacked us, they would have been very difficult to defeat; but we know where they were. We know what their capabilities were. 
   Today, the problem has completely changed. We have terrorist networks that are hiding in the midst of civil society using commercial telecommunications. If we can find out what they're doing, we can stop them and prevent another terrorist attack. It's almost like it's a Where's Waldo problem. You have to find Waldo who's hiding in the midst of regular, everyday confusion. If we can find him, we can stop him. The hard part is the intelligence problem. It is finding him. It's uncovering what their plans and capabilities and intentions are. And so that's why these laws make so much difference. 
   We need to be able to listen to communications among foreigners in foreign countries, do so very quickly, so that we can act on tips as soon as we get them, and use our great strengths in telecommunications to uncover what our enemies are trying to do and prevent another terrorist attack by then using our law enforcement, our military, our financial networks to shut down and arrest and, in some cases, eliminate these terrorist threats.     
   I want to talk a little bit about what the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is for, and then one of my colleagues has joined me here from Oregon, and I will yield to him whenever he is ready to speak. 
   The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was put in place in 1978. It was as a result of some abuses by the intelligence community where they had been listening to Americans, and it puts in place protections for Americans so that if you are in America and, for foreign intelligence reasons, the government wants to listen to you, they think you are a spy, you have to go to a court and get a warrant. That's the basics of it. But we do not require warrants and we never have under, or it was never intended under the initial law to require warrants to listen to people overseas. 
   America spies on its enemies. We are trying to figure out what the North Koreans are intending to do, whether they have developed a nuclear weapon, whether they're going to sell that materiel to someone. Likewise, we are trying to figure out what is going on in Venezuela or in Iran or Syria or any hotspot around the world. We seek, through our intelligence agencies, to know the plans and capabilities and intentions of other countries and groups around the world who may harm us. We spy. 
   The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act says that you cannot do that on a U.S. person in the United States without going to a special court set up for that purpose and getting a warrant saying you have probable cause to believe that this American is an agent of a foreign power or this person is in America. 
   But the problem is technology changed. In 1978, that was the year that I graduated from high school, the telephone was something that was on the wall in the kitchen. The word ``Internet'' didn't exist. There were no such things as cell phones. I mean, that was Buck Rogers stuff. Technology changed, but the law did not change to keep pace with technology. 
   Under the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, they made a distinction among technology. It said, if it bounces over the air, you don't need a warrant no matter where you are listening. That's because at that time almost all international calls bounced over the air over satellites. At the time in 1978, almost all local calls were over a wire. And so the law was written that said if you touch a wire in the United States, you have got to have a warrant. You are presumed to be impacting a U.S. person. So it was technology-specific for that moment in time. 
   But technology has changed. Today, almost all international traffic goes over a wire or a fiber-optic cable. And in complete reverse from 1978, there are over 2 million cell phones in this country. So a majority now of local calls actually bounce over the air. So we needed to modernize the law so it was no longer technology specific. And what happened over a period of 1 year or 2 was that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court started saying no matter where a person is, if you are trying to listen to somebody in Pakistan, talk to somebody else in Pakistan, you needed to get a warrant if you sought to collect that communication by touching a wire in the United States. 
   This created havoc with our intelligence collection, particularly with fast-moving terrorist targets, and we were losing access to intelligence information from overseas. You can understand why, because you know it's kind of hard to develop a case for probable cause for somebody who is overseas potentially talking to somebody else overseas. I mean, it is not like you can have the FBI go and talk to their neighbors. 
   So a problem built that was compromising America's security. 
   I would be happy to yield to my colleague from Oregon.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, one of the things that bothers me about this is that one of the frustrations is that we can't talk about specific instances, but the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell, has said very clearly, and now publicly, we've lost intelligence. 
   On one of my visits to one of our intelligence agencies where I was there to oversee a particular program and get briefed on it, but when we started out the briefing, the director of that agency said, Congresswoman, I just want you to get a flavor for our highest priority threads we are following today, and he passed a sheet across the table for me to look at what exactly they were trying to, you know, the tips that they had, the leads that they had that day that they were trying to listen in to disrupt attacks on this country. 
   It is a very dynamic situation where you get a tip today, do we have 12 terrorists that are transiting Spain, that are coming from Pakistan, where are they going? They picked up cell phones. We think we have the numbers. Can we listen to them before they move to someplace else and before they move to another number? Can we be as fast as they are, because if we are not, the consequences are devastating. 
   And all of us remember where we were the morning of 9/11. Almost no American remembers where you were the morning that the British Government arrested 16 people who were within 48 hours of walking onto airliners at Heathrow and blowing them up simultaneously over the Atlantic, within 48 hours of killing thousands of Americans who were just flying from Heathrow to JFK or La Guardia. We don't remember it because it didn't happen. And it didn't happen because of the expertise of our intelligence agencies and cooperation with the British and Pakistani Governments. We figured it out before they walked through security at Heathrow, and people didn't die. 
   I yield to my colleague from Oregon.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. The key change in the Protect America Act, and also in the Senate bill that is now being blocked here on the floor of the House, is to allow American intelligence to listen to foreigners in foreign countries without a warrant, even if the point of access to that communication is a wire here in the United States. That's really the fundamental change. It has very strong privacy protections for Americans. Americans, wherever they may be, whether you're off in Germany on vacation with your family, you're an American, you have protections and rights under our Constitution. Foreigners in foreign countries do not have those rights under our Constitution, and we are seeking to gather information on terrorist targets overseas. 
   So it's foreigners in foreign countries. And it just has to do with touching a wire in the United States to gather that information. And it says if the point of access happens to be a wire in the United States, that doesn't matter. What matters is you reasonably believe they are a foreigner in a foreign country.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. It was actually a situation like that which caused me to say enough is enough, we have to get this fixed. It was last May, and at the time we couldn't talk about it, but it's been talked about publicly since then. 
   We had soldiers who were kidnapped in Iraq. We had, we thought, a tip on who might have done it. And there was an army of lawyers here in Washington and over a 24-hour delay in listening to communications because they had to touch a wire in the United States. I mean, you 
   think about it, it's your kid, it's your kid that's been kidnapped. All of us are familiar here in America with the AMBER alerts. Speed matters when someone's been kidnapped, and you want to get information out as quickly as possible to try to save somebody. If it was your kid who was in a combat zone who has been kidnapped by insurgents, and we've got a room full of lawyers in Washington trying to get a warrant to listen to the communications of the insurgents that took him? That's not good enough. It's not good enough. And we should expect more of our government than that. And the responsibility for fixing it rests right here in this body. 
   We've got this odd situation with soldiers overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq and the Philippines in dangerous situations where they've got the authority to shoot an insurgent, but they can't listen to him without a warrant. Where is the sense in that?

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. And it's even worse than that. You've got your two cell phones there. If the soldiers were able to intercept between that insurgent's cell phone and the tower that it's going to, that's all fine; you don't need a warrant for that. It's only if it happens to route through the United States and you touch the wire where it's actually easier to listen to it that you need a warrant. So it depends on the point of collection. This is stupid.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. And one of the things that baffles me is to be able to hear the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell, say those things, to have very clear testimony both publicly and privately that the problems they predicted are actually taking place, and yet the Democratic leadership in the House is still in a state of denial, just hoping that we don't miss something important. 
   Now, you kind of wonder, why on Earth are they willing to take this risk? Why are they willing to put the rest of us at risk? And I have difficulty understanding that. And I listened to some of my colleagues on the floor of the House here in the debate last week when one of my Democratic colleagues actually said that he thought that listening to foreigners in foreign countries without a warrant was suspicious and disrespectful.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. One of the things that I think we need to dispel is a couple of myths, and they are myths being promulgated by the Democratic leadership that is blocking the will of the majority in this House from passing this legislation. And one of them is that, oh, well, we can start emergency surveillance, emergency wiretaps in a matter of minutes. It's really just not that big a deal, when, in fact, that's not true. 
   The requirement under the existing law is that the Attorney General can start a wiretap without going to the court in an emergency, but he has to stand in the shoes of the court. He has to certify that all the elements of probable cause to get a warrant are already  there. So all of the material that would be presented to the court has to be completely worked up. And we found in the real world when it really mattered, we had three soldiers that were kidnapped in Iraq, it took over 24 hours to gather the information, build the case for probable cause. And some of my colleagues said, well, you know, you should have just gone ahead and done it and we would have just taken care of it after the fact. We had testimony in front of the Intelligence Committee where the chairman actually said that. And I looked at the young man who was there who was a member of the intelligence community, and I said, Is it true that initiating a wiretap without authority is a felony? 
   And he said, Yes, ma'am, it is. 
   I said, Would you be willing to risk a felony, hoping that this body would somehow cut you some slack or the prosecutor wouldn't go after you? 
   And he said, I'm an officer of the court. I'm a lawyer. I can't knowingly commit a felony. I can't do that.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. If my colleague would think about that for a second, you've got a tip. Most people know that a lot of big cities have gang units. Put this in this context. You got a tip that somebody may be a terrorist overseas, but really all you have is maybe a name and maybe a phone number. That's not enough to get probable cause for a warrant. So you've got to be able to amass why is it that you think this is the person. What relationships do they have? You have to build up this whole case. And unlike something in America where it would be the gang unit in the Albuquerque Police Department or the Washington Police Department, we're talking about people in foreign countries. It's not as though you can send the FBI out to talk to their neighbors to build a case for probable 
   cause to get a warrant to believe that this person is affiliated with a terrorist organization. So in many cases you cannot even reach that standard to get a wiretap in an emergency situation because the probable cause standard was set up to protect Americans who have rights under our Constitution with respect to law enforcement investigations. This is applying a whole body of law to something it was never really intended to be applied to.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. In fact, the Senate bill for privacy protections for Americans are stronger than the Protect America Act and stronger than current law under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act because the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act really focused on technology. It was technology specific and assumed that things that were on a wire were local calls in the United States. Well, we have said that's changed. The bill that we want to bring up and pass in the House has very strict protections for Americans wherever they are and for anyone reasonably believed to be in the United States. 
   Now, there are some folks who think if somebody's not a citizen or if they are here in the country illegally, you should be able to listen to them. This bill doesn't even authorize that. It has very strict protections for Americans in the United States or for Americans wherever they happen to be. 
   Now, we collect intelligence. We spy overseas. When I was an officer stationed overseas, one of my jobs at one post was to negotiate with the Soviets back when the Soviets existed. We knew who the KGB guy was in their delegation. If we happened to intercept his report back to Moscow and it mentioned me, there were already procedures in place to mask or so-called minimize the existence of an American that we may have picked up intelligence overseas. This law actually strengthens that. The bipartisan bill that we'd like to see passed here strengthens it even further so that if I am an American businessperson living in Germany, they'd have to actually get a warrant to listen to me in Germany, which is a stronger protection than we have ever had before.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. We are very close to the time being up in the hour that we have had this evening. But I think it is important to summarize some of the things we have talked about here tonight.  
   The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was intended to protect the civil liberties of Americans while also allowing our intelligence agencies to collect the intelligence information that can protect us. That is all it was intended to do. But it has become outdated because of changes in technology. 
   We have a bill that has been passed in the Senate by 68 votes. There has been a letter from 20 Democrats to their own leadership saying, please, take up this bill because we want to vote for it. We all know here that if we were allowed to vote on this bill, it would pass overwhelmingly in the House, and the President has already said that he would sign it. Instead, we are here tonight, 10 days after a law expired, that our Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Mike McConnell, has said has already degraded our ability to gather intelligence on the people who are trying to kill Americans. I think that is inexcusable. 
   I think we made a decision as a country on the morning of 9/11. We made a decision that we were going to go on offense. We were going to play away games because the home games cost too much. 
   I want the leaders of al Qaeda hiding in a hole in the mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan wondering whether they can use their cell phones without being detected by American Special Forces, rather than Americans using their cell phones to call home one last time. That is the difference. 
   As my colleagues from Texas and Pennsylvania said, God forbid, God forbid that we have to have another 9/11 Commission, that we have another terrorist attack. I believe that the greatest accomplishment of the last 6 years has been what has not happened. There has not been another terrorist attack on our soil, and they have tried. Our first line of defense in preventing another terrorist attack is good intelligence. And because this law expired 10 days ago, we are tying the hands of the intelligence agencies who are sworn to protect us. We are making it harder for them. We are making them jump through hoops that in some cases are too high and taking tremendous risks for the American people. Why? Because a minority of Democrats, including their leadership, refuse to allow a bipartisan bill to be brought up on the floor of this House. Shame on them. Shame on them for not putting the security of this country first. 
   If we have that other commission after another terrorist attack, they are going to be saying, why didn't you protect us? What you are seeing tonight is why. You can't connect the dots unless you can collect the dots in the first place. This is about allowing our intelligence agencies to collect the dots that can protect us. 
   I would urge the Democratic leadership, as my colleague from Pennsylvania said, to take ``yes'' for an answer, to fix this problem, to close this gap this week. We have nine suspensions on the floor. We are naming post offices tomorrow. Pull it up tomorrow. And I will stand here shoulder to shoulder with them on the floor of this House, we will overwhelmingly pass it, and we can walk down to the White House tomorrow afternoon so that the President can sign it and protect this country. 
   I yield the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. I thank my colleague from Texas for yielding the time. It was actually a year ago in May when I became absolutely determined to get this fixed, and it was a result of a series of cases in what I saw as a growing problem in intelligence collection. 
   But so that people understand, in 1978 the Congress passed a law that governed intelligence collection here in the United States, and it was in response to a bunch of abuses that happened in the 1950s and the 1960s. Someone gave me a copy of a declassified memorandum 
   signed by Robert Kennedy and J. Edgar Hoover authorizing the wiretapping of Martin Luther King. Intelligence agencies were involved in abuses and violating the civil liberties of Americans in the 1950s and 1960s, and this law in 1978 set up a special court called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. They meet in secret session. But in order to listen and to do a wiretap for the collection of foreign intelligence in the United States, you need to get a warrant from this court. 
   The problem is that the law was written specific to the technology of the time. 1978 was the year that I graduated from high school. The telephone was connected to the wall in the kitchen. The Internet did not exist. Cell phones were Buck Rogers stuff. At that time, almost all international calls went over the air. They bounced off satellites. And the law does not require a warrant to collect any of that information. Almost all local calls were on a wire. And the focus was if you touched a wire, you needed a warrant because that was presumed to be a local call. 
   Now, technology has completely changed. There are over 220 million cell phones in the United States. And now, almost all international calls go over a wire or a fiberoptic cable, not bounced off of satellites. So all of the foreign intelligence collection, foreign intelligence information which we used to collect over the air, without requiring any warrants at all, has migrated to wires; even more than that, because of global telecommunications. 
   Telecommunications flow on the path of least resistance. So somebody making a phone call from the Horn of Africa into Pakistan, let's say, that call has a significant probability of actually being routed through the United States. Even a call from northern Spain to southern Spain may actually end up getting routed through the United States. 
   Early last year, there was a series of court decisions that found that even if we are intending to listen to a foreigner in a foreign country, if the point of access required touching a wire in the United States, then you needed a warrant. This threw a complete monkey wrench into intelligence collection. By the summer of last year, the Director of National Intelligence has testified in open session that we had lost two-thirds of our intelligence collection on terrorism. 
   The problem was becoming critical, and as a result, we passed something called the Protect America Act in the first week of August that said very clearly if you were in the United States, you needed to get a warrant. If your target was outside of the United States, then you did not need to get a warrant. It went back to the original intention of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. 
   We worked through the backlog in the 6 months that that temporary act  was in place. Unfortunately, that act was allowed to expire on the 16th of February, and now we have gone back to the old system for all new tips and tips that are coming into the intelligence agencies. Anything that was already under a warrant, was covered for a year. But intelligence is a dynamic thing. There are new tips that come in every day. It's a little bit like law enforcement. You're going after the bad guys every day. There are things that happen and you get new tips and new leads, and all of those new leads have to be dealt with under an old and cumbersome system that does not allow America to keep pace with the terrorists we are trying to track. 
   The key here is to prevent another terrorism attack, and our strongest and most important tool in the war against terrorism is good intelligence. If we can figure out what they are doing, we can stop them. The key is to figure out what they are doing, and that means good and timely intelligence. 
   I yield back to my colleague.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. That is correct. Under the law that we are trying to get passed, that passed the Senate by a bipartisan vote with 68 votes, it would not be required to get a warrant to listen to a foreigner in a foreign country. Unfortunately, the leadership here in the House will not allow that bill to come up for a vote. 
   Twenty-one Democrats, over 20 State Attorney Generals have asked the leadership of this House to allow that bill to be brought up for a vote.     
   I think it would pass with an overwhelming, bipartisan majority. 
   So we have the liberal Democratic leadership thwarting the majority of this House and compromising the safety and security of this country, and I believe they are doing it largely at the behest of trial lawyers who are eager to sue telephone companies, who can't defend themselves in civil court without compromising the way we collect intelligence.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. I thank my colleague from Texas. 
   One of the things that I think is important for people to understand is the importance of intelligence in keeping this country safe. In any war, I think intelligence is underestimated; and the reason is that we see the old newspaper headlines of the victory of the Navy at Midway, but you don't learn until years after that it was the breaking of the Japanese code that allowed our ships to be in the right place in the first place. We see the tremendous success of the Battle of Normandy, but we never knew until years later when it was finally declassified that we had broken the German code. 
   So intelligence is often underrated. But in the war on terror, trying to prevent the next terrorist attack, intelligence is even more important than it ever was in the Cold War. 
   I served in the Air Force during the Cold War, and the great thing about the Soviets was that they were certainly easy to find. They were easy to find, or as the military would say, they would have been hard to fix, easy to find. They had the same exercises at the same time of year using the same barracks and the same rail lines and  the same radio frequencies. We knew where they were. They would have been extremely difficult to defeat had they ever attacked the West, but we knew where they were. 
   When we are fighting against terrorism, the problem is completely reversed. If we can find them, we can stop them. The difficult part is finding them. It is more like a Where's Waldo problem, you know, the cartoon books where you get all of these pictures and you are trying to find the little guy hidden in among all the rest of the clutter. Terrorists generally use commercial communications. They have no territory. They are hiding in the civil population, hiding in plain sight as it were. So, the intelligence problem is the most important and most difficult problem. 
   All of us remember where we were the morning of 9/11. We remember who we were with, what we were wearing, who we called first, what we had for breakfast. But very few Americans remember where they were the day the British Government arrested 16 people who were within 48 hours of walking onto airliners at Heathrow and blowing them up over the Atlantic. If they had succeeded, more people would have died that day than died the morning of 9/11; but you don't remember it because it didn't happen, and it didn't happen because British, American, and Pakistani intelligence were able to uncover the plot and arrest those who were going to carry it out before they had an opportunity to. 
   Good intelligence allows us to prevent another terrorist attack, and electronic surveillance is one of our strongest intelligence tools. The Protect America Act just allowed Americans to listen to foreigners in foreign countries without a warrant. If we don't have that authority, it is sometimes impossible to get to the standard required to get a warrant. It is almost a waste of time. It is an incredible frustration for our people who are working in intelligence. 
   I mean, you think about this. If you are going to get a warrant on somebody who is a narcotics trafficker in Chicago, you can send the FBI out to talk to their neighbors; you can go to their place that they are working; you can talk to their landlady. You can develop probable cause for a warrant. But if you think you have got somebody on the Horn of Africa who is affiliated with al Qaeda, you can't send the FBI to talk to their neighbors. Sometimes you can't reach that standard of probable cause. So, intelligence doesn't get collected against people who are foreigners in foreign countries who have no rights at all under the Constitution of the United States, and the people who are hurt by that are the American citizens we are failing to protect. 
   The majority of this House wants to pass a bipartisan bill that has already cleared the Senate that would make the provisions of the Protect America Act permanent, and the Democratic leadership of this House is blocking consideration of that bill, to the detriment of the people of this country. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. I think my colleague from Pennsylvania raises a good point. What are the protections for America's civil liberties, and there has been a lot of misinformation out there about the protections in the Protect America Act for American civil liberties. In fact, in the Senate bill that we would like to have a vote on here in the House, the civil liberties protections for Americans are more than exist under current law, under the current FISA law. 
   What are those protections? First, you have to have a warrant to target anyone in the United States, American or foreigner. So you must have a warrant if someone is reasonably believed to be in the United States. 
   It is a felony to do what some have called reverse targeting. In other words, you think somebody may be affiliated with a terrorist group. They are in the United States and they have a brother in Lebanon. So gee, let's wiretap their brother in Lebanon and maybe we can pick up some of their conversations back to the guy in the United States. That is a felony. You can't do that. You have to have a warrant if your target is reasonably believed to be in the United States, and you cannot do reverse targeting. 
   It also extends the protection of the Constitution to Americans traveling overseas. This is something that doesn't exist in current law. If I am an American stationed overseas, which I was in a past life, and I in some way bump into American intelligence collection overseas, their procedures in regulations is to ``minimize'' or ``screen out'' that information, to destroy information that is of no intelligence value. But the act that has now passed the Senate actually goes further than that. If you are an American overseas, the American government would also have to get a warrant in order to target your communications. 
   These provisions apply irrespective of the communications technology used. So to collect foreign intelligence over the air on a wire, it doesn't matter. All that matters is whether somebody is reasonably believed to be in the United States or is an American citizen. If they are, you have to go to court and get a warrant. If you do not, if they are a foreigner in a foreign country, we do not extend the protections of the Constitution to them.

<DOCNO>Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. (SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DANDY-WALKER SYNDROME AND HYDROCEPHALUS -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. I thank my colleague from Nebraska. 
   I also wanted to thank my colleague from Maryland, Chris Van Hollen, for joining me in this effort and being the lead cosponsor of House Concurrent Resolution 163. There are 105 Members of this body who are cosponsors of this resolution, and it's intended to increase awareness of a syndrome that, frankly, before someone came and talked to me about it, I had never heard of. My guess is most of our colleagues have never heard of Dandy-Walker syndrome because it affects a relatively small number of families, but it's a very serious syndrome that deserves attention and research and understanding. 
   The resolution encourages the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control to do more research on the causes and cures and prevalence of the disease and to encourage education of medical doctors so that it can be quickly and accurately diagnosed. 
   Even the estimates of the number of children who suffer from Dandy-Walker vary greatly. Somewhere between 10,000 and 40,000 children in America  suffer from this syndrome, and it is very serious and often very difficult to diagnose, a combination of developmental delays, enlarged head circumference, hydrocephalus and seizures, that together define a syndrome that was initially described by a neurosurgeon and professor at the University of New Mexico named Dr. Arthur Walker. He initially described nine cases of what is now known as Dandy-Walker in 1942. 
   Early detection and diagnosis, accurate diagnosis, is critical for these children, particularly because of the coincidence of hydrocephalus in children, a very serious condition that can result in neurological complications if it's not diagnosed very early in life. 
   Currently, there are only five researchers in the United States who are focused on Dandy-Walker and trying to understand it, develop treatments, and perhaps eventually develop ways to prevent the disease. 
   This resolution expresses the sense of the Congress that further research and activities are needed to increase public awareness, to increase professional education, and to make sure physicians and the medical community are aware of what this syndrome's characteristics are so that it can be accurately diagnosed. 
   It also commends the National Institutes of Health on their first-ever sponsorship of a research workshop focused on hydrocephalus and Dandy-Walker, and acknowledges the need for continued collaboration between different institutes and centers at NIH. 
   Some of my colleagues have commended me for my leadership on this issue, and I have to demur in that regard. Sometimes I think that the best thing about being a Representative is that you are often the wagon that harnesses the enthusiasm and the passion of others. I would like to recognize where that passion really comes from: Eric Cole and his wife Andrea, who are here in the gallery today. They are the proud parents of Ryan. 
   The fact is that Eric's dad called me. Eric's dad and I served in the Air Force together, and one time, Captain Don Cole tried to teach me something about politics at the United States Air Force Academy. There are people in this body who would probably disagree as to how well I learned those lessons. But Captain Cole's son is Eric Cole. His grandson is Ryan, and Ryan suffers from Dandy-Walker syndrome. 
   I want to commend Eric for his leadership, for making a decision to get involved, not only to help his son but to help others who suffer from the same disease. It is because individuals choose to get involved that things change over time. 
   I would like to place into the Record a letter of support from the March of Dimes in support of this resolution. It's dated June 22, 2007. 
   Again, I'd like to thank my colleague, Mr. Van Hollen of Maryland, for working with us on this resolution and for his staff member, Ray Thorn, who's been particularly helpful in this process. Also, I would like to recognize two of my colleagues, Mr. Aderholt of Alabama and Mr. Ryan of Ohio, for their support and their encouragement on this resolution. 
   I would urge my colleagues to support this resolution to move forward on the understanding and the research and the professional education associated with a syndrome that adversely affects close to 40,000 young Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, the Director of National Intelligence came to the Congress in April and told us that we were not listening to things we needed to be listening to, that we had a problem. And since then we have had numerous hearings, most of them in closed session, about the scope and scale of this problem. And it is worse than we ever thought it was. And, Ms. Harman, I would tell you it is much worse than when you served on the committee. 
   He said, in open session in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, ``We are missing a significant portion of what we should be getting.'' 
   It is imperative that we solve this problem before we leave here. 
   This morning without any agreement, without any prior discussion, the Democrats' leadership introduced the bill we are considering tonight. There is no agreement on the text with Republicans in the House; there is no agreement with the Senate, Democrat or Republican; and there is no agreement with the Director of National Intelligence or with the President. In fact, the Director of National Intelligence had not seen the bill until after we were discussing the rule here on the floor. 
   I rise today to oppose this legislation. I must oppose it because it doesn't solve the problem that we must solve. And, in fact, it makes it worse. 
   The Director of National Intelligence told us this afternoon in writing that ``The House proposal is unacceptable and I strongly oppose it.'' He also said, ``The House proposal would not allow me to carry out my responsibility to provide warning and to protect the Nation.'' 
   This bill will not allow our Director of National Intelligence, who has 40 years of experience in this field, the former Director of the National Security Agency under President Clinton, it would not allow him to carry out his duties to protect this Nation. We are going in the wrong direction.     
   I would urge my colleagues to reject this bill before us tonight; and I would urge the Speaker, Ms. Pelosi, to bring another bill to the floor of this House that can be supported by the Senate, by the Republicans, by the Democrats and by our intelligence community and signed by the President so we can close this intelligence gap. 
   But what does it matter? Why should people care? We all remember where we were the morning of 9/11 and who we were with, what we were wearing, who we called first, who we checked on. You never remember the crisis that doesn't happen because it's prevented by good intelligence.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, when we adjourned we were discussing a rule to make in order two bills, one relating to Minnesota and the other relating to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The rule does not specify a particular bill number, but my colleague from Florida has made us aware of a bill that was introduced. The bill that the leadership currently intends to bring to the floor is H.R. 3356. I would tell my colleagues that the Director of National Intelligence had not seen this piece of legislation when it was brought to the floor today. 
   In the intervening time that we've been waiting for the vote tally system to become operational again, they've been able to at least initially take a look at it, and we expect a formal statement from our intelligence community shortly, but I have also taken a look at this bill. If we're trying to fix the intelligence gap, this will not do it. In fact, this will make the intelligence gap wider than it currently is, and I want to explain to my colleagues why. 
   First, and most importantly, this legislation would continue to require a warrant for the collection of foreign intelligence involving foreign persons in a foreign country. When the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was passed in 1978, the intention was to protect the civil liberties of Americans, and that is what the law should continue to do. Because of changes in technology, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is now being completely backlogged with requests for warrants that they never used to have to see because telecommunications have changed. 
   We need to go back to what the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was intended to do, which is to protect the civil liberties of Americans and allow us to rapidly collect foreign intelligence on foreign persons in foreign countries without first having to go to  court and get a warrant. That is not too much to ask, and the Director of National Intelligence has warned all of us that there are things we should be getting that we are not listening to. 
   The leadership does not have to bring, under this rule, this particular piece of legislation to the floor, and as I understand it, negotiations are continuing and are being much more fruitful with our colleagues in the other body. But we must, before we leave here for August break, fix this problem. It's a problem we've known about for some time and tried to work on and quietly fix. I would much prefer that these things be done quietly, but when it was clear that the law was not working, that it was not protecting Americans, and that we were not moving quickly to fix and close this intelligence gap, I decided that I needed to take action and with my colleagues push more publicly to get this fixed. 
   I believe it is possible here today in this House to find the consensus and something that works for our intelligence agencies to be able to listen to foreigners in foreign countries, who are using the communications systems America has built, to plot, to plan, to kill us. 
   I would encourage the leadership on the other side of the aisle to work constructively with the Director of National Intelligence, call him and get him up here and work this out so that we can do the right thing for our country.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. I thank the gentlelady because I have some confusion over here, and you may be able to help me. 
   As I look at this, I think this is the bill that was rejected by the Director of National Intelligence 36 hours ago as insufficient. And it is not the bill that, as I understand it, was going to be accepted by the Senate this morning that the DNI proposed. 
   Is the House offering a different bill than has been accepted by the Senate?

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I am here to urge my colleagues to oppose the rule and to oppose the previous question on the rule for the Intelligence authorization bill today. 
   I offered an amendment in the Rules Committee that was similar to one that I offered in the Intelligence Committee that would modernize our foreign intelligence surveillance laws so that we can listen to the terrorists trying to kill us, while protecting Americans' civil liberties. 
   Every member of the House Intelligence Committee knows that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is not working, and so does the Speaker of the House. In fact, she has been briefed on this earlier than any of us have, since shortly after 9/11. 
   Last week, in unclassified session in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Admiral Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, urged the Congress to modernize our intelligence surveillance laws. He told us and the world, ``We are actually missing a significant portion of what we should be getting.'' We are missing a significant portion of what we should be getting. 
   In January of this year, the Attorney General of the United States wrote to the Congress and said there were new Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court orders that were innovative, that would put the President's terrorist surveillance program underneath the auspices of a judge in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. They are innovative, because the court is stretching the law like a twin sheet over a king-sized bed. And every member of the Intelligence Committee knows just how fragile the legal framework is in this arrangement. Yet, a single judge in a nonadversarial secret setting has said it is okay to go forward on this basis because it is important to the country, and the Congress has failed to act. Will the next judge go along? 
   Every one of us knows there is a problem. Here is the problem: 
   In 1978, almost all local calls were on wire and almost all long distance calls were transmitted by microwave over the air. The FISA law distinguishes between collection over a wire and collection over the air. You don't need a FISA warrant to collect signals over the air. And that is where long-haul communications were in 1978. 
   Now, in 21st-century communications, the situation is completely reversed. Most long-haul communications are on wire and most local calls are over the air. 230 million Americans have cell phones, but the FISA law we operate under is stuck in the 1970s, while we are trying to protect this country from terrorists who are exploiting the 21st-century technology that was invented by this great country. We are tying the hands of our intelligence agencies while our enemies are using these communication systems to plot to kill Americans. 
   But the rule is even worse than that. The committee has ruled in order an amendment by Mr. Flake and Mr. Schiff that insists, insists that our intelligence agencies must use this outdated 1978 law. What do you think the FISA judges are going to think when they see that pass the House of Representatives? 
   We are actually missing a significant portion of what we should be getting. What did we miss today? What are the terrorists plotting today? What are they talking about that is flowing over the wires that America built today? Who is going to die tomorrow because you won't let our Intelligence Committees listen to the foreign communications on a wire and you will not allow a debate on this floor on this very important issue? 
   I pray to God that we don't need another 9/11 Commission to look at what our failures were in intelligence. Because if we have to look at failures, if we have to look at whether we should have done something when we had a chance, then mark this vote on this day in history, when the Democrat majority in this House chose to tie our hands in the face of a determined enemy. 
   If we defeat the previous question on this rule, we will offer the amendment to modernize our intelligence surveillance laws to update them for 21st-century technology. A vote in favor of the  previous question on this rule is a vote to keep the FISA law frozen in time in 1978, while our enemies use 21st-century communications to plot to kill Americans. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and ``no'' on the rule.  
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Rule for debate and the previous question on the Intelligence Authorization Bill today. 
   This vote is more important than most procedural things we do around here. 
   I offered an amendment in the Rules Committee that would modernize our Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Laws so that we can listen to the terrorists trying to kill us and protect the civil liberties of Americans. 
   Every member of the House Intelligence Committee knows that the FISA law is not working, and so does the Speaker of the House. She has been briefed on these matters since shortly after 9/11--long before any of us were. 
   Last week, in unclassified session in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Admiral Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence urged the Congress to modernize this law. He told us and the world, ``We are actually missing a significant portion of what we should be getting.'' 
   In classified session, the details of the problems are even worse. 
   On January 17, 2007 the Attorney General told the Congress that there were new Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court orders that are ``innovative''. 
   They are ``innovative'' because the court is stretching the law like a twin sized sheet to cover a king sized bed. 
   And every member of the Intelligence Committee knows just how fragile this legal arrangement is. 
   Yet, a single judge in a non-adversarial secret session allowed it is important to the security of the country and because the Congress has failed to act. 
   Will the next judge continue to stretch the law?

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Madam Chair, I would agree with my colleague Mr. Cramer that much of this bill was developed in a bipartisan way. And one of the reasons that I like the Intelligence Committee is we don't have the C-SPAN effect. The cameras are off, and we get down to doing some very serious and important business on behalf of the country. 
   While we fixed a lot of things in the initial draft of the bill in committee, particularly with respect to technical intelligence and overhead systems, there are two very serious concerns that I still have that cause me to stand here today and oppose the bill. 
   The first is that there is a significant reduction in human intelligence in some very important special accounts, and they are reductions that are marked and serious and will impact our ability to conduct human intelligence in an area of the world where it is absolutely critical, not only for current operations but for our long-term security in the region. 
   We can't cut human intelligence. That was one of the number one recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We have to strengthen human intelligence after a decade of neglect. 
   The second problem is that this bill fails to address in any way one of the most important problems that we face in the intelligence community, and that is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Director of National Intelligence came to the committee with written recommendations on how we need to update and modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and this bill does nothing. He said to us we are actually missing a significant portion of what we should be getting. Because of the way the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is written, we are not collecting critical intelligence important to this country. 
   We should have addressed that in this bill. The DNI asked us to address that in this bill because we were operating with one hand tied behind our back. That is dangerous for this country and causes me to oppose this bill.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   When the President acknowledged the existence of the Terrorist Surveillance Program, he claimed the inherent authority, under article II of the Constitution, as the Commander in Chief to be able to conduct that surveillance. Now, whether you agree or don't agree with his interpretation of the Constitution, this amendment, and a bill with this amendment in it, does not change the Constitution. 
   I will admit to the gentleman from California I personally believe that the legal arguments that were presented in favor of the Terrorist Surveillance Program were not strong. They weren't strong at all. And that is why I demanded more rigorous oversight to the program and proposed legislation to change the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act so that we can listen to our enemies and protect the civil liberties of Americans. 
   The sad thing is that the bipartisan leadership of this body, Democrat and Republican, knew for 5 years this program was going on and did nothing to update the laws or even propose that perhaps this was wrong to do this this way. They remained silent. The failure is in the Congress. 
   We now know that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as it is currently written, is not getting us critical information about our enemies and also, frankly, not protecting the civil liberties of Americans. It is broken and not working. 
   The Director of National Intelligence testified last week in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, saying that we are missing important information because this law is trapped in 1970s technology. 
   In January of this year, the Attorney General wrote to the Congress and said that we now have innovative orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. By ``innovative'' what he really meant is that we are on very fragile legal ground. I describe it as putting a twin-size sheet on a king-size bed, and everybody on the Intelligence Committee knows exactly what I mean. We have one judge, in a nonadversarial proceeding, in secret session, who has approved some innovative orders. He is way out on a legal limb. So what will the next judge do? And after this amendment passes saying, by golly, we are determined to stay in the 1970s, the Congress is happy with a 1970s law governing 1970s technology, what is the next judge going to do? And how does that compromise our national security? We have a problem. 
   In 1978 almost all local communications went over a wire and almost all long-haul communications went over the air. The statute sets up different regimes for what to do for over-the-wire communications that you need a warrant for to collect foreign intelligence information. Over the air the sky is the limit. We now, in the 21st century, have things completely reversed. Now almost all local calls are over the air. 230 million Americans have cell phones, and yet almost all long-distance calls are over wires. The information that we critically need is on the wires. 
   This law is outdated, and we are stuck with our heads in the sand in 1970s law. And your amendment insists that we stay there. 
   I will oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has been amended since 1978 several times. But what has not changed is the basic structure of the law, that it treats wire communications differently than it treats over-the-air communications. 
   You do not need a warrant to gather foreign intelligence information that is flowing through the air by radio waves or cell tower or microwave or anything else. We do it. You do need it over a wire. The law needs to be technology neutral and it is not. What you are doing by your amendment is reaffirming that this House tonight is determined to stay with the 1970s law and 1970s technology. And this House also rejected an amendment that would have updated these statutes. 
   My colleague from Arizona says do we need to change FISA? We really don't know. 
   We have a written submission from the Director of National Intelligence telling us the changes that need to be made. 
   I urge my colleagues to look to the 21st-century technology to protect this country and reject the gentleman's amendment.

<DOCNO>Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, in December of 2005, I was walking to work and was at 1st and C Street when the front page of the New York Times revealed the existence of a program that had not been previously briefed to the entire Intelligence Committee and to the subcommittee that I, at that time, chaired that oversaw the activities of the National Security Agency. That launched a period of extensive oversight and draft legislation in 2006. 
   In January of 2007, because legislation didn't pass, the administration made an attempt to put this entire program under a FISA law that was not designed and was not updated. I described that at the time as trying to put a twin-size sheet on a king-size bed. It didn't work. 
   By late summer of 2007, we had lost close to two-thirds of our intelligence collection on terrorism. We were unable to respond fast enough when we had problems, particularly in war zones. 
   Just before Memorial Day in 2007, we had three soldiers who were kidnapped in Iraq. We needed an Army of lawyers in Washington D.C. to listen to the communications of the people that we thought had kidnapped them. 
   That delay is not good enough and led to the insistence that we pass the Protect America Act, which this Congress did, over the objections of the Democratic leadership, in August of 2007. The Protect America Act closed an important intelligence gap, but it expired in February of this year, and the gap is at risk of ever widening. 
   The bill that we pass today will protect the civil liberties of Americans and continue to require individualized warrants for anyone in the United States or American citizens anywhere in the world. It will also allow our intelligence agencies to very rapidly follow up on tips and listen to foreigners in foreign countries who are trying to kill Americans. 
   We have restored FISA to its original intent and modernized it for 21st century communications and technology. This is an important step for our intelligence community and will put it on a sound footing for the next several decades. 
   Intelligence, good intelligence, is the first line of defense against terrorism, and today this body will take the next step in making sure we have the tools to be able to listen to our enemies and prevent other terrorist attacks. 
   I would urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

   I would also ask, we have had 55 Members who weren't here for the vote that we just had. This issue we're about to debate and vote on is one that's important to people on both sides of the aisle. This is an important vote and important debate, and I think people should have an opportunity to participate in that.  
   All of us have had circumstances where there are disasters in our district and there are times when the leadership determines that the votes that are scheduled are of such sufficient gravity and importance that it makes sense to delay that. 
   As the gentleman from Maryland knows, I supported the SCHIP bill. I think we need to reauthorize the SCHIP program, but I am reluctant to do that with so many Members gone and also with our Californians dealing with critical problems in their district. 
   I would echo my colleague from Texas' sentiments and ask that the leadership consider delaying this vote and this debate until early next week.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Ten years ago, the Children's Health Insurance Program passed with a Republican Congress and a Democratic President. Now we are trying to reauthorize it with a Democratic Congress and a Republican President. We should be able to do this, and we should be able to do it in a bipartisan way. 
   The Children's Health Insurance Program has reduced the number of uninsured children in this country and has given them access to primary care. They live healthier lives because of it. This is not a great bill, but it is a good bill; and I have supported this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support it again today. 
   In particular, it phases out the participation of adults in this program. This program is for kids, for low-income kids, not for adults. And successive administrations have been approving the admission of adults to the program, and that was not its intent. 
   New Mexico in particular will benefit from this program because it allows lower income kids to be participants in the program. Because of an anomaly of the original law, New Mexico's lowest income kids are not eligible for this program. I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill today.

   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I want to let my colleagues know that I will be asking for a recorded vote on the previous question on this rule. 
   We have a problem, a very serious problem that we must address before the House adjourns in August, and this resolution which we have done before does not deal with the real issues that this House must address because of the threat that we face. 
   If the previous question is defeated, I will offer an amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that clarifies one very simple and critical thing, that the United States Government will no longer be required to get a warrant to listen to terrorists who are not in the United States. 
   The Director of National Intelligence has testified to us, as has the director of the CIA, that their hands are currently tied. They are being tied up, requiring warrants with probable cause, to listen to people who are terrorists who are not even in the United States because of the way the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is written. 
   We cannot allow ourselves to be deaf and blind because of a law that is woefully outdated. All of us have heard what the Department of Homeland Security has said, the chatter is at levels we have not seen since the summer of 2001. And the Director of National Intelligence has testified we are missing significant portions of intelligence. We have to open our ears and open our eyes to keep this Nation safe. That is the critical issue we should be debating here today. And if we defeat the previous question, I will immediately offer that for the consideration of the House.

   This motion to recommit would do one very simple and vital thing that is critical to the security of this country, more critical than the underlying resolution itself, and I am begging you and pleading with you to take up this issue. 
   The motion to recommit would do a very simple thing. It would say that the United States can listen to phone conversations of terrorists overseas without a warrant. Why does that matter?

<TEXT>
   Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to vote against the rule for the consideration of this conference report. And if the rule is defeated, this House should turn its immediate attention to a critical problem facing this country. 
   We have the perfect opportunity here, and the conferees had a perfect opportunity to add the most important action that this Congress must take, before we leave in August, into this conference report, and that is critical reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   The problem is what this bill does not do. It is the perfect vehicle, the perfect train leaving the station to get a bill down to the President and get his signature immediately on foreign intelligence surveillance reform. But it's going to go to the President without the most critical piece of legislation that we should be working on. This is our responsibility, to fix the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   Just yesterday, the Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, wrote to the members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and in his letter he said, ``Simply put, in a significant number of cases, we are in a position of having to obtain court orders to effectively collect foreign intelligence about foreign targets located overseas.'' 
   He went on to say, ``in short, resource allocation is not the fundamental issue we face in this area, but instead a fundamental problem with a law that requires modification to ensure we are protecting America, while respecting the privacy rights of Americans.'' 
   ``It is essential,'' he said, ``that the administration and Congress work together and without delay to close the current intelligence gap by amending the FISA statute.'' 
   The responsibility is here in this body to fix this law as quickly as possible, without delay, to make sure that we can listen to foreigners in foreign countries who are using our communications networks to plot to kill us. 
   This House has failed to act. I, again, call on the leadership of the Democratic Party and to the Speaker of the House, personally, before we adjourn for August, to bring FISA reform legislation to this floor, and I would ask my colleagues to oppose the rule.
