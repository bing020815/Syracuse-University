   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, the President lifted the executive ban on offshore oil and natural gas exploration last week, and now Congress, this Democrat-led Congress, is what stands in the way of increased domestic supply and lower prices. 
   Well, instead of taking steps toward a solution, the House Democrat leadership has said ``no'' to the American people: go buy a hybrid, take a subway to work. Well, in my Seventh District of Tennessee, that doesn't work, because mass transit is not there. 
   Congress should open up ANWR, the Outer Continental Shelf, and should promote the construction of oil refineries and nuclear power plants. We need a short-, a mid-range and long-term solution. We should provide tax incentives for American families to purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles and to promote energy innovation and efficiency. 
   Republicans have offered a bill that includes all of the above, promoting American-made energy in the short-, mid-, and long-range plan. 
   Let's solve this problem, Madam Speaker. It requires action now.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership on this issue. Indeed, he understands how the people of our great Nation, and certainly of my district of Tennessee, are suffering with the increase in the price at the pump that they have seen since January of 2007. In my district of Tennessee, this has changed. So I have come to the floor today to oppose this bill because it is the wrong bill at the wrong time. 
   And one of the things that we have come to realize, and I think it's been a painful realization for many people, is they have watched the Democrat leadership of this House. They have seen that the Democrat majority is not wanting to take the action that is necessary to address the issue, whether we're talking about short term for immediate relief, mid-range so that we  can address what is coming next, and then long term so that little children, like my new grandson who is 2 months old, will have a consistent steady and dependable energy supply. 
   Indeed, releasing a portion of the SPR is the wrong move now. Americans are wanting to see American solutions and American exploration take place to address this issue. 
   Congress has the ability to do that, and we continue to be blocked from taking the necessary actions by the liberal leadership that is choosing to not take the actions necessary to address this. 
   Our Nation is being placed at risk. Not only our energy security, but our national security is placed at risk by the actions of a kick-the-can Congress who wants to just finish it out, get away for an August recess, and not address the issue at hand. At $4 a gallon, the price at the pump, indeed it is time for us to take action.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, you know, it is so interesting serving on the Health Subcommittee at Energy and Commerce, and one of the things that we look at and are very concerned about, 11 years from now the Medicare trust fund could go bankrupt. That's what we hear from the trustees. Health care spending is going to be 20 percent of the GDP as we go through the next 10 years. 
   And here we had a trigger, something that is a nugget of good government that is put into an entitlement bill. And look at what is happening? This is what you're wanting to take away. It is put there to look at the long-term solvency of this problem. And that is one of the things that we hear from our constituents every day. They have their money that they have earned, that they are putting in every month so that Medicare will be there for them when they retire. 
   And what do they get from you all? You're not wanting to come in and address this issue. You want to pull the trigger back. 
   I think it is irresponsible. I do think it is an abdication of our responsibility, and I would encourage those here to oppose that resolution.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, as we begin to talk about our national security and our troops and the surge and the success of that and why our troops choose to defend this great Nation, I want to stop and just join Mr. Gingrey in congratulating his mother on her 90th birthday. Certainly, Helen Cecelia Gingrey sounds like the type of woman that truly takes a leadership role, first of all, in her family and role models that leadership and how to carry that out in how to encourage children to dream big dreams and have great adventures in their life and to desire that. 
   That is something you learn at a mother's knee. That is something you see role modeled by parents, and Mr. Speaker, that is something that we need to keep in mind as we are here on the floor of the House in this body, as we make decisions about how our Nation moves forward in this 21st century.  
   We need to remember that there are future generations that are relying on us to be certain that this Nation stays secure. There are future generations that are looking to us that go every single day and say, what will my tomorrow be like? Is my community going to be secure? What is America going to look like when I am 20, when I'm 30, when I get ready to retire? 
   We would do well to be mindful of that every single day as we make decisions that affect America's families and realize, yes, indeed, those families are our greatest treasure. Those precious minds of those precious children are indeed what we are to be protecting and be certain that they have the ability to dream those big dreams. 
   So to Dr. Gingrey's mom, Helen Gingrey, happy birthday. We all congratulate you, and we are so pleased that we live in a free Nation and we can stand on the floor of this House and celebrate those birthdays and join your son in wishing you happy birthday and many, many more. 
   Mr. Speaker, I recently did return from a trip to Afghanistan and Iraq to visit with our troops. And tonight I want to spend some time talking about what has been going on in Iraq and the success that we have seen there, the success that our troops have brought to bear on Iraq and on the environment that is there. 
   Just about 3 weeks ago, we had the 1-year anniversary of the surge, and everyone had a lot to say about that surge and a lot to say about how successful they thought it would or would not be. I think, Mr. Speaker, it's very easy for us to be Monday morning quarterbacks or armchair quarterbacks and to always have our opinion of how we think these things are going to work out. 
   The 101st is in my district in Tennessee. We also have the National Guardsmen from our State that have been deployed, Reservists who have been deployed, and we would always say we need to be listening to the troops that are in the field and the commanders that are there on the ground. 
   We saw a change about a year ago. The change was in the form of the surge. The implementation of that surge was carried out by General David Petraeus. He was joined by Ambassador Crocker as they moved forward with the preparations and the implementation of that surge, and we have seen results. 
   Over the December and January period of time, we had the opportunity to visit, and I am pleased to be joined tonight by my colleague from Texas (Mr. Burgess) who has been on the ground in Iraq several times, I think six times he has been to visit our troops in Iraq. And he wanted to join me tonight for a few minutes and talk about what he saw and give a firsthand account of what he saw. 
   I'm so pleased that he has chosen to join us because one of the things our troops mentioned to us on our trip was, We are fighting every day. We are in a war. And we are winning significant battles every single day. And we want the American people to know we are fighting. We are giving it our all, and yes, indeed, we are winning every day. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I think it's important for us to realize that a lot of times, success comes in odd ways. Progress comes in unexpected ways. And it is not just on a trajectory where every day is better and better and better. We take a few steps forward, we take a few steps back. We take a few more steps forward, we take a little step back. But when you add it up, you are trending the right direction. 
   That is certainly what we have seen in the success of the surge. We have seen every major news outlet declare it a success. The American people know that it is a success. And our troops are to be commended for that success. Certainly, the President was right in making that commendation last night. 
   As I said a moment ago, Dr. Burgess from Texas who's been to Iraq six times wants to join us and share his impressions of what he saw on the ground in Iraq, and I yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I would like to put that photo back up, if you do not mind. 
   Now, I think it is significant that you're talking about Ramadi, which is in al Anbar Province. And you're talking about a photo that was made during the summer, July 14, 2007, which is the photo stamp date that is there on the photo. And if I am picking all of this up, it looks like tools and implements that are hanging in the ceiling of the shop, and plastic buckets, rubber buckets, and probably some plastic hampers that are there. And when I was in Iraq, I noticed that there was lots of produce that was also being sold in some of the shops. 
   But one of the things that is of interest to me is the photo that you're showing indicates to us that we do have import and export that is taking place, and we do have commerce that is taking place. And so, as you were on that street in Ramadi, how many shops did you see; do you remember a number? How many were lining the street? And how far did you drive from the base into town to begin to see this type of commerce and the happy kids that are obviously learning how to do a little bit of retail merchant work there? 
   I yield back to the gentleman.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for yielding back the time. And I am so pleased to see these pictures. And I appreciate so much his participation in this, and the conversation about the establishment of commerce and how he witnessed this firsthand with shops that were open. As he said, one little side street where they went there were about 12 shops that were on that. And indeed, these are more like stalls that we would have at one of our swap meets or flea markets. But as you can see, they're full of kids that are happy, that are playing, that are enjoying being around the normalcy of a life. They are full of commerce and goods, items that are coming in for sale. We even saw soft drinks, Coca-Cola. In Afghanistan, we saw cell phones that were being sold. So, in this region of the world, the commerce that is there on the ground. 
   And in talking about Iraq, the gentleman mentioned the local stability. And indeed, that was something we had the opportunity to witness, also, and we're pleased to see that. We had a visit to Urbil in Kurdistan, had the opportunity to go to the home of the Prime Minister of Kurdistan. We drove to that home. Mr. Speaker, I want to be certain that everyone realizes what I just said. We drove to the home of the Prime Minister of Kurdistan for lunch and joined him where he thanked us profusely for all that the U.S. Armed Forces have done for that region, not only in the past few years, but for the decade prior. 
   While we were in Iraq, we had the opportunity to go to the home of Deputy Prime Minister Barzani, to his home in the Green Zone to meet with him. And I will tell you, we visited with him about how hopeful we had experienced the mood of the people. There is a sense of hope that things are getting better, that there is a return to normalcy in their everyday life, and how encouraging to us it was to witness this hopefulness. 
   His comment to us was, we know that sometimes people get frustrated with us, but do not give up this mission. Do not give up on this mission because things are trending the right direction. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, it's all important components in winning, in having Iraq be a nation that can function with some predictability, stability and self-governance. 
   It is also important because, as we look at defeating terrorists who want to defeat us, it is important that we win the war of ideas. And the photos that Dr. Burgess shared with us, the young men in those photos, we have to win the war of ideas with them to reach them, to make certain that over the next decade, as they begin an adult life, that they make a choice to live in freedom rather than choosing a life under a dictator. 
   Indeed, our job is also to make certain that our troops have what they need to do their job. And that is a responsibility of this House, as the President said last night. And certainly, as we are in the midst of a swing, a dramatic swing, if you will, in the momentum in Iraq, especially on the security situation, it is imperative that we pay close attention to meeting the needs of those troops. 
   Now, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, I will tell you, I do not think it is helpful to this situation that we debated over 30 different resolutions about Iraq and timelines and withdrawals and trying to micromanage what is taking place on the ground because there has been a swing and a shift. We have transitioned from 2.5 years of increases in violence with more than 24 weeks of a steady decline. 
   Now, Dr. Burgess mentioned, when we go to Iraq, and I want to clarify one thing here before I move on, this week I had the opportunity to visit with the Tennessee Marine Family Association, and what a wonderful, wonderful group of moms and dads and brothers and sisters and marines who have retired from active duty. And I enjoyed my time with them tremendously. And one of them said, you know, tell me, when you go to Iraq, why do you go? And are you taking the troops' time away from work in the field? And I said no, we go because we are asked to go, especially those of us that have posts. As I've said, Fort Campbell, the 101st is in my district, and they invite us and ask us to come and see how they are carrying out their mission and experience that firsthand with them.     
   But as Dr. Burgess said, when we make those trips, we have the power points and we have the briefings from the commanders on the ground and we have the opportunity while we are there to hold a town hall meeting, if you will, with our troops that are deployed and are carrying out this mission. So I have put some of that endless power point onto some charts that I would like to share with those who are watching us this evening. 
   The first chart that I'm going to show you is one that comes from our commanders there in Iraq, and it shows their assessment of al Qaeda Iraq. And many times people will see AQI, that is, the abbreviation for al Qaeda Iraq, and where they were when the surge began last year. And you can see the dark red areas. It shows where they were operating, and the pink areas show what were their transit routes. And you can see how in the city of Baghdad where they were operating, and then as you look at the country you can see where they were transiting in and out of the country and then where they were holding their primary areas of operation. Again, the pink shading is their transit areas, and the red is where they were operational and where they were working. And the inset is Baghdad and what we saw in Baghdad and how that looked before the surge began. 
   Now I want to move to the second chart and show you what this looks like today. This is what Iraq looks like today. And, again, this is not my chart. This is a chart from our commanders on the ground in Iraq. This is their assessment.  
   So, Mr. Speaker, to the American people that are watching this tonight, I will simply say this is the chart that is your commanders' assessment of where al Qaeda is as of December 2007. And, of course, al Qaeda is still a threat. Of course, they are still there. But as you can see, by looking at the pink areas and the red areas, this has been diminished. They have been pushed out of the urban centers, look at the inset, with Baghdad. You can see where they have been squeezed down and where they have been moved to and how much smaller their area of operation is and how much smaller their transit area is. They know that the Iraqi people, the Iraqi forces, and the U.S. Armed Forces and our coalition forces mean business on this. 
   Look at the map of the entire country. When you can see their egress, ingress with the surrounding countries, and then see the pockets where al Qaeda Iraq is still operational. So they have been pushed out of many of the urban areas, and they have been moved over into some of the isolated rural areas. 
   I want to touch base too on our troops' contribution to this because it has been significant. Our U.S. Armed Forces and the 30,000 that went in for the surge made a marked difference. And I think there is, of course, the physical strength that our troops brought to this, the firepower, if you will, and the training and the strength and the determination. There are no better forces on the face of the Earth than the U.S. military. And we also have to recognize the Iraqis and the force that they brought to bear on this. 
   When we talk about the surge, sometimes many of us think only in terms of the 30,000 of our troops that have led the way in this fight. What we have to realize also is that we have 110,000 Iraqi troops that have lent their power to this effort, 110,000. They were joined in this effort by 70,000 local citizens. 
   Dr. Burgess mentioned earlier the local stability, and there is a reason for that. You had 70,000 Iraqi citizens that basically banded together in what we would call a ``neighborhood watch,'' and they decided to take things into their own hands and to take responsibility. And in many of these areas in the surge the Iraqi troops would lead. They were coached. They were trained. They were supported in so many ways by our U.S. military and by our coalition forces. And the local Iraqi citizen groups would work with those military forces, those combined forces. So together you had 180,000 Iraqis working with our 30,000 U.S. troops that have made this surge successful and have changed that map so that it looks today like it does, with al Qaeda being moved into some isolated areas and with more of the country being able to function with a sense of normalcy. 
   Now, we've already talked a little bit about al Anbar province and the success that was there because that is where al Qaeda Iraq had planted its flag. It was the capital of the caliphate, and that is where they were going to put down roots, if you will. What we saw happen in al Anbar province during the surge, I think, is just nothing short of remarkable, and the photos that you've just seen from the streets of Ramadi and the commerce that was taking place and the difference that the surge has made there. Basically, the citizens of Ramadi and al Anbar province said we are sick and tired of this. We do not want al Qaeda Iraq to be running the show in our town. So they joined with the Iraqi troops and the U.S. troops, and they literally threw al Qaeda out. 
   So many of the experts tell us that this is the first place that the Arab people have stood up to their own and have rejected, openly rejected, al Qaeda and have defeated al Qaeda. And I think that that is significant. And, Mr. Speaker, I believe and I certainly am hopeful in believing that we are going to see other areas follow the lead that al Anbar has set. 
   Now, we have seen some other effects of that team effort over the past year, and I want to move on to a couple of other charts. Now, this is the overall attack trends, Iraq attack trends; and it shows you what has happened, if you look from December 2006, and where your attacks were in December 2006, with over 5,000, and then you go up into April and May where they reach their height, and then you can see where they have dropped down, less than half, and the reduction that is there. It is actually down about 60 percent by the time you get to December 2007. That is the difference that the surge has made. From December 2006, where you're up above 5,000 attacks and then coming down where you have seen that number drop by about 60 percent. That's the difference that the surge has made in the overall attacks. 
   Well, let's look at the IED explosions. This is something that our constituents always ask us about because they hear so much about the explosive devices and the way these IEDs and these IED systems are developed and set up and the way those explosions are carried out. 
   You can see, if you go in here and you look at December 2006, where they are. They move up in June to a high of about 1,700, and then take a look over here, about 700 in December. And there you go from beginning to the end of surge, the year of the surge, and what you have seen. It is almost as if you have al Qaeda jumping in here and saying we're not going to let them get the best of us. They give it a shot, and then in June look how every single month you're dropping. And that's the difference that a year of the surge has made. 
   Let's move on to another figure on this chart, the killed-in-action figure. And as we look at this chart and we see the dramatic drop that is here, Mr. Speaker, we feel so deeply for the families that have experienced a loss, and at Fort Campbell we have seen some losses recently, and we just continue to hold those families close. And we are grateful, so grateful, to them for their service, for their sacrifice, and we grieve with them in those losses. And we know that over the course of the year we have seen a dramatic decrease in those losses. 
   Now, chart number six, the Iraqi civilian deaths attributed to violence, these have dropped significantly. And you can see in December 2006, where we were at about 3,000 and then where we are way down, well under 1,000 by the time we get to December 2007. So this shows us how security is improving. Ethnosectarian violence has dropped by about 85 percent. All of these are the right type trend. And it shows how things are moving a little bit at a time, moving in the right direction. 
   We know there are no guarantees. This is tough. Our military men and women know that they are fighting and winning every day. But, Mr. Speaker, I will tell you they do know that they are seeing some successes, that security is improving, and that they are seeing some success with economic issues. And I want to give you just a couple of examples of these. 
   I had made a comment as we were leaving Baghdad the other night, and it was in the evening; so you could see the lights in Baghdad. I had been going in and out to visit our troops since 2003, and for the first time it really looked like a city. You could see the lights on all over the city and cars driving on the streets. You could see outdoor restaurants. You could see colorful awnings. You could see fruit stands and market areas. And it really was beginning to look like a city. And I did a little checking to see what kind of success stories we could find with the work that USAID and some of our organizations are providing to the area to see that commerce stand up and that sense of normalcy return. So let me tell you a quick little story, Mr. Speaker, and I think this is great. 
   We love success stories. We love it when we have someone who by their bootstraps pulls themselves up and realizes a wonderful dream of having a business or building a company. We as Americans love that entrepreneurial spirit. And I loved this story of Amhed who is in the Mansour neighborhood in Baghdad, and he was able to get a $2,500 microgrant. Now, I know many of our constituents may have been reading in the paper about some of the microgrants and the microbusinesses that are going into Iraq and other countries also to help entrepreneurs start these businesses. 
   Well, Amhed used his grant to buy chest freezer shelves and an awning to open a store. And the store is now self-sufficient. It is supporting him and his family. He now is a merchant with his store, his produce store, on a corner there in the Mansour neighborhood in Baghdad. And it came about because there was a grant that helped him to get that store in place.  
   Now, this is important, Mr. Speaker, because you wouldn't go take out a loan and you wouldn't be approved for that loan if there was not the ability to put things in place and begin to see some success in that neighborhood.     
   Well, we also have another one, a juice merchant, that used a USAID microfinance grant and opened a juice factory in Baghdad. There's lots of pomegranate juice and orange juice and the different juices they are beginning to manufacture and bottle and sell. This juice factory in Baghdad, with a microfinance grant from our USAID, has created 24 full-time jobs in Baghdad. That one little grant. And that gentleman is now making that juice. Of course, I said, well, I hope that Ahmed is one of the customers of the juice factory and selling that juice in his store on the corner, his produce store on the corner. 
   Now, I know that there are some who want to say that the security improvements aren't meaningful because we are not seeing enough political progress in Iraq. I will tell you that, and I think we all agree, that that political progress has not moved forward as quickly as we would like to. But we were reminded last week as we visited with Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus that the Washington clock and the Baghdad clock move at different speeds. You know, I guess that as impatient as many times as we are, we do have to realize this is a country that was under a dictator, a very brutal dictator for over three decades. 
   We are beginning to see some very encouraging signs of political progress, and I think this year is going to be a year when we see some more of that. Just over a week ago, the Iraqi Parliament did pass what was for them a very difficult law. They have taken a long time to look at de-Ba'athification reform, and that was passed. It has been difficult for them to address that central question of how the Iraqi people are going to deal with their past and with the legacy of Saddam Hussein. 
   The law has gone through their parliament, and it has passed. It was passed with Shiite sponsorship, which is significant. We have also seen some key Sunni political blocks return to parliament, to return to their work to be a part of the process. 
   Those are very encouraging steps. They are steps in the right direction. Certainly, the success of the surge has allowed the ability for this to take place. We have also seen the Iraqi Government has developed and is working on an ambitious budget. We are certainly hoping that they are going to do the same thing as they work through this current year. We have seen some encouraging signs of critical power sharing arrangements within the Iraqi Government. Their Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki, is apparently more willing to share power with the three-person presidency council, which represents each of the major sects in Iraq. So that is another sign that is very encouraging to us. 
   Anybody who is a serious and objective observer can say that the surge has worked. They admit that. We know that we are going to face more debate in the coming year over the length and nature and the size of our mission in Iraq. I would encourage all of my colleagues to take the success of the surge to heart and to be certain that they are not trying to snatch a defeat from the jaws of victory, but that they are being fair to our troops, that they are recognizing the success that these troops have given us in the surge, and that they are taking time to commend and thank the troops and the commanders that are on the ground. 
   I think it's fair to say, Mr. Speaker, that we all, I know I certainly appreciate those troops and their families, and I appreciate having the opportunity to support them and to let them know how much I appreciate having that opportunity to support them and also to honor them and to honor their families. My hope is that as we go through 2008 and as we look at our legislative agenda, Mr. Speaker, I hope that the work of this body will honor those men and women who honor us every single day, who honor the legacy of freedom every single day by the way that they choose to carry out their job and by the way they choose to represent this great Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the bill. And I will tell you, I have great respect for the chairman and the author of the bill, but I respectfully disagree with them on this issue. 
   I've also served as an active volunteer with the Lung Association and with the Cancer Society and have worked diligently to stop teen smoking, but I disagree with the approach that is being taken here today. 
   Rather than forcing the ill-equipped FDA to regulate tobacco products, Congress should strengthen existing programs to prevent illegal tobacco use. And now the gentleman from Texas mentioned the Synar program. And I have had a piece of legislation, H.R. 5513, the Stop Adolescent Smoking Without Excessive Bureaucracy Act, that is a better solution and I think a better approach. It strengthens the existing work that the States and localities are doing to reduce underage tobacco use. It is an effective existing program. 
   My bill directly impacts youth access to tobacco products, which gets to the very root of the public health crisis that is brought about by the addiction of tobacco. 
   According to a recent Zogby poll, a majority of Americans, 82 percent, believe FDA control of tobacco would conflict with their core mission to secure the Nation's food and drug supply. And Madam Speaker, at a time when people are concerned about imported and domestic food, imported and domestic drugs, medical devices, and more, it is important that the FDA focus on that mission. 
   Consumers believe FDA product approval equals safety. And here we are talking about moving FDA control of tobacco and tobacco products and giving that the FDA seal of approval. I think that is a step we do not want to take.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a strong supporter of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, and I support a responsible reauthorization of this very successful program. 
   Everybody knows it is going to expire on September 30, unless Congress passes reauthorizing legislation by this date. However, the Democrat leadership in the House and the Senate have been unsuccessful in completing the package. 
   I am proud today to stand as an original cosponsor of legislation that would reauthorize SCHIP for a period of 18 months. By reauthorizing the program for an additional 18 months, we are taking the politics out of SCHIP policy and protecting the children who  are in this program and who deserve the care. It is an extension of the program that we need; and, if it is not enacted, at least 12 States are going to find themselves without SCHIP funds. 
   There is a very simple solution to the SCHIP problem: Support the Barton-Deal SCHIP legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, we in America are at an energy crossroad. Now, one road will lead to price controls and a potential energy crisis that would remind us of the 1970s. The other would lead to cutting-edge technology that will provide affordable, reliable energy for decades to come. 
   Yet, the liberal leadership in this House has chosen to revert to the 1970s and repeat that history. Today, the Energy appropriations bill under consideration will underfund nuclear production by $20 million in one account, hydroelectric power by $20 million in another account, and other forms of American productivity by hundreds of millions of dollars. 
   And where does the money go? Well, it goes to fund research for climate change in another bow to the religion of global warming. 
   And in coordination with other House and some Senate legislation, we find out that some of these proposals could end up raising the price of a gallon of gas over the next couple of decades to $6 a gallon. 
   We need to focus on energy independence today. It is what the American people want.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY OF THE LATE ROBIN BEARD -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to make the body aware of the loss of our colleague and friend, Robin Beard, former Congressman from the old Sixth District, who passed away last Saturday. His district basically overlapped with the current Seventh District of Tennessee. He served in this body from 1973 until 1983. 
   Robin Beard really had a storied and amazing life in which he dedicated himself to public service, and he did love it. 
   He received a B.A. in history from Vanderbilt in 1962. He was a veteran, serving 4 years in the Marine Corps, where he was a Marine Corps officer in charge of the Gemini IV offshore recovery mission, and attained the rank of lieutenant colonel. 
   While in Congress, he served on the Armed Services Committee. He was a strong supporter of and friend to Fort Campbell, which was located in both his district and mine. 
   He was appointed by the House Speaker as a congressional advisor to the Strategic Arms Negotiations in Geneva and the U.N. General Assembly Special Session on Disarmament. 
   He also served as an assistant Republican whip, was cochairman of the Republican Research Committee on Defense, and an executive committee member of the Republican Study Committee. 
   His expertise extended to domestic issues, and he served as an executive committee member of the Congressional Task Force on Economic Policy. 
   After leaving Congress, he continued to serve the public, twice named as NATO Deputy Secretary General. 
   He is being laid to rest today in the Protestant French Huguenot Church in Charleston, South Carolina. 
   He is survived by his wife, Cathy, two children and five grandchildren. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner).

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, one of the things that we know is that the Federal Government does spend too much money. We all hear it from our constituents. They are really aggravated with the amount of spending that they see coming out of this town, and there is a good reason for that. It is because it is their money. They earn that money and they send it to Washington, and then there is a lot of aggravation with how we choose to spend their hard-earned dollars. 
   And the gentleman is so correct in his amendment, moving this back to last year's levels. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, one of the things that we know is it would give a $1.3 billion savings for the American taxpayer, and we know that principles like this and operations like this work. When you go through spending reduction, it works. 
   Our States are great labs for finding ways to find efficiencies in government, and there's a reason for that. It's because many of our States have balanced budget amendments. And many of our States have frozen at previous years' levels, or they've been reduced 1 percent, 2 percent or 5 percent across the board. 
   And what they have found out is that, in their operations, they can move in and find efficiencies and find ways to seek a savings, and still have the same caliber and quality of program that they have had. But, Mr. Chairman, one of the things that they do find is that many times those programs are more effective. 
   So I commend Mr. Jordan for the work that he has done to find a $1.3 billion savings to make certain that the pressure is there on these departments to live within their means, to try to do our best, to avoid what the Democrats are wanting to pass, which is the single largest tax increase in history, and to make certain that we give a message to our constituents that we have heard them and we agree with them. Government spends too much of their hard-earned money.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   The distinguished majority leader just mentioned that it is a debate about life, and, indeed, this is a debate about substance, Mr. Speaker, and it is also a debate about life, clear and simple, and protecting life. Because this bill would divert funds from promising leads of adult stem cell research that have shown large benefits, even one of those of being a cure for Type I diabetes, something that we hear about and there has been tremendous research on. It has shown remarkable promise, and this is a great example, in using immature brain cells and eyelet cells from living donors to develop the insulin-producing eyelet cells that are found lacking in people with diabetes. And by using these from living donors or adult brain cells, instead of embryos, science now has the potential to cure diabetes. It is a great example and lesson for us as we talk about the research that is going on with cord blood, with adult stem cells, and now we are learning with skin cells, producing results. 
   Let's not stop funding this research in order to chase after something else. Let's continue to do productive, results-producing research on which we all agree. And, as we do this, let's protect the sanctity of human life and not cheapen our efforts by disrespecting that life. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against Senate bill 5.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, sales and marketing is my career field, and I know a little bit about the branding of products and the value that is there, and sometimes the name of the product or the idea can make or break the success of the product. Marketing is not always about the product. Sometimes it is about selling a slogan. 
   Yesterday we debated the Human Cloning Prohibition Act, which sounds good, right? No one wants human cloning. But what this bill does is just a very clever marketing ploy that sounds good, but leaves open Pandora's box to a world of dangerous interpretation. 
   Let's make it clear: All this ban does is to prohibit a clone from living inside a mother's womb. It doesn't ban destroying clones from experimentation, just for human life. So that is good. 
   But how would this House leadership react when a woman breaks a law and decides to have a cloned embryo inserted into her womb? Would they force her to abort the clone inside of her? 
   Columnist Charles Krauthammer, a prominent supporter of embryonic stem cell research, says, ``This practice sanctions the most ghoulish and dangerous enterprise in modern scientific history, the creation of cloned human life for the sole purpose of destroying them in the name of science.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, life is a gift, not a science experiment. Let us have the decency in this Chamber to treat it as such. I strongly opposed the bill and urge all those that believe in the beauty of life to do the same.  
   Today, we debate embryonic stem cell research. Republicans are often categorized as opposing stem cell research. The truth is that Federal funding for stem cell research has increased by 60 percent since 2004 and was nonexistent before 2001. I support ethical scientific research when it does not depend on the destruction of life and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, how pleased I am to join the gentleman from California and my Republican Study Committee colleagues in this special order hour. As we talk about the budget and we really begin to focus on some of the components in this budget, you know, I think that many of my Republican Study Committee colleagues are interested in digging into this document, and their constituents are well served by that, like the gentleman from Tennessee talking about his First District constituents who are logging on to his Web site, who are looking at this budget. And certainly we want to direct people to the Republican Study Committee Web site. Here it is: RSC@mail.house.gov. We will be happy to point out some of the fallacies. 
   Our colleagues across the aisle like to talk about fiscal responsibility, but then they don't practice it. They don't practice what they preach. And we have appropriately dubbed the work that the Democrats are doing as the ``Hold on to your wallet Congress'' because they are definitely coming to a pocket near you. And they want more of your money. That is one thing that you can basically take that IOU to the bank. They are going to try to cash it in. It is in the form of your hardearned dollars. So RSC@mail.house.gov. We invite everybody to work with us through this process. We want to be certain that we have your ideas. And we know, as the gentleman from Tennessee was saying, as Ronald Reagan, so many times has said, government doesn't have a revenue problem. It has a spending problem. Government never gets enough of your money. You know, one of the things that I have repeatedly done in my town hall meetings is to say, how much is enough? How much is enough for government to tax? What is the ceiling? When are they going to say, we have got it, we are flush with money? We all know that, and I will yield to the gentleman for comment.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. If the gentleman will yield, that is an excellent point, because every dollar we spend is not ours. It is not the government's. It is the taxpayers'. And this is a government of, by and for the people. It is not a government of the government. 
   And our friends across the aisle, through the New Deal, through the great society, putting all of these programs that sound good, that really answered a lot of questions and needs, you know, they put these in place, and then it grows and grows and grows. And then you have a big, big bureaucracy, and the bureaucracy becomes unresponsive. And the constituents want accountability with that. 
   I had at one point said, you know, it reminded me very much of The Little Shop of Horrors, that stage play that we have all seen. And the plant grows and grows and grows, and then finally it says, feed me more, Seymour, and it envelops everything because that is what the government is saying to the American taxpayer, feed me more. 
   We have an expert who is with us on so many of our family budget matters, our Republican Study Committee, RSC, chairman, Mr. Hensarling of Texas, and I will yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, you know, we are discussing national security every single day on the floor of this House, and our Border Patrol agents seem to be the forgotten soldiers fighting this war on terror. They guard our border every single day and protect our country from terrorists, from human traffickers, from drug traffickers. 
   Former Border Patrol agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean were recently convicted of shooting a drug smuggler while they were patrolling and protecting the border. Then they were sentenced to a decade in prison. You may have read that our own U.S. Attorney had this drug smuggler brought from Mexico, gave him immunity to testify against our agents, and then the smuggler was released. 
   Now the drug smuggler is suing the U.S. Government for damages. As soon as Agent Ramos began his sentence in a Federal prison, he was assaulted by drug smugglers and drug users who were inmates in that prison. Ramos was doing his duty, protecting Americans from the thugs and the drug smugglers. Now we have failed to protect him.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from California, and I thank him for his insightfulness on the immigration issue. 
   He has done so much work in his service in this Congress addressing this issue and encouraging people to look at the issue, to learn about the issue and to realize it is more than just a surface issue. 
   I also have appreciated the fact that the gentleman has encouraged people to realize the compassionate thing to do in this is to make certain that we keep immigration legal and that we honor the men and women who have gone through the process legally. 
   That is important to do, and it is the right step 
   It is the compassionate step to make. 
   H.R. 1314 addresses the issue that Mr. Bilbray mentioned and referenced as he opened his remarks about those that have entered the country illegally, getting access to our financial markets. Now, H.R. 1314 is the Photo Identification Security Act. This is a great piece of legislation. It is not a lengthy bill, it is one that I think everybody here in the House can pick up and read in 1 or 2 minutes. As you see, it is only about three pages. 
   What it does is something very big and very important, though, it closes a loophole that exists in the PATRIOT Act and the IRS regulations, and it is through that loophole that you could literally drive a truck. That is the  loophole that we know that not only illegal immigrants use, but sexual predators and identity thieves, those people that want to be anonymous, that need to be anonymous, that have to be anonymous to the legal system. This is what they are choosing to use to gain access to banking institutions, to wire transfer services from the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury, the IRS. It is giving them the ability to sign up for credit cards, to get home mortgages, to obtain taxpayer identification numbers, which employers call ITEN numbers, and to transfer money from this country back to Mexico. 
   This is a difficult situation for our country, because we have spent a lot of time, effort and energy trying to seek out terrorist groups and those that would do us harm. We are spending a lot of time, effort and energy talking about protecting intellectual property and looking at money laundering and how those pirates are laundering money and sending it back out of the country, taking money out of our communities. 
   We are spending a lot of time routing out identity thieves. Certainly in my community I hear from so many people who have had their identity lifted. They have had it stolen. They have had somebody take that from them, and then these individuals want to go open checking accounts, they want to go open credit cards and run up the number, just swipe those numbers off that credit card, run it ragged. 
   Somebody pays the bill, and it always comes back to being the American taxpayer that is going to pay the bill for fraud and for misuse. Happens every single time, every single time. This is a very serious problem to the faith that people have in our governing institutions. It is a serious problem to the stability of our financial markets. But there is a solution to this problem, and it is H.R. 1314, the Photo Identification Security Act. 
   As I said, it is a very simple bill, and I will do three things. It says in order to access our nation's financial services, in order to do business with the Federal Government, you have to present one of the three secure forms of ID as recognized in this country. 
   Number one would be a Social Security card with a government-issued State or Federal government issued photo ID. This could be a driver's license, if you are from a State that complies with the REAL ID Act. 
   Then you have got number two, a U.S. passport or a foreign nation passport. That would be a passport that we recognize, that we have a reciprocity agreement with. 
   The third form of ID would be a US citizenship and immigration service photo ID card. Now, that would be your USCIS permanent resident card, permanent alien card, work card, green card. Simply put, you have to have a visa before you can apply for a visa if this legislation passes, and we are encouraging everyone to join us in this. We are encouraging everyone, both parties, both Houses, to sign on, let's close this loophole and close it quickly. 
   I was talking to one of my constituents about this problem after it had arisen, it was a banker, in rural west Tennessee in my district. He was excited that we were working on this bill and thrilled that we were going to be closing this loophole. He looked at it like this, he told me a story of a couple of his customers, they had worked at a local plant, both had retired. 
   Then they decided they wanted to buy a motor home, which they did, good customers at the bank, so they get the motor home. They decide to start travelling. 
   Well, they needed a credit card to make reservations at those campgrounds. This banker could not get them a credit card because they had never had a credit card. They had a checking account. They had pretty much operated on cash, they had retired, they were now unemployed. They could not qualify for a credit card. 
   So, when the scandal began that we had major iconic banks in this country issuing credit cards to those that had illegally entered this country, as long as they were willing to put $100 in a checking account and leave it there for a month, then they could get a $500 credit card, that gentleman, that good, solid, patriotic American man that has worked for a company, retired from a company and wanted to enjoy his retirement years, walked into that bank, and he asked that banker, do I need to be an illegal immigrant just to get a credit card in this country? 
   That is the right question for him to ask. That is how ludicrous the practice is and how horrific it is that we would have these big banks, big banks, big iconic companies that have benefitted from the prosperity of this great Nation to play favorites and to say, all right, if you are an illegal immigrant, if you want to put $100 in over here, I am going to give you a $500 credit card. 
   Basically, I will tell you, that is predatory lending. Basically, that is a pretty high interest rate to go get a credit card, but that is the way we are doing it, and their response is we are exploiting a loophole. So the loophole needs to be closed because it just isn't right. It isn't a practice that should continue. 
   Another thing I have heard from some of my constituents is this, all of our local communities depend on keeping money in that community and having it turn over in the community several times before it leaves. You know, once somebody earns a dollar, they like to have that dollar turn over three and a half, four, four and a half, five times, in order to keep that economy humming along. 
   You earn the dollar, you go by the grocery store and make the purchase, and by the dry cleaners and by the shoe shop. You go over and you take the kids out for ice cream after you have gone to the ball game. You go buy new sporting goods for them to play in that ball game. Then you go buy new clothes for Easter as you are getting ready for Easter, and a swim suit for summer, maybe even a little swimming school for the backyard. The point is, the money has to turn over in that community in order for the community to be available. 
   Guess what, our friendly Federal Reserve system has done? The Federal Reserve system of the U.S. government has set up a system that allows illegal immigrants to transfer money back to the Bank of Mexico, direct to Mexico is the program. 
   The funny thing about this is, there are 27,000 transaction a month to the tune of $23 billion a year.     
   Mr. Speaker, guess what? Friendly Federal Reserve is bragging about keeping the fees low, $0.67 a 100. Well, I have not found a one of my constituents who has said their ATM fees are going down. I have not had a one of them say their checking account fees are going down. I haven't had a one of them say they have had any transaction fee go down. My merchants complain about the fees that they get charged. And we even have a hearing reported in one of our Hill newspapers today about retailers and banks duking it out over transaction fees. 
   But then we have another article that came out of the L.A. Times that is talking about the Federal Reserve bragging about being able to keep these fees low. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, it is a little bit of a head scratcher, I will have to admit it, my goodness gracious, you know, when they can go in here and they can wire this money out of the country, 27,000 transactions a month, $23 billion a year, the money is not turning over in the local communities. 
   Some of our friends across the aisle are saying, well, you know, we are not seeing what we want in jobs growth and income growth, even though it has been pretty healthy. Maybe they need to look at some of this. Maybe they need to join us in stopping illegal immigration. Maybe they need to join us in standing against amnesty. Maybe they need to make sure that we are a sovereign and free Nation, and that we remain so. 
   The Photo Identification Security Act, closing the loophole that allows those that have illegally entered this country, that allows those who are predators and identity thieves to remain anonymous to the system; closing that loophole, so that they do not have access to credit, so that they do not have access to our financial markets, so that they cannot have the ability to remain anonymous to the system. 
   I encourage everyone to join me in supporting H.R. 1314, the Photo Identification Security Act. I encourage everyone in this body, Mr. Speaker, to join us in closing this loophole that exists in the PATRIOT Act and the IRS  regulations. And I encourage them to join us in encouraging the Federal Reserve to end the program that allows $23 billion to be transferred out of this Nation every year without turning over in the community. Every single year. 
   Let's be certain that we keep our economy secure and safer. Let's be sure that we keep our communities secure and safe, and let's be certain that we are fair to the families and the working men and women in this great Nation. 
   And I yield back to the gentleman from California.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor this evening and to talk about something that is of tremendous importance to the American people, and today, we have introduced an American Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 
   This is something that we have had talk. We have had a lot of conversation. We have heard from constituents around the country who have said, you know what, we do not like the size of government. We do not like how it has grown. We do not like how government seems to be out of control. We do not like how the Democrats always seem to support the government elitists. We know that we need to have somebody there fighting for the American taxpayer, fighting for the American family, so that when they sit down to work out their budget, when they sit down to look at the family finances, they can be assured that somebody is thinking about them when they take the votes that are going to affect us, to affect the Federal Tax Code and to affect how the American family lives and works and hopes and dreams and plans, how they make their plans for college education, how they make their plans for small businesses, how they make their plans for building a nest egg and a retirement. 
   So we have the American Taxpayer Bill of Rights that was introduced today by the fiscally responsible Republican Study Committee, and this is something that we have brought on. Some of our colleagues are going to join us tonight and talk about this issue, talk about the legislation that we have brought forward, and that we will bring forward through the next several months and talk about the proposals and the principles that we have laid forth today. 
   Now, if my colleagues want to find out more about the American Taxpayer Bill of Rights, I would encourage them to go to the Web site which is house.gov/hensarling/rsc, and you can e-mail the Republican Study Committee at rsc@mail.house.gov. That is the way to stay in touch with us, and as we talk about the principles that are embodied in the taxpayer bill of rights, we want to hear not only from our colleagues that are here in the House but from our constituents all across America, from people who want to weigh in on making certain that this Nation stays focused on preserving freedom, on preserving free enterprise, that we stay focused on making certain that America is a prosperous Nation. 
   Now, our components, we have four simple principles that we have introduced into the American Taxpayer Bill of Rights, and I am certain, Mr. Speaker, that people that are listening to this say I think I have heard about a bill of rights in my State; I think I have heard this before. Many of our States have because many of our States know they need to be responsible with the taxpayers' money, and that is one of the first lessons. 
   The money that we have here in Congress is not government's money. It is not the money of the House of Representatives. It is the money of the taxpayers of this great Nation. They are the ones that have earned that money. They are the ones that have paid their taxes. 
   Most of my constituents in Tennessee will tell me regularly, Congress does not have a revenue problem; they have got lots of money and they are right. For the past 2 years, this government has brought in more tax revenue than ever in history. We have had more revenue come in. The problem is government has a spending problem. Government has such an appetite, it never gets enough of your money. 
   Now, my colleagues across the aisle like to talk about how there is all this waste and how there is all this fraud and how there is all this abuse, and you know what, they are right on that, because over the past 60 years there has been this huge, enormous bureaucracy that they have built. The bureaucracy of the Federal Government that exists in this town is pretty much a monument to the Democrats. They like it. They like bureaucracy. 
   They did not have control of this House for 2 days before they increased spending, and within 2 weeks they had increased taxes on the American middle class and American working families. Two days to increase the spending, so that they could feed this bureaucracy, so that they could grow this bureaucracy; and 2 weeks to increase taxes on the American middle class and the American family, men and women that are working and seeing their taxes go up. Last week, I think it was $17.9 billion that they increased spending. 
   So their habits have not changed. They are going to continue to feed the bureaucracy, to see that bureaucracy waste money, to see that bureaucracy grow because that is the way they like it. 
   What we are going to do in the fiscally responsible Republican Study Committee is put the focus on the American family and on the American taxpayer and be certain that they know we are defending their rights. 
   One of those is to limit Federal spending to the growth of the American family budget. Now, this is a great idea that we have taken from many of our States. 
   In Tennessee when I was in the State Senate, when you look at our State Constitution, you cannot grow spending in that State more than the growth of the budget. You have got to be certain that you balance that out. So what we are saying is, if we have per capita income growth of 3 percent or 4 percent, then you cap your Federal growth spending at 3 percent or 4 percent. You cannot be growing it 8 or 9. You cannot keep up with that. There is no way to make those numbers work unless you go into deficit spending. 
   Our friends across the aisle love to rail about deficit spending. Well, how did we get there? They grew a government so big, with entitlements so wide, that every year they come here and it is always a little more and a little more. Let us spend a little bit more, and a little bit adds up to a lot, and a lot adds up to a deficit, and a deficit adds up to a debt. 
   So limit what the Federal Government is going to spend, get in behind some of these programs that have outlived their usefulness. 
   Every year we bring forward programs that have outlived their usefulness. Every year we talk about programs that need to be reduced. Every single year we talk about ways to find waste, fraud and abuse. It is time for this body to have the will and the energy to begin to reduce spending. 
   Mr. Speaker, for all the rhetoric that comes out from some of the liberal elites who want to pad and grow the  bureaucracy and some of those organizations that benefit from the bureaucracy, you do not hear them talking much about the Deficit Reduction Act that this House passed and was the budget for 2006. The Deficit Reduction Act included a 1 percent across-the-board reduction in discretionary spending.     
   Lo and behold, that yielded a $40 billion savings. Well, now, those on the left wanted to cry, oh, $40 billion is not enough. It is a mere drop in the bucket. It is not even a good start. Their solution was to go out and propose several hundred billion dollars' worth of spending amendments that would increase spending. 
   That is how they wanted to reduce it. Not reduce what we were spending, just maybe reposition some money and spend a little more. 
   So we want to be certain, the Republican Study Committee, with our fiscally responsible premises, let's limit it. Let's not let this Federal budget grow more than the family budget. 
   Another of our premises is to ensure that our Social Security remains secure. I think it is absolutely appalling that every year the Federal Government spends the surplus from Social Security, every single year. Every single year it goes into the general fund. 
   We have a plan we are going to bring forward, and we are going to see several different plans on this. Move it off budget, don't spend it, make certain that it is there for our seniors when they are ready to retire. 
   Commonsense tax reforms: We have a plan for sunsetting the Tax Code, and as we sunset that Tax Code on January 1 of 2011, let's begin now and have a debate. Do we want a flat tax? Do we want a fair tax? How do we want to reduce what the taxpayer spends? How do we want to reduce the tax burden? 
   You know, one of my colleagues was down here a little bit earlier and was talking about how difficult things are for working families, how difficult things are for moms and dads who are working and trying to make ends meet, and where they could go for help. You know the best place they could go for help? The best place to go for help is right at your kitchen table when you can look there at the papers in front of you and say, we have seen our taxes reduced by 15 percent, by 20 percent, by 25 percent. 
   There is no need for nearly 50 percent of everybody's income to end up going to taxes at the local, State and Federal level. It is time to roll that back. Give people first right of refusal on the money that they earn in their paycheck. 
   Our fourth premise is to make certain that we have a balanced budget amendment, another great idea that has come from our States. Many of our States have balanced budget amendments, many of our cities and county governments have balanced budget amendments. You cannot go into deficit spending. The Federal Government needs to adopt that practice. 
   At this time, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), who is chairman of the Republican Study Committee, for his comments on the American Taxpayer Bill of Rights that was introduced today. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership on the issue. The American people have just so clearly said we are tired of this wasteful spending. We are tired of taxes that continue to go up. We are tired of watching wastefulness in bureaucracies that don't respond to you when you need them, when you have a problem. 
   And we have heard from so many people today who have said, we are so excited somebody has grabbed this problem and is looking for solutions, because that is what the American people want is for this body to come together to grab hold of problems and to work for solutions, work those problems through to solution, so that we make certain that our children and our grandchildren are going to have a better future, so that we know that we are going to leave things in better shape than we found them. That is good stewardship. 
   And continuing to feed this bureaucracy that started with the New Deal, that started with the great society, programs that have piled on and piled on and piled on; people that are afraid to say no to every special interest group that comes in this town. 
   It is time for things to change. The Republican Study Committee has unveiled their Taxpayer Bill of Rights; house.gov/hensarling/rsc. Or e-mail the Republican Study Committee, rsc@mail.house.gov, and give us your comments and your feedback and participate with us as we look at ways to make certain that we take less from the American worker, we take less from the American family, we reduce those taxes, and we leave that money there with you, without ever taking it away, leaving it for you so that your pay check is bigger, so that you have got money left over at the end of the month, instead of having too much month left over at the end of the money. That is the way we need to be doing it, leaving the money with the taxpayer. 
   At this time I would like to yield to the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey, who has been such a leader on fiscal issues and on the tax reform issues, and seek his comments on the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I have a constituent who uses that phrase all the time, you know, about having too much month at the end of the money, and would like to have a little bit of money at the end of the month. 
   And today, during our press conference, as we announced this, one of our colleagues was quoting one of his constituents named Hoss. Another of our colleagues got up and quoted the philosopher, Voltaire. 
   And where I come from in Tennessee, we generally quote country music. And when we talk about this Tax Code, I generally think of the great James Dean Hicks song sung by Randy Travis, ``When You're In a Hole, Stop Digging.'' 
   And that is what the American people and what a lot of our constituents are saying. We have dug such a hole with this 17,000 pages of Tax Code, and it is taking too much away, and there is not enough to cover the expenses every single month. So we are kind of looking at the IRS and saying, maybe we will bury these tax books. 
   And I yield back to the gentleman.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Georgia. I was interested in some comments the gentleman from Georgia made earlier today as we look at sunsetting the Tax Code. And I appreciated his perspective on the conversation we should have with the American people about sunsetting the Tax Code, and then, what kind of tax we go to, and what a great and vigorous debate that that can be. We have got some wonderful options to choose from. And there are those that want to reduce the limits. There are those that want to get rid of some of these 17,000 pages of deductions and credits and special preferences and incentives, and they want it to be simple and easily understood. And I appreciated that. 
   There are those, and the gentleman from Georgia mentioned that, another of our colleagues, who supports the fair tax, and having just the national sales tax, and how important that would be to allow a debate on that. How wonderful for the American people if both sides would come together, if they would join the fiscally responsible Republican Study Committee and say, we are going to have this debate. We are going to get rid of this Tax Code. We are going to set about on the path so that our children and our grandchildren will say, they thought about me. They put in place a tax code that I can do my taxes myself. I can focus on building a business. I will have more money in my checking account, in my savings account, in my business, building that nest egg. They will leave that money with the person that earns it, rather than sending it to a bureaucracy to waste on frivolous desires. And I appreciate the comments the gentleman from Georgia made on that issue. 
   At this time, I would like to recognize the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), who has worked diligently on the issue of tax reform since he came to this body. 
   And Mr. Speaker, it is a point of personal pride for me that our freshman class that was sworn in in 2003, everyone that is here in the 108th Congress, all the Members speaking tonight were a part of that class. 
   And I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Iowa so much. 
   And I am so pleased that he mentioned the supplemental budget that will come before us. I noticed today in an article I was reading that it would include $16 million for new House office space. That is not an emergency priority, it is not a war priority, that is something that should be disclosed in the regular budget. And I find it so curious that we are having this type spending find its way into our budget. And Mr. Speaker, that is unfortunate that the American people are having the wool pulled over their eyes, if you will, are being afflicted with this type of budgeting process where there is going to be all sorts of additional domestic spending that goes into something that is to fund our troops and to meet the needs of the men and women in the field. 
   As I close this tonight, I want to go back to talking a little bit about how we limit the Federal spending, how we limit the growth in the Federal Government. And as we have worked on preparing this American Taxpayer Bill of Rights and as we have looked at the items that go into this, as we look at how to grab hold of this situation and this problem and solve it and move the solution to the floor of this House, as a way to be certain that we keep the emphasis on freedom and prosperity for the American people, we had a comment that was made. And it was that the Federal budget should not tell the story of the government, the Federal budget should tell the story of the American people. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I think that that is a very appropriate way for us to consider this budget document and what the budget should look like and what the Federal spending should look like. Because truly if we are listening to our constituents, if we are making certain that we meet our priorities of leaving money with those who earn it, balancing the budget, making certain that the money we earn that has been set aside for our retirement and Social Security is there for Social Security and is not spent on frivolous needs, frivolous wants of the government, then we can say, yes, indeed, the budget document, Federal spending, should tell the story of the American people and their priorities. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I think if you were to ask any of our constituents, what are those priorities, what should government do? They will tell you, defend our Nation; keep us free; make certain that we are secure; keep the emphasis on our families; keep the emphasis on our communities; make certain that we are safe, that we are free, that we have the opportunity to seek the American Dream. And as many of us would say, keep that focus on faith, family, freedom, hope and opportunity.  That is what we should do as we keep our focus on the American Taxpayer Bill of Rights 
   We have been joined by the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell), who chairs our Budget Committee. And I am going to ask him to provide our closing remarks as we finish our debate this evening on the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, and at this time I yield to the gentleman from California.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the need for this Congress to address the rising energy costs across America. Gas prices are continuing to rise, and our energy needs across our country continue to increase. The American people expect us to do something about this, to solve the problem. 
   Yet the liberal leadership of this Congress is missing in action. Instead of  coming forward with a real plan to solve our energy problems, they are preparing to recreate the energy crisis of the late 1970s. Are the American people really ready for long lines, rationing, and higher prices? 
   The policies of the 1970s should have been a wake-up call for us. But instead of instituting a plan for American energy independence back then, we just kicked that can a little further down the road. 
   So today, my GOP colleagues and I will unveil a multi-tiered plan that focuses on innovative ways to create new American sources of power through conservation exploration and cutting-edge technologies. We will act to fill the need.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (HONORING THE LIFE AND MUSIC OF THE LATE ISAAC HAYES -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding, and I must first thank my colleague and cosponsor from Tennessee, Congressman Cohen. This resolution would not be possible without his hard work. Vital business in Tennessee has delayed his arrival on the floor today, and I know that if he were here with us that he would speak better than most about his constituent and his good friend Isaac Hayes. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to share the representation of Memphis, Tennessee, with Congressman Cohen. We are honored to represent its people and its proud traditions. Memphis has contributed so much to our State and indeed to our country, and perhaps the greatest contribution that there is is that ``Memphis Sound.'' The Memphis Sound really is the soundtrack for America. It captures the rhythm of the region, as well as the hopes, the frustrations, and the aspirations of so many Americans. 
   We do stand on the floor today to celebrate the life of the man who gave so much of that music its soul, Isaac Hayes. Isaac was one of the driving forces behind the legendary Stax Records that created and amplified the Memphis Sound. Collaborating with David Porter, Isaac wrote some of our most famous songs: ``Soul Man,'' ``Hold on, I'm Comin','' and his own hits like ``Walk on By'' and that groundbreaking musical score and the theme song from the movie ``Shaft.'' 
   I first came to know Isaac when I was at the Tennessee Film, Entertainment and Musician Commission, heading that body, working on issues that were so important to our songwriters. And I found that Isaac was fiercely proud of the Memphis sound that he had helped to give birth to and the different genres that had been spawned by that, and I know that all of Tennessee today is fiercely proud of Isaac and his work. 
   Isaac was more than a great musician. He was also a noble humanitarian, as we have just heard from the gentleman from Virginia. I found the Isaac Hayes Foundation and their work to be something extraordinary. It was founded by Isaac Hayes, and it was done so to promote literacy and music education. He constructed an educational facility in Ghana. 
   I last saw him and visited with him at a ceremony in Memphis this spring. He was being honored not only for his contributions to Memphis music but also his contributions and his humanitarian work for the City of Memphis. He grew up in Memphis. He graduated from Mannassas High School in 1962, and even after he achieved worldwide acclaim, he always remained loyal to the Memphis community. 
   You know, I didn't know it then, but I am saddened now that that was going to be the last visit that we had. But I will tell you, Isaac Hayes and David Porter were still talking about intellectual property, protecting songwriters, and making certain that songwriters were paid. 
   Indeed, Memphis has lost a champion and an inspiration, but they still have his music and his soul. 
   As co-chair for the Congressional Songwriters Caucus, I am honored to bring this resolution to the floor of the House today, and on behalf of Isaac's family, the songwriting community in Tennessee and for listeners worldwide who have been touched by the Isaac Hayes sound, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (THE DEMOCRAT LEADERSHIP'S PLAN FOR FAILURE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia so very much. I appreciate his diligence on the issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we have been through this issue and with our troops, I have got a letter with me tonight that I received from one of our men and women that is in Baghdad who is thanking me for the support and thanking so many Members of the House for their support in standing with them and their families and supporting our troops. I think it is so interesting how they have viewed this and kind of the filter they view this issue of our troop funding from. 
   As I read that letter and as I have been home over the weekend and talked to so many of my National Guard families, talked to so many of the military families that call Tennessee's Seventh District home, one of the things that has been mentioned repeatedly is, ``Marsha, I hope that people in Washington look at this debate and that they take a little bit of a historical view to this and 
   focus on what should be some lessons learned.'' Because there are lots of lessons learned, or should be lots of lessons learned in this, Mr. Speaker. 
   One of the ones that was highlighted for me by one of my constituents is that we have to realize when you go back and you look at the decade of the nineties and look at the view that then President Clinton took of the military, saying, well, the wall has come down. Well, we have survived these threats. Well, let's reduce funding to the military. Well, let's reduce funding on intelligence. Let's put it into domestic programs, social service programs. 
   Then the unintended consequence, I am sure he would say, is when you look at what happens when you have to go back through that rebuilding process. When you hear from those in our intelligence agencies and in the FBI and the CIA that say, my goodness, it takes 5 years for us to develop an asset in these countries. When you hear from our men and women in uniform about the importance of maintenance, maintenance on those posts, maintenance on that equipment, R&D and how that should have been continued. When they point to equipment and artillery that didn't get developed. We have to look at that as a lesson learned and realize, yes, indeed, you do get peace through strength, and you maintain it by being certain that you are ever-vigilant and that you are always making certain we fulfill the constitutional duty to provide for the common defense. 
   There are lessons learned, and I hope that this body does take it seriously, and I hope that our friends across the aisle will join us and say let's be fair to our military, to those families and to those troops, because for the debate that has taken place, for the rhetoric that has been spewed, for some of the statements that have been made, there are many of them that can look at this and say they are not being fair to us and they are not being fair to the job that we would do.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Yes, and I appreciate the gentleman yielding. Yes, indeed, we hear this regularly, not only from our Guardsmen, but we also hear it from those that are on active duty, that are moving forward and readying for another deployment. They talk about how they work to make ends meet, and they talk about how deeply it hurt the ongoing progress of developing different equipment and protocols as funding was cut through the nineties. 
   I think another thing that we have to remember, and this has been highlighted by a couple of my constituents who are so wonderful and love keeping up with the issue, is we have to remember on September 11, 2001, we were not under a George Bush budget. We were still under the last Clinton budget. The focus was shifting for that budget that was going into place on the first of October in 2001. 
   Actually, Mr. Speaker, I think everybody realizes that prior to September 11, this Nation had responded to acts of terrorism as civil disobedience. September 11, all of that changed and we called it what it is, and that is a war. Because no one can deny, and I do think it is foolhardy to stand and say, oh, there is no such thing as a global war on terror. Everybody knows there is, because they know we have a very dedicated, very focused enemy. You can listen to their own words. They want to annihilate us and end our way of life. 
   I think it would not be wise for us to let that go unattended. We are right to respond with diligence and tenacity and focus to make certain that we defeat the radical Islamic jihadists who want to tear our Nation and our communities apart by the very fabric that holds them together.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, indeed, we see that. The message that it sends, actions do speak louder than words. We heard that as children growing up, ``your actions are going to say more about your intent than the words that you speak.'' And we know that. 
   The message that it is sending by the actions is one that does not serve us well, in my opinion. It is one that causes our intent to be called into question, because we know what the enemy would do with us if they were given the chance. We have to realize that we have to be vigilant and we cannot let down our guard, not for a minute, not for an hour, not for a day. We have to continue to work to defeat this enemy. 
   So many of my constituents have called about the bill. I brought a copy of the bill today to the floor with me, and here it is. It is I think 93 pages when we printed the whole thing out. It is not that difficult to read. I can even read parts of it without my reading glasses, the print is big enough, and I like that. It makes it a little bit easier to focus on.     
   For constituents who are watching tonight and want to follow along through the debate with us, I would encourage them, go to thomas.loc.gov. That is all you have to enter in your search engine. When you get in thomas.loc.gov to query the site, enter ``H.R. 1591.'' That is the number on this bill. I do encourage individuals to go in and pull this down so they can see what is contained in here. 
   Now some of the comments that I have had, and you mentioned this earlier, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Democrat majority, ran railing against pork spending. From so many of our families I have heard: How in the world could they have drafted a bill that had money for all of these different interests? It sounds like a grocery list when you talk about beef and cheese and dairy products and spinach and shrimp. And when you look at the intent or what we have come to believe that they want to do, which was not put it through PAYGO rules, not put it through regular order, but slide it in here because they felt this was something Members couldn't refuse to vote for. 
   How unfair to our troops and our military families, to put this on their back and saddle them with this $24 billion worth of pork barrel spending. It is not what they said they were going to do; and quite frankly, I don't think that is the kind of change that the American people wanted to see.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. That is right. It is so unfortunate. What we need is a clean bill that allows a good debate over how we are moving forward in Iraq. 
   I think it has been striking to see the Senate confirm and give a vote of support for General David Petraeus who is commanding our efforts in Iraq, a very scholarly general. He truly is a leader for our men and women and for the Iraqis. He has great respect from them. 
   But then to turnaround and say we are going to second guess or Monday morning quarterback your decisions and we are not going to give the funding and we are not going to give it in a timely manner. As the gentleman from Georgia was so eloquently stating earlier, there comes a time when you have to look at it and talk about what their intent is, and if they even trust the troops, if they even trust the commanders in the field to have the flexibility that they need to respond. 
   Certainly today we have seen and have noted the demise of al-Masri who is the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq. Now I know that it is probably a subject that the majority doesn't want to talk about, that al-Masri was killed in Iraq, had been found there and had been working there. So it leads one to ask the question: What was he doing in Iraq? Why was he in Iraq? And why was it that he met his death in Iraq? 
   Well, the answer to that question is he was there because he and the other terrorists and the other terrorist groups all tell us the central front of the global war on terror is in Iraq. This is where they are fighting it.

   One of the things that it always brings to mind, if you don't want to get the money to them and you don't want to get it to them in a timely manner, and you want to push benchmarks on our troops, then you have to be able to answer some questions.

   But what we do know is that we cannot let down our guard. We do have to continue to fight. We have to realize terror and the war on terror is a new enemy. They do not have a headquarters. They do not show allegiance to a country. They do not wear a uniform. They are an illusive enemy.

   And we all know there are some things worth fighting for. Freedom is one of those things. Freedom is one of those things. 
   Listen to this from British historian John Stuart Mill. He said back in the 1800s, ``War is an ugly thing, not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.'' People that don't care, that is what is worse. 
   Using our troops as a political tool during a time of war is not wrong. It is ugly. It is downright ugly. It is wrong, and it jeopardizes our national security. Just yesterday, Iraq's Ambassador to the U.S. said American troops are critical to the success of that. 
   Today we stand and recognize the demise of al Masri, the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq. Tenacity. Focus. That is what yields results. Our men and women are getting results. It should be the first priority. We should all be reading this bill. We should recognize war is ugly.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Well, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank him for his leadership on the security issues that affect our great Nation. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from California knows, national security is one of the major issues that we hear about every single day. Our constituents want to be certain that America, that our interests, that our communities are safe, and certainly, as we are looking at FISA, this is an issue that is coming before us. 
   One of the things that we hear regularly from constituents is, what are you doing about it? What are you doing about tracking down these terrorists? What are you doing about finding those that want to kill us? What are you doing? 
   Well, we did some good things last year. As the gentleman from California mentioned, the provisions that we passed, Admiral McConnell's recommendations, the pathway forward for us, how we were to proceed to be certain that we could use the information that we had. 
   And now the RESTORE Act, and I do like the acronym that he is using, Repeal Effective Surveillance Techniques Opposing Real Enemies. That is an appropriate acronym for the bill that they brought forward. 
   And I think, Mr. Speaker, that our colleagues across the aisle forget that it is FISA. Maybe they think it is the U.S. Intelligence Surveillance Act, or USISA. They forget that it is FISA, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   We do seek to find those who would seek to do us harm and end our way of life. That is something we should be about every single day. 
   Now, we've heard from lots of people on the FISA issue, and the gentleman  from California brings such a wide range of knowledge on this, and I know he is going to be joined by others, others of our colleagues who are going to touch on this issue. Many of them are from the Republican Study Committee, and they're going to bring their expertise to bear on this. 
   I want to touch on one quick point. The gentleman from California highlighted some of Admiral McConnell's recommendations and procedures that we took to be certain that we closed the terrorist loophole. And the measure that the liberal leadership brought forward, the RESTORE Act, would reopen the terrorist loophole. The Democrat FISA bill creates a process by which a court order is required for U.S. persons who are outside the United States. 
   As the gentleman from California mentioned, if a foreign target operating overseas, such as Osama bin Laden, has either had contact with a U.S. person or called a U.S. number, our intelligence officials would be required, if this bill passed, to obtain a FISA court order to listen to those communications. 
   Well, in Tennessee, we would say that just doesn't make good sense, and it doesn't, Mr. Speaker; and it is frightening to think that there are those among us who may want to deal with terrorists more delicately than they would handle the welfare and well-being of our communities. 
   I would also highlight the New York Post and a comment that they had as we were working through the FISA overhaul and looking at these situations dealing with these cumbersome legal requirements. The New York Post quotes in an October 15, 2007, article: ``A search to rescue the men was quickly launched. But it soon ground to a halt as lawyers obeying U.S. strict laws about surveillance cobbled together the legal grounds for wiretapping the suspected kidnappers. For an excruciating 9 hours and 38 minutes searchers in Iraq waited as U.S. lawyers discussed legal issues and hammered out the `probable cause' necessary for the Attorney General to grant such `emergency' permission.'' 
   We know the emergency. We know the probable cause. Men were under attack and they needed to be found. We are in a time of war. The terrorists are there to end our way of life. We have to stay a couple of steps in front of them, Mr. Speaker; and as the gentleman from California has so eloquently said, the way we do this is with a commonsense approach and very thoughtful approach to our intelligence surveillance that we have on our foreign enemies.

   As I said earlier, it is not USISA. It is not the United States Intelligence Surveillance Act. This is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   That is so important that we keep this in mind. As the gentleman said, these are people who are not U.S. citizens who are seeking to do us harm.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (CHARLIE NORWOOD DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1808, legislation to VA Medical Center in Augusta, GA as the ``Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.'' 
   Simply put, there is no more fitting vehicle to pay tribute and honor our friend and former colleague, Representative Charlie Norwood. 
   As many of my colleagues have so eloquently noted, Dr. Norwood was first and foremost a friend of the American veteran. Having served in wartime conditions in the Republic of Vietnam in 1968, Captain Norwood helped develop the Army Dental Corps operating procedures that is now the standard for delivering dentists to forward-fire bases. 
   In so doing, Captain Norwood provided quality dental care to his fellow combat servicemen, and established standard practice that continued to benefit servicemen long after he left the Army. 
   That is an appropriate metaphor for Charlie's career in the U.S. House. As a Member who served his constituents passionately during more than 12 years of service, he dedicated his government service to ensuring access to quality healthcare for every American, and for guaranteeing veterans the benefits and respect that they deserve. 
   We all miss Charlie. But even though he is no longer with us, the good doctor's passion and dedication to American veterans is not forgotten. This legislation is a true memorial to his service, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, this is the ``Hold on to Your Wallet Congress'' because they have spent 100 hours getting into the taxpayers' wallet, and as we have heard them say, they have just gotten started. 
   We have had no regular order, no rules. They have made it easier to raise taxes by passing a semblance of PAYGO that makes spending permanent and tax relief temporary. 
   They don't want recorded votes because they don't want their constituents to know what they are voting on. They have passed a 9/11 bill that our private industry tells us is going to be billions of dollars in cost to the taxpayer. We have a minimum wage bill that is going to cost billions of dollars to small businesses and also brought about the Tunagate scandal. 
   Yes, you know, we are seeing it on every front, an energy bill that is going to raise taxes, not make gas more affordable, student loan legislation that doesn't do one single thing to help students get into college and stay in college. 
   Yes, hold on to your wallet, Mr. Speaker. They are coming for it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. If the gentleman would yield, I would like to refer back to something that he was saying on the alternative fuels development, draw attention to that. I know that the gentleman from Texas will agree with me, just as the gentleman from New Mexico has.     
   What we are doing is recapping much of what took place in the Energy Act of 2005, and in that act, the $8 billion that was set aside and designated for alternative fuels development, the reason that was done was because the Republican House leadership knew and the Senate agreed and the President agreed that beginning some alternative fuels development was very, very important. It was something that needed to be done. Great ideas needed to be brought to the table. 
   I think what the gentleman is saying is so very significant, and I want to highlight it because I appreciate so much the fact that you are bringing it forward, that whether you are looking at the blended fuels and ethanol and biodiesel, all of that is coming on line. 
   If I understood the gentleman correctly, what we have seen over the past 18 months is generation capacity of these alternative fuels, fossil-based fuels and blends. What we are seeing is hundreds of millions of gallons available at the retail level every year. This will increase every year. 
   We will hear more this evening from our dear colleague from Maryland about developments in other alternative energies and getting outside of the box and thinking outside of that paradigm. But I appreciate so much the gentleman highlighting the provisions that were there and shedding a little bit of sunlight on the statement that was made today over and over and over on the floor of this House, an untruth, whether they are misinformed or misdirected or misguided or whatever, that clean energy policy would start today. Then what did they do when they voted for the energy act that we passed in 2005, because we got that out of Energy and Commerce Committee on a bipartisan vote. 
   We took significant steps at that point in time, and, as the gentleman is seeing, results are being yielded and brought forth.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman so very much. The gentleman from Texas, being an accountant and understanding what is at stake when you talk about changing contracts and changing rates of taxation, it is so wise to point these things out for our colleagues tonight, and we appreciate that, and also the expertise in the energy industry that our colleague from New Mexico holds. 
   I have dubbed this the ``hold-on-to-your-wallet Congress,'' and indeed I believe it is. To the Americans who are watching us, you just better be hanging on to that wallet, because if you are not, they are coming to a pocket near you to get every single penny out of it that they can wring out of it. They are off in their 100 hours to quite a start. 
   As we talk about the energy bill tonight, the gentleman from New Mexico was recapping what this means and the impact this is going to have on the American people, and he is exactly right. The bill that the Democrats in the House passed today does not put one more penny toward alternative energy development or exploration or alternative fuels. It doesn't do it. 
   It will not make gas cheaper. Contrary to what you heard on the floor of the House today, this is not going to make gas at the pump cheaper. 
   It will not increase U.S. production. As a matter of fact, it is going to make it more difficult to produce fuels and gas and heating oil in the United States. 
   Now, the foreign gas production companies and foreign refineries probably love the action that was taken here today, because they saw House Democrats saying we don't have enough faith, we don't trust the U.S. oil industry enough; but we are going to put our attention on foreign investment and foreign oil, because indeed what they did was make us less dependent on U.S. oil and more dependent on foreign sources of oil. 
   The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Times, three publications that very seldom agree, all agreed today that the bill, H.R. 6, the Democrat bill, was not a wise move for the people of this great country. 
   So to the gentleman from Texas, and Madam Speaker, I will commend to you that indeed this is the hold-on-to-your-wallet Congress. As we have heard in this first 100 hours that our friends across the aisle have been in charge of  this majority, we have had no regular order. We have no rules. They did go in and make a change to make it easier to raise taxes. 
   As I said, hold on to that wallet because they are coming for it. They actually made it easier to raise taxes on the American people. 
   They even want to get into committees and not record votes so that you will not know what they are doing in the Rules Committee and in some of the committees so that you can play both sides of the aisle on these issues. 
   In addition to the energy bill that was passed today, they also passed a bill dealing with student loans. It is not going to do one single thing to help get one student into college. They were dealing with interest rates after, after, you leave college. 
   They decided they wanted to rework a Medicare prescription drug plan. Well, do you know what? Over 75 percent of the seniors are satisfied with the prescription drug plan; and here they go, they are wanting to make that one more expensive. 
   With the 9/11 Commission, we heard from our transportation industry, from companies large and small that transport goods and merchandise that it would be a cost of billions and billions of dollars to the American public. 
   The minimum wage bill that brought about Tunagate, my goodness, $5 billion to $7 billion worth of added cost to the small businesses, plus our fiasco with Tunagate that was carried forth by the gentlelady from California. 
   So it has been an interesting 100 hours. They did pass their energy bill today; and as has been said, it is not a bill, Madam Speaker, that is going to make gas cheaper at the pump, more affordable, or make the U.S. less dependent on foreign oil. It will make it more dependent on foreign oil. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from Texas.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I think we can appropriately dub this the Hold on to Your Wallet Congress. And today, the tax increase that is being passed is one that is being put on the energy that runs our cars and heats our homes; and tomorrow, who knows? But hold on to your wallet, America, because they are coming for it. 
   Some of the previous speakers have said that they are trying to depict this bill as something that would be repealing subsidies to Big Oil and redirecting money to alternative energy. Both are false. Those are false premises. Even The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Times don't agree with this bill. They know it is going to raise prices at the pump, punish domestic production, run up the cost of energy on manufactured goods, all of it being done at a time when we are supposed to be weaning off foreign sources of oil. And this bill is going to do exactly the opposite. 
   There is nothing in the bill that would guarantee that the increased revenues would be spent on alternative energy. While a new reserve is created, it does not have one single enforcement mechanism. In other words, the increased revenues could, in reality, be directed to any Federal discretionary expenditure without penalty, growing the government. 
   It is the classic bait and switch. It is an energy tax on hardworking Americans with no guarantees for alternative energy. 
   I will not be a part of the bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 6.

   I think it's important that they realize the price at the pump is not a hoax, it's not a mirage, it is not a bad dream, it is real life. And to my constituents in the Seventh District of Tennessee, they are angry with the price at the pump. 
   What we are hearing from them is this, Madam Speaker: we can't afford the change the Democrat Congress has wrought. We can't afford the price that they have delivered at the pump. And we definitely cannot afford for the Democrat Congress to vote themselves an adjournment resolution and leave for 5 weeks--5 weeks, while the price at the pump continues to rise, while the price of electric power rises, while home heating oil prices are going to triple. 
   This is reality. It is real life. And it is what is facing our constituents every single day. Take some of the power you're using to save the planet and use it to address this issue.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, this is an important week here as we are hearing the updated assessments from General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker. 
   Under the leadership of General Petraeus, our troops in Iraq have accomplished an astonishing reversal in a nation that was on the road to crippling ethno-sectarian violence just 18 months ago. One of the statistics that we are seeing is that these ethno-sectarian killings are down 90 percent. And with the security provided by coalition troops, the Iraqi parliament is now learning how to work as a parliament as a legislative body to negotiate and to cooperate. 
   By passing their 2008 budget this February, the Iraqis demonstrated their commitment to bolstering security gains by working toward reconciliation, stability, and economic growth. 
   The people of a Muslim state in the heart of the Middle East have rejected violence and extremism, they have cast their lot with the modern world and they have chose freedom. It is significant, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (LEADERSHIP NEEDED IN THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to discuss the topic of leadership. The American people are demanding action from this Congress and so far they have really seen very little. 
   A recent Wall Street Journal-NBC poll shows that more than 60 percent of Americans think that this Congress has done little or nothing since the leadership change took place in November. And you know what, Mr. Speaker, they are right. Not one piece of the liberal agenda has been signed into law. Instead of crafting legislation that can be implemented, this Congress has wasted the last 4 months and taxpayer dollars as a stage for political theater, and they have nothing to show for it. 
   When I go home to my district, like I did this weekend, and visit with my constituents, what I am hearing from them is really a lot of frustration. They are getting tired of the political grandstanding. What they want to see, Mr. Speaker, is action. They want us to be problem solvers on the problems they face every day. 
   The people of the Seventh District want us to hold the line and to not raise taxes. They want to keep more of their hard-earned money. They don't want government to have first right of refusal on that money. They want first right of refusal, and they want to keep those paychecks in their pocket. I believe that the American taxpayer knows how to better spend his own money than the Federal Government. 
   In my district, we hear a lot of people talk about keeping that money. I have said many times, if 10 percent is good enough for God, 10 percent ought to be good enough for the government. My constituents agree with that. 
   The people of Tennessee want to win in the war on terror. They want us to support our men and women in uniform by giving them the supplies they need to win. Anything less than that is insulting to the men and women who stand to protect us every day. The liberal leadership of this Congress says the war is lost. It is time to give up. They also claim to support the troops. In my district, Mr. Speaker, we believe you can't have it both ways. You don't support the troops by threatening to withhold critical funding. You don't support the troops by imposing artificial deadlines and taking control of battlefield operations out of the hands of the men and women and the commanders in the field. And you don't support the troops by telling them that you think the war is lost. 
   The people of Tennessee want our borders secure and they want us to enforce the immigration laws on the books. Granting illegal immigrants amnesty is insulting and unrealistic. It is insulting to all of our constituents who have spent years of time and money entering the country the legal and right way. It devalues all of their hard work and their efforts, and if anyone thinks that granting amnesty to illegal immigrants that are already here will stop more people from crossing the border in the middle of the night, well, they are just fooling themselves. 
   All of this talk of amnesty will only increase illegal immigration and the traffic that it brings at our borders because it is setting a precedent for the future. We know that. We have seen history repeat itself. Do they actually think that those who are illegally here will voluntarily go back to their home country, stand at the back of the line, and pay a fine when they are already here? And if they are caught, it is rare that they are deported. That is the incentive to integrate the right way, to come into this country through legal channels. 
   The law should be enforced, Mr. Speaker. That is what people want to see. No amnesty, enforce the laws on the book, not reward those that have illegally entered the country, be certain that people immigrate to this Nation the right way. 
   It is also a matter of national security. In this post-9/11 era, it is against our national security interest to allow an open border. For instance, three of the six people that are charged in plotting to attack U.S. Army post, Fort Dix, were in the country illegally. Records show there is no record of them ever entering this country. Many of the 9/11 hijackers were in the country with expired visas. Yet, several of them still had their driver's license. 
   It is evident that radical terrorists whose sole purpose is to destroy this Nation and our way of life are here living among us. It is time that we stand in the gap. It is time that we do our job, that we lead, and we do it to protect the American people. They are watching.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (``TECHNICALITIES'' -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to respond to my colleagues' remarks from last week that ``technically, the troops are funded right now,'' as if the bottom line on the budget report is sufficient for some in this chamber to ensure that our war fighters have all the resources that they need. 
   Well, war is a serious business, Mr. Speaker, and we are indeed a Nation at war. Our men and women in harm's way don't have time for our political games or ``technicalities.'' Clever word play isn't going to turn DOD ink from red to black. There is nothing ``technical'' about the risk our war fighters face every day. They are not fighting an enemy that ``technically'' wants to do us harm. Instead, they are fighting a lethal terrorist network actually bent on spreading real Islamist totalitarianism in Iraq and across the globe. 
   Mr. Speaker, the success of the surge strategy in Iraq is not making things ``technically'' better. We are seeing actual results and real improvement on the ground. Even the most liberal newspapers admit that the improvement is real. IED attacks are not ``technically'' down; they are actually fewer in number, fewer bombs being placed to attack our troops and Iraqi allies. Casualties rates are not ``technically'' down. We are actually losing fewer Americans as the security conditions improve. 
   These improving conditions are not ``technically'' creating reconciliation. Iraqis across the country are really beginning to bridge age-old divides as they unite to secure their future. By playing political games with vital war funding, we are not ``technically'' sending a message to our war fighters in harm's way, we are actually putting all of the progress that they have made in very real jeopardy. Mr. Speaker, is that a message we choose to send? 
   My own constituents, civilian and soldiers alike, work at Fort Campbell, home of the 101st Airborne. This holiday season, two brigades of the 101st are serving in Afghanistan and two more in Iraq. They are supported by the men and women at Fort Campbell, and their families are embraced by the citizens of Clarksville and Montgomery County, Tennessee. 
   This Christmas, if we don't actually provide DOD the funding they need, my constituents will begin to get furlough letters in the mail. There is nothing ``technical'' about being laid off. There is nothing ``technical'' about being told that in 60 days you won't get a paycheck. It is very real. 
   Before this Chamber actually adjourns so that we can spend happy and comfortable holidays with our families, I would ask my colleagues to please remember these constituents of Clarksville, Tennessee, who are actually in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan and who are actually worried about being laid off next year. 
   I urge my colleagues not to return home until we actually give the troops the very real funding that they need. Our men and women are not ``technicalities,'' they are indeed our sons, our daughters, our neighbors, our constituents. They are the bravest among us. They need our support and they deserve a Congress who will honor their service and who will do our job.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, the hold-onto-your-wallet Congress is at it again. Just a week after raising costs to nearly all of America's small businesses, they are spending billions of taxpayer dollars with little or no explanation of where it is going. 
   After months of campaigning and pledges on open government and more accountability, the Democrats are still behind locked doors spending billions of taxpayer dollars with very little transparency. 
   Tomorrow, they are going to cram through an omnibus spending package, not a continuing resolution, which basically is going to pay the government's bills; and the price tag is $463 billion, a $463 billion budget. And from what we understand, it has been crafted by a couple of folks, that's all. The Budget Committee didn't hold hearings. It was not reviewed for waste, fraud and abuse. 
   But from what we are understanding from the reports in the news, we have two Appropriations chairmen who have put it together, and you and I are just supposed to trust their judgment. I think so, Madam Speaker; we need to have accountability, we need to have review.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DEMOCRATS' ACTIONS -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to stand before the body today and talk about what we are seeing happen with some of the actions our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, have taken and what those actions, the consequences that they are having on our Nation's economy and the Nation's health. 
   Madam Speaker, we all feel like that one of the defining, iconic, fundamental items of this great Nation is our free-enterprise system. It is an imperative that individuals have the opportunity to show up to a proper job, to work hard, to get that job, to succeed and then to share that success with their families. We all call that the American dream, when you can work hard and build a life and build a nest egg and retire and enjoy the benefits of that. 
   It has been of tremendous concern to us, as we have seen the actions of this Congress and the effect that some of those actions are having on our Nation's economy. We have seen spending go up. There was a continuing resolution, supposed to be, that was passed by this body, but it turned out to be a head scratcher for most Americans because it was not level funding. It was not continued funding. It was $10 billion more in increased funding than had been there previously. 
   Now, where I come from in Tennessee, if you have one number and you add to it, you end up with more. That is an increase. It is an increase, and I think most Americans see it just that way. 
   What we also saw was that departments and agencies did not end up getting what they had had last year. There was some creative bookkeeping, some sleight of hand, if you will, that was taking place in smoke-filled rooms, not on the floor of the House, but with comments being made like, I am going to pick up the phone and call over to an agency and tell them how I want them to spend that money. 
   So that meant picking winners and losers out of the pot of money, and, of course, in my district, where I come from in Tennessee, we were very, very concerned that the loser was military construction. The loser was our men and women in uniform who are fighting to defend our freedom so that everything we do here is relevant. How shameful, how shameful that it is their projects that hit the chopping block. 
   So we saw that spending in that budget go up. Then we have been able to see what has happened with tax increases. All the language through the campaign of we are not going to increase your taxes, but we are going to do all these things, but we are not going to increase your taxes. 
   Well, I did a little figuring today to see what had happened with mandates and taxes and where we were on this issue, and, Madam Speaker, just to do a quick little checklist, as we have them, we have H.R. 2, the minimum wage bill. That was a $17 billion mandate on this Nation's small businesses, 17 B, billion, mandate on small businesses. That does not sound like something that is very friendly to our Nation's free-enterprise system. 
   Then we had H.R. 5, the student loan. That was a $7.1 billion repeal of lender subsidies, $7.1 billion more that the taxpayers then have to pick up the bill on.     
   Oh, and I know it is sometimes fun to say, wink-wink, nod-nod, fees and user fees aren't always taxes. But, yes, indeed they are, because, as Ronald Reagan said, It's the taxpayer that pays. It's coming out of their pocket. So we see $17 billion on small businesses. We see $7.1 billion on lender subsidies and student loans. That is going to make education more expensive. H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy bill, $7.6 billion in tax increases. And then, to add insult to injury, $314 million in repeal of tax credits on those that are out there trying to make certain that we become independent of foreign oil. 
   Now, some things are not only counterintuitive but they are counterproductive. And as we look at this, certainly raising taxes on those that are working to find alternative energy, raising taxes on our businesses who are working for clean energy, it just doesn't make good sense. It defies common sense. We see that in the CLEAN Energy Act. 
   Continuing on through the list, H.R. 976, the small business bill, actually is a $45 million increase in taxes. So what we have is since we have been here and since our colleagues across the aisle have taken control of the majority, they have increased taxes on their constituents by $32 billion. That is just tax increases. That doesn't count the added spending that is coming to this floor day after day after day, and we know that as we begin to work on budgets in coming years that that is going to continue to mount up. Because what we have learned is that the bill always comes due. Isn't it amazing, Madam Speaker, the bill always comes due. Somebody has to pay the bill. Or, as my used car dealership in my town says, Somebody's got to tote the note. And unfortunately it is the American taxpayer that is toting the note for the Democrats' spending habits. 
   You can go back to the Great Society and the New Deal and you can look at the way this bureaucracy has grown and grown and grown in this town. Madam Speaker, I would guess that many of this body are like me. They have individuals and constituents from different agencies that are coming in and visiting with them this week and what we are hearing is good programs, veterans programs, conservation programs, the money is not making it to the local level. And why isn't it? It is  because the bureaucracy is soaking up all of the money right here in D.C. and our constituents' money is not leaving town. So we look at this $32 billion that has been raised in taxes since the Democrats took control, and we know that there is more note that we are going to have to tote on this budget, but we know they are going to come along and try to raise taxes again to pay for their spending habits. 
   We have got the spending that is increasing, we have got the taxes that they are increasing, and lo and behold this week we have a bill. It is called, well, you know, I kind of forget the name of it sometimes. Employer, some kind of name they have for it, or Card Check. I actually, Madam Speaker, prefer to call it the Worker Intimidation Act. I think it is a very fitting name for this legislation because it is not employee friendly, it is not security friendly, it is not job friendly. What it does allow is intimidation. And I find it so unfortunate that we see that embodied in this piece of legislation. I had read a poll that had taken place over the weekend, and it seems that most Americans, about nine out of 10 Americans, agree with me on this issue, Madam Speaker. What we see is that most people agree that an employee should be able to have a secret ballot. That it is something that as our Secretary of Labor has said, it is an intrinsic right. It is something that we hold very, very dear, the right to cast that ballot, to express our opinion, and to do it without fear and to do it without intimidation. Every worker deserves the right to cast their ballot and express their opinion. 
   So this Card Check bill, we are going to hear more about this this hour as we talk about the actions that have been taken and as we talk about the consequences that those actions have on the productivity of this Nation, the actions that those have on those consequences that affect this Nation's health and its economy. 
   At this time I would like to yield to the gentleman from Georgia as he is joining us in this Republican Study Committee hour to talk about this issue and the Republican Study Committee.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Yes. That is one of the things we have seen with these unintended consequences or maybe intended consequences, because we know for the liberal elite, you can never pay enough tax. And one of the things when somebody says, well, we need to be taxing somebody more, I say, you know what, walk on up here, write out a check for what you think you owe and put it in the box. And I will offer to Madam Speaker and my colleagues, I have never had anybody say, ``I am not paying enough.'' I have never had one single person offer to write out that check and give the government a little bit more. But it is so easy to say, pay more, when it's not you, it's not me, it's the guy behind the tree. And that, many times, is where they go, always wanting more money, because government never gets enough of your money. They always want more. They think they have a better idea. They think they're smarter. They think they're brighter. They think that they know more than anybody else. And the liberal elites do that. 
   We can go back and look at the beginning of the Federal income tax in 1913. It started in February 1913. Just 1 percent. Just on the few millionaires in the country to make them pay for a war. And look where it got us. And with the AMT, it was just going to be on 28 people, just for a little while, just to get a little bit more out of their pocket. And now, as you said, estimates of 30 million Americans, men and women who are both working in order to be able to provide for their children and their families so that they have that little piece of the American Dream. And then they are affected by the AMT. They are affected by the small business tax that has been paid, going to take another $45 million out of their pocket. They are affected by H.R. 2, that minimum wage bill, that is going to put another $17 billion worth of mandates on them. We see it just never stops. You give them an inch, they're going to take a mile. And it is the hang onto your wallet Congress. They just are coming for everybody's wallet and can't get to it fast enough. 
   We want everyone to stay in touch with us on this issue, and as I yield to the gentleman, I would like to call attention to our poster there so they can stay in touch with us on the Card Check bill and on different issues that are coming before us.

It probably in their minds would be something that they considered to be perfect. As I said, they name it the Employee Choice or something but it is indeed the Worker Intimidation bill, and they don't want anybody to really bring this, they want it on and off the floor as fast as they can get it. 
   One of the questions that we are asked a lot is wouldn't this give employees more choice over their employment decisions? And we know that the answer to that is a big ``no.'' It will not. It is going to have the opposite effect. 
   We know that just as they don't want a lot of discussion on this floor about this bill, they don't want employees to have more choice and more freedom in how they choose to construct their work situations. 
   I would like to yield to the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Mr. Hensarling from Texas, who is joining us. Again, anyone who would like to be in contact with us and talk about what they are seeing in the workplace, talk about the increased taxes that the Democrats have brought forward, talk about the increased spending that our Democratic colleagues have brought forward, we would encourage them to be in touch with us at rsc@mail.house.gov. 
   At this time I yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas for those well-structured remarks. Again, we are talking about a bill, a piece of legislation that would be a big win for big labor. It is something that they have wanted for a long time. It is something that they have said would strengthen them, the labor union, and, as my colleague from Texas said, the labor union bosses. This is where they want to go to build some power, to have access to those paychecks and access to the information of what their members are doing. 
   Now, we have a couple of documents that some of our friends may want to actually log on and get. Again, at www.house.gov/hensarling/rsc, you can come to these documents and pull them down. One is the card check issue, the end of secret ballots in America. I think this is very instructive. 
   It is important for individuals to read, and as my colleague from Texas said, are Members of Congress ready to do away with secret ballots in their elections? If it is good enough for the American worker, should it be considered for Members of Congress? 
   Now, in this document that I have just shown you, there is a list of groups that are opposed to card check and a list of groups that support it. Those that support it are ACORN, AFL-CIO, Americans for Democratic Action, Center for American Progress, Council on American Islamic Relations, the Democratic Leadership Council, the Democratic National Committee, Earthwatch, Human Rights Watch, NAACP, Sierra Club, Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations in Washington, DC, and UNITE HERE! 
   Now, the groups that are in opposition to the card check proposal, the American Hospital Association, the American Hotel and Lodging Association, Associated Builders & Contractors, Associated General Contractors,  Independent Electrical Contractors, International Council of Shopping Centers, International Food Service Distributors' Association, International Franchise Association, National Association of Manufacturers, National Restaurant Association, National Retail Federation, Printing Industries of America, U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
   I also have in front of me the statement that has come to us from the Fraternal Order of Police. The 
   Fraternal Order of Police in this great Nation stands against the card check bill. They are not for this, and their national president has called on Congress to reject the bill. 
   A couple things I would like to read to be certain that we get these in the Record, because the men and women who are members of our local law enforcement communities are there on the front line every single day defending our streets and our communities and keeping our homeland safe. 
   I think that it is worthy that we listen to them and that we heed what they tell us. There is some wisdom in the thoughts that they present to us. I am quoting from this press release. It says, ``The legislation as proposed would replace the current democratic process of secret ballots with the card check system that invites coercion and abuse.'' 
   Under this process, the identity of workers who signed or refused to sign union organizing cards would be made public to the union organizers as well as to the workers' employer and coworkers, leaving these individuals vulnerable to threats and intimidation from union leaders, management or both. 
   The most common method for determining whether or not employees want a union to represent them is a private ballot election overseen by the National Labor Relations Board. 
   Then going on further and quoting from Mr. Canterbury's release, without the anonymity of the secret ballot, the FOP would probably not exist today. The only way to guarantee worker protection from coercion and intimidation is through the continued use of secret ballot elections so that personal decisions about whether to join a union remain private. 
   That is just comments from one of the organizations that understand how harmful this piece of legislation, the card check bill, or, as I have called it, the worker intimidation bill, would be on our Nation's business structure. This is something that we need to think very, very carefully about. 
   Another document that I would love to call attention to, from our Republican Study Committee, and, again, send us your thoughts at rsc@mail.house.gov, and you can go to our Web site, www.house.gov/hensarling/rsc, and you can pull this information down. But it is a Q&A on the card check issue, with some of the myths and some of the facts, the rights and the wrongs that spell this out, what it would mean to our Nation's law enforcement community, what it would mean to our Nation's business community.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   And, Madam Speaker, as he said, it took 2 days to go about raising spending. Within a couple of weeks taxes were raised. We have seen those taxes be raised on the American worker to the tune of $32 billion that the Democrat majority has passed since taking control as the majority party in this body; $32 billion in tax increases. We have seen spending increased. And now what we are seeing is within the first couple of months they are going to come along and they are going to compromise the workplace. And they are going to push a piece of legislation on the American worker that the American worker does not want. 
   And again, looking at the poll that I have quoted from, when you ask the question, tell me if you agree or disagree with the following statement, every worker should continue to have the right to a federally supervised secret ballot election when deciding whether to organize a union, and nearly 9 out of 10 individuals think that the worker deserves that right. 
   You know, Madam Speaker, it is so interesting. We have moved away from the days of coercion and intimidation and union bosses that would beat up on people. That is how the National Labor Relations Board came about, when people sought to have relief from that type of coercive, intimidating activity that would strike fear in the hearts of families and fear in the hearts of workers. 
   And how sad, how very, very sad that in this year and in this time, and in this 110th Congress, we would take steps that would return to those ways that would limit the freedom of men and women who have chosen a profession, chosen a career, chosen a job that they want to perform and would place them under the heavy-handed fist of a union boss who would seek to challenge their viability in the workplace and who would seek to challenge their freedom. 
   It is my hope that more of our Members will become familiar with the statistics on this issue, and the desires of the American people, and will realize there is nothing in this legislation that speaks to free choice at all. That is a fancy, dressed-up name for card check, which is a fancy, dressed-up name for a return to worker intimidation and coercion. And it is unfortunate that we see it happening here in this body. 
   One of the things that we do, that we put a focus on when we talk about our job here and our work here, and those of us in the Republican Study Committee as we gather and we talk, we talk a lot, Madam Speaker, about what are we going to do to preserve this great union. What are we going to do to protect its sovereignty? What are we going to do to extend individual freedoms? How do we make decisions that are going to be so that we are certain that we extend the opportunity for prosperity to future generations? 
   And I can honestly say, increasing government spending doesn't do that. Increasing taxes on our families does not do that. Increasing taxes on our children and increasing the debt that they are going to bear does not do that. 
   History shows us that when you create a government program, a government program continues to grow. I have said many times on this floor, as Ronald Reagan said, there is nothing so close to eternal life on Earth as a Federal Government program. 
   We have 141 programs that we would like to see eliminated or reduced this year. Unfortunately, we don't see that happening. What we do see happening is they are increasing your taxes, they are increasing spending, and now they are going to limit your freedom in the workplace. 
   And I yield to the gentleman from Texas.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman. As he has pointed out, in the 2006 budget we had reduced spending by $40 billion. It was called the Deficit Reduction Act, a first step. Our colleagues across the aisle immediately increased spending in what was to have been a continuing resolution. 
   Then we look at taxes. We reduced taxes, which stimulated the growth of the economy and growth of jobs. Our colleagues across the aisle have already raised taxes by $32 billion. 
   And as my colleague from Texas said, we have more workers than ever in the American workforce at this point in time. There are more Americans than ever holding a job and getting a paycheck. And over the past 4 years, we have seen the addition of 7.2 million new jobs to the U.S. economy. Now, these are not new hires. These are new jobs, newly created jobs. And, Madam Speaker, I think that that is important for us to put the attention on. These are jobs where a business owner sits down and says, ``I can create a new position. We have our taxes down. We have seen some regulatory relief. We are doing well. We see growth in this business. We see a future that indicates growth.'' So they create a new position, and they hire someone to fill that position. That is how we get business growth. That is how we get business expansion. 
   And now we find that on top of increasing spending and on top of increasing taxes, our friends across the aisle are saying, We want to let the union bosses get another hit at those workers. We want to take away the workers' right to a secret ballot. We want to infringe on that freedom in the workplace that American workers enjoy that was a hard-fought battle decades ago, and we want to compromise that and give big labor a win.'' 
   And that, Madam Speaker, is how the liberal elites couch this battle. It is, as was said in the letter that I read, a return to coercion and intimidation. It is something that in the 21st century we should not do. I do personally consider it an inappropriate step for this House. This House should be focused on how do we expand freedom? How do we expand hope? How do we expand opportunity? And how do we make certain that every man, woman, and child has their shot at the American Dream in a safe, free, and productive country.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today with a heavy heart and a new set of questions for the bureaucracy here in Washington, DC. I am here because it appears that our veterans, who have been wounded and are in dire need of medical care, have received shamefully substandard care by the Veterans Administration, the agency charged with treating the veterans who have sacrificed their body and soul for our country, and they have fallen short of their mission. 
   Reports from our government audits, and, recently, the report here in Newsweek really shines the light on the travesty that is a bureaucratic boondoggle at the VA. Many men and women who were casualties of war, they are looking for help, they are either being given the bureaucratic run around or substandard care or housed in decrepit facilities, if they are lucky. 
   I have repeatedly voted to increase the VA funding. They have received a lot of money. They have got plenty of it, and I think it is disgraceful that our military, many severely injured, have received anything less than stellar health care from this agency. The executive branch, starting with the administration, has fallen short.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank our ranking member from Texas. 
   I find it so interesting, Mr. Speaker, that so many of our colleagues refer to this as a historic day. I think, in some regards, it certainly is. Certainly the New York Times regards it as a historic day, and I quote from the New York Times this morning where they say, and I am quoting, ``This is one of the most ambitious dictates ever issued to American business.'' 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I think that that happens, because in this 805 pages, the 16 titles of this bill, we don't do anything to produce energy, and this is not a bill that is focused on energy independence. But what it does do is pick winners and losers, Mr. Speaker, and that is something that the American people and American business are going to realize very, very quickly. 
   Now, I also find it interesting, and I think it is historic from another point of view. What has happened to the price of gas at the pump since the majority took control in January? Since that time, it has gone up by over 33 percent, and we know that our families are feeling it more. In January, an average mom in Tennessee's Seventh Congressional District that I have the honor to represent paid about $34 to fill up her 15-gallon tank. Today, she is paying $45. Moving us toward energy independence should be a goal for this Congress, and it is unfortunate, and maybe it could be termed historic, that this is a piece of legislation in 805 pages that is not going to do that. 
   So we are seeing those prices increase. That mom is going to spend an extra $528 this year in order to fill up that pump. So what we should be doing is focusing on how we best move this Nation to energy independence, how we best achieve that goal, and how we best represent our constituents.

And everywhere I went, people were saying: What is Congress going to do right now to get the price down at the pump? 
   Well, my constituents know this affects every family every day, the price at the pump. They also know it is an energy independence issue, and yes, indeed, they do know that this is an issue of national security. 
   Yet the Democrat leadership of this House doesn't want to do one thing on debating this issue. Well, we have some bills that are in there. 
   How about, Mr. Speaker, if we debate H.R. 3089, a bill to promote domestic oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy production? Or there's H.R. 5984, to offer incentives for clean energy production and energy efficiency? 
   The Democrat solution seems to be simple and ill-advised: just drive a smaller car, take the bus, or walk if you can. 
   These may not be bad things, but they are often impossible for Tennesseans in my Seventh Congressional District. They want real solutions now.

Residents of Clarksville, Tennessee are paying $51 for a 15-gallon tank of gas. That's a difference of $18.45 since January 2007 when Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat leadership gained control of Congress and began making promises. 
   They continue to wax eloquent about the future of energy. Their words sound promising, but the reality is, they're as empty as a lot of our gas tanks. 
   So what have they been doing? They have not encouraged domestic production, but have sought to remove exploration incentives that would promote energy independence. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are calling on this Congress for action. So let's take some action. Let's invest, explore and provide opportunities for American innovation to develop reliable, affordable energy for years to come.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I read in the Charlotte Observer about a gentleman who decided to retrofit his 1981 diesel Mercedes with vegetable oil and got a knock on his door by the tax man. His crime was choosing to take a stand against the rising cost of gasoline, OPEC, and other international energy cartels by converting his car into clean-running alternative energy. His punishment was a $1,000 fine by the North Carolina State Government and $1,000 notice from the Feds. So much for innovation and alternative fuel research. 
   The predicament was chronicled in the Charlotte Observer on June 15, and what we're finding out is he's not alone. Many innovators around the country are creating unique ways to exercise energy independence. In so doing, they're demonstrating to the Federal Government that the American people are more than qualified to break their addiction to foreign oil. Good old American ingenuity always comes through. 
   As we take up consideration on the Energy Approps Act for 2008, it's instructive to consider what they know. If you want to get more innovation, incentivize it. If you want less of it, tax it.

   In today's latest episode, the liberal leadership has proposed another spending bill that will most likely be dead on arrival when it hits the President's desk because it shows disrespect for the taxpayers' dollar. 
   The Democrat Transportation-HUD spending bill provides for a whopping $104.4 billion in spending for the next fiscal year, which is more than $4 billion in new spending and more than $2.8 billion above what the President requested. 
   The legislation increases spending for earmarks. And it does fail to address the very real solvency issues of the highway trust fund, which will face a $4 billion shortfall in 2009. 
   The bill is irresponsible, sets the wrong priorities, and adds to the already staggering level of additional new spending in the 110th Congress. 
   The current Congress pledged to curb runaway spending, but instead they have moved it to the fast lane and they've set the pedal to the metal to see how fast they can spend your dollar.

How much are Americans going to have to pay before they will bring our bills to the floor to address this issue? They are wanting to know. They also want to know why no refineries have been built since 1976. They want to know why permits seem to be slow walked when it comes to exploring for natural resources.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, American businesses in the private sector continue to advance the use of information and e-commerce technology to strengthen their bottom line and increase customer service. However, too many government agencies continue to use antiquated operating systems that do not use taxpayer dollars efficiently or create optimal conditions for customer service. 
   Right here in the House of Representatives, we offer Americans e-commerce services in the form of ``Write Your Rep.'' I am sure most of my colleagues and their staff use this program, and they use it with efficiency. It helps us to stay in touch. 
   I have a military post in my district, Fort Campbell. It is located in Montgomery County, Tennessee. I also have 60,000 veterans that are there. One of the things we find is that many times our agencies, working with these constituents, continue to do business on antiquated systems that don't optimize efficiently. 
   That is why I am offering this amendment today. Increasing the use of e-commerce technology and procedures in the bureaucracy will allow critical agencies funded under this act to operate more efficiently. But, more importantly, it will allow our members of the military and our veterans to gain access to records, especially health records, that they need in a timely manner. 
   I want to thank the chairman for recognizing this important business objective. The underlying legislation takes a step forward to the goal by encouraging the agencies to expand the use of e-commerce. 
   My amendment, however, is an important step further. It would direct the agencies funded under H.R. 2642 to expand the use of e-commerce technologies in the conducting of their business practices within the limits, within the limits, of the existing statute and funding. 
   It is a straightforward, simple amendment. As we know, the bureaucracy is not going to do this on their own. They need the oversight from Congress. 
   If successful, we have got three points we hope it would achieve: number one, lead to greater transparency in agency asset and records management; number two, enhance governmental reform and efficiency; and, number three, spur agencies to build best practices and conduct themselves in a more businesslike manner.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in opposition to this legislation, because I certainly feel that it is going to increase the cost of gasoline to the American people. H.R. 1252 does purport to crack down on price gouging and marketplace manipulation by integrated large oil companies. Yet that is not what this legislation is going to do. 
   We had a hearing in committee about it yesterday, and I wish, indeed, that we were going to have the bill before us for a markup. What I find in this piece of legislation is that it will put a target on the back of every small business owner who runs and operates a neighborhood convenience store, a filling station or a truck stop. As I said in our hearing yesterday, there are so many of these that are the local gathering spot. These are not people that are going to gouge their neighbors. 
   You know, I know it is tempting to react to constituents' frustration with high gas prices. We are all frustrated with that. But the way to do it is not passing a hastily drafted price-control legislation. We should be focused on the real problem and work for real results on this issue. That is what our constituents want. 
   H.R. 1252 is not going to give us the real results. What we are going to see is a turn-back to energy policy, back to the Jimmy Carter era. It is a clumsy attempt, I think, to punish bad actors who take advantage of the public. But the bill adopts some vague language, employs some heavy-handed criminal penalties, some unenforceable civil penalties that no small business owner could afford. 
   I do think it's a little bit of legislative overkill, and some people would call it unconscionably excessive. They are entitled to that point. It was my hope that Congress would go through regular order, would address some of the issues pertaining to this Nation's energy policy, and look for some real solutions to the root problem.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, last year we passed the Secure Fence Act, which mandated the Department of Defense construct a fence and vehicle barriers along 800 miles of the southern border of the U.S., from California to Texas. And 283 people in this Chamber, many of them Democrats, voted to take this first step in real border security reform by funding a secure fence on our southern border. 
   But under a new liberal Democrat leadership, actually paying for the fence is a whole different matter. Despite the overwhelming support and a $2.4 billion increase in the Homeland Security budget, the bill before us today actually underfunds the fence by $187 million and ties up an additional $700 million in bureaucratic red tape. 
   The question is: Why? Nothing has changed. Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, drug dealers and possible terrorists continue to slip through the cracks in our southern border while we wait for the fence on the southern border. 
   Where are those people on the other side of the aisle that were committed to pay for this security fence last year?

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, it is interesting to sit here last night and then today and listen to some of our colleagues who find it incumbent to step to the microphone and say this is not a worthy debate and to talk about frustration and talk about anger and talk about this being a debate of little substance. 
   Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to everyone that serves in this Chamber and the people that they represent, this is indeed a very worthy debate. It is a debate that deserves our best effort. It is a debate that deserves our focus and our undivided attention. 
   It is also a debate that we should enter into with respect for the American taxpayers, the ones that are sending their hard-earned dollars here and their expectation that we should be, that it is incumbent upon us to be good stewards of every single penny that comes to this House. 
   So for those who feel that the moments we are spending on this floor are not worthy, I would commend to them to think about the taxpayer that is hard at work right now, maybe in a job they don't even like, maybe doing something they don't really love, but they are working hard to provide for their family and they are working hard to meet their obligations and pay their taxes and to make certain that they do their part to be a good American citizen. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, I think that the frustration, anger and ``of little substance'' that was spoken of by one of my colleagues a bit earlier this morning, is probably exercised by the American taxpayer who looks at the increases in spending that have been brought forward by this majority. They are the ones who are frustrated. I think they are the ones who are angry. And I think that they are probably the ones who look at what is taking place and they fear that money is being put into items that are not substantive.     
   Now, this new majority has already increased appropriations $105 billion. This is a 5-year cost of what they're wanting to appropriate. For '07, we've got $587 billion they've appropriated. They've already designated $23 billion in an '08 budget and it goes on and on and on, the increases in spending. 
   Certainly we know that the bill before us, this homeland security bill, would be a 13.6 percent increase. And as I speak on Mr. McHenry's amendment, I commend him for bringing forward something that would cut just a little bit, just a little bit, out of these expenditures. But the truth, Mr. Chairman, is that there is a philosophical difference in how we approach this debate from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   Now, we heard last night that the decision on how appropriations should be done and how earmarks should be handled should be delegated to some of the professional staff. I heard from a couple of my constituents on this issue who really could not understand why we would want to delegate that authority, not review these earmarks ourselves, not want to cast a vote on those. They feel like that is our job, just as they feel like it is our job to oversee this budget, just as they want to know how this $36 billion is going to be spent on homeland security. They want to see a more transparent and a more open budget process. They don't want to see secret slush funds returned. 
   They heard about these. They didn't believe it in the 1970's. They didn't believe they really existed in the 1980's. And then we had the advent of the Internet, 24/7 news, people could log on, and they started realizing, yes, there were these secret slush funds and smoke-filled rooms and that's how money got appropriated and sequestered for specific projects, something that they really didn't like. That is one of the reasons that we saw a change in '94 and things were done differently.  
   I enjoyed that debate. I enjoyed that little history lesson last night. But I think as we review our situation that we find ourselves in today, what we see is a need for more transparency. We see a need to rein in this funding.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to speak on Ms. Foxx's amendment, and I thank her for being one that realizes one of the threats that we face is a growing Federal budget and out-of-control Federal spending. 
   And as we have talked about threats this morning as we are debating this Homeland Security budget, it is not lost on us that this is a $36.3 billion budget. It is 13.6 percent more than last year and, as our ranking member has so wisely stated, 6 percent more than was asked for and more money than needs to be in that budget. And, certainly, it does not make good fiscal sense that this would be the type of budget document, this would be the type of appropriations that would be passed for this. 
   As we talk about threats, one of my colleagues mentioned that we were holding hostage the budget and loved using that term ``holding hostage.'' Well, Mr. Chairman, I think that probably the American people who watch this debate feel like they are the ones that are many times held hostage and their paychecks are held hostage by the Federal Government. 
   The Federal Government has first right of refusal on that paycheck. They take out what they want before the taxpayers and our constituents see that paycheck. And, quite frankly, Mr. Chairman, I think they are tired of it. 
   And they are tired of the type of out-of-control spending that they are seeing from this new majority. They didn't like the spending that was there when we were there. Certainly there are many of us that think that we spent too much, and certainly many of  us worked very hard for the Deficit Reduction Act, the 2006 budget, that reduced $40 billion of Federal spending. 
   Quite frankly, Mr. Chairman, I think the American people thought that you all were going to do better than that, that you were going to cut more than we had cut. But that is not what they are seeing. 
   We have got hundreds of billions of dollars more in spending certainly, $105 billion more in new appropriations, 13 percent more in this single budget alone. It is out of control. Our constituents feel like their paychecks are held hostage, and, quite frankly, we think information is being held hostage. 
   Now, on the security issue and on this fence, sometimes those of us who are mothers talk about setting up situations that are going to be win-win situations for our children. We like to create an environment where things can succeed. Well, unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, when it comes to funding the fence, what the liberal leadership has done is set up a failure, because what you do is underfund the fence. Then you come along and $700 million of this funding gets pulled into this gray bureaucratic red tape area that probably you are never going to see that fence built. 
   Now, we had a vote last year. We had 283 Members of this body go to a machine, put in their card, and punch the green button for the fence. That was the vote that was taken. So that leads us to say was that a politically motivated vote? Did they do that because they thought they were looking for reelection? Did they feel like that was what their constituents wanted? Because, certainly, we know one of the things we hear from many of our constituents is ``secure the border first.'' 
   But now we have a Homeland Security bill and in this $36.3 billion with a 13.6 percent increase over last year, we can't find the appropriate amount of money to fully fund a fence. And that is something that the American people want to see done. 
   Mr. Chairman, the debate that is taking place here, quite frankly, I think, is a very good debate. It is the type of debate we ought to have, and we ought to do this more often so that people can see what are the philosophies of the left and what are the philosophies of the right. So then they can get an understanding for the philosophical differences of how we view how to go about our jobs, how we view going about handling the taxpayers' money. I think this is a good thing for us to come here and talk about if we want to spend more, if we want to spend 13.6 percent more, or if we want to return to the model of the Deficit Reduction Act, the 2006 budget, and reduce $40 billion worth of spending.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise in support of the amendment from the gentlelady of Virginia, and also in support of the 287(g) program. 
   I want to thank the ranking member for mentioning our program in Nashville, Tennessee, and talking a little bit about that. He gave us some information about why this program works. I would like to expand on that for just a couple of minutes, and then I'm going to yield to the gentleman from Virginia for a couple of minutes of remarks. 
   The program in Nashville, the 287(g) program there, is working. We understand that it yields results. You heard about the first week's results from this program. 
   Now, the reason we need to put our money where our mouth is and the reason the funding needs to support the language in the bill is because this is a program that saves local governments money. And it works. And there is a waiting list to get into this program. 
   Now, a follow-up on the comments that the ranking member made from the June 10 issue of the Nashville Tennesseean. Fifteen deputies from the Davidson County department underwent training, and now they check the immigration status of every foreign-born person that is booked to that jail. 
   Also, they have 213 inmates that were held on immigration orders during the program's first 45 days. It is a sharp increase from the 151 metro jail prisoners subjected to immigration holds in the year of 2006. This is paying for itself. It is getting results. That is why this program deserves to be fully funded. 
   At this point, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cantor) for his 2 minutes of remarks.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, you know, it is amazing that the liberal leadership in the House is living up to the moniker of the hold-on-to-your-wallet Congress, and we see that they can't even get out of paragraph 1, Title I, of the bill without spending more money. 
   And I want to commend the gentleman from Iowa for offering his amendment. Sounds really simple, $79,000, make a reduction of $79,000 in spending and make it out of the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management. It's the right type thing to do. 
   In my district in Tennessee, people don't like what the Federal Government spends, and we are hearing from our constituents. They are looking at this bill, $36.3 billion, 6 percent more than was requested, 13.6 percent more than last year. And in the middle of all this money, we can't find a way to fund the fence, which is one of the things that people want to see, securing our southern border? 
   Now, my constituents are upset about that. They know that this is hypocrisy. They know that people are trying to skirt around the edges. They have caught on to this secret slush fund and going back to the way they were and the way things used to be done. And quite frankly, Mr. Chairman, it's something that they don't like, and they are hopeful that we are going to be down here making certain that we put some sunlight on what is taking place. 
   When you've got a group that is so addicted to the taxpayer dollar that they cannot get out of paragraph 1, Title I, of that bill without spending more money, you've got a problem. And my constituents know that that problem is not that the taxpayers aren't sending enough money up here. My constituents know that the problem is the Federal Government who has a spending problem. They know that it is the bureaucracy that has too much power over how that money is spent, and they know that it is the government that has a ceaseless and insatiable appetite for their hard-earned dollars. 
   So I commend the gentleman from Iowa. I commend him for being diligent and reading the language in this appropriations bill. I commend him for being diligent and making certain that he goes through this bill to find ways to reduce what would be spent, to cut out the waste, to look for areas where it can be pulled in and tightened up and reductions can be made. 
   You know, I know a lot of people in this House didn't like the Deficit Reduction Act, when we made a step in the right direction, reducing, cutting in that 2006 Deficit Reduction Act, cutting more than $40 billion, and poof, it all goes away with one stroke of their budget pen. Given the opportunity, they're going to spend more, and they're going to hide it and not tell you exactly where it is. 
   And the issue of earmarks, Mr. Chairman, it comes up in nearly every conversation that we're having in our districts. Let's have a way to evaluate those earmarks. Our constituents deserve to know before that vote takes place rather than after that bill comes out of conference committee. 
   In order to fund all this fun that the leadership is having, we face the single largest tax increase in American history. It is certainly, certainly inappropriate, and going in here and beginning to find places to make cuts, as the gentleman from Iowa has done, is the right type way to go. 
   If you cannot find $79,000 out of a $36.3 billion budget, you've got a problem. If you can't reduce some out of a 6 percent increase more than was requested, 13.6 percent more than last year, then you've got a problem. It is a spending problem. It is something that needs to be dealt with by the Federal Government.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, we are hearing illegal immigration is a big debate. There is a lot of passion on this issue. 
   Last year, Congress took the right step in passing the Secure Fence Act. It was the right thing to do. It puts 800 miles of fencing in place, both physical and electronic borders, on our southern border. 
   Now, authorizing it is one thing, but paying for it is another matter. That duty has fallen to the new liberal leadership here in the House. Even though they have increased Homeland Security spending by $2.4 billion, a lot of that is going to go into global warming. 
   They have cut funding for the fence by $187 million, compared to last year's budget. You are going to hear a lot about this as we begin our appropriations process today. 
   As we work on this Homeland Security bill, they will claim to have budgeted $1 billion for the fence, but they are withholding $700 million of that while we go through bureaucratic red tape. We have got to be certain we don't hurt the environment, all the while 4,500 illegal immigrants cross the southern border every day. 
   It is disgraceful. Do not delay the fence. Fund it. Take action in the appropriate matter. The hold-on-to-your-wallet Congress is at it. Stand up for the fence.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman so very much. I am pleased that we are talking about the issue that so many Americans are talking about right now, and that is the energy needs of our country. 
   One thing that you touched on, I think, that is just so vitally important to see, the solutions that we work toward are going to be American solutions, and it is not going to be something that is simple, or you can't change it with the stroke of a pen. This is something we are going to have to work our way out of, things we can do right now. Right now, through conservation efforts, things that we can do over the next decade, through exploration, through the innovation, things that we can work over the next 25, 30 years toward, as we look at diversification of our supplies, and commercialization of new technologies and new forms of fuel. 
   But the thing is, when you look at all of that diversity, and having a wide, broad answer, a sustainable American energy policy, we know, it is American solutions that will lead us to being free of the influx of foreign oil and foreign energy sources into our country. I think that what we have to do is look at the steps we are going to take over the next couple of years and the next couple of decades as being more or less next level steps to the building blocks that we have put in place. 
   Our party has had a tremendously strong record of conservation. You can go back to Teddy Roosevelt and look at the efforts that he had toward conserving this Nation's natural resources and the legacy that was put in place there, and how we have moved forward through the decades now to where we look at our environment and energy and, say, you know, we passed a good bill in 2005. It brought forward, moved forward, a lot of our alternative energy sources, our renewable resources, and allowed for additional exploration of those natural resources that we have here. 
   Now it is time for us to push it a little bit further down the pike. That's what the American people want to see. They know that fuel prices are high. They understand that. They know that our electricity use is going to increase over the next couple of decades. They understand that. They accept that. 
   What they want us to do is to get the costs down, to be certain that we have access to an ample supply of affordable energy.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. If the gentleman will yield. That is indeed one of their frustrations. 
   And one of my constituents this past weekend said to me, you know, I appreciate all the talk that's out there about the environment. I appreciate the talk that is out there about energy. 
   But, let me tell you something. Global warming is not a national security issue. And what I don't like is the fact that the liberal left is taking money out of homeland security. They're taking money out of intelligence. They're diverting funds from all sorts of budgets up here to study their fascination with global warming. And that is something that our constituents are not happy with. And as one of my constituents said to me, I don't think global warming had one single thing to do with September 11. 
   They want us to focus on what should be our priorities. And as we're talking about the budget and the priorities of the House, one of the things we have continued to hear so much about is a tremendous amount of concern from the small business people that are in our district, all of our small business owners, especially our female-owned small businesses who are extremely concerned about the budget that the Democrat leadership has brought forward that would be the single largest tax increase in history. 
   These are women who have stepped forward. They are taking a risk. They are taking the responsibility of running a company, and now they are getting ready to be hit with the single largest tax increase in history by a leadership that I guess does not understand the necessity of being a small business owner and looking at those books, being a single mom and wanting deductibility for that child tax credit; small business owners that are sharing in the ownership of this; married couples that are looking for marriage penalty relief that want to continue small business expensing. And every time they turn around, the government is wanting to take more of their pay check. 
   My constituents want to know that they've got first right of refusal on that pay check, not the Federal Government. They know government has a spending problem. It doesn't have a revenue problem. 
   And as I've said many times on this floor, a lot of my constituents believe if 10 percent is good enough for God, 10 percent is good enough for the government. And they feel like we should do a better job of managing the people's money, and they are exactly right.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. If the gentleman would yield, that is their projections for right now. We are just a few months into the new majority, and it took them just a couple of days to increase regulations and increase spending. It took them a couple of months to start raising taxes, and look at where they've gotten. They already are spending so much more than they should be that at this point this is where they are. And we haven't even gotten through the first year of this.  We haven't even gotten through the first budget. And we would see those rates on ordinary income tax go from 35 to 39.6 percent on January 1, 2011. That's 1/1/11. And that is when they would raise that. We would see that child tax credit cut in half. We would see cap gains go back up, and we're just a few months into this. This is the Hold on to Your Wallet Congress, and I would recommend that people hold on to that wallet because they want to get their hand on your pay check. And I yield back.

   But you will have to excuse the American people if they don't understand the leadership's real agenda here, because you actually have to read through 452 pages of the National Defense Authorization Act to find it. Subtitle F, section 951 reveals all you really need to know: a significant diversion of national security resources to indulge the liberal fascination with global climate change. 
   The language paints an unwelcomed portrait of the liberal left's agenda on  national security: Wax philosophical about the so-called impact of global warming first and, only after that, talk about the real issue of the war on terror. This is the second time in as many weeks that the left plans to force this body to vote on a bill that would fund special interest priorities at the expense of our national security. It is unconscionable. It is unfair. It is not right. It is an abusive use of Federal funds.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   You know, it is so interesting as we always debate these budgets. It seems that the liberal elites always think they are smarter than everybody else in America, and that they need to have the authority to come down here and decide how our communities are going to spend their money, how families are going to spend their money, because government never gets enough of your money. That is one thing you can count on. They want government to have it all. 
   Well, let me tell you, I have got a little box in my office on my desk; it is a tax box. And if you don't think you are paying enough, come to 509 Cannon, write out how much you want to give the government, and stick it in there. There is nothing that is stopping you. But the Democrat budget increases taxes on Tennesseans $2,611 a year. The Progressive budget is going to increase it about $6,000 a year. They just can't get enough of the taxpayers' money. 
   And the fact that they would cut military spending and call it the single largest waste, you know what, Madam Chair, if it were not for the brave men and women in the U.S. military, there would be no need for us because we would not be a free, secure Nation. We are free. We remain free because we are ever vigilant. That is the cost of freedom. And to deny what they need and to say it is a waste, I am very sorry to see that. And at the same time, to increase domestic spending with new programs when our friends across the aisle have repeatedly said they were going to cut it out, they were going to cut programs, they were going to cut spending, that is unfortunate.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the chairman, and I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his legislation to make a 1 percent reduction. We have got to start taking these first steps. 
   Year after year, I feel there is a group of us that come down here talking about how we slow the growth of government, talking about how we make reductions in what the government spends and talking about the necessity to begin with those little, tiny savings, 1/4 percent, 1/2 percent, a solid percent, that will yield a savings. We are talking about $5.5 million. I find it just amazing that we can't even find $50,000 in there. We can't agree to make that kind of reduction. There are ways to do this. That is something government should be doing. 
   The gentleman from Wisconsin mentioned the SCHIP program. Indeed, in our Committee on Energy and Commerce, we have been quite disheartened that the SCHIP bill that he mentioned is not going through regular order. We didn't have a committee hearing in our Health Subcommittee. We would have welcomed that. 
   There is nobody against health care for low-income children. What we have great concerns about is all the other stuff, all the pay-fors that are in this bill, all the expansion of policy, taking a block grant, moving it to an entitlement. It brings us back to the initial question with the gentleman's bill on this appropriations bill of making a 1 percent reduction. There has to be a way to yield a savings that will pay for some of these things, because we can't take it out of Medicare Advantage. 
   The SCHIP legislation that the gentleman mentioned would make an incredible reduction to Medicare Advantage. My goodness, we would see $193 billion in reductions to our Medicare Advantage program over a 10-year period of time, which would be $15.3 billion in cuts to Medicare Part A for seniors. This would include skilled nursing facilities, rehab facilities, and long-term care hospitals. That would be one of the pay-fors in the SCHIP bill that the gentleman referenced. 
   That is why the gentleman from Georgia has a great amendment that says, let's get going. In title 1, page 1 of this bill, let's start finding a way to make some reductions. $9.6 billion in cuts to Medicare Part D for seniors is in that bill, that SCHIP bill that didn't go through subcommittee, didn't get a complete markup in committee. It is going to be moved to the floor. 
   So, there, again, the gentleman from Wisconsin's points on this bill is the reason we have this amendment to title 1, section 1 of this bill, to make that reduction in the Secretary's spending, $5.5 million. Certainly, we can find $50,000. $3.6 billion would be cut out of end-stage renal disease in that bill. There has to be a way to start making reductions so that you're paying for the government that you are trying to spend, the money you are trying to spend, the government you are putting out there. There has got to be a way to pay for this. Unfortunately, that is not something that we are seeing considered. 
   Mr. Chairman, $50,000 may not be much to the Secretary, but it is a lot to my constituents in Tennessee and especially those that are on Medicare Advantage.

And coming back to Congress, one of the things we are hearing about as we hold our town hall meetings is the impact of illegal immigrants having access to credit cards and to financial services in this country. Banking institutions, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury, and the IRS are allowing illegal immigrants the ability to sign up for credit cards, mortgages, taxpayer identification numbers, and to transfer money back to their country. 
   It is a problem, and there is a solution. H.R. 1314 is a piece of legislation I have filed. It is bipartisan legislation with over 50 cosponsors. The Photo ID Security Act will close the loophole that illegal immigrants are using to obtain valid financial service information and access to these services. What it will do is change the identification that is required, requiring them to present a photo ID issued from their home country or the U.S. Everyone in the U.S. can legally obtain these documents. 
   I encourage all Members to cosponsor H.R. 1314.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Thank you so much. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for yielding the time, and I thank my colleagues for taking the time to come and talk to our colleagues and also to the American people a little bit about the issue of spending. 
   You have the right to know how we spend your money. Madam Speaker, I think that that is something we need to think about. This is not our money. It is not the government's money. This is the taxpayers' money. And to each and every individual, each and every taxpayer who is listening, you do have a right to know how your money is being spent. 
   The gentleman from South Carolina spoke so well to the issues that are encapsulated in the budget process. Some of you may be wondering about that budget document. Yes, the President did get it out to us last week. You can actually download the budget document if you want to see it. It is about 2,000 pages. 
   You think about how small the Constitution is and how big the budget is for this one year. But at Whitehouse.gov/OMB/budget/FY2009, the fiscal year 2009 budget, you can go to that Web site and you can actually print it off and go through and search and look at it, as the gentleman said, entitlements, and the entitlements that are there, the mandatory spending, as it is called, even though it is items that just don't seem to be addressed.     
   They are put on auto pilot, if you will. And it really takes strength to get in there and address Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security and those items that have been put on auto pilot. 
   Are these items things that are going to continue to grow every year? Yes, indeed, they do. Do they need to be addressed? Absolutely, they need to be addressed. And the gentleman is right in that, as he was pointing out the amounts of money. And then just making a small little reduction in that spending, you have a Budget chairman who is saying, oh, my goodness, draconian cuts. We can't do that. 
   So it is important to keep up with actually what is in that document. And I do encourage everyone to print that out, look at it, and stay in touch with us as we continue on a regular basis to come to this floor and talk about how this body spends your money. 
   Now to follow the good members of the Budget Committee, the gentleman from South Carolina and a couple of Members you will hear from yet a little bit further tonight and to follow some of the process, the process of getting this budget together. The President proposes that budget. You can go to budget.house.gov/republicans, and you can follow the actions that are going to take place as we talk about spending, talk about how the limits are going to be set for the different categories in the budget, as we go through amending that budget and the House putting its mark on that budget. We are the keepers of the purse. And I invite you to follow those actions. 
   Those of us that are in the Republican Study Committee, which are bringing you this hour tonight and this discussion, you can follow what we are doing with the budget at house.gov/hensarling/rsc, and we encourage you to do that. 
   We do recognize this is your money, it is not the government's money, and you deserve information on what is happening with spending. As you have heard from the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline), and also from South Carolina (Mr. Barrett), you deserve that info so that you can decide if you think you are getting a good value for the tax dollars that you are sending into the Federal Government. So work through this with us, and then you make the decision as to what kind of value you think you are getting. 
   Now I will tell you, I am one of those that thinks the President spends too much. I have disagreed with how much he spends. I think this body spends too much. There are all sorts of good ideas that are out there. But every time there is a good idea, you have a price that has to be attached to that. And it is not only a price as to what we are spending here, but it is also the price that is paid because neither the private nor not-for-profit sector is going to fill that need or address that need if the public sector is doing it. 
   I think as we talk through the issue and as you are listening to the Members that will speak to you tonight, you will agree, government spends too much. As you have heard tonight, taxes are too high. The American people are overtaxed and government has overspent. The bureaucracy is bloated and the bureaucracy needs to be trimmed back. Every year they take a little more and a little more and a little more and go through this process of baseline budgeting, never going back to dollar zero like you do, like we all do with the family budget. Every year they just add on. So the bureaucracy is bloated. And in this season of a new year and new resolutions, the Federal budget is one that needs to be put on a diet. But we all know that government has an insatiable appetite for the taxpayers' money. 
   There are some actions that need to be taken. As you have heard tonight, you see the mandatory spending, the things that are on auto pilot approaching 60 percent of this budget. It's time to get our hands around that. We're looking forward to beginning some of that process this year, just as we've begun it every year with the budget discussion and driving that debate a little bit further to make certain that fiscal responsibility is restored to this House, to make certain that future generations of Americans have a free Nation in which they can grow up, which they can dream big dreams, where they can have great adventures and they have the confidence of knowing they have a government that is going to work well, a government that is going to be efficient and effective in the tasks that they undertake and the services they provide. 
   I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 971, and appreciate the efforts of Mr. Gordon to bring the resolution forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues have spoken about being on the ground and seeing firsthand the devastation and, of course, Congressman Tanner, Congressman Cohen and I all have counties that were affected by this. 
   We had nine counties that saw devastation and destruction with the impact of this EF-4 tornado. We had Shelby County, Fayette, McNairy, Hardin, Hickman, Perry, Wayne, Williamson, Montgomery County. Each saw devastation, destruction of property and loss of life. 
   Mr. Speaker, indeed, we extend our condolences to those families who have lost their lives, and to their loved ones who have seen that loss of life. And we also extend our condolences to those families who have lost their livelihood because, indeed, as has been stated, the destruction is unimaginable. 
   I have a poster right here from Sunday afternoon when we were in Hardin County at Sharon Baptist Church, which was a wonderful church and school. It was completely obliterated. All six buildings on the campus of that church were obliterated. 
   And while you see the destruction that is just unimaginable, what you also see is the rising of the human spirit and neighbors who are reaching out to help. I asked Dr. Spencer, who pastors that church, what next? How do they move forward? Because they had nothing left. They had a hymnal that was found two counties over, but other than that, nothing left. 
   And he said, well, tomorrow morning we start to rebuild. And tomorrow morning we're going to be pulling out the scrap metal, and we're going to be moving the rubble to the street. And tomorrow morning is a new day. And that is the spirit that we see of individuals pitching in, neighbors coming to help. 
   Now they've also been so well supported by FEMA, by Director Paulison, by TEMA, and the team that is on the ground, by our State and local elected officials who didn't sit around and wait for someone to say they're coming to take care of it. They took action and said, we're going to get this done. It has been a wonderful testament to the volunteer spirit of our great State of Tennessee. 
   I commend all of those who have served, who have shown up to help and again extend my condolences to those who have lost family members and have lost the means of their livelihood.

   We all are on the Health Subcommittee. They have worked diligently on this and have continued in their efforts to raise awareness on heart health for women. The resolution is timely. It is something that we hope tomorrow is going to share the limelight a bit with Valentine's Day as we raise awareness on the importance of heart health for women. 
   It is also something that is important as an educational tool as we each individually, and then all working together, continue our outreach efforts to make certain that women are aware of the signs of the disease, they are aware of the precautions, and they are then properly informed of the steps that they need to take. 
   Again, I commend my colleagues for their diligence and work. I appreciate the opportunity to sponsor the legislation with them.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, 1 week ago today, a deadly series of storms rolled across the South bringing destruction and heartache to many of my constituents in Tennessee, and I rise today to recognize the people affected by these storms in Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Kentucky, and to commend them for the character and determination that they displayed and to encourage my colleagues to support H. Res. 971 to recognize that courage and character. 
   In visiting the communities that were hurt by the storms, I drew true inspiration from the people that I met. In the midst of destruction on an unimaginable scale, shaken and grieving individuals were pulling together with the spirit of determination and cooperation. Neighbors are helping one another, churches and schools are functioning as headquarters for emergency aid, serving hot meals and giving out supplies. Emergency responders have proven their mettle, and local and State officials are focused on how they can best move forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing the spirit of the people in the community. Support H. Res. 971, and I wish each family well as they rebuild.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, you know, the subject of Iraq and the war in Iraq, the global war on terror, is indeed a subject that is a tense subject, it is a difficult subject. In districts like mine, with Fort Campbell, with our National Guard men and women, it is one that we talk about a lot. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the things that I do fear is that in this debate, as we talk about it, we have lost civility in this debate. It has been of great concern to me that I have heard of some of the actions of the protesters who came to our Nation's capital this weekend. I am deeply disturbed by the report of a veteran who was counterprotesting the protesters that were here, and he was spat upon by those protesters, spat upon, a man who fought for our freedom, to protect the freedom that allows them to have a protest. That is shameful, and they should be ashamed; they should be dealt with. 
   You know, one of the things that we continue to hear from the Iraqis is, do not leave us until we are stable. That, Mr. Speaker, is something that we need to remember. It is imperative that we make certain that they move to stability and productivity.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding the time. 
   You know, this has been such an interesting discussion that we have carried forth on this bill. It has lasted for weeks. And finally the majority decides they're going to do something about it. But you know, it really is a bait-and-switch-type issue with the American people because the American people are for drilling on American soil for American energy resources because they want to move to energy independence. They want to lower the price at the pump. And the bill that we have in front of us is not going to do that. 
   Indeed, Mr. Speaker, if you get into section 101 of this bill, what is it that you find right out of the gate, right from the start, what is it that the majority wants to do? And now bear in mind this bill never came to the Energy and Commerce Committee. It didn't go to the Energy Subcommittee. The 290 pages of this bill was dropped in the dark of night last night and brought to the floor today. 
   But in section 101 of the bill, what do you have? Putting permanently off-limits some of the richest reserve areas in the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   So it's like that situation where you want to give a little and take a lot, which is not appropriate when we have the price of gas in our States at all-time record highs today. 
   Other things that it does not do is to address renewables without tax hikes. If you want renewables, run the taxes up, is what the majority says, what the Democrats say. Oil shale exploration? Not going to do that. Arctic coastal plain, ANWR? Not going to do that. 
   If you want nuclear--in TVA and Tennessee, we're looking at a 20 percent electric rate hike. But this bill would make it more difficult for expanding nuclear. There's nothing in there for emission-free nuclear. And we know that our rates are going up 20 percent. We know that moving from hydroelectric to nuclear is an imperative for us. 
   I encourage my colleagues to vote this bill down and vote for the American Energy Act, all-of-the-above.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, today the liberal leadership of this House will call up H.R. 980, the Public Safety Employee-Employer Cooperation Act. 
   It sounds harmless. But let's not mince words. This bill is not concerned with public safety. It's a payoff from the left to the powerful labor unions that finance many of their campaigns. 
   The liberal leadership already bowed to union pressure by passing legislation to strip workers of the right to vote in a private ballot election. Now they are attempting to federalize collective bargaining for public safety professionals. 
   The International Association of Chiefs of Police opposes the legislation because it would effectively take power from State and local governments during labor-management relations. I oppose it because it will likely make our communities less safe.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The motion to instruct would require the Secretary to deny a Transportation Worker Identification Credential, a TWIC, to any applicant who has been convicted of certain crimes. 
   This card is the access card to our Nation's critical and sensitive port and maritime facilities. We have over 750,000 workers who access our ports daily. TWIC was created to ensure that they are all screened and that they pose no threat of terrorism. 
   Now, our motion would specify that individuals convicted of certain crimes, such as treason, espionage, sedition or murder, would be permanently disqualified from receiving a TWIC card. This would further specify interim disqualifying crimes, such as smuggling, arson, kidnapping or robbery, that would disqualify an individual within a certain timeframe of conviction. 
   This provision provides the right balance between ensuring that our ports are safe while ensuring that we have the workers we need to get the job done in a timely manner. 
   We all agree that protecting our ports is one of the most critical duties that we have. All the guns, all the gates, all the guards in the world, every bit of that is useless if we give an individual a TWIC card to walk right past them. 
   This would ensure that the screening of these individuals is thorough, and that it is complete. While some may argue that this will unnecessarily disqualify too many individuals, we have already provided for an appeal and waiver process elsewhere to ensure that individuals can apply for a TWIC despite their past history. 
   This section that we are offering today in this motion to instruct passed the Senate 94-2. Our motion to instruct would accede to the language in the Senate provision. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   The concerns with this clause, I know that this program, TSA is going to roll this TWIC card program out on September 1. I would hope that our security is of such importance to us that we would not weaken this program. 
   We know that the security of our ports is important. We want to make certain that the workers that we are sending in to these ports have gone through the appropriate clearances. We know that these are critical and sensitive areas. Why would we want to give a card to someone who has been convicted of crimes such as treason, espionage, sedition or murder? 
   I do not think that the American people want to see those individuals inspecting the cargo that's coming into these ports. We hear so much about security and food security, the issues that surround that. We are hearing about the security of human trafficking that is going through our ports. For goodness sakes, we want to be certain that the people that are walking into those ports to work every day are not convicted of these serious crimes.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Mississippi spoke of the compromise language, and the compromise language does not give our TSA the tool in its toolbox that it needs. Indeed, the compromise language would weaken that tool that they need in that toolbox to be certain that they are giving Americans the certainty that they want to view our Nation's ports security with. They want to know that certainly the people that are coming into those ports have our Nation's best interests at heart. And I fully believe that they do not want individuals who are convicted of these crimes of treason, espionage, sedition, murder and, further, interim disqualifying crimes such as smuggling, arson, kidnapping or robbery to be in there watching the cargo and the transportation that comes into our ports and maritime facilities. Certainly, this is a regulation that TSA uses now with our truck drivers who are moving hazardous material. So the compromise language would take a tool out of that toolbox that TSA uses to give Americans the certainty that they are doing their best. 
   Now, with respect to the question from the gentlelady from Texas, and I appreciate the hard work that she does at the Homeland Security Committee, but this would provide only a 7-year lookback, and I think that that is important to note in that screening process. But at the same time, Mr. Speaker, we want to be certain that screening is thorough, that it is complete, and that there is certainty given to the American public.

We don't want to do something that is going to weaken a tool that is in the TSA toolbox for being certain that we have the necessary security at our ports; that we know who is there and we know the reasons they are there, that we know that they have the appropriate clearances for being there. 
   And with all due respect to the chairman and the chairwoman who have worked on this legislation, our wording here, acceding to the language that passed over in the Senate, 94-2, would be certain that we have in statute something that is going to give our citizens the security that we have done our job. 
   It is the responsibility of this body to be certain that we have this national security interest at heart for the people of this good Nation, and certainly this language is one step in so doing.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, today the tax man cometh, and the tax man taketh away on this very day. The American people circle this on our calendar. We look forward to it with dread because we know that this is the day that the money goes in to feed an inefficient and ineffective, many times, Federal Government. 
   The current Congress has voted for tax increases at every single turn. They voted for more spending while eliminating tax reductions for middle-class American families. They are getting rid of the deductions that have helped jump start the economy. The simple truth is that liberals want to take more money out of your pocket and put it into the Federal Government. 
   In my State, my fellow Tennesseans can expect to pay more than $2,600 per year in coming years, thanks to the hold-on-to-your-wallet Congress that is in action today. 
   My colleagues and I at the Republican Study Committee have recently proposed a taxpayer bill of rights that protects the taxpayer. 
   It includes:  
   1. The right to have a Federal Government that does not grow beyond their ability to pay for it. 
   2. The right to receive back each dollar that they entrust to the Government for their retirement. 
   3. The right to expect the Government to balance the budget without having their taxes raised. 
   4. And the right to have a right to a simple, fair tax code that they can understand.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Georgia. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to be on the floor tonight and talk a little bit about what the hold-on-to-your-wallet Congress is doing to Americans as we come to this tax day. You know, we circle April 15 on the calendar every year. I tell you, everybody knows that. They look forward to that day with dread. And I have said so many times I think the only thing good that happens that day is my nephew, Chip Wedgeworth, has a birthday every year on April 15. So that is the highlight of our April 15. 
   I think the reason that Americans look at April 15 with that sense of dread is because they know, our constituents know, that we are overtaxed. They know that the government is overspent. It is plain and simple to them. They know that the government does not have a revenue problem, they've got a spending problem. And they never take the time to go through the disciplines that are necessary to reduce what the Federal Government spends. Those are things that American men and women who are working know. They know that government is overspent; they know that they are overtaxed. They know that the government doesn't have a revenue problem, that it has a spending problem. And Americans do mark this date on the calendar. They resent what it stands for. 
   I thank the gentleman from Georgia for what he is doing on this issue. 
   Madam Speaker, it is so nice to be on this floor and be joined by my colleagues who are real people, who live real lives, as the gentleman from Tennessee was talking about his business; people that understand what it takes to start a business, to run a business, to maintain a business. They are not part of the liberal elite. They are part of real people, this wonderful American middle class that makes this Nation run. 
   You know, I think another thing that kind of gets to people as they are sitting there trying to get those taxes in the mail tonight and figure these forms out, these thousands upon thousands upon thousands of pages of the tax form, you know, I had one of my constituents in a town hall meeting say he couldn't read the Tax Code, it was bigger than the King James version of the Bible and he has never been able to get through the Bible, and so he definitely couldn't get through the Tax Code. That is how big and unwieldy this thing has become. 
   But they look at this and they know that what we've got is a bureaucracy that is out of control. It is unresponsive; it is out of control. And the liberal elites who have created this bureaucracy think they are smarter than everybody else. They think that they know what should be happening for and to the rest of the country. And you know, I am right in there with them, don't like that very much. 
   I think that our constituents all know, too, that just as we are talking about, they know that they are overtaxed and government is overspent. They know that government is never going to get enough of their money. 
   And my colleague from Tennessee mentioned sales tax deductibility. Madam Speaker, I think it is just really so very sad that this Congress chose to let those tax deductions expire, which in effect will enact the largest tax increase in history on the American people, all to put more into the coffers of a government so that the liberal elites get their hands on it and they spend it. There again, the people know that they are overtaxed and they know government is overspent. 
   As we talk about what is before us today, I think that it is important. I was looking at one of the gentleman's posters that he has down there about mandatory spending growth. Isn't it amazing that we see this mandatory spending growth? The budget that our colleagues across the aisle, the Democrats, have chosen to pass makes our tax reductions temporary, makes tax relief for all of our families temporary, and makes spending permanent.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I think what we see here is so important, and what you've just said speaks to the issue. Because a budget should reflect not the priorities of the government, but the priorities of the people. And what we have seen in the budget that our friends across the aisle brought that eliminated the tax reductions, that increased the taxes, that adds to that, knowing that people are overtaxed, knowing that government is overspent, is the fact that all of these automatic increases, mandatory spending growth, not addressing entitlement reforms that are needed, but allowing that to be put on autopilot, and increase and increase and making that spending permanent while you make the tax reductions temporary.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. The gentleman is exactly right. That is why we have to look at that budget document on this tax day and say, they laid the marker down. They showed us what their priorities are. Their priorities are a bigger government and higher taxes on the American people. 
   I would invite all of them to join us, join us in reducing taxes. Join us in making these tax reductions permanent. Join us in making sales tax deductibility permanent. Join us in being certain that middle-class Americans get first right of refusal on their paycheck, that it is not the Federal Government that gets first right of refusal on that paycheck. Before those deductions are taken out, let's be certain that the American people have the opportunity to sit down at that kitchen table and decide how they are going to spend those hard-earned dollars, because it is their work. 
   You know, American families, individuals in my district in Tennessee, we talked a lot about taxes as we went through this district work period. I had one of my constituents stand up in one of our meetings and he said, Marsha, I've got sweat equity in my paycheck; I've got a lot of sweat equity in my paycheck when I get it. And it just galls me every time I see a little bit more of that paycheck going to Washington, D.C. for programs that don't work. He talked about the spinach farmers and the fisheries and the peanut storage people and Katrina relief and all these things that were the waste; and the additions and the add-ons and the pork barrel spending that got put into the bill that would have funded our military. 
   On this tax day, as people are going to the mailboxes tonight, they know that they are not undertaxed, they are overtaxed. They know that government is not underspent, it is overspent. And they know that the Democrats laid down a marker. They made a choice when they did this budget. That budget choice was, do you want to stand with the American families and let them have first right of refusal on that paycheck, or do you want to give first right of refusal to the bureaucrats and the liberal elites in Washington, D.C.? And they made their choice.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. It is such a pleasure to come to the floor tonight as we start a new fiscal year for the U.S. Government. 
   A new year is a time where you get to look back at what happened last year, where you get to redirect your focus and talk about what your priorities are going to be and the goals that you want to set.     
   Now, we all do that with our families as we get to the end of the calendar year and start the new calendar year in January. It is a time that we enjoy. 
   I hope for each of us, as Members of the House, as we start this fiscal year, that we will put some attention on what we spend and how we spend. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, over the weekend, I had the opportunity to do a town hall with some of my constituents. We  got together yesterday afternoon after church over lunch. One of them said, ``Do you know, I have been reading Alan Greenspan's book. My goodness, it is amazing to me, absolutely amazing to me what Congress spends, how much money they spend. It is amazing to me that we have seen this debt skyrocket through the '70s, through the '80s and begin to level off through the '90s but still continue to grow. It is amazing to me that decisions are made that grow that debt. It is amazing to me that earmarks are out of control. Explain earmarks.'' 
   My constituent posed this question before the group because, like so many, once he looked at the issue, he realized that every time we grow a program, every time some new program comes along, every time Congress stands and says, ``We must meet this need,'' that there are two costs to that program. Of course, there is the dollars cost, and then there is also the opportunity cost, because if Government steps in and meets that need, the private or not-for-profit sector is not going to step in and meet that need. So my constituent posed this for the group to talk about. I said, ``What a great discussion to have. This is the last day of the fiscal year for the U.S. Government. Tomorrow is a new day. They turn a page in the book and start a new slate with the new budget.'' 
   Now, my constituent said that he would have loved to have seen the U.S. Government get to the end of the year and brag about how much money they had saved. But in reality, he knows that probably there is going to be more bragging done about special projects that go back home to the district in the form of earmarks. 
   So we talked a little bit yesterday, Madam Speaker, about priorities, about earmarks and about how earmarks came to be. When communities have trouble coming in and going through the process, they will say, ``Oh, can you help us, Member of Congress, to get this set aside in the bill? Can you help us to find this money?'' Quite frankly, Madam Speaker, we all know not all earmarks are bad. It is the abuse of earmarks that are bad. As I came back this afternoon, I found on my desk a copy of Congressional Quarterly Weekly. You can find this at cq.com if someone wants to pull it up. In the article, they are citing that there were 7,000 specific House-passed earmarks in just eight of the bills. There were 500 sought by the White House; roughly 1,000 were identified with more than one sponsor. That left 5,670 earmarks worth a combined $44.2 billion, each linked with a single House Member. And then it goes on and talks a little bit about how many and how much are here in the earmarks game and a little bit about who gets what. But it is the process and the abuse of that earmark process that has our constituents confused, frustrated and, rightfully, a little bit angry. 
   We know that many of us have pushed for greater transparency in this earmark process. We have pushed for changes, for knowing what is taking place in our earmarks so that people know what is in those bills when they come to the House floor, so that it is easy to find, to pair it up, to know who is asking for what, where it is going to be located or what program it is going to go to, and then how much of the taxpayer money is being spent. 
   Madam Speaker, it is not our money. It is not government's money. It is the taxpayers' money. So like my constituent who posed the question yesterday, ``Tell me how much you are spending and how you go about spending it and explain these earmarks,'' those are questions that, yes, indeed, they have the right to ask, and we as Members of Congress should be answering those questions and discussing what is in those bills, what is in those appropriations bills, and what we find in those earmarks. 
   Now, I will have to say that this is a year when we have started our fiscal year on what is called a continuing resolution, and we passed that last year. I will say that the new majority did a good job of bringing a fairly clean continuing resolution before us so that we were running today, so that we didn't have to shut government down. What the continuing resolution basically does is it takes last year's funding numbers and rolls them forward. A lot of people would like to see us hold everything at exactly the same spending level it was. That is not all bad. But the new majority was not able to get one single spending bill through both Houses and to the President to be signed, so that is why we are operating on the continuing resolution. 
   We have seemed to have time to talk about global warming and pass bills pertaining to global warming or conservation. We have named post offices. We have expanded programs. We have passed billions in new authorizations and new spending. But we did not get the budget done, so we are on a concurrent resolution. 
   It is our new fiscal year. We are going to spend a little bit of time tonight talking about how we spend that money and looking at what takes place through this earmark process and why we, as Republicans, and why we, as members of the Republican Study Committee, are continuing our push for earmark transparency and earmark reform. 
   Madam Speaker, at this time, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) who is chairman of the Republican Study Committee, and I yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his remarks. He does such a wonderful job in directing the activities of the Republican Study Committee. You can find out a little bit more about the Republican Study Committee going into Mr. Hensarling's Web site, House.gov/Hensarling, and enter in ``Republican Study Committee.'' It will take you there to some of our activity and the work we are doing. 
   We also have a little ``money monitor'' that we use every single week, update it, to show you what the majority in the House is spending, show you how this is going to affect your budget. As he said, the priority is the family budget, to be certain that families have the opportunity to decide how and when they want to spend their money. 
   As the gentleman from Texas said, unfortunately, since World War II what we have seen is the Federal budget has grown four to five times faster than the family budget. The Federal budget growing four to five times faster than the family budget. That is exactly opposite of what our Founding Fathers would want. 
   I hope that my colleagues across the aisle will join us, join with us as we fight the growth of this budget, as we fight the growth of spending. When it is a new fiscal year, it is a good time to sit down and review this and say, okay, when we get to the end of the fiscal year, what do we want to look back and say we accomplished? Wouldn't it be a great thing if we were to say this is what we were able to save, this is how we were able to find ways to reduce the size and cut what government spends? So we invite our friend across the aisle to come over and join us and work on this issue. 
   I would like at this time to yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Price), who has been a stalwart in working on the earmark issues, the earmark reform, and a real leader in the push for earmark reform, greater transparency and more fiscal accountability from the House.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia so very much. We have started our new fiscal year, and the new majority was not able to get one single spending bill to the President's desk, so we do operate on a continuing resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I said, some of us who want to reduce what the Federal Government spends, holding the spending at last year's level is not such a bad idea. We kind of like doing that. But for a new majority who said we are going to have transparency and openness, to come in and continue to spend more and more and more, not less, but more. More of the taxpayers' money, putting more of it into earmarks. 
   The gentleman referenced the cq.com article which referenced 7,000 earmarks in eight bills; 5,670 of those earmarks with a combined worth of $4.2 billion linked to individual House Members. And the concern with that, as my constituent said, how much you spend and how you spend it and concern over the earmarks. 
   You know, we have seen quite a bit of hypocrisy from the new leadership. As the gentleman from Georgia said, we do have House Resolution 479. This is something people can go on and pull up on the Internet and take a look at it. We are trying to get that voted on, forcing the transparency issue and restoring those rules that we passed last year to make certain that an individual's name is there, that you can find what individuals are earmarking, not trying to hide this, but you can find it and know who is asking for what in that budget. 
   We have 193 signatures on the discharge petition so we can force it out of committee, force it to the floor, and force a debate for the American people so they know what is going to be spent here in the House. 
   I encourage our Members to take a look at that legislation and to come join us on this first day of the new fiscal year. Again, I encourage our colleagues from the other side of the aisle to embrace the issue of reducing what the Federal Government spends, to embrace transparency in these earmarks, and to work for earmark reform, to join us in continuing to work for earmark reform. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to yield to Dr. VIRGINIA FOXX from North Carolina who certainly has conservative credentials and understands so very clearly how to work with earmarks, how to work with Federal budgeting and making certain that we remain true to our conservative principles as we address our Federal budget issues.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina, and she is precisely on target with her remarks. 
   A year ago, we had some of the senior House Democrats that joined us Republicans in calling for earmark reform in Congress, saying new transparency rules should apply to all earmarks, not just on appropriations bills, but on tax bills, on authorizing bills, transparency for all earmarks of any kind. And House Republicans later delivered those reforms last year when we were still in the majority. 
   But now that we have the new Democrat majority, they have retreated from those promises. They've gutted the reforms implemented by the Republicans, and they are denying Members the ability to have a full debate on those earmarks. 
   As the gentlewoman from North Carolina said, this is so unfortunate that this is what they're doing in the House because the people do expect better from us, and as she said, there were promises that were made and there are promises that have been broken. 
   I want to yield once again to the gentleman from Texas, our Republican Study Committee chairman, Mr. Hensarling for a few more comments on the earmark issue.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas, and Mr. Speaker, as we come to the close of our hour that we have had tonight where we put the focus on spending and put the focus on earmarks, I would remind my colleagues that a couple of months back Republicans successfully forced the Democrats to restore two critical GOP reforms from last year, and that was disclosing earmarks and their sponsors before spending bills are voted on on the floor and then the right to challenge those bills on the floor. Those were important changes we made last year, and we forced those to be reinstituted so that we could begin to have some debate. Now, they may try to cover up some of those. We're going to keep digging and playing hide-and-seek and figure out who all of those earmarks belong to. 
   I want to give you a couple of quotes that tie into this. From the AP, ``Democratic leaders gave in to Republican demands that lawmakers be allowed to challenge individual Member-requested projects from the final version of each appropriations bill.'' That's from June 14. 
   From June 18 of this year from the Charleston Post-Courier, ``A House compromise achieved Thursday night shows that the worthy cause of earmark reform is far from lost. When the Speaker recently signaled a retreat from her repeated vows to fix that problem, House Republican leaders cried foul.'' 
   We called for that accountability. The cost to the taxpayer for earmarks not being disclosed is hundreds of millions of dollars of additional spending. 
   I hope that as we start this new year that our colleagues across the aisle will reach out to us, that they will join us in signing the discharge petition on Leader Boehner's bill, H.R. 479, and get the 218 signatures we need so that we can come to this floor so that we can have a debate and ensure the public that all taxpayer-funded earmarks are publicly disclosed and subject to challenge and debate on this floor. The future of our children, the future of this government depends on getting our spending under control. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time this evening. I thank you for the opportunity to address the issue of out-of-control earmarks and the need for earmark reform by this body.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, it is with disappointment that I rise today. It is disappointment over the fact that this body still has not brought to the floor the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Protect America Act. 
   We have heard the colloquy that has taken place on this floor this afternoon. We know that a bipartisan solution to this was passed in the Senate with 68 votes. We also know looking at our calendar that obviously the issue is not about time. The issue is about having the will to pass this bill. 
   The Protect America Act has expired. We are now under the old surveillance laws that were written in 1978. The intelligence community has expressed their desire to see this passed because they know that they are having to waste valuable time working on bureaucratic red tape and legal paperwork and dealing with trial lawyers, instead of spying on terrorists who seek to do us harm. 
   I would encourage the majority to bring forward the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Let's work to keep America safe.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. It is a pleasure to join you. And I appreciate the opportunity to come and talk with our constituents about this program. 
   It is amazing to me as we are looking at this and looking at the reauthorization of it and looking at what has been a very successful program when it has worked as a block grant program, and then look at the problems that would arise as it moves to being an entitlement program. And this is something, though, that, unfortunately, it seems to be more or less the method that the Democrat majority is using as they move forward. 
   This is the ``Hold on to Your Wallet'' Congress, and they are expanding programs. Today we have done the college cost of savings. It sounds good, but, my goodness, nine new entitlement programs that they have voted to establish today, nine. And it is not going to have an effect with making certain that people have the ability to get into college and then stay in college. You have got all these different programs that appeal to special interest groups but not to the average family that is sitting down at the table and taking out a pencil and a piece of paper and saying, How do we make all of this fit? 
   I have just been amazed listening to the debate today as it pertained to education. And, of course, we are seeing this as we are working through our appropriations bills. They are spending more money. They are spending above the President's request. They are proving Ronald Reagan right at every turn. He has said, ``There is nothing so close to eternal life on earth as a Federal Government program.'' And certainly we see that. They are given the opportunity, and what are they doing? They are starting new programs. They are starting the bureaucracy; certainly not the kind of change that the American people thought that they were going to get. And we see that as we look at the SCHIP program. 
   Now, those of us who have watched health care and worked on health care issues at both the State and the Federal level know the value of having this program and having it work and States having the flexibility that is there. But what we are seeing is the SCHIP program being hijacked to help the liberal left move their agenda of socialized medicine a little bit further toward the finish line. And when they talk about Medicare for everybody, when they talk about expanding Medicaid, and when they talk about moving SCHIP from a block grant to an entitlement and then expanding the reach of that program, that is what they are doing. 
   SCHIP is to be for children. We have States that are using it to pay for adult health care. SCHIP was originally capped at $40 billion over a 10-year period of time for block grants, for children's care. What has happened, Congress has granted an additional $676 million in new Federal spending for State bailouts through 2026. So, there again, we hear accountability and we hear our constituents talk to us about accountability and the importance of accountability, but what we see is our colleagues on the left who will say, ``Well, if somebody gets in trouble, let's pay for it. Let's pay for it. Let's let the Federal Government pay for it.'' But the problem here is we forget, this is not Congress's money. It is not the bureaucracy's money. It is not SCHIP's money. It is not CMS's money. It is the hardworking family that goes to work every day, that earns that money, that sends it to the Federal Government. This is taxpayer money.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. That is happening because States are deciding that they are going to take the money and then use it for some things other than the children. Maybe they don't have enough children that fall below that poverty level or the 100, 200, 300 percent of poverty, wherever those levels may be for those specific State programs, so you have part of that money being used for adults. 
   Now, the problem that has come before us is SCHIP has to be reauthorized before September 30th, and the funding will expire. Now, this is a program we don't want to expire. We would like to see it continue as it was originally set up to continue. We do not want it to morph into other things and be a program that also covers adults, be a program that covers those that are not falling into the category of being needy children. We want to make certain that it remains a block grant, that States are given flexibility, and that the money is used to cover the children, the population for which it is intended. That is how accountabilities should work with these programs. 
   Now, our colleagues across the aisle want to make it permanent. They are not interested in addressing how the money is being spent or whether a less costly, more efficient system could end up serving children better and meeting the needs of those children in the appropriate way. 
   One of the things that they are also wanting to do is to change the income levels and include those that are at 400 percent of poverty. So what we would have is families that are making $60,000 to $84,000 a year would end up being eligible for SCHIP for their children. So what we would have is the IRS looking at a family's tax return and saying, ``You are rich. You are going to pay the AMT.'' And then the SCHIP program looking and saying, ``Well, you fall within the guidelines of 400 percent above poverty, and you qualify for this wonderful entitlement called SCHIP.'' So that is the kind of frustration that we see in the bureaucracy that causes frustration and a lot of questions from our constituents and causes them to say, ``Wait a minute. How is this money being used?'' 
   Now, we also hear from our constituents that they don't want more of this control centered with the bureaucrat. They want to be able to preserve the doctor-patient relationship. They want to be able to make choices for themselves. And they sure don't want socialized medicine and government-run health care. 
   We have heard one of our colleagues say, do you really want the bureaucracy that can't seem to straighten out Katrina, that can't seem to handle homeland security, that can't seem to get their hands around passports, to then manage health care from cradle to grave? And those are the right questions for our constituents to ask. And as they bring those questions forward, we say: And one of the ways that we need to address this is through making certain that SCHIP stays as it was intended to be, a block grant program that was put in place to assist the States in providing health care for children at low-income levels, those needy children. 
   And I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman. And yes indeed. You know, one of the things that one of my constituents is fond of saying when they come to town hall meetings and gatherings is, Marsha, whatever the government giveth, the government sure can take away. And we need to keep our attention to as we talk about this health care. Do we really want to put a bureaucrat behind a desk making a decision for the type health care that our child is going to receive? Or do we want to make certain that we, as parents, and as patients, with a physician, have the opportunity to make those decisions about health care, and do we want to make certain that we are moving toward a market-driven health care system? Or do we want to move toward socialized medicine system? And those are questions that the American people are certainly asking. 
   You know, one of the things, as we've looked at this, and you hear the discussion about what it's going to cost, and generally, as with so many programs that come from the left, they will say, oh, but it's only going to cost this amount. And it's not going to be that much more expensive to pick up those extra 45 percent of the children to move us to 95 percent. It's not going to cost us that much. And it's going to pay dividends in the long run. 
   Well, you know, the interesting thing about that is the way government structures its budget. We're not looking at the 10-year, 20-year, 30-year cost. We're looking at a 5-year snapshot. Many of our States, when they construct their budgets, they're doing cost accounting, which is a 1-year view into what is taking place. 
   And even at this, you know, CBO has scored this bill at $50 billion, and we're finding out that the cost is more like a $108 billion to cover the cost between adding an additional 1 to 2 million extra children. And that doesn't even get into considering some of the income requirements for recipients. And this is going to be an interesting issue of debate. 
   And I yield to the gentleman.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Yes. And one of the points that I would make in this debate is that in fiscal year 2007 alone, SCHIP will cost the American taxpayer $11.5 billion. Now, under the plan that the Democrat leadership is pushing forward for expansion of this program, that cost would increase fivefold. That would increase fivefold. This is what it would cost turning it from a block grant with flexibility to the State and moving it to an entitlement where you're going to put it on auto pilot.  
   And people say, what are entitlements? What's the difference here? When you're talking about Medicare, when you're talking about Medicaid, when you're talking about some of our Social Service programs that are entitlements that every year they just grow right along. There's not a check and balance. You're not working on outcomes. You're not working on making certain that you're achieving efficiencies. You've got it on auto pilot. 
   Now we've established nine new today, nine new entitlement programs in education. That is what the Democrat leadership wanted. It's not what the American people wanted. That's what they wanted, entitlement programs. And what we know is they would increase the cost fivefold on this plan. 
   Another thing we need to keep in mind is that the SCHIP expansion would generate a real shift away from private health insurance and that private health insurance market for children. And for every 100 children who get public coverage as a result of SCHIP, there is a corresponding reduction in private coverage of between 25 and 50 children. So you change the way that market is going to work. And it is of concern to us. We know that this is something that will cause a lot of questions. 
   We are very concerned with what we hear they are pushing to do to try to make this palatable so that they can pull in votes to pass this SCHIP program. We know that our physicians have a problem with the payment system for Medicare reimbursement, and certainly, the gentleman from Georgia, being a physician, understands this so very well. And we've seen reductions in payments for Medicare payments to those physicians. And so they're going to include this in the SCHIP bill. 
   Well, the Medicare payments don't have anything to do with the SCHIP block grant. But in order to try to pull together those votes and pull together something that they think the Republicans can't afford to block, they're going to put that in there. 
   Now, if I were a practicing physician dealing with the SGR and with Medicare reimbursement, I would be highly offended that I'm going to be used as a bargaining chip in the Children's Health Care Insurance Program. 
   Now, they're also going to look for ways to improve programs that provide financial assistance to low income Medicare beneficiaries for premiums, cost sharing and prescription drugs. So they're going to set up a generational battle and say, well, we'll do this on SCHIP, but we're going to take away some of the benefits from the Medicare part D and the Medicare Advantage. So they're going to take away a little bit from the seniors and then try to put that into the children's health care. 
   Now, if I were a senior citizen, there again, if I liked my part D and my Medicare Advantage, I wouldn't like the fact that they're going to use me as a bargaining chip. 
   And then we find that they're going to provide a special focus on addressing the health care needs of those living in rural areas. Well, if I lived in a rural area, and if I had a community health center in my area, and of course, in my seventh District of Tennessee, I have plenty of rural areas and plenty of rural health centers. I wouldn't like the fact that I'm going to be a bargaining chip. 
   And it is unfortunate that this seems to be the path that they are going to choose to travel. Rather than addressing the issue straight up, rather than addressing the needs of the States, rather than addressing how do we best meet the needs of children, they're going to pull all these different things and pull them into one bill and try to make something they think that there are plenty of people that they can't vote against it. 
   So I find that, indeed, unfortunate and something that, when we talk about health care, preserving access to health care for all of our constituents, it is, indeed, unfortunate that that bargaining chip-type mentality, that let's make a deal with the hold on to your wallet Congress, is the way they want to operate and do business. 
   And I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. You know, as you were saying that, I'm reminded of what we in Tennessee went through in 1994 and 1995 as we saw the advent of TenCare in our State, which was the test case for Hillary Clinton health care. And we know what has happened in our State of Tennessee, and the fact that TenCare now is consuming about two-thirds of our State's budgets. It is a very, very difficult program. 
   And somebody always is going to pay. Somebody always has to pay the bill. And what we are seeing with the American public is, they know that it is the taxpayer that is going to pay; that there are not things that are free. Someone pays for that, and they, the taxpayer, going to work every day, American families holding American jobs, earning a pay check that, unfortunately, the Federal Government has first right of refusal on that pay check, they take their share before you get your share. And it happens every single pay period. 
   And so many people are tired of it. They're tired of government not being accountable, and they are tired of Congress having an insatiable appetite for their hard-earned money. And it's what causes them to contact us when they hear about how these appropriations bills are being handled, when they hear about the increase in Federal programs, when they hear about the increase in spending. And, yes, indeed, as I've told my constituents this weekend, I'm not surprised that the numbers for Congress are as low as they are. People wanted things done differently. And this is not the kind of change they wanted. What they're saying, this is exactly what we didn't want. It's exactly what we didn't want.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California for the work that he has done on this. I also want to commend him for his appreciation for how we approach education and how we approach access to education in this country. His work in the committee has not gone unnoticed, and we do appreciate that commitment. 
   I do rise today to support the McKeon substitute that we have before us, and I think that it addresses some of the problems that so many Members on both sides of the aisle have problems with in the underlying legislation. You cannot deny that there are nine new entitlement programs that are contained in the underlying legislation, and quite frankly, we have heard from so many people who have expressed concern over this. 
   As we are at a time when people talk about the need to reduce the size of the Federal Government, to reduce the bureaucracy, to reduce the number of programs, here comes a piece of legislation, and lo and behold, you're going to have nine new programs.  
   Now, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, there are so many that say, why would you do this? Why would you not do an assessment of the needs and then put the money where the needs are? 
   And Mr. McKeon has done that, as he has addressed the Pell Grants and spending the funding, increasing the Pell Grants, which address the access component that is so important to our students. 
   Another component that is in there that I think many of the Members would be interested in is the changes that it makes in providing funds for year-round Pell Grants, there again answering a question and solving a problem that we hear from our constituents and the type Pell Grant program that they want, the access that they want, being certain that we're going to help those students who wish to pursue their education not only in the fall, not only in the spring, but the summer as well. We know that this is very important as people look at new type schedules, as they look at moving on through the educational process and getting into the workforce. 
   We know that we have different areas where we need employment and being able to finish a little bit earlier. Not everybody wants to go on a 4- or 5-year program. There are some people that want to go through in a 3-year program, 3 1/2 -year program, and so this addresses a societal change and a need that is there that allows that flexibility that students want. And that is where we need to place the emphasis, allowing people to take control, individuals to take control and make decisions that are going to suit them and not having the bureaucracy make those for them, which all too often, when we create nine new entitlement programs, with nine new bureaucracies, we don't see fast decision-making on something. We see this go into that black hole or the terminal put on hold that so many of our constituents continue to complain about every day. 
   I would also like to commend to this body and thank Mr. McKeon for the work that puts the emphasis on our military by providing for them extended deferment options for our returning soldiers who may need extra time to get settled and to return to careers and be able to begin repaying any outstanding student loans. Certainly in my district, the Seventh District of Tennessee, this is something that has been recognized as a need. We have so many that have served so honorably with the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell, and this is a provision that is important. It is one that is recognized by us, by the minority, by those of us on this side of the aisle, and it's one that we do express our thanks for being included. 
   The McKeon amendment, the substitute is the right move. It is the right balance. It puts the funding where it is needed by increasing those Pell Grants, and I do rise in support of it, and I thank the gentleman for his work.

Mr. Speaker, today the House will vote on the College Cost Reduction Act, which sounds good on the surface, but once you begin to peel back the layers of this onion, you find that it is just rotten to the core. It contains billions of dollars of new spending, and worse still, it will never even see the light of day. The President has vowed to veto the bill. 
   And it creates nine new entitlement government programs at a cost of $197 billion over 5 years. That's nine new programs. And this is just the tip of the iceberg with the leadership spending this year. $20 billion more than expected on the President's budget. They had $6 billion more in new spending on January's omnibus, $17 billion they added to troops spending. It goes on and on, and it is enough to make a taxpayer cry. 
   And if there's one thing that we all know, once you've got a government program, you've got a government program. Ronald Reagan said it best. There is nothing so close to eternal life on Earth as a Federal Government program. 
   The leadership knows this bill will not fly with the American people. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, you know, this is such an interesting debate that we come here to have on the minimum wage issues. All of our economic issues debates end up being such interesting debates, and I always love it when I hear the statements made that this is wrong and that is wrong, and our focus becomes, let us go to the government and expect the government to fix it. 
   Mr. Speaker, you know, we know that just is not so. I have found it so interesting that you would hear from people that it appears that the Republicans never raise the minimum wage. What about 1994? What about 1997? 
   Then we hear all of this about explosive costs. But what we are not hearing is that per capita disposable income has risen 9.2 percent in real dollars since 2001. 
   All the millions of jobs that have been created, nearly 7 million since 2003 alone. The reason this happens is because of good economic policy, because of good tax policy, because in leaving more money with the individuals that earn it and not doing things that are going to harm small business, as the gentleman from Ohio said, most of our Nation's jobs are created through small businesses. 
   We know from the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, they estimate that a minimum wage increase without considerations for small businesses and their workers would impose a 5 to $7 billion unfunded mandate on small businesses. 
   Now, I ask my colleagues from across the aisle, are they willing to stand up today and pass an unfunded mandate, a 5 to $7 billion unfunded mandate on our Nation's small businesses? We know, raising the minimum wage will reduce employment, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose the Democratic bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, the media just loves to give names to the different Congresses. I think that they should call this one the Hold-Onto-Your-Wallet Congress, because they are definitely coming to a wallet near you and it is going to be yours. During their first 100 hours, which is seeming to never end, they are spending billions of dollars of the American taxpayers' money on, guess what, bigger government, right here in Washington. They are not sending that money back to the local communities. And today they are going to have their student loan bill up. 
   Here are some facts. They would have you believe that we have slashed student loans and it is just not true. 
   Here is a fact. In a shocking display of hypocrisy, Democrat leaders are paying for their $6 billion plus plan with some of the same lender subsidy cuts crafted by congressional Republicans in the 109th Congress. 
   Here is another fact. House Republicans have committed a record $13 billion for Pell Grants, a two-thirds increase over the past decade. Go look it up. 
   Another fact. To the tune of more than $4 billion over 5 years, congressional Republicans established the first-ever grant program for high-achieving Pell students in their first and second years of college. 
   It is a fact. Republicans have a solid record of helping students get and stay in school.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia, and I want to thank the gentleman from Tennessee who previously spoke. He was in the State House when I was in the State Senate there, and he has been such a leader on the issue of government accountability and government reform and openness. And the comments he made are so very, very true. And he truly does have a sense of disappointment with the way the Democrat majority has chosen to circumvent the rules process, circumvent the committee process, not record the vote and go under a shield of darkness rather than having sunlight and exposure in recorded votes. And he represents his constituents so very well, and I am delighted that he has joined us in this body. And I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his diligence in the Truth Squad and in continuing to bring truth to the floor and to talk about the issues that are before us. He is talking about the student loan bill that came before us today, and I tell you what. Listening to some of this today, I think the gentleman would agree with me, you had to wonder every once in a while what you were listening to and where they were getting this information, saying that it was going to save approximately $4,400 over the life of every loan, talking about how it was going to make college more accessible. And it was such a head scratcher because it doesn't do anything for students who are trying to get into college. It doesn't do something for the here and now. It is for the later on, after people have graduated from college. 
   And you know, another thing that I found to be so very interesting was the way there was no talk about things that the Republican majority had taken action on, conservative ideas, things that we had heard repeatedly from our constituents that they wanted to see happen. And I would like to highlight just a few of the steps that were taken by the Republican majority. You can go back to 1996.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. And the gentleman is correct in that. This is for ones who have graduated and then you are earning an income and then you start to pay a loan back. 
   Now, the Republican philosophy, the conservative philosophy on this is, let's get more people into the classroom. Let's help people afford that. Let's allow deductions for families so that they have the opportunity to work hand in glove with their children to make a better education possible. You can go back to 1996 when the section 529 plans came in. Save for college. You, the wage earner, the taxpayer, the mom, the dad, take the responsibility for this and tackle it as a family. That is part of the American dream, working together to realize that dream. 
   And Mr. Speaker, I tell you what. That is something that is proactive. That is something that gives the power to the individual, not taking it away and saying hey, we are going to cloister it away in Washington, D.C. and you want to go to college, come talk to us. We don't believe in that. 
   Then you can look at the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, two tax credits in that. HOPE Scholarship, Lifetime Learning, reinstatement of the above-the-line deduction for interest on student loans, an exclusion for earnings accruing to education IRAs. They were later changed to be the Coverdell Education Savings Accounts. There again, not giving power to the government and control to the education process over the government, but giving it to moms and dads and families and students so that they can make those. 
   Well, we can look at the Deficit Reduction Act in 2005. The Smart Grants of up to $4,000 annually for students majoring in math, science, engineering or a foreign language critical to this great Nation's security. Smart Grants. It effectively doubled the Pell Grant for many students. It increased subsidized student loan borrowing caps for freshmen and sophomores, there again, steps that give you, the individual, the power and the control. 
   We can look at current student aid. We have seen such an increase in student aid over the past decade. To see the amounts that those have increased is just amazing. Our higher ed funding in total has increased.     
   To the gentleman from Georgia, you know, as we have stood here today and  listened to all the myths, and listened to the information that is erroneous, it has been very disappointing. I would just like to commend to our constituents who are watching tonight that they may want to go to the Education and Labor site, our ranking member, BUCK MCKEON's site, and look at some of the information there that the republicans.edlabor.house.gov have on there, what is the truth with the legislation that we have passed today, so that they can have a better understanding of it. 
   I had talked with a constituent who had thought that they were going to see enormous savings from this. They had misunderstood the rhetoric that they were hearing on the floor today and thought that they were going to be saving about $4,400 a year, not $4,400 over the life of a loan, which is incorrect, but that it would be even less than that, and for the average student it is more like $400. 
   So the gentleman is correct in the assessment that he is making. I appreciate that he is breaking down the interest rate chart so that our constituents do have clarity on the situation that is before us.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (FUNDING THE TROOPS -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Well, here we go again. 
   Instead of getting down to business and tending to the people's business, the majority wants to play a political game. So to do it, they are going to tie temporary funds for our men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan to a timetable for withdrawal. No amendments can be offered. Once again, the leadership of the House is set to embark on a legislative gamble to force the hand of U.S. military leadership. This is their 41st Iraq vote. 
   But the suspense comes. Will the Houses of Congress, the President, and the American people take their bluff? I think it is very highly unlikely. 
   The Democrat leadership seems content to write legislation that they know is going to fail. Now, why would you write something you know is going to fail? 
   Let's get past this. Let's give up the games. Let's take care of the people's business. Let's pass clean legislation to ensure the safety of our troops.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his work on this issue and for his work on the Truth Squad. 
   Today is a historic day, as my colleagues have mentioned. I commend my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle on their collegiality and their tone as we have approached this day, and have recognized the historic importance and the significance of the first female taking the position of Speaker of this wonderful body which is the people's House. 
   You know, as the gentleman was saying, it is so important that we note, we are not here to complain. We are not here to gripe. What we are here to do is to highlight for our constituents some of the content of a rules package that seems to be hastily pulled together that did not go through the committee process, that didn't have hearings, and was brought to the floor for a vote. 
   I think it is important that our constituents know, because we have a lot of new Members of this body, and those voters that voted in the elections this fall did not go to the ballot box voting to have a government that was going to be carried out in the shadows. They went to the ballot boxes saying we want government that is more accountable. We want government that is more open. We want government that is more responsive to the needs of our constituents. We want government that is going to work more effectively and more efficiently for the American people.     
   And the very first vote that is taken on the rules package presented in the people's House today is a vote that would eliminate recorded votes in the Rules Committee. 
   Now, in my great State of Tennessee, we have had this discussion, and in our general assembly in the great State of Tennessee, we have had this debate, and people said over and over again we want those votes recorded. We want sunshine. We want openness. And that is something that needs to be highlighted with our constituents. They need to realize the format that they are wanting to push forward would deny the minority the opportunity to hear, have their amendments heard in the Rules Committee. Dr. Gingrey has highlighted some of the provisions, and he does such a wonderful job with our Rules Committee and the concerns that we have with the format that would go before the Rules Committee that would deny recording some of these votes, which means there is less accountability. So it is our responsibility to come and highlight those things. 
   You know another thing that the people did not vote for this November was to raise their taxes. They did not go to the poll and vote saying, ``Representatives, we want you to make it easier to raise the taxes on us.'' And one of the things that we find with the PAYGO rules is that it is basically pay as you go on a spending spree. Even the Concord Coalition has estimated that this 100 hours would cost $800 billion over 10 years if everything was funded. That is $80 billion a year for 10 years, $80 billion a year additional, additional, new spending. 
   Now, I can tell you one thing for certain. I don't know a lot, but one thing I do know is that the people of the Seventh District of Tennessee do not want to be forking over another $80 billion a year. 
   What they did vote for this November was to see government spending reduced, and that is where they want our emphasis to be. And it is important that we spell this out for our constituents, for the American people, for them to know what is transpiring as we come into the 110th Congress. 
   Words are important and it is important that we provide the clarification that is there and that is needed. And as I have viewed the package that we have debated some today and will debate tomorrow, I have come to realize that one of the things our colleagues across the aisle, the Democrats, have said is they want to go back to the way things were. I even said maybe Barbara Streisand's ``The Way We Were'' should be their theme song because that is how they want to go back to doing business where it is closed. This is what people voted against with the revolution in 1994. They voted then for more openness. 
   This past November, people thought they were going to see more action and more openness, and the first votes that are being taken are closing that process and are excluding people, excluding representatives of as many as 140 million Americans from participation in that process.

If the gentleman would yield and also yield to Dr. Gingrey, who is on the Rules Committee, but having served in a State legislative body, that is one of the things that our constituents who were tuned into watching so closely would say, how in the world can you represent me and then not tell me how you voted and try to keep that a secret? I am having a difficult time finding words to say how egregious that is and how offensive it is to our constituents.

And I think that is an important distinction for our constituents who have stopped us on the campaign trail and stopped us as we have prepared to come in and take our solemn oath of office today and have said we want to be certain that this Congress is going to function in an open,  accountable manner. We want to know what is happening in the people's House, and it is your charge to keep with us to keep us informed.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa so much, and I thank him for hosting our Republican Study Committee hour this evening so that we can come here and talk a little bit about what those of us in the Republican Study Committee are doing, and certainly how we feel about the supplemental budget that is before us, a vote that we will take tomorrow. I appreciate the context that Mr. King has brought to our debate tonight. 
   It is so very interesting to listen to our colleagues across the aisle. They talk about how they are going to change things, and when we talk, Mr. Speaker, about the change the American people wanted to see in November, they were not talking about subpoenas and hearings and vilifying people. The Democrats said that was not what they were going to do, and we know there are many who would like to make the President responsible for every single thing that has gone wrong. 
   We understand that, and we accept that, but it is unfortunate that when they come down here and they talk about honesty and accountability and trustworthiness and oversight and responsibility, their actions do not match their words. Their actions do not match their words at all. 
   What we continue to see in the supplemental budget, in the D.C. voting bill that they pulled from the floor today, and the budget that they will bring before us next week are a lot of accounting gimmicks, trying to move spending off line, hiding dollars, budget manipulation and deception. My goodness, this does not match up to what we hear from their rhetoric at all. 
   We know that there was all this talk about trying to be certain that we kept the spending low, and, Mr. Speaker, it took our colleagues across the aisle, as they took the majority, it took them 2 days to increase spending and 2 weeks to increase taxes on the American taxpayer, on the middle-class families working so hard to make ends meet, 2 days to increase spending.     
   They have spent well over an additional $50 billion so far. Two weeks to increase taxes, and as this budget that the Democrats are working on comes to the floor next week, they are going to invoke the largest tax increase in U.S. history, $400 billion over 5 years. That does bring us to the point of talking about the supplemental, and that is before us. Because as we hear all of this rhetoric, what we see is a budget, a supplemental bill that is to be there for our troops. 
   We all know that there is a lot that our troops need. When it comes to meeting their needs, when it comes to meeting their readiness, there is a lot they need. One of the reasons for that, when you go in and you look at the decade of the 1990s, budget after budget after budget, the military was cut. Funding to the military was cut. Funding to veterans, funding to veterans health care, funding to programs for the military retirees, funding for the active duty, funding for equipment, funding for artillery, funding for research and development, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, year after year after year. The Democrats chose to cut that. 
   Bill Clinton chose to cut that because they had other priorities. They were do the dot-com boom. They were into issues that were other domestic issues, but the Nation's security was not a priority. Certainly, even the current Speaker of the House was quoted in last year's campaign as saying national security shouldn't be a campaign issue. 
   There is nothing more important than the security of our families in this Nation. There is not one thing more important. 
   I have so many places I could go to talk about what has happened to this budget, to this supplemental bill that is before us tomorrow. It is to be the emergency spending bill for the war on terror, for our issues in Iraq. USA Today even had an editorial calling this a bad bill, because they don't see, and I agree with them, I agree with USA Today on this, they don't see an additional $500 million for the Forest Service as an emergency spending. They don't see $283 million for the Milk Income Loss Contract Program an emergency, or $120 million to compensate for the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the shrimp and fish industry, or $100 million for citrus assistance, or $74 million for peanut storage costs or $64.4 million for salmon fisheries or $54 million for asbestos mitigation, or $48 million in salaries and expenses for the Farm Service Agency, or $35 million for NASA risk mitigation or $25 million for spinach growers or $25 million for live stock. 
   Even USA Today doesn't see that as emergency spending. I agree with them, because it's not. 
   I bet that many Members of this House had a wonderful mother like my mom has always been. My mother was always very good at saying, when I was doing something that maybe wasn't appropriate, she would say not here, not now, this is not the place. 
   Well, as good as some of these programs may be, not here, not now, this is not the place. The men and women in the US military are worth more. They are worth more than the actions, the actions and the conduct that is being carried forward in this budget. It is the wrong place, and this is the wrong time to spend $21 billion on discretionary spending that the Democrat majority does not want to carry to the floor and debate. They want to hide it. They want to keep it out of sight. They don't want anybody to know this. They just want to get the spending in there. Because, why? They want to circumvent their own PAYGO rules and their own budget rules. It is not the time; it is not the place. 
   Now, if the leadership of the Democrat Party is so into instant gratification that they cannot wait to take it to committee and go through the proper channels, then I think they need to have a reevaluation about what is important. I can tell you what is important to my constituents. It is knowing that when they put their head on the pillow at night, they are safe. It is knowing when they drop their children off at school, they are safe. It is knowing that when those children graduate from high school and from college, they are going to have a brighter future. It is knowing that as they work hard to build a business, that they are going to have the opportunity to grow that business. It is knowing that when they retire, that they are going to be able to enjoy every single day of that retirement. 
   It is knowing that, yes, indeed, they are going to be accountable, they are going to support their government, and it is knowing that their government is going to be there to support the fundamental values, the underpinning of this Nation, and to support the men and women who put their lives on the line every single day to go and defend this country and defend their freedom. 
   You know what, if it were not for those men and women in uniform, if it were not for them doing their job, if it were not for the fact that they have done their job time and again during the course of this Nation's history, you and I would not be standing here tonight having this debate. 
   There is a price that is paid for freedom. Every penny we appropriate in an emergency bill deserves to be spent on the men and women wearing the uniform defending that freedom.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   And, Mr. Chairman, I am so pleased to come to the floor and participate in this debate. I think it's one of the most important debates that we have every single year. 
   And listening to all the comments that are taking place here this evening, Mr. Chairman, it is not lost on me. Budgets are supposed to be about priorities. Budgets should reflect the priorities of a nation, and they should lay out the funding for what we think is important, where we should spend the taxpayers' money. 
   And I think we have to stop there and pause just a moment because, Mr. Chairman, when I listen to some of our colleagues make comments, as my dear friend from New York just made, talking about all the good things that could be done with money, this is not our money. I do admit that the Federal Government has first right of refusal on the taxpayers' paycheck. I recognize they do that. I don't agree with that. But I think what we have to do is say having first right of refusal isn't right, but the taxpayer turns that money over willingly, and they have the right to know how we spend their money. They have the right to know what those priorities are going to be. So all the functions of the budget are supposed to lay those priorities out. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, when I have talked with my constituents about this budget, the number one thing that they have said is this: With the way the taxes are going up, with the way the spending is going up in Washington, I am having too much month left over at the end of my money. And they think the priority reflected in this budget ought not to be the Federal Government's having first right of refusal on that paycheck. The first priority ought to be leaving that paycheck with the person that earned it. Well, what a novel idea. What a novel idea. 
   Well, let's just look at what we see in the Democrat leadership's budget. Well, the largest tax increase in American history. Here it is. And you can see previously we had $241 billion in 1993. That was President Clinton's tax increase. But now look at the number over there: $683 billion in tax increases over a 5-year period of time to pay for the spending that this House wants to participate in. 
   Well, we know this is going to be costly. So when you look at a chart of what it's going to cost every State, $2,611 is what it will cost the average Tennessean. In my district in Tennessee, that number is $2,668. 
   Well, taxes seem to be a priority, enough of a priority that this Democrat leadership wants to increase taxes on my constituents in the Seventh District of Tennessee $2,668. But, Mr. Chairman, they had the opportunity to extend sales tax deductibility, which those of us in Tennessee have enjoyed because we don't have a State income tax. And every Democrat on the Budget Committee voted against giving that tax relief to my constituents in Tennessee because they wanted higher taxes. 
   Well, the question is, what are they going to do with this tax money once they get it? And here is a chart that shows their discretionary increases. Well, we see $23 billion above the request in fiscal 2009. And, whoops, look at what's going to happen over there: $280 billion. And what does that discretionary spending buy the taxpayer? Well, Mr. Chairman, there are $280 billion worth of earmarks. We're going to have another $280 billion, not hundred, not thousand, not million, but billion with a ``b,'' $280 billion worth of earmarks that we are going to see over a 5-year period of time. 
   The American people have said enough is enough. They want that discretionary spending to come down. They want the earmark spending to come down. 
   Well, let's take a look at one more thing, and that is entitlements. And we don't even have enough time, obviously, to address that. This House has chosen not to address it. This leadership has chosen not to address it. And look at this chart. By the time we get to 2030, it is going to take every tax dollar coming in to pay for the entitlements of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.     
   We know there is a crisis coming with entitlements. We know that we are going to see earmarks increase. And my constituents are telling me they've had enough of it. They've got too much month left over at the end of that money, and they want to keep more of that money in their pocket.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule that is bringing this legislation to the floor today, because what we have is 768 pages of a bill, H.R. 3221, and, guess what, it doesn't do a thing about producing one drop of energy. It does not get the price down at the pump. 
   And that is what the American people continue to ask us, what are you going to do about high home heating bills? What are you going to do about the price at the pump? And, yes, indeed, as my esteemed colleague just said, alternatives are important. Looking to the future is important. R&D, all of that. We have to have emphasis there. 
   But at the same time, we have to realize production, American production and American solutions are important to this debate, and we have got 768 pages that do not put the emphasis on American production to address this. 
   What we do have is increased regulation. We have got a section in this bill that would put the Federal Government more into the process by which States develop and enforce their own building codes. 
   Regulation is not going to get us to further conservation. We know that efficiency is important. We know that conservation is important. But we also know if you overregulate and if you overtax, you are going to be killing jobs. 
   We know for a fact that if you get in here and you tax something more, you are going to get less of it. If you incentivize it, you are going to get more of it. The American people want to see the price down at the pump. That is not what they are going to see in this bill that is brought before us today. 
   Conservation and efficiency is important. It is not the total answer, and we are missing a great opportunity to incentivize American production of American fuels that will move us towards energy independence. We are not doing that with this legislation. 
   In the portion of this that deals with the tax, one of the things that we have seen happen here is that we have more taxes. They put cigar taxes in place. They put health insurance taxes in place. 
   I tell you, this new majority, if it is moving, if it is shaking, if it is waving in the wind, they are going to tax it, because they need money to pay for the programs that they are putting on the books. And it is the American taxpayer that is paying more at the pump that is watching their gas tax go up. They are watching cigarette and cigar taxes go up. When they get their statement for their health insurance, they are going to see a tax on that, because they had to find a way to pay for all these new programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, they are just addicted to putting a tax on everything that is moving. We are seeing the same thing take place in this lack-of-energy bill that is brought before us today.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, you know, to the Americans who are watching what is taking place on this floor over the past couple of days, it probably seems like a story nightmare, what is up is down, what is down is up; 215 is assumed to be less than 213. There you go. And I do think that Thursday night's vote is still going to continue to be one of those actions of disgrace when we talk about the history of this House. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, it is a pattern of action that we see. They are for tax increases. They voted for the single largest tax increase in history, they did  that on March 29th, for personal earmarks, and then admitting that they're putting earmarks in legislation to buy votes. That is taking place. Oh, and hiding those earmarks in slush funds. We forgot about that one. 
   Record spending. Never in the history of the world has a legislative body spent as much money as this body is spending under Democrat control. $193 billion in cuts to Medicare, inflicting that on our senior citizens, and yes, fixing that vote to give illegal immigrants benefits, shelter, food, paychecks, putting them before the American people. 
   We will continue to fight for freedom and stand for security.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, if my grandmother were standing here today, she would say your actions are speaking so loudly I cannot hear one single word you are saying. And she would be saying that about the mistreatment of our veterans by this majority. 
   It has been over 140 days since the House passed the MilCon-VA approps bill and 8 weeks since the slow-moving Senate passed it. The bill has strong bipartisan support and the President has poised his pen ready to sign that bill. 
   Well, now the Democrats have decided they are going to delay it. They are going to play politics with it. They are going to pile on other things around it. And they are doing it to use it as a political tool. How very, very sad we find this situation. 
   We need to make certain that a political tool is not made of our veterans and our men and women in uniform. They have sacrificed so much for this country. It is imperative that we move  the bill forward as a stand-alone bill. As we go into Veterans Day, let's honor those who served by the actions they see us take.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to speak about the Ag approps bill that is going to come before us, and the culture of tax and spend that is just running unabated in this House. 
   And why should we expect the Ag approps bill to be any different? Well, of course it is not any different. It is going to be more of the same; it is going to be more of the same tax and spend. 
   And again we see a piece of legislation that is spending more than what the President requested, which many of us think was too much in the first place; 5.6 percent more than the President requested and 5.9 percent more than last year. You know what, Mr. Speaker? There are a lot of Americans that would like to see a 5.9 percent increase in their paycheck. 
   It is time for this House to get its fiscal house in order. It is time for the liberal left to stop spending the taxpayer's money. This is the ``Hold-On-To-Your-Wallet'' Congress. They're proving it every single day.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, in middle Tennessee today, you are going to pay about $3.93 for a gallon of gas. My constituent families know that this price is outrageous, and they know that now they are being faced with choices: How much are they going to put in the tank or how much are they going to put in that grocery cart when they go to the grocery store? This is unacceptable, and my constituents know that. 
   They also know that there are some things that we could and should be doing. May I offer a suggestion to that, Mr. Speaker. Here is a simple way to start: 
   To the Democrat leadership, admit you made a mistake, and repeal the so-called Energy Independence and Security Act that you passed last December that didn't produce one bit of oil or gas or move anything to the marketplace. It put in place roadblocks, and we have far too many roadblocks to putting gas into the pumps and into our cars. 
   Specifically, let's repeal section 526 of this so-called Energy Policy Act, and let's get rid of a roadblock that makes it more difficult for the U.S. Government to address the needs that we have and, certainly, for our Air Force. 
   There are many things that we could and should be doing before we leave for July 4. There are things that we could and should be doing to make certain that our constituents have a safer July 4th celebration. 
   Let's reduce the price at the pump.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, you know, I do believe that everybody engaged in this debate today does have the best intentions at heart. And the beauty of this House is that important issues like this that face our country can be debated, and passionately debated, right here on the floor of the House for the public to see.  
   But this is not a debate about passion, and it is not a debate about style. It is, Mr. Speaker, a debate about substance. And the substance of this debate today is life. Clear and simple, it is life. That is why I rise to support ethical stem cell research and to oppose H.R. 3. 
   We hear from a lot of proponents of stem cell research that they have suggested that embryonic stem cells would provide potential benefits to all mankind, and some of them insinuate that those of us or anybody who opposes their brand of research doesn't care about the suffering of their fellow man, and that is completely untrue. 
   There are many of us with family and friends who look for breakthroughs for debilitating diseases. But the presumption that only embryonic stem cells have the most potential for success is inaccurate. The growth of these cells can be erratic and uncontrollable. We have had people speak to that today. And we all know that embryonic stem cell research has not given science any successes in treating diseases. 
   In my opinion, I think we would be giving away a little part of our humanity and our sense of ethics for mere hope that this form of research would some day at some point yield results that would surpass ongoing research. 
   So let's focus on the efforts that are proven alternatives, adult stem cell, cord blood research that have made great leaps, significant success. This past week, the researchers from Wake Forest and Harvard, using the latest in technology, made reports showing advances in stem cell research that can be achieved faster and safer with amniotic fluids. 
   I encourage everyone to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3 and to support our motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4, the Big Government Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. This bill is politically driven, and it will result in a one-size-fits-all program that gives us higher drug prices, less consumer choice, and will certainly not uphold some of the access that has been made available through Medicare part D. And we know that seniors want choice. We hear that from them. They want to preserve the doctor-patient relationship, and they want access to prescriptions in their local communities. 
   What H.R. 4 does is to open the door for Big Government to decide what medicines patients receive instead of their doctors. 
   Unfortunately, the Democrats are rushing the bill to the floor to undo the hard work of Medicare part D. We know from survey after survey that over three-fourths of seniors are satisfied with this program. 
   There have been no discussions, no hearings, no analysis on how this proposal will impact the access of seniors. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on a subject that is first on the minds and the wallets of the American public, and that is the cost of rising energy prices. 
   We are in the middle of the summer, and prices at the pump are above $3 a gallon in much of America. The liberal leadership was going to fix the high gas prices, and they have responded by offering no solutions. They offered so-called ``price gouging'' legislation, but it did nothing to address the root problem of high gas prices. 
   The American public wants innovation, not procrastination. They want energy exploration, not bureaucratic red tape. They want this Congress to do their jobs and put forth a plan that will power this country, self sufficiently, into this century and beyond. The liberal leadership, meanwhile, is missing in action on the issue. 
   America needs to change the way we look at how we produce energy, and in the next couple of weeks the Republican Conference will take the lead in unfurling a long-term energy plan for the future. It will not only address our immediate power concerns but those for decades to come.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (THE BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, we are looking forward to spending some time on the floor over the next several months and several weeks and spending some time talking with our colleagues and talking with the American people about the budget. 
   Everybody hears a lot about the budget and about this budget document that is several hundred pages thick, that it is what directs t he spending, and I think that most Americans know that the House of Representatives is basically the keeper of the purse, if you will, for the American public. 
   Now, some of my colleagues from the Republican Study Committee and I want to make certain that we all understand how this money is spent because we fully believe that the American people have the right to know, they have the right to know and they should know, how their budget gets spent, how those tax dollars get spent because we know, Madam Spe aker, this is not the Government's money; it is the taxpayers' money. And we want to shine the light on how those dollars are being spent. We want to break down this process. We want to demystify the process and invite the American people to join us and follow us. 
   We believe Government spends too much money. We believe that Government never gets enough of your money. They never get enough of the taxpayers' dollars and, indeed, one of my favorite analogies is from one of my favorite plays, ``Little Shop of Horrors,'' and I think we have many Americans who fully believe that the U.S. House of Representatives, the Congress, that the Federal Government, that this big enormous bureaucracy that liberals have built as a monument to themselves, the bureaucracy never gets enough of the taxpayers' money. It's like Audrey II in ``Little Shop of Horrors,'' never can get enough to eat. And what that bureaucracy wants to just chomp away on every day is your money. It is the taxpayers' money. 
   So we want to make cert ain that we spend some time going through this budget process spelling out where those dollars get spent, how the dollars get spent, actually, basically, holding a classroom for our colleagues, spending some time talking about the budget document; talking about the consequences that come with baseline budgeting; talking about what would happen if we went to zero-based budgeting; talking about performance-based budgeting; dissecting the appropriations bills; highlighting the risk of growing entitlements; and also addressing the waste that we find in earmarks. 
   So today as our first session, we thought it would be a good idea to review how Washington spent the taxpayers' money last year. 
   We have it broken down by household, and we always find that when we speak in terms of billions and trillions in Washington-speak, that we are talking about numbers that are really big. So we went in here and said how much is it per household that was spent in 2007 in the name of Government. What did we appropriate and s pend of your money? Came out to be $24,106 per household. That's the highest total since World War II. 
   The Federal Government collected about $21,992 per household in taxes. So what did that give us? If you are spending $24,106 per household and then you are taking in $21,992 per household, Madam Speaker, think about that. That is each household's share of taxes: $21,992. 
   But it wasn't enough. That wasn't enough. Audrey II wanted a little bit more. The bureaucracy wanted more. The bureaucracy couldn 't curb their spending. So they spent that $24,106. So that leaves the taxpayer and future generations a deficit each year that becomes a debt. And the deficit last year came out to $2,114 per household. 
   All of that is going to land in the laps of our children, and in my case, a grandchild that is going to arrive in May. Welcome. Because there's going to be a debt from the U.S. Government on that child's head when he arrives. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to yield at this time to the gentleman from Californ ia (Mr. Campbell) who chairs our Republican Study Committee budget committee and is doing great work on this issue. He's going to take the lead on many of these issues; and at this time I yield to the gentleman from California.

What we saw from the `01 and `03 tax reductions was that the Federal Government's revenue, the money the taxpayers are sending in for us to appropriate and spend on behalf of them at the Federal level, that money has been increasing in double digits every year since we started the tax reductions, which allows our taxpayers to keep more money in their pockets. So, what we saw was we made those reductions, and then the Federal Treasury is bringing in more money from the taxpayers. But what we also saw was that Congress continued to increase the percentage and increase their spending.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Well, I appreciate that. And especially when you consider the fact that 77 million baby boomers are going to retire between now and 2029. You were j ust pointing to 2030. And where we are with getting to that budget in 2030, you would be able to pay for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and defense when you get to the line on 2030. And I think also, as we look at our entitlements and we look at Social Security, we know that in 1960, we had a 5:1 worker ratio, five workers for every one retiree. In 2007, this past year, we've had three workers for every one retiree. And by the time we get to 2030, we're going to have two workers for every one retiree. So you're going to have a married couple with children supporting their family plus supporting a retiree, and I think that that adds to the push that we feel and the urgency that we feel. 
   You're exactly right. And I thank the gentleman from California for all the leadership that he brings to this issue because beginning to deal with the long-term structural issues that exist in this budget are vitally important to us. It is something that has to be dealt with, and it's something we can't kick the can d own the road. And I yield.

Madam Speaker, it is a true desire that he has to be certain that we provide transparency to the American people and that we become good stewards of the tax dollar, that we exercise good stewardship, because these are dollars that the taxpayers send to us and entrust to us to use. As I said earlier and as the gentleman from New Jersey pointed out so well, $21,992 per household in taxes, and even that is not enough to meet the $24,106 that the Federal Government spent per household. And this is where some of that money goes:  
   Social Security and Medicare, $8,301 of that $21,992 went to Social Security and Medicare. Defense saw $4,951. The anti-poverty programs, whi ch are our TANF programs, supplemental security income, things of that nature, $3,500. Interest on the Federal debt, $2,071; Federal retiree benefits, $907. This is all out of that, per family, per household. Health research and regulation, $664; veterans benefits, $627; education, $584; highways and mass transit, $418; justice administration, $392; natural resources and the environment, $305. And certainly we know much of that money is going into bureaucracy, much of it is going into wasteful spending.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for continuing the conversation about how we should be good stewards with the taxpa yers' dollars and looking at how we spend those environment dollars, $305 per family, spent on environment and energy programs last year. Unemployment benefits, as he said, the best economic stimulus is a job, unemployment benefits, $299 per family. As you talk about developing energy resources, community and regional development, $282 per family. But his point is it is imperative that regardless of what the sector, regardless what we are talking about, whether it is Social Security, defense, antipoverty pr ograms, community development, or unemployment, it is imperative that we exercise good judgment and we use wisdom as we make these decisions, because the taxpayers do need to know how we are spending their money and how it relates to each and every family and what their share of that pie is. 
   Really, the leading expert on the family budget in the House is the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) who is chairman of the Republican Study Committee which is embarking on this project to demystify the bu dget and to make certain that our constituents and our colleagues all understand how we bring the budget together.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for that. So we have got the $21,992 that the average household paid in 2007, and then they had on top of that the $2,100 deficit for the year, and the Federal Government spending $24,106. But what you are saying is the current budget policies are going to push that up even another $3,000 per family over the next 3 years. 
   I just highlight to my colleagues that we have talked a good bit today about the overall budget process and why we think the taxpayer has the right to know how this body spends your money. The taxpayer has the right to know what is going to be there in the form of a deficit and a debt that their children are going to have to pick up the burden on and carry that burden. 
   The taxpayer has the right to know what is looming with Medica re and Medicaid and Social Security and the entitlements that are there that are put on automatic pilot. They have the right to know what the budget processes are, what is the difference in baseline budgeting and zero-base budgeting and performance-based budgeting; what are the benefits that would be derived by transparency. 
   They have the right to know how the Budget Committee goes through the process of setting the parameters on this budget. And certainly they have the right to know what takes place in the appropriations process. They have the right to know what is wasteful spending and what are earmarks and what is in front of us with this entire document. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank you for the time that you have yielded to us. We are going to be back next week. We are going to continue to talk about this issue. I hope that people will follow this with us at House.Gov/Hensarling/RSC. We would hope that we hear from them and that we bring an element of transparency and therefore accountability to the bud geting process.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I heard from one of my constituents who said they felt like this bill was not really about rescuing homeowners, they felt like it was another attempt at wealth redistribution. They felt that the risk and the costs that are borne and should be borne by irresponsible lenders, investors, and borrowers are going to end up being transferred to the Federal Government and thereby to the American taxpayer once again. And this time, it is to the tune of $300 billion. 
   What the bill does is the good actors, the 92 percent of all mortgage holders who are paying their mortgage on time, they are going to end up being liable for the irresponsible actions of lenders and speculators. The way my constituencies see it, this is a risky business. This Congress should not send a message that it is acceptable to give up on an obligation because you're going to have a government buyout or a bailout and you are going to be able to cut your personal losses. 
   Last week I did a seminar in my district. I worked with some government and private sector initiatives such as Hope Now, working to help homeowners weather the storm, to get the information to them that they needed. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is what we should be doing, educating homeowners on the options at their disposal, as opposed to passing measures that reward recklessness and provide a safety net for irresponsibility. Congress does not need to bail out the housing market, it needs to encourage a kick start. I hope that my colleagues will join me and that together we will vote this bill down.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, the legislation before the House today is nothing short of an abdication of the liberal majority's responsibility to protect the American people. Yesterday's Investor's Business Daily editorial sums the bill up nicely, a ``FISA Fix for Lawyers.'' I could not say it better myself. After all, this bill is nothing short of an earmark for the trial bar, and it reveals the brazen partisan interest of this Democrat majority. 
   Rather than accept the bipartisan legislation adopted in the Senate and endorsed by our Nation's security experts, the liberal elite of this House instead brings forward a $72,440,904 thank you note to the trial bar. Why $72,440,904? That's the amount the trial attorneys have contributed to Democrat candidates in the 2008 election cycle. 
   But it might only be a down payment for the potential liability interest that they have if they get their way on their earmark bill. We have to say, at what cost? We have heard the story that I used in a Memphis story on February 28 of our three American soldiers who were kidnapped.

   Now, we know that we're going to see the tax on private insurance. We've heard from some of our individuals who are questioning why in the world are you putting a tax, you've got a tax on everything, why are you taxing our health insurance benefits? 
   We're hearing from our tobacco farmers and our friends in the agriculture community that are quite upset about cigarette and cigar and tobacco taxes there. And as the gentleman from Georgia just said, this grand plan basically says, seniors, we need you to smoke more so that you can help pay for this plan to expand SCHIP to middle- and upper-income families. 
   And being a mother, I can tell you that a 25-year-old probably is a little bit offended to be called a child, because 25-year-olds are adults. They are young adults, and they are working, and they do not need to be on those programs.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against this extremely flawed SCHIP bill. I support the original intent of SCHIP, which is to cover our moderate- to low-income children at 200 percent of the poverty level. Yet the bill before us today goes much further. It does expand the program, and it does move it from a block grant to an entitlement, and it moves patients towards a universal, government-run health care that shifts patients from private care to a massive government entitlement program. 
   And I know what runaway health care costs in a broken system look like. As a former member of the Tennessee Senate, I watched TennCare, Tennessee's statewide Medicaid-managed care service, which was granted under one of those waivers, I have watched this thing invoke stress, pain and hardship on both health care providers and consumers. It does not work. Someone always has to pay the bill. 
   Over 10 years, also, this CHAMP bill would make $193 billion worth of cuts from Medicare services for our seniors. It didn't work. It is not going to work here.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I support the original intent of SCHIP to cover our low-income children at 200 percent of the Federal poverty level; yet the bill before us really strays from that, and we all know it. 
   And we're debating this under a lockdown rule because the Rules Committee refused to allow Republican amendments to this bill, and I will tell you, I found that 1 a.m. meeting for the Rules Committee informative and entertaining in an unfortunate sense. 
   The debate on this, as my colleague said, is pretty simple: Who will manage and control the health care sector that comprises one-seventh of our Nation's economy. That's what this is about today. Are individual Americans going to have the freedom to make those choices or are those Americans going to be relegated to being a faceless file on a bureaucrat's desk with that bureaucrat making those life-and-death decisions? Our future health care system is going to be shaped by the way we answer those questions on this floor today. 
   Under this Democrat bill, there will be billions spent to enroll children into SCHIP. 
   I encourage my colleagues to oppose this bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 20, FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, today we are considering this Democrat joint resolution, which really is nothing more than a big old omnibus bill. It is a bill that uses what appears to be budget gimmicks and what appears to be some misleading rhetoric to mask their true passion, which is spending more of the taxpayer dollars on government programs. And we know government does not have a revenue problem. Government has a spending problem. 
   And despite their campaign promises, they are refusing to allow the House to discuss and vote on something that they advocated just last month, which would have been a true continuing resolution to restore fiscal responsibility and to pay down the deficit. 
   Now, as my colleague from Texas said, Representative Campbell offered an amendment, which would have been a true CR. It would have spent $6.2 billion less. But they didn't want that. They wanted the omnibus. If they were committed to fiscal responsibility, they would join us in that CR. They would help pass Paul Ryan's line item veto bill, and they would show what fiscal responsibility looks like. It is another action of the hold-onto-your-wallet Congress. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia. He does such a wonderful job of pulling the Truth Squad together and helping us focus on the issues that are important to our constituents and of concern to our constituents and of concern to all Americans. 
   Certainly the process that we have seen carried out here in the House of Representatives is one that causes us concern. For those of us who respect regular order, who respect the integrity of the House, to see an omnibus spending bill go straight from the drafting table of a couple of Members, one in the Senate and one in the House, and then come directly to the floor for a vote is of tremendous concern.     
   We all know that our Nation has a process that was laid forth in the founding of this Nation, a process by which this body would conduct its business on behalf of the people, the people's House. Today, as I heard some of my colleagues across the aisle talk about how we had returned to regular order, I thought, oh, my goodness, I do not think this is what people had in mind. 
   I really do not think, Mr. Speaker, that when people went to the polls in November and voted and said we want to see a change in things, we want greater accountability, we want greater transparency and we are frustrated with what we have seen in Washington. I do not think this is what they had in mind, and certainly we would hope this is not the process that the Democrat majority will follow as they talk about what is going to be regular order. 
   What the gentleman from Georgia just said about the omnibus is so very true. As he said, this is a continuing resolution. It requires two sheets of paper. It is a total of about 40 lines of type. That is it. It just says we abide by the budget that was in place in 2006. Our constituents may remember that the budget that we passed in 2006 was the budget that made 1 percent across-the-board reductions in spending, 1 percent. It was a $40 billion savings to the American people. 
   Now, the budget, this omnibus budget, this 137 pages is going to end up spending about $17 billion more. So they are reducing and doing away with the savings that we worked hard to put in place. 
   The thing that is of tremendous concern to me, and I am so delighted to see the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) who is such an advocate for our military and is really, having chaired our Armed Services Committee, speaks so well to that issue and I know he is going to talk about it, but it just breaks my heart to know that our National Guard troops and our troops at Ft. Campbell, which is located in my district, are going to have far less money for quality of life because of the actions that were taken in this budget and the way in this budget, in this document, H.J. Res. 20, and people can go online and pull this up and look, and how they have taken from military quality of life, money that should be going to our military families and have moved that to other departments; how they took money from our military quality of life, $50 million, and that is given to the Palestinian Authority. That is something that with my constituents has certainly raised a lot of questions. 
   The thing that interested me when it came to the issue of the earmarks was they had said, oh, no earmarks are going to be in this budget, and then I found out that, well, there were earmarks that were in the budget. Nevada seems to have earmarks. Other States seem to have some curious earmarks that are left in there, but then there are funds that are turned back to the agencies. 
   I said, well, how does this money get spent? Is it done with letters of instruction? How is it done? What I found out was that the process that they would revert to, and I guess this is regular order, would be the process before money started being earmarked. It is where you pick up the phone and you call the agency and say let me tell you how I think we need to spend that money. 
   My constituents long ago said they did not want the activities of smoke-filled rooms. They wanted more transparency and the American people wanted to see greater accountability, and I think that we will continue to hear from our constituents. They want a smaller budget that is going to be more responsible of their money. This is not our money. It is the taxpayers' money. Government does not have a revenue problem. With the tax reductions that have been passed, the Federal Government has brought in more money than ever. 
   What government has is a spending problem. It has a priority problem, and this big, bloated budget that was passed today is a budget that will continue to fund a bloated bureaucracy that just cannot get enough of our constituents' money. 
   I was disappointed today with the actions of the majority. I was disappointed in how they chose to carry it out. I do hope that we see a change in the way they carried forth, and to the gentleman from Georgia, I will tell you, I hope that we continue to see a return to a respect for how we address the people's business in this House. 
   We talked some about one man, one vote and the sanctity of that and the importance of that, and I do hope that  everyone will continue to keep their focus on being certain that we respect that for our constituents. 
   I thank the gentleman for the time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (NATIONAL CAPITAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6842, The Second Amendment Enforcement Act. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court rightly overturned the unconstitutional gun ban enforced by the District of Columbia. 
   The Court recognized what Tennesseans have always known, that the second amendment applies to individuals, and that all law-abiding Americans have an inherent right to self-defense. The ruling was a victory for freedom and constitutional rights.  
   Sadly, the District of Columbia has chosen to turn a blind eye to the court and the constitution by re-legislating the gun ban piece by piece. DC has legislated that guns must be trigger locked or disassembled in the home, rendering it nearly impossible for law-abiding citizens from purchasing guns in the District. 
   When the court overturned the ban, I breathed a sigh of relief for the young women on my staff who are now able to appropriately defend themselves. Imagine my surprise when the District dictated that those same staffers store their guns in pieces or with trigger locks until an ``immediate'' threat presents itself. Have you ever heard of anything so ridiculous? When a threat is immediate, you don't have time to find a key or put together a gun! 
   I stand for the right of all Americans to defend themselves and in support of H.R. 6842, which will make the policy of the District of Columbia consistent with the ruling of the court and the clear intent of the Constitution.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, as I rise I do want to say a special thank you to our troops who are deployed tonight, to those that are from Tennessee's Seventh Congressional District, many of those from Fort Campbell, and our National Guardsmen, our Reservists, certainly to our veterans. 
   I can think of no more wonderful gift to give those and to leave for those you love than the gift of freedom. And certainly, on Valentine's Day, on Valentine's evening that is an important, important thought for us to have. And I appreciate all of our men and women and the efforts that they make to keep this Nation free, and to be certain that our children and our grandchildren have the opportunity to grow up in freedom and to enjoy the America that we have enjoyed. 
   As we have talked about this resolution, the 97 words that exist in this very short resolution, we have talked about it from different angles, how a nonbinding resolution and a no confidence resolution affects our troops, the thoughts that went into creating this resolution. And one of the questions that I continually come back to that actually was posed to me by some of the veterans in my district, is whose side are you on? When you offer a resolution like this, whose side are you on? 
   And the other question that keeps coming back is who are you listening to? 
   Certainly, I would hope that we would all be standing on the side of freedom. I would hope that we would all be standing on the side of our troops. And I do hope that we would all be listening to our commanders in the field. 
   There has been some mention this evening of General David Petraeus, who this weekend took control of command in Iraq. And I will give you some of his quotes, some of the things that he has had to say in the last few days as he is over there and working those. And I quote from him. ``Our job in the months ahead, supporting and working with Iraqi forces, will improve our security so that the Iraqi Government can resolve the tough issues it faces, and so that the economy and basic services can be improved. These tasks are achievable. This mission is doable.''     
   Indeed, those on the ground believe this is doable. We know that it is doable, and we know in the global war on terror we have to win. We cannot lose. We have to win. The civilized world depends on defeating terrorists and winning. 
   We also know that Iraqis are making progress. There has been some debate and some mention tonight about progress not being made in Iraq. And, Mr. Speaker, I will offer to you that indeed you are not going to hear this on the 6 o'clock news, the 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock news around the country because the major media outlets just don't want to report it. But we are finding out that while this body sets aside a political debate that some think will benefit them, what we see is our troops in the field in Iraq are making progress. They understand their mission. They know what they are about every day. We see that even just in the last few days, when you are talking about Baghdad, three Iraqi Army brigades are now deploying to Baghdad to reinforce the six Iraqi Army brigades and nine National Police brigades that are already there. These are steps that are taking place. This is progress that the Iraqi people are making on behalf of their quest for freedom. These are their steps, these are their steps toward freedom and toward leadership. 
   How dare we discount that? How dare we not recognize that? How dare we not encourage that? And how dare we take steps to embolden and encourage the enemy who would seek to strike them down? 
   Mr. Speaker, we should be very, very careful whom we listen to, and we should be very thoughtful as we answer the question, Whose side are you on? 
   I am so grateful, Mr. Speaker, that those that have gone before us chose to be on the side of freedom.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding the time, as we come to the floor to debate this nonbinding, no confidence resolution that is going to serve to discourage our troops and embolden our enemies. 
   I have noted that this obviously is the best that the Democrats have to offer when it comes to national security and to their thoughts on how we deal with the situation in Iraq, and that is a disappointment to me.     
   I think that the question that we have to ask is, whose side are you on? Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of winning? Are you on the side of freedom? Or are you on the side of allowing the terrorists to get an upper hand? 
   And as I begin my remarks, I do want to thank the troops that live in my district, those of the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell, members of the National Guard who have served with distinction, Reservists who have been deployed more than once. I want to thank their families, and I want to thank the veterans that served in an advisory capacity to me as we look at these issues and as we make decisions about how best to approach preserving freedom, preserving liberty, and preserving the sovereignty of this great Nation as we know it. I thank them. I am grateful for their sacrifice. I am grateful for their service to this Nation, and I want it to be noted on this day. They have a commitment and a perspective and a love of freedom that few Americans will ever know. I wish that we all did. 
   I am grateful also that they can articulate so fluently their mission and what they are called on to do every day in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and in the 30 countries around the globe where Americans fight to preserve freedom. They articulate this in e-mails and blogs, and even in notes and letters to their Member of Congress. 
   I also, Mr. Speaker, want to recognize the Kurdish community that calls Nashville, Tennessee home, and recognize their commitment and their appreciation to our U.S. troops. One of the points that many of them make to me regularly and also one of the points that our men and women in uniform make regularly is to remind us of why we are in this fight, why we are in this fight and providing the historical perspective that is so important. This didn't begin on September 11. It did indeed begin long, long, long ago. 
   Indeed, the radical Islamists have fought Judaism and Christianity not for decades but for centuries. This is something that we all know. The Islamic radicals did get a toe-hold in Iran in the late 1970s with the approach at that point by President Carter, then President Carter, and those around him. And now those radicals tell us, they tell us that Iraq is indeed the central front in the global war on terror. We know that they want to change the Middle East and then they want to change the world. And, Mr. Speaker, that is not the type change that we want. I want my children and grandchildren to live in freedom. I want them to know an America that is free and strong and independent. 
   Our soldiers are fighting. They are fighting every day. They are fighting the insurgents in the field, they are fighting the battle of ideas; and the battle of ideas is a very, very powerful fight in Iraq at this point in time. 
   Now, too many in this Chamber want to add another fight to our military men and women, to their agenda every day. They want them to have to fight the battle of public opinion here in the United States. I see that as a disservice to the men and women in uniform. This legislative body does have a role in oversight of the war, but I do believe, I personally believe it is inappropriate, Mr. Speaker, that we try to micromanage from the comforts of Washington. I do believe that we should be listening to our troops and our commanders in the field. 
   General David Petraeus, who has taken the command, accepted the coalition flag this Saturday, said it very well and I will enter his comments for the Record. He reminds us that progress is being made and lays that out, and I will enter that for the Record and have the opportunity to talk about it again later. I think that what we have to do is realize the resolution before us, Mr. Speaker, will not build morale with the troops on the ground, and it does give the terrorists just what they want. We have to fight back. We have to realize sacrifices do have to be made in order for us to further the cause of freedom and liberty in this great land.  
   The situation in Iraq is exceedingly challenging. The stakes are very high. The way ahead will be hard and there undoubtedly will be many tough days . . . however, ``hard'' is not ``hopeless''; indeed, together with our Iraqi partners, we can and we must prevail. (General David Petraeus, Commander MNF-I, 2/10/07.)

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq is the front line in the war on terror. We know this because the terrorists tell us it is so. In poll after poll, the American people tell us they fully believe that what happens on the front line in Iraq affects their security every single day. 
   You know, the Democrats have every right to disagree with the President's plan, but a nonbinding resolution is not the way to go. It sends a message of no confidence and no support to our troops in the field, weakening their morale while encouraging and emboldening the enemy. 
   Our men and women in harm's way are fighting the insurgents and they are fighting the battle of ideas every day, not only in Iraq but in 30 different countries around this globe. They know that what we have to do is continue to win in that battle, and they don't have time to fight the war of public opinion in this country, which is what some of my colleagues in this House would seek to have them do. 
   The Democrats have no alternative plan; they have no way forward. I welcome a responsible debate on this war, but let's make sure that we keep the focus on encouraging our troops, freedom, prosperity and ideas, and that we not encourage those who seek to do us harm.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   Madam Speaker, this veto will be sustained, and I hope it will allow us to return to the core issue of discussing health care for children, needy, poor American children. That is what our focus should be. It should not be about a secret, giant step towards nationalized health care. It shouldn't be about health care for adults or for middle-class families. It should be about meeting the needs of poor American children. That's what the program was set up to do. 
   Unfortunately, as H.R. 976 is constructed, we are only talking about 800,000 additional children. For all of the hype, for all of the talk, that is what you are talking about. We have seen numerous gimmicks used to try to make this bill work. We have heard about income disregards today. Now, in this bill, there are provisions that would allow you to go to 800 percent of the Federal poverty level. So instead of addressing the needs of poor American children, what we are talking about is providing coverage for families making over $206,500 a year. Madam Speaker, that is not the original intent of this program. 
   Another budget gimmick, in mid-2012, all of a sudden the funding is going to be cut 80 percent. 
   Madam Speaker, what is going to happen to SCHIP in mid-2012? How are we going to meet the needs of those children? This is what we need to do; return to the core issue, strip away all of these attached issues, and get back to what we need to do to be certain that we meet the needs of poor American children, not provide health care to illegal immigrants, not provide health care for the middle class. 
   SCHIP is about those children that are of the working poor, 200 percent of the poverty level. It is a program that deserves to be reinstated under the same rules that it was put in place in 1997.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (THE ENERGY FUTURE OF AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank you for the work on the House Energy Action Team and the leadership that you have provided there on this issue, and for your consistent message that I think most Americans share with us. They understand that fuel sources are abundant in this Nation. The problem is they're restricted. And there is so much regulation and so much red tape that you have to go through in order to arrive at a utilization point for those fuel sources. 
   Now, we've just come past the second remembrance of Katrina. And as we have done that, and as I spent some time down in the gulf coast region during August, so many people would say, you know, it's amazing to me that the Federal Government has not made significant changes in putting refineries, in opening other resources. We're still centered around here, and the hurricane season is coming. And that causes people to say, I question you for what you have not done. And we hear that from our constituents. And I question you about the price at the pump, because they now understand that a lack of refinery capacity in this country, overregulation of refineries, restricted access to fuel sources, yields a higher price at the pump for transportation fuels. It yields a higher mark on the bill when they get it for their home heating oil, for gas for their home, for electricity for their home. They understand this. And I fully believe that the liberal leadership in this House will have to answer to the American people for the high cost to consumers.     
   And that's the first point that I want to touch on today. As you look at what was passed in the energy bill they brought forward that really has no energy production in it, it just deals with all these global warming measures or conservation measures at some point but not really with energy. Just looking at the cost of government-mandated efficiency, now, if I have ever heard an oxymoron, that is probably is it. Government-mandated efficiency. It's not driven by consumers, it's not driven by innovators, but by the government saying reach this mark. 
   What we are seeing is that the new appliance efficiency standards have raised the cost of a good top-loading washing machine, which is the kind I still have in my house. The kind I choose to use is a top loader. They have raised that to over $900. And that is not according to you or me or the Congressional Budget Office. That is according to Consumer Reports. And we know that if the Senate had their way, then it would cost even more. So on our appliances, the mandated efficiency standards are going to end up costing our consumers more when they go to make that purchase. 
   So the gas to get in the car is going to cost them more. The electricity to power the computer is going to cost them more in order to get to the purchase point for that appliance that is going to cost them more.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. The gentleman is exactly right on that. They are expensive forms of energy and electricity. And one of the other components to that, in our Select Committee on Environment and Global Warming today, we had a hearing dealing with carbon emissions and carbon offsets and the cap and trade system that Europe is currently involved in to meet their Kyoto protocols. Well, the interesting point of this is if you were to enact some of the sequestration encaptured for CO  
   2 emissions, what we are seeing and what we are hearing from some research is that this could end up raising a household electric bill $40 a month. 
   Now, what we do know is we have a lot of Americans that would not take kindly to seeing government mandates increase their electric bill every month while we are still not sure if our CO  
   2 emissions are causing the Earth to warm or if it's cyclical. Is it just part of a natural scientific cycle that our wonderful world goes through? We have times of cooling and times of warming. 
   So there are lots of questions that are around this issue, and before we make hasty decisions, one thing we need to do is be certain that we tend to what we know is on our plate; that we tend to, first of all, address lowering the restrictions on our domestic sources of energy, making certain that we can avail ourselves of the oil, of the gas, of the coal that we have domestically, making certain that we are doing the right type of research and looking for alternative sources, making certain that nuclear is available for our power generation. As you said, the least expensive, the cleanest form of electric power generation is the new nuclear. And I will ask the gentleman to reiterate those statistics.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And he is exactly right about the cost and comments about the portfolio. And I think that many of our colleagues would be interested in seeing what the balance is in our portfolio as to where we are pooling our energy sources. And you are right. A well-balanced and appropriate portfolio is going to have many different components to it. Just as with trade, we are going to see many different components in that. We are going to have an opportunity to look at how trade affects this. 
   And you have just put a poster up about our trade deficit, and we certainly can see where we are fitting in here with some of our natural gas and our petroleum and petroleum products and what that means to our trade balance. And at the same time as we look at trade, we look at the portfolio that we have stateside and look at what is contained in that portfolio, and you are exactly right to bring those issues forward. 
   I will just say I thank the gentleman again for yielding. I do think that as we look at this issue, the cost to consumers and the effect on our GDP has to be considered as well as moving forward. The gentlewoman from Virginia mentioned a biodiesel alternative,  algae, and we know that for carbon capture, sometimes that is used to help spur the growth of that algae that is then turned into biodiesel. So you are using an unwanted byproduct to create an item that can be the genesis for an alternative fuel, making certain that we open up American energy resources for American energy solutions. Our domestic energy supply is abundant. And then in order to capitalize, to be resourceful and utilize that, making certain that we are spurring American innovation to find those solutions. 
   And, again, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from California for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I'm rising to oppose this bill. 
   We are all for fair pay; we are all for equal pay for equal work, and we are all against discrimination. But, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2831 does much more than just simply overturn a Supreme Court case in order to provide relief to one plaintiff, Lilly Ledbetter. It constitutes a major change in and extended application of employment discrimination law. 
   In my opinion, what this change would do would serve to impede justice and undermine the important goal of having allegations of discrimination expeditiously resolved. The bill essentially limits the 1964 Civil Rights Act statute of limitations regarding almost every claim of discrimination available under Federal law and potentially broadens the scope and application of the civil rights laws to entirely new fact patterns, practices and claims. 
   It also would allow an employee or any individual who can arguably claim to be affected by an allegedly discriminatory decision relating to compensation wages, benefits, or any other practice to sue for discrimination that may have occurred years or even decades in the past. The anticipated increase in legal and recordkeeping costs created by this legislation would, indeed, be staggering. 
   Congress should not be in the business of removing incentives for prompt resolution of discrimination claims. And that is what this would do; it would remove the incentive to find a prompt and timely resolution to discrimination claims. 
   I thank the gentleman from California, and I encourage my colleagues to vote against the bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this bill. It doesn't produce one bit of energy. It does not generate one kilowatt of electricity. It does not move us toward energy independence. Certainly those are things that need to be a priority when we discuss energy. 
   Now the price of a barrel of oil, we have talked about that today. It is topping $100, but where was it a year ago? It was at $56 for a barrel of oil.     
   I like to talk about what that means to my consumers and the impact that has on my constituents in my district. We have seen the price of a gallon of gas go up 75 cents per gallon in the Seventh District of Tennessee over the past year. Let's say a typical mom in Tennessee's Seventh Congressional District fills up her 15-gallon tank once a week. That is $47 per fill-up. Every month she is spending $44 more on that gasoline than she was last February. The difference for the year is $528 more coming out of her pocket to pay the additional energy cost. 
   Now, there is a bill before us that would tax energy companies and stop new domestic oil and gas production and discourage new investments in refinery capacity. Instead of making America more energy secure, we are seeing things that would drive us to be more dependent on sources from Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and other nations. 
   It would be great if we were to have a debate on revolutionizing energy and revolutionary energy legislation. But, in reality, the legislation we are discussing today does not alleviate the strain on the consumers. It would be great if we were talking about energy independence. It would be great if we were talking about increasing refinery capacity and if we were going to look at short-term, mid-range, and long-term solutions to our Nation's energy needs. 
   I would encourage all to oppose this bill. Let's talk about solving the energy problem.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, Fort Campbell, one of the Army's largest posts and home to the 101st Airborne Division, is in the seventh district of Tennessee, which I am honored to represent. 
   Currently, over 700 Tennessee National Guardsmen and the bulk of the 101st Airborne are deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   With this in mind, I'm particularly gratified that this House is finally discussing an appropriations bill today. Funding for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs certainly warrants our attention. 
   The brave members of our military, and the families that support them at home, are fulfilling the commitment they made to our Nation by fighting and serving to help protect it. 
   The federal government must in turn fulfill its commitment to provide top-quality equipment, facilities, and training for these heroes, and the best possible care upon their return. 
   On behalf of the men and women in uniform, veterans, and military families in Tennessee's 7th district, I urge my colleagues to support today's measure for MILCON-VA appropriations.      
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired. 
   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. 
   No amendment to the bill may be offered except those printed in the portion of the Congressional Record designated for that purpose in a daily issue dated July 30, 2008, or earlier, and pro forma amendments for the purpose of debate. Each amendment may be offered only by the Member who caused it to be printed, or his designee, and shall be considered read.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, it's so interesting listening to this debate this morning. And I think that the gentleman was rattling off some bills that they have passed. The problem is they're all talk and no action. They don't do anything to get the price down at the pump; don't actually accomplish the goal of producing any more oil. 
   What the American people want to see is not right now a debate on a bill which could go through on a voice vote, the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network. What they want is for us to take the time to address the price at the pump and the cost of energy. 
   My constituents in Tennessee ask me every week, what did you all do to address the price at the pump? They know that we, as Americans, are the greatest innovators that there are. American ingenuity can solve all sorts of problems. They know that we have the resources on American soil to address this issue. They also know that we need a short-term, a mid-range and a long-term strategy. 
   Now, to my colleagues, I will say no is not an energy strategy, and no is not an energy policy. No is a roadblock to a sustainable, predictable energy source. 
   Now, we can go in and look at what was happening with the price of a barrel of oil, and we're using about 21 million barrels of oil in America today to get the 420 million gallons of gasoline that you are pumping when you go to fill up your car. 
   Now, when the Democrats took the gavels in the House and in the Senate, and they're the ones that are setting the legislative agenda, they are the ones that are saying no to getting this price down, they are the ones who are making decisions that continue to drive it up. $123.85 a barrel. That's where it was yesterday. That is where it was. 
   What has caused this to happen? 
   Mr. Speaker, I would say it is because of the history of action. When you look at ANWR exploration, House Republicans have supported this 91 percent of the time. House Democrats have opposed it 86 percent of the time. 
   Coal-to-liquid. There's another innovative source. 97 percent of the Republicans have supported it. 78 percent of the Democrats have opposed it.  
   Oil shale exploration. House Republicans have supported it 90 percent of the time. House Democrats have opposed this American solution to American resources and American energy 86 percent of the time. 
   The Outer Continental Shelf. We know that Cuba is letting China drill 50 miles off our shores. What are we doing with the Outer Continental Shelf? 81 percent of the time House Republicans support that. Democrats oppose that 83 percent of the time.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, actions speak louder than words. Rhetoric is what the Democrats have given us on the issue of the price at the pump, on the issue of home heating oil. 
   The American people want answers and they want solutions. And what they are getting from the Democrat leadership is prices that are going up and up and up and up, in my district, from $2.20 a gallon to $3.99. $3.99. That is what Democrat leadership of this body has given you.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (THE PRICE OF GASOLINE: CONGRESS MUST TAKE ACTION TO LOWER GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, traveling through my district in west and middle Tennessee this past week, gasoline and the price at the pump are what everybody is talking about. Busy moms in Tennessee are now spending about $240 to fill the minivan up every month. That's about $100 more than it was when the Democrats took control of the gavels in both the Senate and the House. 
   Well, the Congress must stop talking and they must take action so that we can solve this problem. 
   Government has been and continues to be a roadblock when it comes to lowering gas prices. Republicans want to incentivize efficiency and innovation. We want to incentivize and promote production of American energy resources for an American solution to this problem. We want to incentivize ingenuity. We are innovators. We can solve this problem when we put our best minds to it. 
   And there are some concrete steps that we could and should take now, things that we have supported, like repealing and delaying the ethanol mandates; taking advantage of our natural resources, western shale, ANWR. 
   Mr. Speaker, families are calling out for relief. Let's take action.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the recognition, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here this evening to speak with our colleagues and certainly to have a conversation with the American people about what has transpired on the floor of this House today. 
   I know most families are beginning to look toward the Christmas season, and they are looking toward a winter holiday and spending time with family and with friends. And many of them have worked diligently to meet their deadlines to be certain that they have time set aside for such an observance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say that the leadership of the House has worked that diligently and is focused on meeting those deadlines so that we would all be spending that time with our families. But indeed, we have found that is not the case. In unusual moves and through an unusual process, we are still at work, because we find that a budget has not been passed that should have been done before the 1st of September but didn't. 
   So, what happens with this the process when you don't get your work done, when you don't meet your deadlines, when you disregard what you are charged to do and the duty that you are to fulfill? You find that you get backed into a corner. And, Mr. Speaker, when that happens, then you have to start working your way out of it. 
   Well, in the House of Representatives, when we are backed in that corner and we are unable to fulfill our work in a timely manner, instead of passing our appropriations bills and funding our government one bill at a time, we decide we are going to roll it all together, and then we have what is called the omnibus. And it is a great big spending bill, a great big spending bill, Mr. Speaker, where you throw everything into this that your heart could possibly desire. It is better than any Santa sack in town. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to be certain that everyone realizes this big bill, this 3,565 pages of bill that weighs 34.4 pounds is indeed a Santa's sack loaded with pork and with earmarks, over 9,200 earmarks. 
   In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, I think that it is fair to say that this also is a symbol. It is a symbol of the broken process that this House has gone through in arriving at a budget. It is a symbol of the broken priorities that exist. And, indeed, it is a symbol of the broken promises of the leadership of this House to not only the body of the House but the American people. 
   I have some colleagues joining me tonight to talk a little bit about what we find in this 34.4 pounds, 3,565 pages. And, Mr. Speaker, I know we are going to talk about energy and the environment. I am saddened to know that we have had a lot of trees give their life to print these bills this week. 
   I would like to recognize the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin, for some remarks on this legislation.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for coming and speaking. We are members of the Republican Study Committee. If you want to find out a little more about what is in this bill, you can go to our Web site, which is House.gov/hensarling/RSC, and find out a little bit about the details in this bill. 
   As the gentleman from Wisconsin pointed out, this is serious business. We are responsible for the budget process of the House. The House holds the purse strings for the Federal Government; and it is a duty that we, many of us, take very, very seriously. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is of tremendous concern to us when a bill is filed at 12:30 a.m., the dark of night, this bill gets filed and within 24 hours this 3,565-page bill is voted out. And as the gentleman said, there is no funding for our troops on the ground in Iraq who have been making steady, consistent progress. What a disservice to the troops and to the American people. 
   I want to recognize the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), who is chairman of the Republican Study Committee. His Web site, House.gov/hensarling/RSC, that is where you can get a copy of what is in this bill; the $515 billion that is contained in here, plus you can find out where some of those gimmicks, budget gimmicks are; plus, you can take a look at some of the emergency/nonemergency spending that is also in here just so that the majority can spend a little bit more money. 
   But I would like to yield to the gentleman from Texas who chairs the Republican Study Committee, Mr. Hensarling.

And again, Mr. Speaker, if someone would like to pull down the summary and get the information on this bill, house.gov/Hensarling, H-E-N-S-A-R-L-I-N-G, /RSC, and they can pull down our summary here. H.R. 2764 is the omnibus. Not a minibus. It is a great big omnibus, all 3,565 pages, and they can see for themselves a little bit about what is contained in here and what is not contained. 
   And as the gentleman from Texas said, the fact that we are a Nation at war and we have men and women in the field in Iraq who are fighting for our freedom, fighting for our ability to be here and to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, fighting for our security so that we can safely and peacefully celebrate Christmas and the holiday season, and we do not honor their service by funding that work. It is a serious error. It is a serious omission. 
   At this time, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg), who has been chairman of the RSC in times past. He serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee. He is one of the leading fiscal conservatives in this body, and I yield to him for his comments on the omnibus.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman and I thank him for his comments on this. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that it is just one of these occurrences that has happened tonight that you just find almost inconceivable, that the majority could have filed a 3,565-page bill in the middle of the night and then bring everybody back to Washington and vote it. 
   Now, as the gentleman from Arizona said, the fiscal year started September 1. This is something that should have been done last summer. But, instead, they wait until Christmas week. They file this bill in the middle of the night. They don't give people time to read it. And then, as we do begin to read it, we find what we thought at first was going to be about 7,000 earmarks, read a little more, the number is growing to 8,000. Then, Mr. Speaker, lo and behold, we get up to 9,000. Then it goes to over 9,200. We find that 300 of those earmarks had not been discussed by anybody. They just appeared out of thin air, like magic. They just appeared and got written in to this bill that passed the House tonight. 
   That is not fiscal responsibility. That, Mr. Speaker, is what you call fiscal irresponsibility. It is the symbol of a broken process, with broken priorities, and it is broken promises. That is something that is very troubling to us as we are here this Christmas week hard at work defending the American taxpayer. And the American taxpayer has no better individual standing to defend them than the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. Westmoreland has worked with and chairs the Floor Action Team for us in the minority and does a wonderful job in that capacity. He is an active member and a part of the leadership of the Republican Study Committee. And I yield to him for his comments on the legislation.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Smoke and mirrors, it is indeed, where they come in and they're going to make it very difficult to build the fence. 
   You know, they have $2.7 billion for border security funds in the homeland security accounts, and then they have another $225 million for GSA related to the border fence. Then they turn around and there is $10.5 million for defender services for illegal immigrants. And we know that what they've done is to go in and make it very, very difficult. 
   The bill releases $650 million of this funding for the border fence only after, and that is where they're setting up roadblock, only after the Appropriations Committee is satisfied with the Department of Homeland Security's expenditure plan and that 15 conditions listed in the bill are met. 
   Now, as the gentleman knows, every time we do a town hall meeting people are so concerned about the loss of this Nation's sovereignty, about the loss of security in our communities. Because the illegal immigration issue is not addressed, every State's a border State, and every town is a border town, and now we see that they're playing tricks. They're going to say, well, we're going to go under emergency money and we're going to put it in here that it could be released if we decided it was an emergency, and oh, by the way, we're going to release part of it only after the Appropriations Committee is satisfied. 
   Well, what's satisfied one person's requirements may not satisfy another because it is subjective, and that will be released at that time. And then you have got 15 conditions. Well, you can make it impossible to ever satisfy a list of conditions, Mr. Speaker, if your goal is to block something. If your plan is to fail, you can develop a plan to fail, and that is what we see in this 3,565 pages of a budget document is how to fail. 
   And I yield back to the gentleman.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia, and you know, I think it is so important that, once again, I remind individuals at house.gov/hensarling/rsc you can get a little bit of a summary of the bill. 
   Of course, you know, it's one of these things where, Mr. Speaker, we have had it for only a very short period of time because it was less than 24 hours ago that it was even put up on-line for Members to be certain that they had the chance to look at it. I was one of those Members up. I was at home working away, trying to get things finished to get some of my Christmas cooking done and my Christmas ironing done and ready for the holiday season with my family. And I will tell you, it is of such concern to me that we see the manner in which this has been constructed and pulled together. 
   I do hope that the American people will sit down and look through some of this and see where this money is going. My goodness, when you see $11 billion for emergency designated spending and then you see that the budget's criteria for emergency spending is sudden, unforeseen, temporary, urgent, et cetera, and that is where you see some of the gimmickry begin to come in. 
   Of course, these are things that we all agree with. There's money for drought relief, which that's been very difficult, but $20 million for farm service agency salaries and expenses, that should have been something that was anticipated. 
   Eight million dollars for Department of Justice administrative review and  appeals; $10 million for legal activities, salaries and expense; $7 million for U.S. attorneys, salaries and expenses; $15 million for U.S. marshals, services, salaries and expenses; $143.5 million for FBI salaries and expenses; $2 million for Drug Enforcement Agency, salaries and expenses; $14.5 million for Court of Appeals, salaries and expenses. Mr. Speaker, salaries and expenses should be something that was anticipated. I'm not certain that meets the criteria of emergency. Emergency should be something that is unforeseen, that we didn't know was going to happen. Now, if we have people on our payroll and we do expect them to get a paycheck, then that salary and the related expenses and benefits are something that we should be planning for. 
   Then there's the $10.5 million that the gentleman from Georgia and I have discussed where you set aside the money for illegal immigrants to be able to have attorneys to defend them. And then there's the ruse of the border fence with the money that's being appropriated but then you can't get to it. 
   There's $300 million for wildfire suppression and $195 million for the Minnesota bridge accident, which occurred many months ago.     
   And here is $100 million for Presidential security at political conventions. 
   Mr. Speaker, it may be a news flash. This may be totally new to many people, but we have a political convention every 4 years. This is something we should be planning for. It should not be an emergency expense that we are going to have to have Presidential security at the political conventions. Cities go to great lengths to bid to get these conventions, to be able to hold them. We know that every 4 years we are going to have a Presidential election. This is something that is anticipated. It is not an emergency that is unexpected.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Reclaiming my time, that is what we have found. That is all a part of the emergency spending component. That's why I think it's so interesting when you go through and read the summary on this bill because you find that in order to carry out the ability to spend a little more on programs where they want to spend more, what they have done is to shift the cost. And so if you can put it under emergency spending and then not have to submit it to the PAYGO rules, then it allows you to be able to spend a little bit more.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Yes. Reclaiming my time, the next segment that I have here is after the emergency spending, which I was reading through, then we get into the budget gimmicks, and you see how they have pulled in $10.2 billion in gimmicks that are being used to artificially lower the cost of the bill. And it goes through this with some transportation funds; the crime victims fund; advanced appropriations, which sounds just a little bit sneaky there. It increases some funding for the BRAC account, and there's a way that's kind of shifted and moved around. 
   And then following that we get into each of the individual Departments, each of the appropriations bills, with the Agriculture bill, Commerce-Justice-Science, Energy and Water. We go through each of these and list where some of the provisions are and some of the increases. There is an increase in here for salaries and expenses at the Food and Drug Administration from $1.57 billion to $172 billion. An increase for conservation programs. The Legal Services Corporation, the LSC, it gives $350 million for them, $1 million over the fiscal year 2007. 
   Now, the Legal Services Corporation is free legal aid. They represent individuals that sue the government. So we are going to increase their funding, but we are not going to fund our troops, and we are not going to get that fence built and secure that border. So in here is increased funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs from $1.47 billion to $1.72 billion.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. And there again you see that we are increasing that. We are increasing the Department of the Interior programs, but we are not funding our troops. We see increased funding for the IRS. They are going from $10.60 billion to $10.89 billion, and it is an increase of $295.3 million or 2.8 percent over their fiscal year 2007 numbers. So we are going to increase money for the IRS, but we are not going to get that money to our troops.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. And that is what we will hear from our constituents. 
   And the list goes on and on, as you can see. I have got plenty of pages that we could flip through. We even have title X and family planning money that is increased by $300 million. And I find it so very interesting that they go in and they increase the title X and the Family Planning money, but guess what? What they didn't do was to increase the money for the abstinence education program. Now, how about that, Mr. Speaker? That funding was held level. It was held level. And Family Planning and Planned Parenthood will get big increases, but abstinence education will not. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, as I have said several times tonight, budgets are about priorities. Budget documents tell you where you want your emphasis to be. And what we see from this majority is a budget process that is broken, with priorities that are broken, and promises that are broken. And we have a 3,565-page bill that weighs 34.4 pounds when you print it out. It contains over 9,200 earmarks. There are lots of pet projects, lots of pork in this big Santa sack. What is missing is funding for the troops on the ground in Iraq. 
   I find it very sad, very sad indeed, that it is the men and women who defend this great Nation who are left out in the cold this Christmastime. They are the ones that should be at the very  top of the list, Mr. Speaker. We should think of them first. We should honor them in the way that we do our jobs. We are a Nation at war. We know that. That is something I think most people in this body agree with. And we pass a budget that does not include them and does not include the funding to meet their needs. 
   Mr. Speaker, you and I would not be able to stand in this Chamber and have this debate if it were not for the men and women of the U.S. military. We should honor them. They should have been Title I, Page 1. And instead they are nowhere to be found in 3,565 pages. That is a serious oversight. 
   And, once again, we can talk about all the other things. We can talk about the illegal immigrants being able to get funding for attorneys. We can talk about roadblocks to having the borders secured, things that are purposely placed there; but the most egregious oversight is the fact that it does not fund our troops. 
   As I close, I will say God bless those troops. God bless their families. And, Mr. Speaker, my prayer is that this House will reverse itself and will put them first in this budget document.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon we will hear from General David Petraeus on the Iraq progress report. He is going to tell us what worked, what hasn't, and what needs to be done. And Congress should listen to the general and to Ambassador Crocker. 
   My position is that we should have been listening all along to our commanders and leaders on the ground, and the testimony from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker should be heard without prejudice. They are men of impeccable credentials, and it is troubling that the antiwar liberals are already moving en masse to discredit and dismiss the testimony without even hearing a single word of what they have had to say. 
   The debate over the surge should be over. While much remains to be done in Iraq, there is evidence that the surge is working and stabilizing that country and improving the security situation. 
   Finally, the consequences of failure in Iraq are monumental. A failure in Iraq will embolden al Qaeda. They will use the nation as a launching pad for attacks. Iran will move in and fill that void. It is a monumental day in the war on terror. We should approach it with an open mind.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. 
   It has been so interesting to listen to the debate this evening. I am reminded of my school teacher grandmother and an admonition that she would regularly give us to us, which was ``Your actions speak louder than your words.'' And she would remind us of this time and time and time again. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I can tell you, quite frankly, I think that what we are seeing is the actions of a majority who are doing their best to ensure, to ensure, that our men and women in uniform do not have the funding that they need. 
   I represent a lot of these military men and women, and I have heard from them. I am hearing from a lot of the military men and women and their families, and they feel like the modified withdrawal dates in this legislative disaster are nothing more than a vote of no confidence for our troops. They feel that this legislation will embolden our enemies and send a message to the rest of the world that they believe that they are more qualified to prosecute a war than the men and women we are sending to the frontlines. That is something, Mr. Speaker, that they do disagree with. 
   Our military leadership deserves the opportunity to fight this war with the funding and the support that they need to accomplish their goals. They deserve the ability and the opportunity to win. Yet the leadership in this House continues to try their best to micromanage the war and our troops without the funding that they need. 
   Despite what the majority leader in the other body and his supporters in the House believe, this war is not lost. Yet this dead-on-arrival supplemental bill will only exacerbate the problem and put our troops in harm's way. 
   I think that we should show our respect for the men and women in uniform by respecting the job they do. We should do our job: Send the funding to the troops.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina and my colleague from Tennessee for his work on the resolution, and I thank Mr. Andrews for his kind remarks. And, yes, we think the Scarlet Knights as we honored them last week did a wonderful job. 
   But I will have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, we were so thrilled with our Tennessee Lady Vols, and we did like that score of 59-46. We thought that was very good. We liked the fact that our Lady Vols captured their seventh title in 20 years, and it was the first NCAA championship since they won three straight titles, as my colleague from Knoxville mentioned, there in 1996, 1997, 1998. 
   He mentioned also their coach, Pat Head Summitt, and mentioned that she is the NCAA's all-time winningest coach, male or female. She is given to leadership and she is given to mentoring and role modeling. That is why she has totaled up 947 victories, and she is still counting because she is still out there. 
   And we accept that challenge from those at Rutgers. We know they are coming back next year, but so are we, and we know that Coach Summitt is going to be out there. And, again, we expect that they will dominate not only the SEC but the NCAA. 
   And, as always, the Lady Vols accomplished their goal with the dignity befitting one of college basketball's most celebrated programs. Yet their on-the-court exploits pale in comparison to the fact that the Lady Vols continue to set a standard for Division I college sports in the classroom. Coach Summitt and her staff demand the best, and that attitude is reflected in the championship team's 3.0 grade point average, and the program's remarkable graduate rate that has spurred every student who has completed her eligibility at the university to either graduate or continue working toward requirements for graduation. Basketball excellence deserves our applause, but a commitment to academic excellence and the pursuit of a young student athlete's college degree and their leadership and professional development deserves our celebration. 
   I do congratulate the Lady Vols, Coach Summitt, and the entire University of Tennessee family for their tremendous achievements.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, the liberal leadership of this Congress has put themselves and the lives of our military members, our soldiers in the field, in a very difficult position. When they passed the supplemental spending bill earlier this month for the global war on terror, they only did it by loading it up with pork. It sounds like a grocery list. They have got money for spinach, for beef, for fish and for peanuts. Billions of dollars of pork. They made their Members an offer that they couldn't refuse. 
   They claim to support our military, but in this bill they tie the hands of that same military by instituting a timetable for withdrawal and taking the power for running the war away from the commanders in the field. The majority leader, HARRY REID, didn't help when he said he thinks the war is lost. 
   American citizens need to ask themselves the question: What would happen, what would happen, if we were to walk away? It is the same question our Speaker, who obviously isn't going to meet with our commanding general, also needs to ask. 
   Let's respect the soldiers in the field by doing our job and passing a clean budget.

   The American people have entrusted us with a great responsibility to represent their interest in this great House. The people of the Seventh District of Tennessee work hard and represent what is good about America, and it is my honor to speak on their behalf. 
   In my district there are farmers, bankers, truckers, accountants. My district is as diverse as America itself. One thing they believe in is the goodness and strength and perseverance of our country. They entrust us to do the right thing, no matter the circumstances. 
   They want lower taxes and believe that they, not the Federal Government, should have first right of refusal on their paycheck. They believe that if 10 percent is good enough for God, it should be good enough for the government when it comes to taxing that paycheck. And they think that government should learn to live within its means. 
   Most importantly, they want action, not political grandstanding. They want results, not rhetoric. They want and expect us to solve problems. They expect us to stand in the gap, stand up for them, and do our jobs. 
   They expect us to lead.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding, and I am so pleased to be joined by three gentlemen from Texas, if you will, two judges and a physician. And we are all part of the Republican Study Committee and are certainly committed to carrying forth the conservative values that we appreciate here in this House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have enjoyed hearing the conversation and listening to the conversation and discussion between my two colleagues as they have talked about this law that is a fairness issue, and I think so many people do look at it and say, my goodness, $350 million for those that are in prison, and as the gentleman said, rewarding illegal behavior. 
   And that is something that people are very sensitive to right now, especially in light of the impact that illegal immigration has made on so many of our communities, the cost to those communities and the concern with our citizens that there are some here in this body that would like to consider amnesty and reward those that have broken the rule of law. 
   I also enjoyed the conversation about health care and that being provided to those that have been imprisoned. I've been visiting with my Realtors from Tennessee, yesterday and today. They've been on the Hill. The number one issue for them is small business health plans and access to affordable health care. And these are people that really do such a great job in working to improve the quality of life and work with our communities. And they are struggling with providing health care for their employees. They are struggling with providing health care for their families and insurance. 
   And then when you hear about those that are imprisoned, as they leave having grants for health care provisions, you know, there's just something not right about that. There is something that is a little bit inappropriate about them having access to that when hardworking, middle-class families are struggling with that issue. 
   We have got so many things to talk about. We have had such an interesting day here. We have had some procedural moves, as Mr. Gohmert mentioned. There is a rule that the majority was trying to change. It dealt with germaneness. This is a rule that has been on the books since 1822, part of our House rules, part of the decorum and conduct of the House. And for expedience, for convenience, this is something that they were choosing to try to change, very unfortunate, and the kind of change the American people certainly did not vote for. They want to see the rules of the House and of this great institution respected, and it's been unfortunate. 
   I have been greatly disappointed, and as my constituents, I've heard from three or four of them during the day that have said what's going on. And it's been with great disappointment that I've explained to them that for power, the sake of power, we saw the majority trying to eliminate a rule that has been a part of the order of this House since 1822. And we hope that they will push that aside and decide that they are going to abide by the rules of the House as they have been laid forth and have worked well for centuries, if you will. 
   I think also we could touch today on the fact that today marks 100 days since President Bush sent the request over for supplemental spending for our troops. It has been 100 days of inaction or putting forward bills that they knew were going to be vetoed, of political grandstanding, and I find that to be unfortunate. And it is with regret that we have to admit that that is a tactic and a mode of operation that the majority has decided to take. 
   They have had time to pass D.C. having the right to vote. They've had time to pass bills that would recognize schools. They've had time to name post offices. They've passed bills on global warming. They've passed legislation to  protect wild horses, but there hasn't been time to craft a bill to get money to our troops in the field. 
   It is a matter of priorities, Mr. Speaker, and how unfortunate that the frivolous nature of some of the legislation that has come before us, that has consumed the time of this body, would be placed as a priority above the legislation to get funding to our troops in the field. And our soldiers are running out of cash. This effort is running out of cash, and we are in a global war on terror, and it is imperative that we get that money where it needs to be to those troops. 
   But that has not been the priority of the majority. They chose to bring forward a supplemental bill that they knew was going to be vetoed because it had an additional $24 billion worth of pork barrel spending. So then they decided to rework it and break it into two supplementals so that the California salmon could get their money and you could get Ag money and you could get Katrina relief money. You could get all this spending and not put it through regular order, but let's get that money to that California salmon out there. We've already had 
   Tuna-gate; so now let's go throw some more money in here for this. 
   And how very unfortunate to that put into a wartime supplemental. This is a wartime supplemental. Our primary responsibility is keeping our Nation safe, keeping it secure, making certain that when you get in that car to get those children to the bus stop, to go to school, when they go to that school, you know that they are safe, that you're not going to have a group of terrorists like the Ft. Dix six come show up at the shopping mall or at the college baseball game and try to destroy our citizens. People want that type security, and it is unfortunate that that has not been a priority. 
   I tell you, I look at what is happening before us and some of the things that have been passed by this body, naming the post offices and recognizing schools and horse legislation and some of those things, and you'd think maybe the Democrats have an insecurity agenda. Maybe that is their agenda for this session, this 110th Congress. 
   And then as we look at the supplemental, which was supposed to be passed and out of the way before we started on DOD appropriations for next year, and that is what has been before us today, we also are in the midst of looking at the budget which contains a $392.5 billion tax increase over 5-years, the single largest tax increase in American history, $392.5 billion. You would see your marginal rates increase. You would see the cap gains rate increase. Child tax credit would be cut in half. Tennessee and Texas are two States that enjoy sales tax deductibility because we're wonderful States without a State income tax. That would go away. $392.5 billion tax increase over 5 years, single largest tax increase in history. It would cost $2,611 per taxpayer in my State of Tennessee. That is the amount of increase that we are looking at. 
   And quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, my constituents know that government is overspent and taxpayers are overtaxed and they are tired of it. They also know that government does not have a revenue problem. It is a spending problem that government has, and my constituents also believe that if 10 percent is good enough for God on Sunday, then it ought to be good enough for the government. And they believe that we should learn to live within our means. 
   They are tired of working hard, getting their paycheck, looking at that pay stub and realizing that the Federal Government has first right of refusal to their paycheck because before that worker ever gets that paycheck deposited in his account, the Federal Government has put his hand into that wallet and has extracted every dollar they want out of that paycheck. Social Security comes out, your Medicare comes out, all your taxes come out. There you go. There you go, Mr. Speaker. The Federal Government has first right of refusal on your paycheck, and that is something that it is time that we should be changing. 
   We have so many things that are budget issues, and I want to circle back around to the health care issue that comes back to us every time we look at the budget, every time we look at DOD, Department of Defense, health care comes to the forefront. And we're so fortunate at our Energy and Commerce Committee that we have some physicians who serve on that committee with us, who are articulate and well-versed in health care and what it is, what we need to do in order to be certain that this Nation stays healthy, individuals stay healthy but that our health care delivery systems stay healthy. 
   I would like to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) for some comments on the health care issue.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas. I appreciate this so much. How interesting that something that would yield a $3.8 billion savings has been overlooked and left on the table. But I think that what we see from this, and what the takeaway for us is, that we have an innovative idea, and as the physician from Texas said, our States are great labs for finding things that work. They do such a great job looking at needed reforms, whether they are educational reforms or health care reforms, and finding things that work. 
   You take a program like the liability reforms in Texas that have reduced insurance rates by over 22 percent, and then you run that out on a national basis and you say, okay, over 5 years, we can save $3.8 billion, not to include it, when you know it's a concept that works, not to bring it forward for discussion from the House, so that you can elevate the awareness of this. 
   Look for a pilot project for this if you need be, if you need further evidence and some qualified data to work from. But to be able to say, all right, we are just not going to do this because we like the status quo, we like the way the status quo is, and we are not interested in something that will be new, different, or maybe save some money. 
   We would rather be spending money and spending they are, to the tune of the single largest tax increase in history that the liberal majority and the liberal 
   leadership in this House is bringing forward in their budget, $392.5 billion over a period of 5 years. 
   It has been a pleasure to stand with my colleagues tonight and to talk a little bit about our budget, to talk about some of the gamesmanship, if you will, that has taken place as the majority has tried to change a rule that has been on the books since 1822, lack of respect for the traditions of the institution. 
   We also would recognize with sorrow the fact that this is the 100th day since President Bush said, our men and women in uniform need additional funds. It is an imperative that we get the funds to them, and still no bill in sight. We have a Memorial Day break coming up upon us. I think it's unfortunate.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. It has been so interesting to me, and the gentleman mentioned Fort Hood and Killeen, Texas and his constituents there. Fort Campbell is in my district in Montgomery County, Tennessee, and to see these men and women, and to hear their stories and to see their need, as I have worked with that post since coming to Congress and working to meet their needs, one of the lessons to me has been, and I think this should be one of the lessons learned for all of us who are Members in Congress, when you cut funding to programs like the military, then there is a price to pay for that. And we are constitutionally charged and directed to provide for the common defense and the security of this Nation. 
   One of the things that happened during the Clinton Presidency, in order to generate a surplus, was cutting the military funding and cutting the intelligence funding. And we have heard, 4 years. This is not anecdotal, it is something that is fact and something that was bragged about, actually, a little bit in the late 1990s, was not putting that money into R&D, not researching the next generation of tanks or choppers or fighters or artillery or armor, because the Cold War was over and there wasn't a big threat. So let's cut that funding, and then let's put that money into something else. 
   And the same thing happened with intelligence, as the gentleman was saying. There was money that was cut back from that and put into social programs and domestic programs and not put into keeping that intelligence network strong and viable. And it takes about 5 years for one of our intelligence agents to develop an asset that is a reliable asset for information to protect our country. And I hope this is a lesson learned. 
   When we look at what happened to our country on September 11th, that is the date our Nation stopped responding to acts of terrorism as civil disobedience and started responding to acts of terrorism as an act of war, September 11th. We had been attacked for 2 decades prior to that, but that day was the day it changed. And as we looked at that and realized that on September 11, 2001, we were not under a George Bush budget, we were still under a Bill Clinton budget, and the Bush budget was kicking in about the 1st of October. 
   We have to realize that what you had were many years where our military had been telling us, we are pulling down on all of our resources, our reserve resources, we are pulling these down; and we need to be replenishing, we need to be careful where we are. I think that is a lesson, and I hope it is a lesson that we realize, that when you put something in place, you have to maintain it. When you build for the common defense, you need to maintain that in order to be able to stay strong. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, what I'm hearing from my constituents is they are still very concerned about our national security, about border security, about the security on their streets and in their communities. That's why I would like to raise one issue with the House this morning. 
   For the second time in the last several months, a mobile foreign consulate has traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, on the western edge of my district, to issue government IDs and passports, the latest courtesy of the Guatemalan Government.  
   Now, many illegal immigrants in this country are using these matricula consular cards to access American financial markets. And some American financial institutions are offering illegal immigrants credit cards and access to our financial services and financial markets based on the issuance of these cards. Only reason you need one, you're in the country illegally. 
   I've even had an industry representative tell me that they think they should be able to ``bank illegal immigrants.'' 
   Madam Speaker, that's why I've introduced H.R. 1314, the Photo ID Security Act, to close this loophole that allows illegal immigrants access to these services.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to be able to stand here and talk for a few moments about the SCHIP proposals, or I should say the health care proposal, the expansion of health care that has been brought under the name of SCHIP. It is, indeed, unfortunate that a fine program that is there to help underprivileged children has been hijacked, if you will. And on its back, on the backs of our Nation's children, on the backs of the children of the working poor has been placed this expansion of health care. It truly shows a level of disrespect toward the children of this country. 
   I appreciate the leadership that the gentleman from Arizona shows, not only on this issue, but the leadership he brings to our Republican Study Committee. And those of us who are speaking on the issue tonight are members of the Republican Study Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, on the topic of this SCHIP, you know, one of the things that the American people said was, we want to change the way things are being done in Washington. We want smaller government, we want government to spend less money. So, we saw some changes take place last November. And the new majority went into control in January and they've authorized nearly $1 trillion in new spending since the time that they took over. And, of course, we are hearing that there are tax increases. One of the chairmen of Ways and Means calls it the ``mother of all tax increases.'' I take a little bit of offense to that, being female. And also, when you talk about the mother of something, you worry about what the offspring are going to look like, Mr. Speaker. And so we are worried about what that tax bill will look like. 
   But on SCHIP, as I said, unfortunately for America's children, the liberal leadership of this House decided that they were going to put on their back the burden of carrying this enormous expansion of health care and changing a block grant program into an entitlement. That's not the kind of change the American people voted for. Just like the American people didn't vote to have the single largest tax increase in history take place. 
   Now, one of the interesting things about all of this is the SCHIP proposals that have come out include allowing illegal immigrants to get health care. And I know we hear from the majority, oh, that's not going to happen. We have eligibility requirements. But, Mr. Speaker, I would direct my colleagues to either section 211 or section 605 of the bill where it plainly states, and you can read it for yourself, anyone watching could read that for themselves. They can look up H.R. 3963 or H.R. 976 and see what is contained in that bill.     
   We know that this would result in $3.7 billion in new spending over a 10-year period of time if the new liberal majority had its way. You can go into the allocation section, section 102 of the bill, and you can look at what is going to take place when you get mid-year 2012. Do you know what happens, Mr. Speaker? All of a sudden, no money. So what are you going to do, throw 80 percent of the people off the  bill? We all know that is not going to happen. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, my question is why would anybody support a bill, support a program, that they are setting up to fail. Why would they have that level of disrespect for this program, that they would pass legislation that would plan for it to fail. Then, as my colleague has said, we have the problems with spending more, insuring less children, and not making available to the children truly that are eligible for the program the opportunity to have that access to affordable health care. 
   We could go on and on with the problems with this bill. I just find it so unfortunate that in this day and in this age that we would have the new majority and the new leadership take a block grant program that is working well, that the States like and change it to an entitlement program that is put on auto pilot when we know some of the greatest pressures we have on our budgeting process are on our entitlement spending. 
   I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding. I appreciate his leadership on the health care issues. I appreciate his concern for how our constituents continue to access health care in this country.

What you see is a play on words and how unfortunate that we have this disingenuous approach to this issue, have a play on words with the eligibility requirements and allowing, putting something in words and then allowing a loophole. As I said, the two sections, sections 211 and 605, with that we can look at the income disregards. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, how many people have ever said let's have the income disregards when they are trying to decide who goes on to a program? Well, I had one of my constituents in my district come up, and they said, Tell me what is an income disregard? I said, Do you know what, an income disregard is when you do not consider the income. And they said, How can that be for the sake of considering SCHIP which is to be for children of the working poor? And I said, Because you don't want the income to matter. And if you don't want the income to matter and you want to make it available to what the IRS calls ``high-income earners,'' you establish that doubletalk with income disregards.

That is what our constituents are asking. They are concerned about security from the national and the local level. I think many of them are frustrated that those of us in Congress haven't done anything to address the criminal illegal alien situation. 
   I want to let the body know last week the Board of Supervisors in Prince William County, Virginia, took a stand by unanimously approving a tough local crackdown on illegal immigrants. They are doing it to make their community a safer place. It denies some county services to illegal immigrants and adds to enforcement powers already available to cops on the beat. 
   We can do the same thing at the Federal level with the bipartisan CLEAR Act, which I introduced last month. It would get dangerous criminal aliens off the streets and require the Department of Homeland Security to pick them up within 48 hours. 
   It is H.R. 3494, the CLEAR Act. I would encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and do what the Prince William supervisors have done: put citizen safety first.

I think that they are content to have their constituents either ride a bike or walk to get where they want to go. In my Seventh District of Tennessee, that does not work. 
   What they might not know is that what we see happening at the pump is happening in every single energy sector. Tennesseeans and Americans are paying more than ever for their gasoline, their groceries, and naturally to heat and cool their homes. It's bad enough during the summer driving months, but what my friends across the aisle might not know is that utility officials in Memphis have projected a 30-percent spike in the cost of natural gas for this fall. That is on top of a 13 1/2 percent increase last fall. 
   This Congress must take action and the United States must diversify its energy portfolio and incentivize all types of energy production: Oil, natural gas, geothermal, hydroelectric, nuclear. It's all there.

   But what the leadership did was to make an offer that couldn't be refused to a lot of Members. They claim to support the military, but in the bill what they are doing is tying the hands of the military by inserting a timetable for withdrawal and taking the power away from the commanders in the field. Majority Senate leader Harry Reid didn't help when he considered that the war was lost. That is the message that he is sending to our troops and to the terrorists alike, that everybody ought to give up.

   In order to win, Mr. Speaker, we must not only succeed on the battlefield; we must win in the battle of ideas. We must win the civic and economic battles with the Iraqi people. They are as critical as any firefight that they face every day. 
   The idea of freedom and prosperity is a powerful idea. Our coalition is breathing life into that idea with the Iraqi people. We need to stand firm, fund our troops, support our men and women in harm's way.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (MEMPHIS MUSIC -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Memphis Music. This summer, my district will play host to a tradition that has evolved with the city for more than 70 years, Carnival Memphis. Every year, Carnival Memphis lifts up the best of our city and asks it to help those Memphians who are most in need. Leaders of an honored industry roll up their sleeves to help special Memphis charities, charities that are often otherwise ignored. This year, the honored industry, Memphis Music, is at the very foundations of our beloved city. 
   Mr. Speaker, so much of the music that is identified as iconic American music came from Memphis. It rose up from the heat of the Mississippi Delta and drifted into the city where it was stamped on vinyl in studios like Stax and Sun. From there, the sounds of Elvis, Mavis Staples, Al Green, Booker T. and the MGs, and Isaac Hayes became part of the fabric of American culture. 
   This summer, Memphis Music and Carnival Memphis will turn their hands and their hearts to the Emanuel Episcopal Center Neighborhood School, and United Cerebral Palsy of the Mid South. They will be joined by the King and Queen of Carnival, the Royal Court and all of the mystic societies. The economic, cultural, and spiritual engine that is the entertainment of industry in Memphis will turn their efforts to lift the spirits and circumstances of those in need in Memphis. 
   I am proud to represent a city that has left such an indelible mark on American culture. I congratulate Carnival Memphis on their 77th year and all their hard work to enrich Memphis. And I encourage all of my colleagues, the next time they hear Sitting on the Dock of the Bay, Green Onions, or Heartbreak Hotel, to join me and do what I do, and think of Memphis.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, today is a serious day on Capitol Hill. General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have returned. They are reporting to the Nation on the progress in Iraq. 
   Since they were last here, this is what the Iraqi Parliament has passed: A pension law for regime officials; de-Baathification reform; an amnesty law; a provincial election law. The national government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces; sectarian killings are down 90 percent; civilian deaths have dropped by more than 70 percent; and coalition casualties have dropped by more than 70 percent. Most importantly, Iraqi security forces are fighting for the future of their very own country. 
   Some in this House are so invested in the narrative of defeat that they are blind to the results of a campaign that ranks among the greatest in the history of our Armed Forces. 
   Our troops have achieved tremendous success through valor and sacrifice. Let's not sell them out and choose to lose a winnable war. History would not forgive us for that.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, and Mr. Speaker, he just touched on something I think is so very important. 
   Every once in a while, we need a wake-up call, and I think that is indeed true. And today has been a very serious day. This week is a very serious week here on Capitol Hill. And as I entered the Capitol again this evening to participate in our Special Order hour, I was struck by this stillness of the surroundings, the serene feelings of the Capitol as you walk in and as you look at the paintings and at the statues, making my way over to the chamber, reminded of those who have loved this Nation and loved the freedoms that we all enjoy and that allow us to stand in this chamber and participate in debate and to bring forward ideas and talk about what is a good idea and what is a bad idea. 
   And indeed, as the gentleman from Georgia said, every once in a while we need a wake-up call and a reminder that freedom is an idea that definitely has served this Nation well. It, Mr. Speaker, is an idea that serves all of the nations of the world very well. It is something that people all over the globe seek to have. 
   We have had discussion on this floor tonight about Tibet and the desire there to live in freedom, to worship freely. Many of us have watched the Iraqi people move forward with elections freely and willingly. Some of us travel to other nations to participate as we watch people seek to go in large numbers to the ballot box in their nation to freely vote. 
   I was struck a little bit earlier today, and I think it was more or less a wake-up call for me, Mr. Speaker. I stood in the shadow of the Capitol on the Senate side with a group called Vets for Freedom. I have had the opportunity to spend some time with them as they have told their stories about the success, the success stories, if you will, of what is happening on the ground in Iraq. And today they were joined by Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman, and other Members of the Senate, several of us from the House, including one of our most distinguished Members and a former prisoner of war, Sam Johnson, the honorable gentlemen from the great State of Texas. 
   And it was amazing to stand there and look into the faces of these veterans who have been willing to put it all on the line for freedom, to put it all on the line to protect this great Nation. And then to give actions to, again, to the actions they've carried out, to the words and the stories they're telling, and again, to take an action of coming here and coming to the Capitol and meeting with the Members of this body and to stand and support General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker as they reported to our Nation, to say we've been there, we've carried out the heavy lift, and indeed, freedom is worth the fight. 
   They've also made it very clear that America now has the opportunity to achieve our fundamental objectives in Iraq through the establishment of a peaceful, stable, secular, democratic State which will be a reliable ally in the struggle against both Sunni and Shiite terrorism. Establishing this ally would allow America to reorient our position in the Middle East away from a position that relies on anti-democratic States to a position based on a strong democratic partner whose citizens have explicitly rejected al Qaeda and terrorism in general and have chosen freedom. 
   Today, General Petraeus reported to the Senate on his progress. Tomorrow, the House will hear from the general. 
   What we've learned so far is that levels of violence and civilian deaths have been reduced substantially. Al Qaeda Iraq, and other extremist elements, have been dealt serious and damaging blows. The capabilities of the Iraqi security forces have grown. Indeed, the involvement of local Iraqis and local security has been noteworthy. The forces are growing, and indeed, the Iraqis have carried out their own surge, Mr. Speaker. 
   Americans are well aware the additional U.S. forces that deployed to Iraq as part of the surge and our great Nation's part there. What is less understood well is that Iraqi forces surged, adding over 100,000 additional soldiers and police to their very own security forces in 2007. 
   There has been a shift in attitude among certain elements of the Iraqi population. The Sunni communities 
   in Iraq increasingly have rejected al Qaeda's indiscriminate violence and extremist ideology. They recognize that they cannot share in the new Iraq if they don't participate in the political arena. That, Mr. Speaker, is a major step forward. 
   Over time, these awakenings have prompted tens of thousands of Iraqis, some former insurgents, to contribute to local security as sons of Iraq. There are 91,000 sons of Iraq Shia, as well as Sunni, under contract to help coalition and Iraqi forces protect their own neighborhoods. Again, they are taking the lead. 
   Al Qaeda's leadership, who still see Iraq as the central front in a global strategy, send funding, instructions, and foreign fighters to Iraq. Iraq's ethno-sectarian conflict in many areas is taking place through debate rather than through violence. That is another turn that we have seen. Security incidents are at a level not seen since early 2005, and civilian deaths have decreased to a level not seen before the mosque bombings in 2006. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are all items that are being reported to us of successes, military successes, that are taking place; and indeed, the gentleman from Georgia has mentioned some of these, has touched on some of the trends that we are seeing; and I know he's going to spend a little bit of time this evening going back and looking at these steps that tell the story of what is happening on the ground.  
   And as we see this take place, we see a population that is, indeed, beginning to feel safe to leave their homes. And once you're safe to leave your home, then you can start to work to make certain that your neighborhood is safe and then you make certain that your province is safe. All of this leads to a safer and free Iraq. 
   We know that the Iraqi parliament is making some progress, and as the gentleman from Georgia detailed some of the stats tonight, these are going to be items that will be included as we look.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And he's exactly right. Security on the ground, a secure and stable environment. And that is what the counterinsurgency strategy has been about, and the results that it has yielded. 
   As we have just discussed, indeed, and as Americans know well, we had a surge from our troops. The Iraqis also carried out their surge, and what it has yielded is an environment where not only we saw the military progress, but also where political progress can take place. And there are some wonderful lessons learned here. 
   I think that one of those, when we are in Iraq visiting with our troops and working with some of the Iraqis and helping to mentor some of the women that we have mentored over there, one of the things they will tell you is, we are so glad that you have not left us. Thank you for not leaving us. We know people are frustrated. We know there are no guarantees. But we also know that it is important that we keep at it. It's not going to happen overnight. And thank you, thank you for not leaving. We fear what would happen if you left. 
   And they are, as the gentleman from Georgia was saying, Mr. Speaker, they are seeing progress. The Iraq parliament is seeing progress. And as the gentleman just listed some things, and let me touch on them again, a pension law for regime officials, that has happened. De-Ba'athification reform, that has been carried out. An amnesty law, provincial election laws. And as he said, the sharing, the national government now sharing oil revenues with the provinces, something that a year ago many people said, it will never happen. But, here we are, and yes, indeed, it all is beginning to take place. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from Georgia.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And he has shown us some great charts, civilian deaths, the coalition data, the high profile attacks with the suicide car bombings, the car bombs, the suicide attacks, the weapons caches that are found and cleared. And when you look at the fact that we are finding many more weapons caches than we were and when you look at the fact that the attacks are down and the deaths are down, you have to ask, how did this happen? And the way it has happened is our men and women in uniform, and God bless them all, and I think about my constituents from Fort Campbell who are deployed right now, who are in both Iraq and Afghanistan, but the men and women in uniform who are taking the lead and who are gaining the trust of the Iraqi people and of the Iraqi forces and of the Sons of Iraq. And it is our men and women in uniform, as they gain this trust, and as the Iraqis know we're not going to quit, they are telling them, this is what I know, this is where you go to root out this evil person, this is where  you go to root out this weapons cache, this is where you go to get this information. Because they know that we are their partner in success and we are their partner in freedom. 
   And it really begs the question, and as I visited with some of the veterans that have come to spend some time with us today, this really begs the question, when you look at the data and when you have this discussion, can we afford to give up on a war where we are winning, that our military men and women tell us that they are seeing some successes every single day? Can you afford to give up? And how would history remember it if you did give up?

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (ANNUAL BUDGET DEBATE -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank you so much. I am really appreciative that you have mentioned sales tax deductibility. As the gentleman from Texas knows, that is something that I worked feverishly and diligently to have passed when I came to this body in 2003, restoring that deductibility of sales tax to our Federal income tax filing for  those of us who live in non-State income tax States. 
   Now whether you are from Washington State or from Nevada or from Texas or from Florida or Tennessee, my home State, you have been able to enjoy a sizable deduction. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, are willing to do away with that as they go about passing the largest tax increase in American history, the single largest tax increase in American history. They are going to do it all in one bill and all with one fell swoop. 
   You know, as I have listened to the debate on both sides of the aisle gathering around this budget, it has reminded me of something that we have talked about on this floor before, Mr. Speaker, and it is that the budget should reflect the priorities of the people of this great Nation, not the priorities of government. 
   Mr. Speaker, what we have right before us is a classic liberal elite bureaucratic document. It is all about growing the bureaucracy. It is about power to Washington, D.C., and not power to the people in our districts. It is clear as day. I am really kind of glad that the Democrats have brought this budget forward. It defines so clearly the priorities of our parties.     
   Are you for the bureaucracy or are you for the people? Are you for tax relief or are you for tax increases? Are you for middle class, hardworking Americans or are you for the liberal elites? Are you for those liberal elites that want to tell you they are smarter than you and they ought to be telling you exactly how to spend your money or are you for the taxpayers that are right now sitting at home at their kitchen table trying to figure out how much they owe the IRS and they are looking at the end of the month coming up and they have more month left over than they have money left in that checking account and it is because they know the government never gets enough of the taxpayers' money? 
   Mr. Speaker, my constituents know this Federal Government does not have a revenue problem. This Federal Government has a spending problem, and our colleagues across the aisle would be well-served to learn that lesson. 
   Whether you go back to the New Deal or the Great Society, all these programs that have been put in place and have to be grown and have to be fed, government never gets enough of your money because of this. 
   Now, in Tennessee, because of all the bookkeeping gimmicks of the Democrats, and they ran on one set of priorities but now they are governing like what they are, the liberal elites, and it is going to cost 2.1 million Tennesseans $2,600 per family. If they want to go vote to raise the taxes on the constituents in their district, have at it. Let them line up and vote to raise the taxes on the people that live in their districts. But the people in my district in Tennessee do not want to pay more in either State or Federal taxes. They want to see their taxes reduced. They want to see the size of government shrink, and they want to see better fiscal management and responsibility of the resources that the government has. 
   I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. I look forward to continuing this debate. I look forward to working hard to defeat the Democrats' tax increase which is the single largest tax increase in American history.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia; and I was so pleased that the gentleman from California mentioned Ronald Reagan and his birthday and brought up the Ronald Reagan quote that government does not have a revenue problem; government has a spending problem. This is something that we all know and we all realize and certainly because of the tax reductions that were put in place, and the gentleman from Georgia showed us the charts that showed how the tax reductions went into place in 2003, and we have seen not only growth in our GDP, not only jobs growth but a reduction in the deficit and record revenues for the Federal Government. Because when those rates of taxation go down, we know that revenues to the government go up. 
   I was listening to the gentleman from California, and I recalled a conversation with one of my constituents this weekend. He came to me and he said, Marsha, look at this here in the paper. It was a note that on February 3, 1913, is when the Federal income tax went into place. So here we are at a time when that is being remembered. February 3, 1913, a 1 percent temporary tax, only on the wealthiest, went into place to pay for a war. 
   And look at what we have got now: an IRS that is big and is bloated and is cumbersome and wants more and more and more, a government that wants more and more and more of the dollar that the taxpayer earns. It is like another saying that Ronald Reagan had: The closest thing to eternal life on earth is a Federal Government program. 
   1913, a tax was put in place to pay for a war, to fund a defense effort; and today it is bigger than ever and is still in place. 
   So how appropriate that we come this week and we talk about the budget and we talk about what the President is bringing forth and we talk about the Tax Code and the changes that should be made and the changes that ought to be made and the steps that we should be taking to be certain that the American people retain more of their paycheck. It is an important thing to do. 
   As I was looking through the President's budget that he is offering forth this week, one of the things that caught my eye and that I was pleased to see is that he is recommending the elimination of 141 programs that maybe have outlived their usefulness, that need to be revisited, that the duties could be shuffled to another one, that could be merged with another program so that services are delivered more effectively and more efficiently. I was very pleased to see that because, as I said earlier, we know that there is a spending problem in Washington, DC. 
   We have had our focus on addressing that; and what we want to do is reduce that spending, eliminate programs that have outlived their usefulness and make certain that we do not raise taxes. It is important that we move forward balancing the budget. It is important that we get the fiscal house in order. It is imperative that we do it without raising taxes. 
   So I am looking forward to working to make certain that we focus on waste, fraud and abuse, working to make certain, Mr. Speaker, that we eliminate those programs and, Mr. Speaker, working to make certain that we keep the commitment to the American people that their tax bill is not going to go up, that their tax bill is going to be going down. 
   I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding.

   One of my constituents this weekend was talking about this very issue, and he was very concerned. He had been reading some of the reports, hearing some of the things about the tax reductions that had been put in place in 2003 may be allowed to expire; and he said, Marsh, you know, it is all too often that I have got too much month left over at the end of my money. 
   His point to me and his admonition was the time has come to achieve greater efficiencies. Every one of our constituents can go through their district and see any number of Federal agencies, State agencies, local agencies that are wasting taxpayer money. They know they cannot do that in their family budget. They know that they cannot do that in their small business  budget. As we have said time and again, this is the hold-on-to-your-wallet Congress. They are determined to get more of the taxpayer money, and we are going to stand solid with the taxpayers to make certain that we help protect those pocketbooks.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, we do know that the war in Iraq will come up for debate in this body, as it should. But the debate on this floor should not be about partisan politics. It should be about doing what is in the best interests of our troops, making certain that we win in this global war on terror, and how we are going to keep this Nation and our communities and our cities safe. 
   I recently read a quote from Specialist Tyler Johnson. He is serving his first tour of duty in Iraq. When asked about the criticism back home, he said that passing no-confidence resolutions does send a message to our troops overseas: ``You may support or say we support the troops, but you're not supporting what they do, what they're here sweating for, what we bleed for, what we die for. It all just doesn't make sense to me.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I agree with Tyler and our troops. Passing no-confidence resolutions does send a message, and it is not a message of courage, of confidence and strength. 
   I agree, let's support Sam Johnson's House Resolution 511. Stand with and fully fund our troops.

   You know, I have been asked many times over the last few weeks, and certainly on Sunday when I was at Fort Campbell, if I would support a surge in the troops. I think that we have to remember that it is important that we listen to the men and women and the commanders in the field as we have this discussion. 
   We have to look at the situation: what does it take to defuse it, to stand up the Iraqis and make it easier to relinquish control to the Iraqis for their country. 
   It is exactly this sort of opportunity and these situations that really animate the work and the leadership of Lieutenant General David Petraeus, the American commander who has been there for a year with the 101st, who was back for a year training the Iraqi troops in Baghdad, and now will return again. He has been called the military's warrior scholar and has drawn deeply on his dual background to create a leadership style that is respectful of military tradition and is innovative. We support General Petraeus. 
   We look forward to his work there and his leadership style as we work to continue to defeat the terrorists and win the war on terror.

What they are saying when I meet them is, what is going on in Washington? What is happening up there? We thought we were going to see a different type of environment. But you know what, it seems like nothing is getting done. 
   Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, they are right on the mark, because we are zero in '07 on the six for '06 that the leadership had promised that they were going to do. 
   More importantly to my constituents, and especially to some of those at Fort Campbell that I had the opportunity to spend time with on Sunday evening as they had their Normandy barbecue, the number one question was, what is going on with the Iraq supplemental? It is truly a disservice to our men and women in uniform for this not to be passed. Our troops in the field need that funding. 
   Other constituents were saying, what is this we are hearing about this budget? My goodness, the single largest tax increase in history? 
   Yes, indeed. And I can guarantee you, Mr. Speaker, many of us will stand in the gap to keep that from becoming law.

   We have already learned that a few of our major banks are issuing credit cards to illegal immigrants, but a recent article in the L.A. Times uncovered a program through our own Federal Reserve Bank that makes it easier for illegal entrants to send money back to Mexico, direct to Mexico. A federally sponsored program allows illegal immigrants without a Social Security number to wire money through the Federal system for a fee. 
   What is even more shocking is that the Fed expanded the program that allows anyone, illegal or not, to open accounts at participating banks. This is a big business. We have learned it is 27,000 transfers from illegal immigrants every month, totaling $23 billion a year, all with the help of our Federal Government. 
   We are sending mixed messages, Mr. Speaker. We say we want to stem the tide of illegal immigration, but once again, here we go. We will not only turn a blind eye; we will make it easy for illegal immigrants to send money back to Mexico.

It is a job that you can sink your teeth into, that you can go to work every day and you can use this job to provide for your family. So, as the debate ensues, let's keep our focus on how policies affect the environment in which job growth takes place. Of course we all want to see lower marginal rates on our income tax rate. We want to lower cap gains. We want to lower the corporate tax rate. We want to see full and immediate section 179 expensing for our small businesses. And for those of us that live in States that do not have a State income  tax, we want to see deductibility of State sales tax extended. All of these are good things and, Madam Speaker, we are working for all of these. I hope that we also will keep in mind that actions speak louder than words. So this body should use this conversation about economic stimulus as an opportunity to prioritize and reduce what the Federal Government spends. Reduce the budget. Let's spend less.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I am rising today to urge a ``no'' vote on the SCHIP veto override. 
   You know, it seems like we have done this over and over and over again. But to my colleagues across the aisle, the time to have started this discussion was this time last year. And if they were so concerned about children's access to health care, the timely manner would have been last year to start this debate, not the end of the year. 
   Now, as we have heard in the discussion here today, this issue is decided. This body passed S. 2499, that's Senate bill 2499, which very closely mirrors the Barton-Deal bill that the ranking member mentioned earlier today, and it came very close to extending the program with its original intent. 
   Now, how many times in this body do we hear programs have strayed from their original intent, they're not what they started out? And that is how we went about making certain that this program was put in place through March 2009, getting through the Presidential debate so we didn't have to come back to the floor and talk about this. But instead, the majority wants to keep their focus on H.R. 3963. 
   Now, in that bill what you would find is it will increase the number of adults on SCHIP, which is the State Children's Health Insurance Plan. Why do we need to be putting adults on SCHIP? It would also allow illegal immigrants to fraudulently enroll in SCHIP. Why should illegal immigrants be getting taxpayer-funded health care? And it would create a flawed tobacco tax scheme to the tune of $70 billion. 
   Madam Speaker, let's vote to sustain the veto. Let's vote ``no'' on this veto override. It is disheartening that the Democrats cannot put aside their partisan agenda for children.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, we've heard a lot today about H.R. 3915 and how it is a dramatic departure from current law that I believe will have an unintended negative impact on banks and creditworthy home buyers. 
   I think it's the opinion of many in this Chamber, certainly it's my opinion, that in an attempt to improve conditions in the housing market, this bill instead will likely prevent more hardworking Americans from obtaining a mortgage in a market that is already feeling the pinch. They need more help; they do not need roadblocks. 
   The legislation before the House today may do more harm than good. Yet reasonable people, which we are in this Chamber, can choose to disagree on issues, and this is one of those where we are in disagreement. I respect my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their varying positions on this legislation, but there is disagreement. 
   I believe most of my colleagues cannot disagree with the following proposition, and it is this: American creditors should not be able to extend any credit in connection with a residential mortgage loan unless they verify the identity and legal immigration status of a potential debtor and verify the status with only a secure ID. 
   Mr. Speaker, this recommittal makes good, solid common sense. The American people do not believe that illegal immigrants and other individuals without proper identification are entitled to the same benefits, privileges and services as U.S. citizens and legal aliens. To extend such benefits only reinforces their notion that the laws of this land exist only on paper. 
   This motion to recommit will help preserve the faith the American people have left with this government and show that we are serious about denying services to those who are not entitled. 
   It is quite simple. The motion, number one, requires creditors to verify the identity of an individual seeking to obtain a loan for a residential mortgage; and, number two, prevents a creditor from accepting, for the purpose of verification, any form of identification other than a Social Security card with photo ID, a REAL ID identification card, a passport, or a USCIS-issued photo ID card. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people have spoken out loud and clear on this issue. They do not believe that illegal immigrants, international criminals, and those who may wish this Nation harm should have access to American financial markets. That is why I had previously introduced H.R. 1314, the Photo ID Security Act. The legislation responded to plans and actions by firms in the financial services sector to affirmatively target this population by accepting insecure identification. My office was flooded with phone calls, e-mails, letters from across the country; many included credit cards that people had cut up in protest to their bank's decisions. 
   The motion to recommit adopts much of the language that was found and cosponsored in a bipartisan basis in H.R. 1314 and will provide American citizens the reassurance they need that the American financial services sector is, indeed, secure. It doesn't solve all the problems of the underlying legislation, but it is certainly a start.  
   Let's take one step forward for the security of the financial services market, Mr. Speaker, and let's all support this motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, it is a rare opportunity to rise in support of commonsense decisions coming out of the other body, so it gives me great pleasure to rise in full support of the majority's decision on the other side of this Capitol to separate the Labor-HHS approps bill from legislation that funds our military installations and veterans health care. I certainly hope the majority on this side is paying attention. 
   While the other body has said ``no'' to politicizing veterans health care, ``no'' to putting the security of our military installations at risk, and ``no'' to budget-busting pork, it appears that the majority on this side is, well, a little tone deaf. 
   So, Madam Speaker, our veterans and men and women in uniform deserve better. They deserve quick action from the leadership in this House to pass a clean veterans bill and provide the funds they need. Let's leave the politics of disrespect behind. Let's pass a clean veterans bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Charlie Norwood CLEAR Act of 2007. Our late friend and colleague, Representative Charlie Norwood, introduced commonsense legislation to institute an efficient system, an efficient system, of identifying and detaining criminal aliens. Our good friend is gone, but his idea remains as viable today as it was the day that he first introduced it in the 108th Congress. 
   There are 400,000 alien absconders in our country, with 285,000 possessing criminal records. This bill targets those criminals by increasing Federal funds to local law enforcement agencies that need those funds, providing police that are on the beat with the resources they need and giving them the background, the information, to enforce immigration law. 
   It also cuts funding to sanctuary cities which have enacted laws prohibiting local police from detaining and arresting criminal aliens. Most notably, it requires the Federal Government to take these criminal aliens into custody within 48 hours. 
   Join me in supporting the Charlie Norwood CLEAR Act of 2007.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, it is so interesting to look at today's Whipping Post and see the myriad and vast range of the issues that are coming before us. And many of these are issues that should have been addressed months ago. 
   One of those that we are going to address first off this morning will be S. 2499. This is an issue that is going to deal with Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance Program. This should have been handled months ago. It has been running under a continuing resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I am so pleased that the congressional leadership has decided to finally take the politics out of this and to support SCHIP as it was currently put in place in 1997 by a Republican Congress and to keep the focus on children of the working poor who need access to health care. 
   I support this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do likewise and to continue to support SCHIP as it was originally put in place in 1997 by a Republican Congress.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I want to compliment Mr. Barton and Mr. Deal for the extraordinary amount of work they have done on this issue this entire year. I know that they are pleased that the congressional leadership has joined them in working to be certain that we take the politics out of this issue and we keep the focus on how we address the health care needs of our Nation's most vulnerable, our children and our elderly. 
   A couple of things that we are going to see in this bill, as you have already heard, the Medicare physician payment schedule, the cut that was to take place is not going to. They are going to see a half percent increase through June 2008. My hope is that we will be able to have the majority work with us to resolve this issue. 
   I think it is just unconscionable that every single year this SGR gets revisited and we try to work it through. We know that this is something that we are going to be providing. It is a service. Health care is going to be provided for our Medicare enrollees. And, Madam Speaker, this needs to be dealt with and the problem needs to be solved. 
   I am also pleased that SCHIP is going to be extended through March 2009 and that we are keeping the focus there on standing in the gap between those children that are not eligible for Medicare and those that have the ability to afford private health insurance. This gets back to the original intent of that program to be certain that the children of the working poor are covered. 
   I am also pleased that this contains the 6-month extension of critical funding for the Tennessee Medicaid DSH payments to our hospitals. 
   Madam Speaker, there should be some lessons learned from the 1115 waiver process that my State of Tennessee has been through and through the experiment of HILLARY CLINTON health care and the failures of that. As we move forward, I hope we look at those lessons learned. 
   I appreciate this legislation does provide those DSH payments to these hospitals. I look forward to working with the majority.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank Mr. Jordan for the good work that he is doing right here. He is exactly right in the amendment that he is bringing forward, hold constant, hold it level.  
   Mr. Chairman, we hear this from our constituents every single day. We all know that the American people are certainly frustrated with the way they see Washington spend money, and the amount of money that they spend. 
   What our amendments are doing is just to say, just pare it down a little bit. Let's require the bureaucracy to institute some efficiencies. Let's require them to get their House in order. 
   Now, quite frankly, I don't think it's a bad thing. I think that it is a very positive step to look forward and say let's hold the bureaucracy accountable. Should they be able to move forward and not put best practices in place? Should they be able to just every year get an increase when we have men and women who go to work every single day? They may work for a period of 2 or 3 or 4 years and not see an increase in their salary. 
   We may have families that look at their budget and say that they are not seeing an increase. To say, you know, to not increase spending puts us on a downward trend. 
   I truly take exception with that. It is our constituents who are saying you need to start putting some accountability measures in place, you need to reduce what this Federal Government is going to spend because they tax too much and certainly, in order to pay for all of this increase in spending, and this is an increase, it exceeds the President's request by $1.9 billion, which is a 7.6 percent increase. In order to pay for this, they are willing to push forward the single largest tax increase in history because they spend too much money.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I have been watching as we are pulling together this year's energy bill for the House; who is doing the cobbling; what they are including in the package, or, curiously, what they are leaving out. 
   This is the current House leadership's second attempt this session to produce an energy bill that would address our energy dependence on unstable parts of the world, our strategic vulnerabilities that arise from that dependence, and the disastrous effects that high energy prices have on our ability to retain and produce American jobs. 
   You would think that the Energy Committee would be a pretty good place to start on this. But last week, provisions in our committee's bill promoting additional energy production,  especially production focussed on the clean and efficient use of American coal, were stripped. And unless my colleagues in committee are successful in putting them back in this week, then the Democrats will deliver another energy bill that does not produce an ounce of energy. 
   It is time for us to address this issue.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, it is becoming painfully clear to us and now we know that Americans should not be forced to endure a prolonged and painful economic downturn to pay for the sins of Fannie, Freddie or discredited Wall Street executives. The question that is being asked by many of our constituents is, all right, now what are we going to do? 
   So let me be clear. I do not support a bailout of Wall Street firms funded by hundreds of billions of taxpayers dollars. There are smarter ways for us to handle this. 
   The President and congressional leaders should set a timeline for legislation, come to mark it up, and look at things from both the short and the long-term. We have learned that the ad hoc approach to bailing out companies in the past few weeks just has not worked. What we need is a workout plan that leverages Wall Street's assets and ingenuity to bring the economy back to health while protecting the American taxpayer. 
   Any deal that comes forward should limit the cash available to Secretary Paulson. We cannot write one man, no matter how experienced or smart, a check for $700 billion of the taxpayers' money. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that we continue to work forward on this and keep the American taxpayer first and foremost in our thoughts.

My goodness, they have really grown so ill and fatigued of all the excuses they hear from our leaders. And that is why over the past 5 weeks, 137 Republicans have spoken here on the House floor in favor of American energy and in favor of solving this problem for the American people. 
   Although Congress was in recess and the lights were turned out and the microphones were off and the TV cameras were quiet, we brought our constituents onto this floor to demonstrate that we are willing and ready to go to work. And still, there is no vote, no vote scheduled on legislation to increase American energy development and to decrease our reliance on foreign oil. 
   Should Congress promote increased production of American energy? Should  we promote conservation and efficiency? Should we encourage the use of alternative and renewable fuels? The answer to all of the above is yes. That is why we need an ``all of the above'' energy strategy. We need a vote, Mr. Speaker. We need a vote on the House floor.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, you know that the price at the pump is what everyone is talking about. And in my district in Tennessee, moms are now spending over $100 more to fill up the tanks than they were when the Democrats took the gavel in both the House and the Senate. It costs over $100 a month more to fill up the tank of an average minivan. We have seen the price of a gallon of gas go from $2.26 to $4 a gallon. 
   Madam Speaker, there is a reason for this. And we on the Republican side have solutions for this problem. It is time to waive the gas tax. It is time to waive the ethanol mandates. It is time to waive the requirements for boutique fuels. And it is time for Americans to explore for American energy on American soil. 
   There is a way to address this. There are bills that are filed. There is action that can be taken. I encourage my Democrat colleagues, encourage your leadership to rise to the challenge, reduce the price at the pump.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding, and for his leadership on this issue. 
   Getting our hands around waste, rooting out waste, fraud and abuse is something our freshmen class when we came to Congress said we were going to be committed to. And certainly pushing forward earmarks and the issue of pork-barrel spending is something we have committed much of our time in this Congress to. 
   Madam Speaker, I think it is so appropriate as we talk about this issue that we realize yes, indeed, we have called for a moratorium on earmarks and would encourage all Members to join us, doing so partly because this is an issue that over time has grown and grown and grown. 
   When you go back and look historically, the first correspondence on this that we could find was Thomas Jefferson writing a letter to James Madison March 6, 1796, and Jefferson wrote commending to Madison did he think of all of the consequences that would come from the proposition of using public money as a bottomless pit, if you will. It is a great quote.  
   There are quotes from President Monroe in 1822 when he argued that Federal money should be limited to great national works since if it was unlimited, it would be liable to abuse and might be productive of evil. That's 1822, how interesting. 
   As we look at the period of time through the 1950s and the 1960s and 1970s and 1980s, how this body repeatedly increased spending every single year and increased the use of those earmarks every single year, and how the practice became commonplace. 
   Well, some of us feel like enough is enough, that the American taxpayer deserves greater consideration. Now is the time for an earmark moratorium.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Tim Murphy) for the leadership that he brings to our Health Subcommittee. 
   I also want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps) for her attentiveness to women's health issues. She is an effective advocate. 
   And to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey) for his leadership on the issue, and for honoring us, all women, with the resolution and bringing the resolution forward to the body as a whole. 
   Mr. Speaker, as has been discussed, this is House Concurrent Resolution 331, and I do join my colleagues in encouraging all of us, not only to support the resolution, but to be effective spokespeople for what the resolution means; that we move forward, actively, to encourage women to gather the information that they need, because indeed, one of the purposes is to encourage women to seek information, to become health conscious and as the gentleman from New York said, to develop those healthy habits. 
   And it is not only adult women that we are speaking to, but it is to young girls also as they look at diet, as they look at exercise, as they gather information about how to best take care of themselves. And we do encourage them to seek that information, to get regular checkups, to become knowledgeable of the preventive screenings that will help them to stay healthy and to enjoy a better quality of life. 
   One thing that we also do is encourage women to have that relationship with their primary care physician, somebody that they can go to to gather the information about how to become knowledgeable on taking care of their bodies. 
   We've talked a little bit about some of the diseases that affect women, fibromyalgia, depression and, of course, postpartum depression, which concerns us all with the young women and those in the child-bearing years. 
   Heart disease also and some of the screenings that are important for that. And as the gentleman from Pennsylvania said, there is the website where individuals can access this information. 
   But we do stand together to promote prevention and awareness for disease management so that the women of this Nation are certainly taking better care of themselves, and are knowledgeable on the diseases that could impair their quality of life and their productivity. 
   Again, I join my colleagues and thank them for the leadership on Resolution 331. And I appreciate the opportunity to stand and speak on the importance of this, and again, encourage all Members, not only to support it, but to actually be certain that we disseminate this information to our constituents.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (FISA -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership on this issue, as well as the leadership that has come from the gentlewoman from New Mexico and also the gentleman from Pennsylvania. It is an issue that does need to be addressed. I would remind our constituents who are watching that we are talking about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA. That is what it stands for. 
   As the gentlewoman from New Mexico said, the changes in technology may mean that someone in the Horn of Africa who is calling in to a Middle Eastern country, their call ends up being routed through this country. What we are talking about is foreign intelligence and talking about getting information, gathering that intelligence that will keep Americans safe. As the gentleman from Pennsylvania said, our constituents are wanting to know, are we in danger? Are we in danger? Where is the next threat? Are you making certain that in our communities, in our homes, in our neighborhoods, in our schools, that we are going to be safe? 
   We were just discussing a bit about the trial bar and their part in this issue, if you will. In mid-March I noticed an editorial in Investors Business  Daily and it was titled ``FISA Fix For Lawyers.'' Not my words, Investors Business Daily from a mid-March issue, ``FISA Fix For Lawyers.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that kind of peaked my curiosity, so I read a bit about it. Basically what it goes on to say is that pretty much this bill could be considered an earmark for the trial bar. 
   Well, I did a little bit of investigating on that issue, once I read that article, Mr. Speaker, and it seems that $72,440,904 had been given to the Democrats by the trial bar this cycle so far. That was through mid-March. So we will see what else happens with that figure. 
   But it appears, as we have just discussed the lawsuits that are filed with the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, that that may have a little bit to do, Mr. Speaker, with why Investors Business Daily would write an article and look at FISA as a fix for lawyers. Certainly something we do not want to do is have the integrity and the security of every single community in this great land of ours compromised in any way, shape or form because of that. 
   Now, the gentleman from Texas mentioned that 45 days has passed since the Protect America Act expired, and that does cause some question from our constituents. As the gentleman from Pennsylvania mentioned, Attorneys General from 25 different States support the bipartisan Protect America Act, and independent intelligence reports support this. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think there is indeed a reason. It is because we all know that protecting this Nation and our Nation's interests should rise above partisan debate on this floor. Of course, the bill that was brought to this floor before we departed for our Easter recess was a bill that the leadership knew was not going to go anywhere, but they felt like they had to do something. 
   Mrs. Wilson mentioned that intelligence is dynamic. I think that is an important part of the debate that we have before us as we talk about FISA. It is indeed dynamic, because it doesn't stay the same. The individuals who are seeking to do us harm do not stay in the same places, nor are their camps nor are their cells stationary or stagnant. Because of that, we have to look at electronic surveillance as going about this a different way. 
   The gentleman from Texas mentioned the situation that occurred last year with three American soldiers that were kidnapped in Iraq and the wrangling that had to go on to get through the courts, as he said, to get ``lawyered up,'' to get in there and to get a warrant. By that time, 9 hours had passed, and by that time we had one individual who was dead and we still have two who are missing as of this point in time. 
   So, looking at 21st century technology, understanding how that technology works on a global basis, and understanding that if we are to stay ahead of the game on this, Mr. Speaker, it is imperative, it is imperative, that we realize that our enemies are using satellite phones. They are not using rotary phones. They are using text messages. They are not sending telegrams.     
   They are moving constantly; they are not in the same place. And it is imperative that we adjust our laws so that we have the ability to stay ahead of them, and ahead of their desire to do harm to us, our constituents, and our great Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that our majority has set up this Special Order hour and those of us in the minority have the opportunity to come to claim this time and to talk about issues that are of tremendous importance to us. 
   Over the past few weeks, some of my colleagues and I have come to the floor on a weekly basis, and we have talked about the Federal budget and what you find in the Federal budget. And, Mr. Speaker, we think that this is a very important thing to do because the budget that the majority has brought to us this year is a rather large budget and it contains the single largest tax increase in history. 
   So we have spent some time talking with our colleagues and with our constituents about what you actually find in this document. Now, we have called this ``Budget School: The Right to Know How Washington Spends Your Money.'' And, of course, as each week we have talked about this, you can go to the whitehouse.gov Web site and go to OMB and pull down a copy of that budget. Then you can get the Republican response from budget.house.gov/republicans and see what we would do, how we would go about reducing the taxes that you pay and making certain that you, the taxpayer, are keeping more money in your budget. 
   Now, if you want to watch some of the sessions that we have had on Budget School, you can go to house.gov/blackburn, and there are some Budget School resources there. One of the resources that we have used is the Basics of the Budget Process briefing paper. You can go to the Budget Committee Web site, budget.house.gov/republicans, and be able to get a little bit of information about how we actually go through this, how you look at the different functions of the budget, where you find those, looking at the size of the budget, being able to follow it through, looking at the timeline of the budget and how it goes through the process of the President's presenting his budget, then its going to the committee, how the committee works through the process, brings it to the floor, and then this summer as we start through appropriations and through the earmarking process. And we're going to be back to talk about that part of the budget, the earmarks, as we get into the summer. 
   Tonight as we talk about process and what has actually happened, I want to welcome to the floor and to this session of Budget School the ranking member, and the ranking member of the Budget Committee is our number one Republican on the Budget Committee, and this is the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), who is known for being one of the top fiscal conservatives in the U.S. Congress. And I am delighted that he has joined us for Budget School. He is a leader in the Republican Study Committee and a leader on the Budget Committee.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. If the gentleman would yield, I would like to go back to this poster for just one moment. 
   So what I am hearing you say is you all worked through this process in Budget Committee. And as the budget document came to you from the President, and then you worked it through committee, this is the resolution that the Democrat-led majority came to in that committee, that they didn't want to have a budget that stressed priorities. They didn't want to have a budget that was going to lessen the burden on the taxpayer. What they wanted to do was have a budget that was just going to keep the focus on spending and taking more out of the taxpayers' pocket. 
   And in order to get to their number, their desired number, the $683 billion tax increase that's going to take place over the next 5 years, what they are willing to do is to have those income tax rates go back up, the marginal rates go to 39.6 percent, which will affect so many of our small businesses. 
   And as you so rightly stated, 70 percent of all the jobs in the country come out of the small business sector. Capital gains, which are very important to our senior citizens, those that are living on retirement income, who have worked hard, who have built a nest egg, who have saved, we are going to  see that go up to 20 percent. The death tax is one of those taxes that I think is so egregious because you acquire something, you pay tax. You earn the income and you pay tax. You make an acquisition and you pay tax. You maintain it and you are paying tax. Then if you have a capital gain, you pay tax. If you put that aside so that you're leaving something for your family, the government reaches in, the IRS reaches in one more time after you're gone and takes it again. And that is going to go to 55 percent. 
   For staying married, you are going to end up paying $1,400. You will go from zero back up to $1,400. Your child tax credit, in the meantime, is going to be cut in half. And then that 10 percent bracket, that lowest bracket for those that are working and need to have a break, the government needs to give them a break, they are going to raise that back up to 15 percent. And that is the resolution that the majority chose to move out of the Budget Committee.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for his leadership at the Budget Committee and for being there in the fight on this, to make certain that we bring forward these issues, to point out that we are focused not on immediate gratification when it comes to this, not on saying yes to pork-barrel projects. We are focused on the long-term, what is the legacy going to be. 
   As you pointed out in your charts, by the time we get to 2030, it is going to take every dollar of our existing tax base to cover Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. That is it. I mean, it will just be the entitlements that get covered.  
   And for our children and grandchildren, if you were to take a dollar and extract 40 cents out of that, and there again, that is just the Federal Government portion, it is not your State, it is not your local communities, it is not your county, it is just the Federal Government. They have that right of first refusal on your paycheck. And now when you earn a dollar, before they give you any of it, then by the time we get to 2040, they are taking 40 cents out of that dollar and then giving you 60 cents for yourself, for your family, for your State, your county and your community. 
   That is a frightening, frightening thought for this next generation. That is not the legacy that we want to leave them. We should be about securing the blessings of this great Nation for our children and our grandchildren and future generations. It is truly indeed regrettable and even shameful that the focus would be only on the here and now and not on what is to come for generations to come. 
   I want to yield now to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), who is a CPA. When we talk about fiscal responsibility, many times this is someone that we turn to and say, tell us what you know and give us your best insights. For that wisdom, I yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. If the gentleman would yield, the bill that he just referenced I think is so important, because what it does is to redirect the funds as the budget works its way through the process. You mentioned the top line number, and that is the number that gets set in the Budget Committee, and then as we move through this process with the appropriations, and we are going to be back on this floor during that season talking about earmarks, but those are hard-fought battles. 
   But let's say that we eliminate a program and that program saves $50 million, eliminates $50 million in spending. Then that money is not used as a savings. It is not realized as a savings for the taxpayer. It goes back to the committee and the committee can choose to spend it another way. And your legislation, and they can go to your website and get more information on that legislation, would require that the Federal Government use that money to lower the deficit.

If the gentleman will yield, I think that there was also an amendment presented that day in those 36 amendments that would have allowed your State of Florida and your State of Texas and my State of Tennessee to continue to deduct the sales tax deductibility that some of us worked very hard in 2003 to have that deduction restored for our States, where we did not have a State income tax. We have a sales tax. That is an issue of tax fairness, and it was a party-line vote to take that deduction away. 
   In my State of Tennessee, that is about a $1,600 deduction per family. That ends up being real money in the pockets of our families. This new $683 billion tax increase that the majority has brought forward and laid on the table here in this House and said we are for it, that is what they want, that is what they think should be the priority. That bill, their budget, will take another $2,668 per tax filer out of the pockets of my constituents and send it here. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from Florida.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. The gentleman from Texas talks about his seven grandchildren and the gentleman from Wisconsin talks about his three children. I have two adult children, and I am going to have a grandbaby in just a few days, and it is so disappointing when you see what that child is going to be responsible for when they come on the face of this Earth. 
   This year alone, Washington is going to spend over $25,000 per household and that is going to be a heavy burden for every man, woman and child to bear. 
   Just as a reminder, our budget school, the right to know how you spend your money, if you want to see how the Republicans would have approached this budget this year and not raised taxes, how the Republicans fought a $683 billion tax increase, $683 billion, this is where you go: Budget.house.gov/Republicans, and you can pull that response down. To get more information on our Republican Study Committee, budget and school resources, go to House.gov/Blackburn. That is a great way to figure out how we think is the best way to approach fiscal responsibility, how to be a good steward, a wise steward of the taxpayer dollar. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank you for having yielded the time tonight.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, during the district word period back in my State of Tennessee, I traveled, talked with many and listened to my constituents. 
   What they are wanting is people in Congress to solve problems. In their estimation, you are either part of the problem or part of the solution, and there is no in between. Yet they have not seen the liberal majority in this Congress tackle one of the most pressing problems of our time, that of illegal immigration, which is only getting worse every single minute. 
   That is why this week I am introducing the Charlie Norwood CLEAR Act of 2007. This legislation provides clear authority for local law enforcement to enforce immigration law, and actually requires the Feds to remove and deport criminal aliens detained by local law enforcement officials. What a novel concept, deportation. 
   It also sends a tough message to sanctuary cities by reducing Federal funds to those cities that provide sanctuary to violent criminal aliens. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Charlie Norwood CLEAR Act of 2007.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, you know, today President Bush presented his budget to the American people, and even though it is bigger and more bloated than I think it should be, I am pleased that it does include a balanced budget without raising taxes. 
   As stewards of the taxpayers' money, we must be diligent in working to achieve savings and making this government run more efficiently. We have plenty of data from the GAO and from our Inspector General showing that money is wasted throughout the Federal Government, and the President's budget does target 140 programs that could and should be removed. 
   So whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, there is consensus among the American people that we do have a spending problem in the Federal Government. It is not a revenue problem. Tax reductions have generated record revenues. It is definitely a spending problem, and it is time that we begin to fine-tune our focus and decide what is a priority with this government. 
   So I hope that my colleagues on either side of this center aisle will join together, will take a good hard look at this budget, and will find a way to balance it without raising taxes.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in a continuing call for responsible leadership in this House. 
   It has now been 107 days since the President called for Congress to produce a supplemental bill that will adequately fund the war on terror. And after more than 3 months of political theater and grandstanding, we have a leadership that hasn't produced anything. A bill will come before us today, hopefully that will fund the troops, and quite simply this will hurt our men and women in uniform. 
   These are not my words but those of a sergeant first class from Tennessee serving in Iraq who wrote to me recently. She has said this, and she is frustrated with some of the things in Iraq but is committed to her duty. And I would like to quote from her letter. 
   She writes, ``I believe that before Congress keeps pushing to get us out of here just to get their sons and daughters home, they need to take a step back, talk to the soldiers.'' She continues, ``I have lost several good friends, brothers and sisters in arms, to this place, but I do not want my children to come back here and clean up this mess if I had the capability to take care of it myself. I know that if we pull out now, the next generation will be right back here to finish what we did not, because too many people are worried about their own political agenda. I am proud to be an American soldier, doing my job to protect my country and help others.'' 
   God bless this soldier, and God bless all who with her serve.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, he mentioned earlier in his comments the lack of hearings that we have had on this issue. Indeed, this morning over in Energy and Commerce there is a hearing on health issues, but nothing to do with Medicare reform, nothing to do with this situation that is before us right now. Indeed, late notice was mentioned. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that what we see here is a pattern that is developing with the majority party, and when they don't want to talk about something, they don't want to debate it on the floor, they want to maybe cover a few things into the bill, then we have it on suspension calendar. I find that very unfortunate. 
   I will say this. With H.R. 6331, 89 percent of our seniors in Tennessee that are enrolled in Medicare Advantage would be adversely impacted by this bill. This is something, this bill, H.R. 6331, would leave a lot of our elderly patients and doctors in peril, while the leadership in this body is playing politics with Medicare. 
   We have heard about the 10 percent cut on July 1. We have heard about procrastinating and leaving this until the 11th hour rather than taking significant action. Mr. Speaker, I think that we have to look at what is happening to Medicare. I am deeply concerned about this issue and how it impacts our seniors. 
   We know that the Medicare trust fund is likely to go bankrupt in 2019. These aren't my figures, these are the Congressional Budget Office figures. We know that this year, we hit the 45 percent trigger, which occurs when Congress is obliged to find a new way to curb Medicare spending. This bill does not do one thing to curb that spending. It makes it worse. It is unfair to our seniors. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I do rise in support of the Stearns-Blackburn amendment to protest the actions of a rogue government agency that really is out of control, and I thank Mr. Stearns for his good work and his good efforts on this with us. 
   The EEOC, as we have heard, it is taxpayer funded, and it is tasked with eradicating discrimination in the workplace. Now, unfortunately, the organization's actions are speaking louder than their words, and certainly they are not in step with the mission that they are instructed to meet. What we see is an agency that is waging war against private employers who have English-speaking policies and English-only language policies in their workplace and with their workforce. 
   Now, as my colleague from Florida has said, the situation we have discussed is in 2004, we had two employees from a Massachusetts Salvation Army Thrift Store. They were instructed to learn English within 1 year to comply with that organization's English-only language policy on the job. The employees refused to comply or even to make a good-faith effort. I think that everyone would like to see them make a good-faith effort to learn the language. And they were summarily dismissed in December of 2005. So they had that full year. 
   Interestingly enough, the two employees were able to navigate their way through the bureaucratic system and get the EEOC to file a discrimination lawsuit against the Salvation Army in April 2007, despite their limited command of the English language. The turn of events would be laughable if it were not true, and if the consequences were not as grave as they are. 
   Yet, in 2006 alone, roughly 200 charges were filed alleging discrimination due to English-language-only policies in different workplaces. This explosion of claims against workplace English is a 612 percent increase since 1996. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think that is one of the things that is of concern to us; 612 percent. That is the increase in these claims against American small businesses, against the businesses that are employing our citizens. We have gone from 32 cases in 1996 to 228 in 2002, according to the EEOC alone, and what we see is those misplaced priorities of the EEOC. 
   As my colleague previously mentioned, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has a backlog of 45,265 cases right now. They expect that that backlog will grow to 67,108 complaints in fiscal year 2008. 
   Mr. Chairman, it does not take an organizational genius to figure this out. What we see is people are not getting their workload done. What we see is the EEOC is putting their energy on something that they don't need to be putting it on, and they have those misplaced priorities, so therefore the items that they are supposed to be addressing in order to meet their mission are languishing in their in-box. They are never getting around to addressing those files. So those are continuing to pile up. 
   What we see is that they should be taking their resources; they have plenty of employees, they have plenty of funds. This is not an issue of them having more money or more resources. This is an issue of them putting their work and making their priorities where they need to be, of addressing these problems, kind of getting their nose to the grindstone, if you will, and getting in behind those cases and getting them done not over here suing U.S. small businesses that are employing our citizens, not over here suing the mom-and-pops who have the right, because they are signing the paycheck, they are paying the payroll taxes, they establish their workplace policies.     
   And they have the right to say we would like you to learn English. We should be incentivizing them to insist on having those employees learn English so that they better communicate with their employer and so they know how to communicate and they are learning by that interaction with those customers. 
   We know so well, those of us who have so many small businesses in our districts, many of these small businesses see these people as true friends.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the Musgrave amendment. I think it is the wise move to make. It shows good stewardship to come in and look at this budget and say, where do we slow the growth and how do we slow the growth? 
   As we all know and as we have learned from so many of our States that have balanced budget amendments that have to curtail the growth of the budget, across-the-board reductions work. They work. And the reason they work is because you get to go in and manage. The Departments get to manage where they want to make those reductions. We all know you can make those half percent reductions. Mr. Chairman, they have been proven to work. 
   The thing that is so very interesting to me is, even if this were to pass, making a half percent reduction and saving the taxpayers $268 million, which is what Mrs. Musgrave is seeking to do, you would still have an increase. You would still have an increase in Science, Commerce, Justice spending. That would be there. 
   But what we are seeking to do is rein in what the Federal Government spends. We can sit here and argue about the particulars of budgeting. We can talk about how baseline budgeting always sets us up for saying whatever is put on the table is a cut, and we can talk about how zero-based budgeting might be a better approach to how the Federal Government goes about setting its annual budget. 
   But one thing we know is this, that the liberal elites always want to come in and spend more. They never get enough of the taxpayers' dollar. We are seeing that this is proving to be the ``hold onto your wallet'' Congress. As I said last week when our friends across the aisle were calling us the ``fringe,'' FRINGE does mean ``fiscal responsibility includes no government excess.''

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the concerns of many of our small businesses in the Seventh District of Tennessee. The ongoing debate over illegal immigration has brought many issues to light. While this issue is trudging its way through Congress, small businesses are stuck trying to figure out how to confront the problems of illegal immigration that are created at the local level. 
   For instance, these businesses should have the right to refuse to hire or fire a person who cannot speak English. An employer who signs the paycheck and pays payroll taxes, and their customers, should be able to communicate with an employee. But under current law that small businessman can be sued by the Federal Government for refusing to hire or in some cases firing a person who cannot communicate in English. As ridiculous as this sounds, it is true. 
   That is why today I will offer a commonsense amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State approps bill that will close the ridiculous loophole and offer some protection to the businesses that drive our economy and employ our citizens. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join this effort to protect our mom-and-pop businesses, not because it is a hard line against illegal immigration, but because it is the right thing to do.

   Of course, at Energy and Commerce Committee I have had the opportunity to watch your leadership, even going back as we were working on the 2005 Energy Policy Act. 
   And I would imagine that some of our constituents who are at home and watching us carry out this colloquy and this discussion here on the floor are thinking, they are talking about coal. Now, I thought coal was a dirty fuel, and I sometimes will hear people talk about carbon emissions and not wanting to use coal because of the  emissions that go into the air and not wanting to use that natural resource. 
   Now, we all know that there are clean coal technologies that will prevent that. But I think that those who are sharing this discussion with us tonight would appreciate hearing just a little bit about some of the clean coal technologies that would allow the use of this vast supply of coal. 
   You know, most people refer to the United States as the Saudi Arabia of coal. We have got more than anyone else. And we have good, bright engineers and innovators who are using those skills and gifts to figure out ways to use this coal in an environmentally friendly way. And I would love to hear the gentleman's comments on that.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Chairman, you know, this is so interesting listening to this fiscal debate and talking about we are the fringe. Well, let me tell you, FRINGE is a great acronym, and let me tell you what FRINGE is a great acronym for. 
   And I think it is very appropriate for those of us on our side of the aisle because fringe means this: Fiscal responsibility includes no government excess. Fiscal responsibility includes no government excess. Now, Madam Chairman, that is what the people tell us they want. Get this fiscal house in order.     
   That is what they want. They don't want you to spend more. They want you to spend less. Government does not have a revenue problem. Government has a spending problem. All of this about across-the-board cuts don't work. 
   If I may tell you why across-the-board cuts do work, the reason is this. You have the opportunity within a department to decide where you would like to reduce. I would recommend, as with many of our States, you go in and you make those reductions out of the bureaucracy. 
   You don't have to take one single penny out of any program. You can take it out of the bureaucracy. That is where you go, and that is why across-the-board cuts work. That is why they use them in State after State after State because they have balanced budget amendments, because they cannot spend more than the rate of growth of the economy in that State. 
   They work. And, yes, fiscal responsibility includes no government excess. Now, yes, there is some real long fringe down there because, it is way down by great big, overblown, heavy bureaucratic programs that do not respond to the needs of the American people. 
   I think it is time that we say let's get this under control. It is the hold-on-to-your-wallet Congress. If we are not happy, they will leave you in tatters, not fringe.

   The Democrat RESTORE Act does fall short. It falls short of what is needed to give our intelligence community the effective tools they need to detect and prevent terrorist activities. That is what we want to do, prevent it. This bill would restrict the intelligence community, and in many cases it gives the appearance of favoring those who do not have our best interests at heart. Is that a message that we would seek to send? Our intelligence community deserves the full resources of the Federal Government, not the red tape of a typical bureaucracy. 
   While we agree that proper oversight is necessary, oversight should never prohibit the men and women in the intelligence community from doing their jobs.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise to support the amendment of the gentleman from Virginia. I do rise on the point of conservation and pointing out some conservation. You know, it is amazing to me to hear all of this talk that we have about global warming. But you know what, the debate that we are having here just points out, Mr. Chairman, there is a difference between conservationists and environmentalists, and this is one of the debates that points this out. Conservationists walk the walk. Environmentalists talk about it, but they do not walk the walk. 
   You know, I remember, I appreciate so much the gentleman from Tennessee's comments about global warming and the threat that is there. Well, you know what? I am old enough to remember having been in high school in the 1960s, and I remember in the early 1970s, going into college where we were all going to freeze to death. 
   We were going to freeze to death. It was on the cover of every magazine out there. We had an Ice Age that was coming. I was scared to death. I thought, my goodness, I will never be able to have children, watch them grow up, because we are going to be living in igloos. 
   Well, but you know what? It did not happen, and now we find out, guess what, 100 years ago, they thought they had a warming cycle; or they did, they documented it. Then we find out that the rises and falls in temperatures of this great Earth are cyclical. It is there, and, yes, it is rising a little bit right there. But in 1969 and 1970 and 1971, the Ice Age was coming, and there was scientific proof. 
   You know, at Energy and Commerce Committee last year, we had some great hearings. We talked about the  fallacy of the hockey stick theory. We discussed that. We heard testimony, and we can have all of our community of scientists who are trying to serve the purpose of validating one another's theories, but not wanting to go back and use the evidence from 100 years ago, and it just proves the point, as is often said on this floor, you are entitled to your opinion, but you are not entitled to a different set of facts, and that is the truth. 
   You know, it is of tremendous concern, on a day when we are talking about the environment, that we do have an example being brought forth that would be spending, not only $22,000 an hour, but would be spending a lot in emissions, in gases. This is something that does deserve to be discussed, Mr. Chairman. 
   I tell you what, we have named this, we have talked about this being the hold-on-to-your-wallet Congress, and for every hour that our friends across the aisle are in charge, they are racking up, not thousands and millions, but moving to billions. Hold on to your wallet because of what they are choosing to spend the taxpayers' hard-earned money on. 
   It is of great concern to me, when I read reports that are coming out of all sorts of papers and news organizations about how this is coming to be, people returning to smoke-filled rooms, picking up the phones, calling, saying, this is the way it ought to be done. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is of great concern to me, I think for those of us who are conservationists, who want to be certain that we leave this Earth a better place than we found it. We are wise to stand and to question the bill and to support the amendment of the gentleman from Virginia.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentlemen for yielding their time back and doing it in the spirit of bipartisanship. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that now that the 100 hours is out of the way and we are to the point of having the State of the Union, that we will see this body return to a format of regular order and regular process and rules that we have had in place and have respected and this body has abided by through the course of this great Nation. That would, indeed, be welcomed. 
   In the 100-hour agenda we have seen the majority party take action on some of the issues that they had chosen to address. Their 100-hour agenda has included legislation on student loans that really is not going to do anything to make loans more accessible and available to those students that are trying to get into college. It is not going to reduce the cost of college while it is there. And it will take effect  after a person has graduated and then is working and is looking at consolidating those loans and paying them back. 
   So that one was a little bit of a head-scratcher for a lot of our constituents because we have worked tirelessly to make college more affordable, to raise the caps on what could be loaned for students to get those Stafford loans, Pell Grants and increasing the funding for those, things that actually would make a difference, and that is an accomplishment of the Republican majority over the past decade. 
   Minimum wage. One of our colleagues had just mentioned minimum wage. And I will point out, Mr. Speaker, to the Members of this body that the actions that were taken on minimum wage, we heard from our small business community. Certainly small business employers that are in my district were very concerned about this. We have heard estimates of 5 to 7 to as much as $17 billion in costs that this would be to our small businesses. That is of tremendous concern. That is a cost that is going to get passed on.     
   That is a cost that is going to get passed on. And of course in the minimum wage bill, we had the unfortunate error of Tunagate that was crept into that bill somehow in one of the sessions as the bill was being drafted, and there again, not going through regular order in making its way to the House. And we hope that we will see that situation addressed. 
   And the tuna producers that American Samoa were exempted from that, American Samoa was exempted from that minimum wage. That is not fair to the rest of the tuna producers in this country. It is not fair to the rest of the companies that sell tuna and tuna products, and we do hope that there will be attention placed to that and that issue will be addressed, because it was a northern California, San Francisco, company that produced the tuna that is harvested in American Samoa. We do have concerns about favoritism that was shown there. 
   The Medicare bill that was passed in the first 100 hours will indeed yield additional costs to the VA. We have had some numbers there that are of quite concern, as much as three-quarters of a billion dollars that this would end up costing, be an additional cost to the veterans health care system, to our veterans for their pharmaceuticals. 
   And what we have heard from our seniors is that they are pleased with Medicare part D. They are pleased to have access to affordable health care. They are very pleased that prescriptions and pharmaceuticals and therapies that at one point they did not have, that they now have access to that. 
   It was a little bit of a head-scratcher, Mr. Speaker, that a program that has been so well received by our seniors, that the new majority would come along and say, well, we are going to change it. We are going to tweak it. It does not matter if it is working well. 
   And it leads us to question: Is it just they want programs that only they design and only they grow, or do they want programs that are going to be of service to the American people? 
   Another of the bills that came through was the 9/11 Commission implementation, not exactly what had been promised in campaign promises. But, you know, the new majority did take the bill up and did take action. And we have heard from a lot of our businesses that are in logistics and transportation with great concerns, great concerns about the cost. 
   Mr. Speaker, when you pass additional fees and additional mandates, and additional costs on to business, guess what? Ronald Reagan was right. It is the people that end up paying those costs. It is not businesses that are bearing those costs and absorbing them. They get passed on to you, to me, and to other consumers, the taxpayers, who see their costs go up because the business that they are doing business with is having to meet the mandates of who? Guess what? The mandates of the Federal Government. 
   So, yes, this has been a very expensive first 100 hours. And it has been troublesome in that regular order was not abided by, the bills were not going through committees and having hearings and having the due diligence process that we as Members of Congress are bound to do. And then they were just coming to the floor without those hearings. 
   I just had another of our colleagues mention something on health care. Of course, this is an issue that we know the President is going to speak a little bit about this evening. Before we move on to a couple of other points, I do want to make a couple of observations about health care and some of the discussion that was taking place on the issue of health care. 
   We know the President is going to talk about health care tonight. Now, the Republicans, the conservatives, have an approach that they think is a right approach. We think that it is appropriate for small businesses to be able to band together and come together under an umbrella and purchase health care, health coverage, health insurance for their employees. 
   That is very good. Our Nation has 40 million uninsured, and to be able to have groups come together, small businesses, let us say all of your florists, or all of your auto supply companies, or all of your plumbing companies, or companies that are a part of the Chamber of Commerce or other small business organizations, or women-owned businesses, businesses of like groups can come together and make that purchase of insurance. 
   It is called small business health plans or association health plans, very good idea for helping our Nation's 40 million uninsured, and the right type, the right type step because it helps make health care insurance affordable. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is positive. That is a free-market way to address the situation. It is a pro-small-business way to address the situation. It is the right step. 
   Another good step is allowing a tax deduction, $5,000, $7,500, for small business that buy insurance. That is the great step. That is the way it should be. You know, when you start looking at the end of the year and filling out your taxes, that is money that you have earned, and being able to take that deduction because you have done something that is right, way to go. 
   It should be incentivized. There should be deductions for that. And it is appropriate that that take place. Now, those are private sector, free market responses to addressing the health care situation. They work very well with the health savings accounts that were passed as part of the Medicare modernization when that bill came forward in 2003. 
   Health savings accounts have been tremendously popular. We now know that we have about 15 million Americans that are insured through health savings accounts. The number is growing. By 2010 we know that there will be over 20 million American families that are there and insured through health savings accounts, having the opportunity to take responsibility for their health care from dollar one. 
   And continuing to incentivize health savings accounts, tax deductions there. There again, it is a private sector, free-enterprise solution to the health care situation, more market-driven, allowing people to have control of access, to take control of their health care decisions, and to participate in those, have choice over who their physician is. Those are the right things to do. 
   Now, one of my colleagues just made a statement about the haves and the have-nots in health care, and made a statement that health care could be provided and, I think I am quoting this correctly, said: We could do it without any additional cost to the system. 
   Oh, Mr. Speaker, let me tell you, when I hear things like that, without any additional cost to the system, it certainly causes me to pay a little bit closer attention, because one of the things that we have realized, Mr. Speaker, is you know what? Nothing is free. There is nothing free. Nothing. There is no free lunch. There is nothing free in health care. Somebody is paying the bill. 
   What we see take place many times is cost shifting, and you will see costs shift within a system. Now, in my wonderful State of Tennessee, we have had an interesting situation take place. We have had a program that went into place in January 1, 1995. It is called TENNCARE, and it was basically a template for HILLARY CLINTON's health care plan. And one of the talking points on it was: There will be no additional costs. We will just spread out  the risk. We will allow those who are uninsured, up to so many percent of poverty, 400 percent of poverty, to come in and to access health care, and we will spread the risk. We will do it through managed care organizations. And managed care organizations can compete for the opportunity to provide this insurance. 
   Well, it has been a program that has had quite a bit of turmoil. We now see that nearly 30 percent of the individuals in our State are on the program, and it is eating up about 36 percent of our State's budget. 
   The reason for that, Mr. Speaker, is because whenever you are trying to give things for free, someone else is paying. In the case of TENNCARE, it has been the citizens of our State, the taxpayers of our State. And there is no way to ever keep up with the exponential growth of that program. So I would encourage all of my colleagues to be very, very thoughtful as we move forward on the health care debate. 
   There is no such thing as being free. There is no way to do this with no additional cost, because, as you try to make more things free, what happens is your access is restricted. What happens is you have fewer physicians who are available for those individuals that need those services. What have you when things are free is people flood into that State trying to get that for a reduced fee, and your own citizens of the State who need the program many times are not able to access it. 
   So I would step very cautiously as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about health care that is going to be free, and universal health care and HILLARY CLINTON's health care plan. There are some pitfalls that are there, and they deserve to be recognized by the body of this House. 
   As we talk about health care, I would love to yield to the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. PRICE, a distinguished Member of this body who is an expert on health care, for some of his thoughts on the issues of the day.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Before I yield back to him for some further comments, I just want to highlight one of the things that he brought up as a physician, and someone who deals with this. 
   When you have a government-run program, what you are doing is putting bureaucrats in charge of your health care decisions, and you are removing that doctor-patient relationship many times. You are putting a barrier there between the individual and that doctor. Someone else that is removed from the process is making that decision; thereby it removes the patient many times from that decision process.     
   That is something that we do not want to see this Nation run toward. Our seniors, our families want to be able to participate in making those health care decisions for themselves. We are so pleased to know that the President will talk about, as I said earlier, the private sector free market-based approach to solving our health care problem. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is what it is going to require, innovation, thinking outside of the box and being certain of something we know: access, affordability, and preserving that doctor-patient relationship. 
   In my case, preserving health care for Tennesseeans. In the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price), preserving health care for Georgians. That is where our focus will be as we move forward on this discussion. We do not want a government-run, government-directed program that is going to place barriers between patients and the individuals that are making those decisions with their health care professionals.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for bringing that forward. The unintended consequences are many times what is so difficult to deal with. In theory to bureaucrats sitting in buildings, that sounded like a great deal: let's have everybody sign the forms. 
   In practice what happened for physicians, it was additional paperwork, additional staff, and removing the patient from the process, making it longer before they get a definitive diagnosis and know how to begin a protocol and treatment that will restore their health, things that impede a quality of life that our constituents desire. 
   So those unintended consequences many times get in the way. We are just very hopeful that we will continue the focus and that the Democrats will join  us in wanting a private sector, free-market solution to health care and not a government-run bureaucracy.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. It does indeed. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. 
   Having this process that gets more and more convoluted every single day is of such concern to our constituents who just want to be able to go to the doctor, have a relationship with the doctor and know a little bit about what to expect. 
   As I said earlier, not knowing what to expect has been one of the interesting points that we have dealt with in this first 100 hours. I think that we all have been a little bit concerned about a bill that was brought forward on Friday. I know my constituents asked about it as they heard about it over the weekend. We talked about it on the floor some this morning, and this is allowing 
   the Delegates voting rights. 
   I have had constituents say, well now, wouldn't that require an amendment to the Constitution? They remember when this debate took place at different times through history back in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s when there were those that wanted to give voting rights to our territories. They are very, very concerned about this, and rightfully so. 
   This morning on the floor earlier I quoted a comment that was made by the Democrat Speaker of the House in 1970, Tom Foley, who said: ``It is very clear that a constitutional amendment would be required to give Delegates a vote in the Committee of the Whole or in the full House.'' That was taken from a New York Times editorial. 
   Now, this is something that we have to realize, we hold our Constitution and the orderly process and the rule of law that is laid forth in that Constitution, we hold that to be meaningful. We recognize the necessity, Mr. Speaker, to respect the Constitution of this great land. We respect that it is built on one man, one vote and equal representation under the law. 
   So when we hear about giving the residents of our territories a vote, it is of concern to us and it does raise several succinct points that we have discussed on the floor today. It is a point worthy of discussion because it appears that since this has not gone through regular order and through the committee process, we haven't held hearings, this is nothing more than an unconstitutional power grab in order to try to move the new majority's agenda. It is of tremendous concern. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia for some comments on the issue.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, repeating again from the Constitution that the representatives of this body are popularly elected from the several States, and that is so important, and I want to talk for just a moment about the size of our districts. 
   Mine is right around 700,000 people. We have some that I think are as low as 640,000, 650,000. They are going to vary just a little bit. But that is the size of them.  
   We do appreciate so much the guidance that is given by the Delegates from the territories. They are a valuable participation and a valuable addition and a wonderful and treasured resource of this body. We need their opinion and their input. But the Constitution does not allow for their having a vote. 
   I think in Guam we have about 155,000 people, and in American Samoa there are about 57,000 people.     
   So we look at one man, one vote and the equal representation, and then we have to say, my goodness, that is just really a far smaller number. That is the size of many of our towns or our counties that we represent when you have a district like mine. So I think that it is important for us to realize that. 
   And it is important for us also to realize that these are Delegates that will be able to vote to raise your taxes, but they are not paying those Federal income taxes, and that is of tremendous concern to our constituents. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have dubbed this time and again the ``hold on to your wallet Congress'' because it seems as if they are looking for ways to increase the cost of government and increase the size of that bureaucracy. And our concern is that this is another of those ways that would make it easier to raise your taxes. 
   And I yield back to the gentleman from Georgia.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman. 
   And one of the things that we have our focus on as we prepare for the State of the Union tonight and for the work that is before us for the rest of this Congress is certainly making certain that we are successful in our efforts in Iraq and making certain that we are successful in the war on terror. 
   Mr. Speaker, our constituents know that this has been a long war. They know that the terrorists started attacking us over two decades ago, and they also know that on September 11 this Nation decided we were no longer going to respond to terrorist attacks as civil disobedience. What we were going to do was to change course, and we were going to respond to it as what it is: an act of war. And our constituents all know, especially constituents in my district, National Guard families, Reserve families, families at Fort Campbell that are in our district, they know that this is a very, very difficult time for our Nation, and it is a difficult time for our men and women in uniform. And they know that freedom is worth protecting. 
   And when I talk to those men and women, many who have been deployed in Afghanistan, have done two deployments in Iraq and know that they may be going back, they will say, Yes, we are going back because our job is not done. And they understand it, Mr. Speaker. And they know that we take a step forward and then we take a step or two back, and that it comes very slowly, and that progress is very slow. 
   We have seen, and our colleague JOHN SHADEGG had handed me an article from Real Clear Politics that pointed out some things that have been happening recently that just haven't caught the eye of the media, and I wish that they had because I would like for them to catch the eye of the American people. 
   First of all, there appears to be some retreating by al Qaeda from Baghdad because they know that troop levels are returning to where they were during the electoral process that took place in January of last year in Iraq. They know that the radical cleric, al Sadr, has decided to call off his boycott, and that his people are returning to participate in that newly formed Parliament, and they know that he is lowering his profile. And they also have seen Prime Minister al Maliki begin to take a change of course and to put some distance between himself and al Sadr. But this is of tremendous concern to us when we hear the naysayers talk about cutting funding and not supporting the troops. 
   And this morning I was on the floor speaking about our colleague SAM JOHNSON, who truly is a hero and has a wonderful piece of legislation that steps forward. It is House Resolution 511, and it really pushes forward on the idea of supporting our troops and funding these men and women who are in harm's way, making certain that they have what they need to do the job that is in front of them; sending the message to them that we stand with them and we are not going to desert them. 
   We know that this is difficult work. We know that it is a job, as I said, that is slow; that progress is slow. But, Mr. Speaker, as we stand here today preparing for the State of the Union, and as we expect to hear this evening from our Commander in Chief that the state of the Union is indeed strong, we also want these men and women in uniform to know that it is strong because of the work they do. 
   We have the ability to stand here every day and talk about freedom and defend freedom and talk about having a Nation that is so wonderful and so diverse that we all, each and every one of us, can pursue our dreams, can focus on hope and opportunity that is so important to us. We do that because men and women have put their life on the line, many times more than once, many times for days on end, to be certain that freedom remains. And we feel that it is appropriate to bring forward a resolution that says fund the troops and fund their needs. 
   We think that it is important that we move forward letting the men and women know that, when they are in the field, we are listening to them. We are listening to the troops. We are listening to the commanders, and we respect their judgment. That is an important message for us to send. 
   And I yield to the gentleman from Georgia for his comments.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman. 
   I will close our hour by referencing some comments I have had from some veterans in my district. I love the fact that I have absolutely wonderful veterans who participate with me on these issues in our National Security Coalition, in our Veterans Coalition, which are advisory groups for me. And I have had great discussions with them and have sent them information about the new strategy going forward in Iraq, about some of the conversations that have been taking place here, and have sought their best judgment, men and women who have worn the uniform and have been there and who have fought and seeking their best judgment. And a couple of their comments, I think, are so incredibly significant. 
   One of them says: ``We have to continue our push forward and let our military make the decisions in this war. When the House and Senate changed, there was no doubt there would be a change of efforts. Our enemy knows this and will continue to strike as long as they think our country is not united.'' 
   And another of the veterans said in this e-mail: ``What is important is that we show a unified front to the enemy and we give the new plan and the deployment a chance to work. If we win, if we defeat radical Islam, then maybe, maybe, this is all going to be worth it.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, these men and women who have put that uniform on and have gone into battle know that this is the price that we pay. They understand that this is not going to be easy. They know, and they are watching the President's speech tonight, and they are watching our response. And I would submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that our enemy is watching our response. And I will submit to you that, while we all have different philosophies, we all come from different districts, and we are a very diverse body, I would commend to you and my colleagues that it is important that we stand with our men and women in uniform, that we show a unified front and show that we are committed to being certain that this Nation continues to stand as a great Nation and that we persevere.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (DELEGATE VOTING -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the time and the opportunity to talk with my colleagues about an issue that is of tremendous importance to us. It is certainly one that I have heard from from my constituents in Tennessee's Seventh Congressional District. They are quite concerned about this. It seems that all of a sudden last week, outside of regular order, outside of the normal committee process, an old idea resurfaced and came before this body in the form of a piece of legislation that is not going through regular order, is not going through the committee process. And I had many constituents who were quite concerned about this, and how could a bill that is important to us, important to our Nation, important to our structure and our way of governing come before us without people being aware? This issue is the issue of delegate voting. We are going to hear more about this today and tomorrow. Then the Democrat majority is going to push this to the floor for a vote so that they can circumvent what is the constitutional underpinning of this great Nation.  
   Now, we as Republicans believe in the constitutional principle of one person, one vote. We think that that is important. It is important to adhere to that, that everyone is equal under the law. Everyone is entitled to their vote, everyone is entitled to that representation of one person, one vote. And to change that principle and allow delegate voting would require an amendment of the Constitution. That is not a statement that comes only from me but the Democrats can look at their former Speaker of the House, Tom Foley, who is on record in 1970 when this old issue came up at that point. In 1970, former Speaker of the House Tom Foley, a Democrat from Washington State said, and I am quoting, it is very clear that a constitutional amendment would be required to give delegates a vote in the Committee of the Whole, which is the full House. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, this act by the Democrats is nothing more than an unconstitutional power grab that they want in order to be able to further their agenda. So we feel that it is important to stand against this. We feel that it is also important that we look at the Constitution, when it says that the House shall be composed of Members chosen by the people of the several States, not delegates representing the non-State territories. There is a distinction here. There is a bright line here. 
   We also feel like that it is important to note that this plan would run over that tenderly held principle of one person, one vote. The average congressional district has approximately 650,000 people. Mine in Tennessee has a little bit more than that. We know that Speaker Pelosi's has 640,000 people. But we also know that American Samoa has 57,000 people, the Virgin Islands 108,000, and Guam 155,000. So the Delegates that represent those numbers of individuals could vote to raise your taxes, but--and this is another point that concerned my constituents--they would not have to pay them. So their Delegates can vote to raise the taxes of my constituents in Tennessee but those Delegates' constituents wouldn't have to be paying the taxes. They get benefits, they want a vote, they want to use that money. They are just not having to pay the taxes. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I do believe that this is something that many people would say, well, if we're going to have equity under the law, if they're not going to have to pay though those taxes, if they're going to have a Congressman for 57,000 people and they have their vote for 57,000 or 108,000 or 155,000, then why don't we just change the rules for everybody? The answer to that, Mr. Speaker, we know is because this Constitution means something. This is a Nation of laws. It is a Nation that is built on the rule of law. And to give Delegates the right to vote is inappropriate. It is a circumvention of our law. It is a violation of our Constitution. 
   Now, we know that the Democrat leadership is trying to ram this through the House and there are some reasons for doing this. They feel like they can literally do it on the sly this week. Tonight is the State of the Union. They feel like they can do this in the shadow of the State of the Union without going through the process of the committees, without going through the process of amending the Constitution. We also know that they would choose to do it before they establish regular order. 
   Mr. Speaker, you know, we have not been in the committee process. The committees have not been functioning. We have been having bills come straight to the floor without the due diligence and the oversight that is done by the committees. We know the Democrats would choose to circumvent that process and pass this before regular order is established. It is an issue of great concern. I appreciate very much that my constituents have been involved in the issue.

No one knows this better  than SAM JOHNSON, our colleague from Texas, who is a true American hero; and I commend him for introducing House Resolution 511. I would commend it to every Member of this body to support. 
   And I want to say to the Democrats that if they should mean what they say and do what they mean, they really cannot have it both ways on this vote. To vote to support the troops in the field and then not give them the equipment and the supplies and the resources that they need to win is deceptive, it is dangerous, and it puts the lives of American servicemen and -women at risk. 
   The Democrat majority must understand the stakes in Iraq. Certainly, our constituents understand the stakes that are there, both in the terms of human life and global stability.

I will tell you what my constituents are saying: They were better off in 2006, and they're asking what has happened since that time. 
   Well, the Democrats took control of both chambers of this House. And you know what? They are not doing one thing to turn the heat down on the American consumer. As long as the energy crisis is not addressed, the price of oil is going to affect everything else: transportation, food, home cooling, home heating this fall. TVA, which provides electricity for most Tennesseans as well as six other States and over 8.8 million people, recently had to increase its wholesale fuel cost.

Mr. Speaker, since we have all been gone, the Glasgow Airport has been bombed, Piccadilly Circus in London was the site of an attempted terrorist attack, another attempt on a hospital, and within 48 hours, the British Intelligence Agency rounded up several credible suspects. Their use of intelligence should be commended. They have faced terrorist attacks on their soil for over 30 years and put in place the tools to deal with these. 
   On the other hand, it seems the liberal leadership of this Congress wants to backtrack in our attempts to track and survey potential terrorists by scaling back our critical intelligence-gathering efforts. 
   They took issue with the program designed to monitor phone calls from potential terrorists. They railed against the PATRIOT Act. They even shifted funds from critical intelligence-gathering programs to put it into a slush fund to study global warming. Mr. Speaker, the last time I checked, global warming didn't have one single thing to do with putting a bomb in Piccadilly Circus or trying to blow up the JFK airport. Global warming didn't bomb the USS Cole or take down the Twin Towers. Climate change can be studied, but it need not be done at the expense of human intelligence needed to help eliminate international terrorism. We need to adjust our priorities. It's time to get to work.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for yielding the time. 
   I find this such an interesting debate every year, Mr. Chairman. You know, as we come down here and debate the budget every year, we do talk about the budget, and it should be a reflection of the priorities of the people of this Nation. And what we see in the budget document that is before us is the priorities of the bureaucracy reflected. Because what we see is a budget document that is going to make spending permanent and tax reductions temporary. 
   Now, one of the things that we all know is that is not what the American people voted for. That is not what they wanted. They did not want to grow spending. They did not want to increase what the Federal Government spent. They did not want to increase the Federal Government's reach into their lives. What they wanted to do was to see that size reduced. But we do have a budget before us that is going to raise taxes $392.5 billion over 5 years. 
   Now, the last time the Democrats were in control in 1993, 1994, they passed what was then the largest tax increase in history, about $240 billion over 5 years; and this year it did not take them but about 3 months to come back and decide they were going to get it while they could. 
   You know, it is baseball season. They were going for a home run. They have earned the moniker of the hold-on-to-your-wallet Congress because America, yes, indeed, can be sure they are coming to a pocket near them as quick as they can get there for a wallet; and they are going to take $2,600 out of every wallet of every one of my constituents in Tennessee, $2,600. 
   And to add insult to injury, our sales tax deductibility, which was restored  in 2003 because we do not have an income tax in Tennessee, thank goodness, we just have a sales tax, that is being taken away in this bill, $1,100 per family, $2,600 total. It is a tax increase.

That subject is the Federal budget. It is something that as we debate issues here, we say it affects 10 percent or 20 percent or 50 percent of the population. Our Federal budget, it affects everyone, Mr. Speaker, and I think we should start this second session of budget school with a little bit of perspective. 
   I have got a copy of the Constitution of the United States, and there is also included in this a Declaration of Independence. Now this copy is small enough to fit into my pocket. I could put it in my jacket pocket and carry it with me all day long. 
   What is a little bit frightening, Mr. Speaker, is here is the phone book for the news media that covers Washington, D.C. We are one of the most covered places on the face of the Earth, and here is the phone book that covers that. 
   Well, I also have the Federal budget. As you can see, it is an enormous document. It is much larger. By the time you have the tables and the justifications and the analytical information and go through the appendix and find what you need, it is a huge document. It is much larger in size than the simple documents on which this great Nation was founded. 
   What we are going to do today is talk a little bit about this budget and talk about what our response should be on behalf of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the time. I am coming to the floor as a  member of the Republican Study Committee. This group of conservatives within the Republican conference have developed this project called ``Budget School'' because we think that it is imperative that the American people know what is in this budget and know where to find this budget and are fully aware of how their money is being spent because we realize it is not the Federal Government's money that is being spent, Mr. Speaker, it is the money of the taxpayers of this great Nation. 
   This evening to open our session as we begin this period of time called special orders which comes at the end of our workday, and Congress has finished its regular business for the day, and it is 5 minutes of 5 in the afternoon here in Washington, and we are moving into the period of time called special orders. It is the period of time when we can come to the floor and talk a little bit more at length about the issues that are very important to us. 
   This evening we have several of our colleagues from the Republican Study Committee that will join me to talk about the budget and their concerns with the increase in spending, the concerns with the increase in taxation and their concerns about the long term fiscal health of this great Nation. 
   I would like to begin our conversation this evening by yielding to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston) to hear his comments on the budget.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. The budget that was presented is over a $3 trillion budget, and it calls for a $683 billion tax increase. And discretionary spending is increased in this budget by $280 billion. So, what I'm hearing the gentleman say, that's not enough. We've already, day two coming back from our Easter district work period, day two we have seen them move forward and increase $20 billion more. 
   And I yield to the gentleman.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. If the gentleman will yield. 
   There are a couple of things that I would point out. I'm sure people are sitting there going, I'm not believing this. I have worked all day long, I work all year, I haven't even finished paying my obligations for my property taxes, my state taxes, my Federal income taxes this year because you have to work until around the first of June to meet your obligations on taxes before you're working for money to take home. 
   So, what I'm hearing him say is, all that increasing, they want you to work further into the year to pay them. Somebody sitting at their desk right now, they're thinking, I can't believe this. If they want to pull down a copy of the budget, here are some Web sites and some resources we would encourage them to use. To get a copy of the President's budget, they can go to whitehouse.gov/omb. To get the Republican response, which our Republican Study Committee was involved in, budget.house.gov/republicans. And to get some of our budget school resources, they can go to house.gov/blackburn. They can also go to YouTube and Face Book and pull some of this information.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. We're going to work through explaining that process this evening because the budget has come through the House and it is going to the Senate, it will come back to conference committee. And we set all of those different, the template, if you will, and then it will go through the appropriations process this year. 
   And I wanted to show this second poster. You were just mentioning about Medicare and Social Security and some of the different functions that are entitlements. And then we also have the areas that are seen as being discretionary. And you were mentioning discretionary spending. And those who want to follow the budget discussion with us can follow these different functions in the budget documents that we had mentioned earlier. 
   And I yield back to the gentleman from Georgia.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. And I'm about to be a grandmother. And I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia's comments about the historical data that is involved in that. And as we look at the budget, and how did this budget get to be so big? That is just so very important. And if you look at the budget, which is what I have right here on the podium in front of me, and you can see it, you can hardly hold it up it's so big, but it comes in sections. This much is just the overview. And I said, that pales in comparison when you look at the small size of our Constitution and our Declaration of Independence. 
   Here's the appendix. And you would get inside this and look for the program that you're talking about with the Department of Agriculture. Then you would come in here to the Analytical Perspectives. This volume is where you would go to look at the analysis that you were just speaking of. And then, here are the historical tables. 
   And Mr. Speaker, this is where our colleagues go to look at where a program was when it started, to trace back through why this program was put in place and go back and see if that program is still aimed toward meeting what it was put in place for, meeting that original mission, how has it changed? And as you're pointing out, so many programs get changed on a regular ongoing basis. You go into the analysis and look at if you think this is worthy, if those are certainly the type data and the type premises on which you want to be operating to fund that budget. You look at this appendix to see how much they decided that they ought to be putting into that budget. 
   So, the gentleman is quite right in explaining how these programs grow, and did they begin to move away from their original mission? That is why some of our colleagues that are joining us this evening have been busy working on fighting waste, fraud and abuse, fighting increased spending, fighting wasteful earmarks, and working for the past few years to raise this issue. 
   And I know the gentleman from Georgia has constituents, and we have the gentleman from Iowa, Ms. Bachmann, who is from Minnesota, Mr. Davis from Tennessee, who are joining us on the floor this evening to talk about this issue and to talk about where we are seeing the movement in this budget. 
   At this time, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) who has worked tirelessly. He was in my freshman class as we made waste, fraud and abuse our freshman class project, and as we have worked to reduce what the Federal Government spends and begin to try to tame this budget and to bring it back in so that it is a friendlier budget for the American taxpayer. 
   And I yield to the gentleman from Iowa.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. 
   And he is exactly right. In 1993, the $240.6 billion tax increase that came  about in 1993 is something that people in this Nation stood up and said we are not going to stand for this.     
   And I appreciate also that the gentleman mentioned Wealth of Nations and made reference to that wonderful work. 
   I think another one that we could add to the reading list of those who are fiscal conservatives is Road to Serfdom, which is a book, and I would commend that, Mr. Speaker, to all of our colleagues, to go back and read that work by a wonderful economist, Friedrich Hayek. And it talks about how, when you tax more and government spends more, and you take more from your people in a Nation, that you're walking on that Road to Serfdom. 
   As the gentleman was saying, we look at the rate of taxations based on our GDP, where we are right now in 2007, and many of us feel like this is too high. We are under 20 percent. 
   This is the CBO long-term outlook for taxation. You can see by looking at the bars, the red one is net interest. Social Security is the purple area. Medicare and Medicaid is the orange area, and then you have all other spending, which is in green. 
   Look at this chart, and look at what happens from 2007 to 2015, where we move above that 20 percent. Look what happens by 2030, when meeting the cost of your entitlements and your interest are going to take all revenue coming in on our current percentage of taxation. And then 2040, look at what happens, when you're spending about 35 percent of your GDP on taxes.

And my hope is that as we work with our colleagues on this budget issue, that we will see these charts level off and then head downward, because Federal spending is far too high. And then you're exactly right; when you add your political subdivisions and the State taxation and spending to that, you do see a different picture. 
   At this point, to talk a little bit more about what we see happening with this budget, I want to yield to the gentlelady from Minnesota (Mrs. Bachmann) who has joined us this year and has jumped right into the discussion of budget and taxation, and does a wonderful job representing our conservative perspective.

   At this time I yield to David Davis, the gentleman from Tennessee who joined us in this House this year. He was in the State Legislature in Tennessee. He knows firsthand how important a low rate of taxation, low and reasonable regulation is to having small businesses grow and develop jobs. And as we all know, there is no economic stimulus as good as a job. And I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee, and as he said, the loss to the economy is something we hear a lot about. 
   Look at this chart. You can see what happened with Federal revenues in 2001, 2002. Look at what happened when we reduced taxes in 2001 and then again in 2003, and look what happened, how we took off with a growth in Federal revenues. It just shows you what happened when you reduce taxes, when the government takes less and allows individuals to make those decisions, what to do with that money. When government doesn't take first right of refusal on so much of that paycheck and allows our constituents to make those choices, you can see there are four straight years of increases there.

   Another of our 108th freshmen who worked making waste, fraud, and abuse our class project as we developed to the wasteful Washington spending and the Washington waste watchers and started shining some light on earmarks and the need to change that practice on wasteful spending, on increased taxation, on programs that may be have outlived their usefulness, and that is the chairman of our Republican Study Committee, Jeb Hensarling of Texas.

And what you're going to find there with some of the line items, as our colleague from Georgia was talking about, is the ag program. That's where you find that information. Then there is analytical and historical data that we look at and what we actually find with our trust fund and with our debt.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, it seems like we have a fact and fiction problem that is taking place right here in the body of the House. It is about SCHIP 2.0 that is coming before us today. Well, here are the facts. SCHIP 2.0 will not prevent illegal immigrants from receiving children's health care benefits. It will not prevent adults from receiving children's health care funding, and it will not prevent the government from crowding out 2 million people from the private health care market. 
   The bill actually covers 400,000 fewer children than SCHIP 1, and it spends 500 million, yes, a half billion dollars more and still leaves out 800,000 eligible children. Yet under SCHIP 2, adults will constitute 10 percent of all SCHIP enrollees in fiscal year 2012 when the program has a major funding problem. Under SCHIP 2.0, 2 million people would lose their health care coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
   Let's get straight on the facts. Let's vote against SCHIP 2.0 and make certain we put the children of the working poor first.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I don't think anyone opposes providing health care for poor children and children of the working poor. That is not what our argument is about today. 
   What we do oppose is having a bill before us that covers 400,000 less kids in SCHIP than previously. We do oppose having a bill that has a funding cliff in 2012 where you just plan to run out of money. Now the question is: Why would you vote for a bill where you plan on having a program fail? 
   Another thing we see in this bill before us, it is going to spend a half billion dollars more than SCHIP version one, and it is going to cover less kids. So there are plenty of reasons to oppose this bill. 
   In addition, you have the issue with illegal immigration. CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, projects that section 211 of this bill will result in spending $3.7 billion in increased spending on health care for this population over the next 10 years. 
   And then you get to the issue of adults. Well, what you are talking about is getting childless adults off the program, not all adults, just childless adults.  
   Madam Speaker, I think we as parents expect our children to grow up and expect them to take responsibility. This is not Never Never Land, and all adults need to be removed from this program. 
   SCHIP, as it was put in place in 1997, is there for poor children, children of the working poor. The list could go on and on. We also know there is a massive redistribution of taxes within this bill. We have all seen those figures. 
   On top of that, you look at what goes to the east coast and it is harming those children in the middle of the country. I oppose the bill.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, we do all know what this debate is about, but I think there is still confusion about the context of this bill and the content of this bill. We have heard our colleagues across the aisle saying that it has to do with supporting health care for disadvantaged children. But, unfortunately, that is not exactly what this bill does. 
   We are all for health care for children of the working poor, but some of the things that this bill is about: It would move a very successful block grant program to an entitlement. It would provide free taxpayer-funded health care to illegal immigrants. It would add more adults than what our own IRS calls high-income families to the government health care rolls. It would remove people from private insurance and put them over on the government rolls. It would, in many cases, replace the doctor-patient relationship with the bureaucrat making the decision. 
   It doesn't live up to its name. It doesn't live up to what it is supposed to do. How do you pay for it? With budget gimmicks. Look at what happens in 2012. Let's show respect for the issue. Take it back. Sustain the President's veto.

   For weeks, they have been taking to the airwaves and talking about anybody that opposes this bill is against disadvantaged children. Well, that's just not what this bill is about. 
   Their bill would change a block grant program to an entitlement; it would provide taxpayer-funded health care to illegal immigrants; it would add more adults and what the IRS calls high-income families to the government health care rolls. It would even remove people from private insurance rolls and place them on the government rolls. And, most important, it's going to move that decision between a doctor and a patient to a bureaucrat. Well, that is what they are for. 
   I suggest that we show respect for the children of the working poor that this bill was initially set up to address, that we sustain the President's veto. Let's start over. Show the issue the respect it deserves.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, in March, the Homeland Security Committee unanimously approved a bill to authorize funding for the Department of Homeland Security for the coming year. It wasn't a perfect bill, but it was one the committee accepted. 
   Now the liberal leadership plans to strip the most critical provisions in the legislation. These are not controversial points that should make my colleagues on the other side of the aisle uncomfortable. Unless, of course, the Democrats do not agree with an increased emphasis on immigration enforcement at the ports or secure biometric identification for aliens captured at sea or critical funding to protect America's food supply. But, as we've all seen since the Democrats took over in January, we know that is the case. 
   But it actually gets worse. The liberal leadership voted against allowing noncontroversial amendments to increase information sharing between DHS and cops on the beat, allowing DHS to investigate Social Security fraud at the workplace, and increased fines of employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill makes a mockery of the democratic process, does nothing extra to secure our borders and will, unfortunately, probably make our Nation less safer.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. We could even call it the Big Government Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. You know, I represent about 70,000 Medicare part D beneficiaries in my district and they deserve low-cost prescription drugs and the option to choose the plans that best suit their needs. 
   Part D plans have produced greater than expected savings and our Medicare beneficiaries appreciate this. They are saving an average of $1,200 annually on their drug costs. Program costs are going to be about $200 billion lower than expected over the next 10 years. And repealing part D noninterference will create drug therapy restrictions found in the Department of Veterans Affairs programs. 
   There is a lot of talk about the Veterans Affairs and comparing that to Medicare. That is like comparing apples and oranges, because the VA is a direct provider of medical services, where Medicare part D is an insurance program for our seniors that allows them to choose to access and to control their health care.

The way Medicare part D is constructed, that is what we have, the opportunity to make those choices, to have that control, to actually have a private insurance. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have had a lot of conversation about the VA and veterans. I would like to point out that comparing Medicare part D and the VA drug program is like comparing apples to oranges, because the VA program is a direct provider of those medical services and part D is an insurance program that is run through private plans, so that our seniors have the options and the ability to choose, to have control over their health care.  
   About 40 percent of Medicare-eligible veterans enrolled in the VA health care are choosing to benefit from the Medicare drug benefit. 
   .It's critical that we protect what seniors value most--access to quality care in their own community; affordability; and choice of their prescription drug plan and pharmacy.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time, and I appreciate the leadership, our House Republican leadership designating the time for us to be able to use today. We want to continue our discussion with the American people and put the emphasis on what has happened since we gaveled in for the 110th session of Congress. 
   It is going to be such an interesting Congress, we know that. There is a lot of work to do, and our constituents are depending on us to get the job done for them. We all look forward to that. We are excited about representing our constituents. 
   What we are not real excited about are some of the things that the majority has pushed forward and the way in which they have gone about it this week. What was to be openness, what was to be transparency, has devolved into a Rules Committee not being put into place, our regular order not being recognized, bills not going to committees, opportunities to amend those bills not being given, and it has made for quite an interesting 54 hours and 48 minutes as of this morning. 
   I am joined by a couple of my colleagues, and they are going to give some of their thoughts. I would like to recognize first, Mr. Davis from Tennessee, who is new to the House this year. He is a Member of the freshman class. He served in the Tennessee General Assembly, and we are so delighted that he did.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee. I welcome his comments. He is on target, Mr. Speaker, and just as he always has been in the General Assembly of Tennessee. Government is not the solution to many problems. Government many times itself causes the problem. 
   We all know that when you have a situation out there that if you put government into that mix to solve that problem, you don't get a private sector or a not-for-profit solution to that problem. You get a taxpayer-funded bureaucracy that is guaranteed to grow, guaranteed to grow, because they never go back to dollar one to build that budget. They go back to what is called baseline budgeting. Baseline budgeting says you take what you had last year and you build on it. 
   I tell you what, one of my constituents the other day, they were talking about this, compounding, and compounding interest in order to build a retirement nest egg, and what a wonderful concept compounding interest is. 
   It came to mind, as he said, you know, that is what the liberals have been doing with that Federal budget. It is compounded spending, because every year you take what you had and you add to it, and you grow it a little more and spending always grows.     
   As the gentleman from Tennessee said, in their PAYGO rules, what they have done is make it easier to raise taxes without you knowing about it, without the American people knowing about it. 
   So the 110th Congress is going to be the hang-on-to-your-wallet Congress, because it is coming at you. They are after your wallet, and they are going to take more and more of your wallet, your money that you have earned, and they are going to give it to the government, to the bureaucrats, to solve your problems in a way you don't want. So hang on, it is coming. 
   But in order to get some help, we have got some great Members here on our side of the aisle who are going to be fighting for the American people every single step of the way. One of those great Members is the former lieutenant governor from the State of Oklahoma, and she joins us this year as a member of the freshman class. She has been such a stalwart for conservative ideas and for helping Oklahoma set its course toward a State that is dynamic, even developed some pretty good football players along the way, and we are absolutely delighted to have the gentlewoman from Oklahoma join us and share her thoughts on her first couple of weeks here in Washington.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentlewoman from Oklahoma, and I thank her for the contribution and the insight that she is bringing. 
   One of the things that we have to realize with legislation that we pass is it is a partnership effort, whether it is the local, the State, and the Federal levels working together. And her expertise, with 16 years of State government, as a legislator, as a lieutenant governor, helping the State chart a new way forward into the 21st century, that is so vital to the work that we do to be certain that we don't gather in the power and keep it here in Washington; that we send it to the States. 
   And the gentlewoman speaks so eloquently of missed opportunities, of wanting to bring that expertise to 
   bear, not only for the benefit of her constituents, but for the benefit of all Americans, to be certain that we respect this Nation, we respect this House, and that we respect the sovereignty which each and every one of us hold so very, very dear. 
   You know, my colleagues have mentioned some of the things that have taken place this week. And as I said at the outset, the Democrats brought forward what would be their 100-hour agenda, and they have talked about the things that they had wanted to pass. And we have heard some in the 5-minute and 1-minute presentations and the speeches on the floor that we have got some creative clock keeping going on around these parts. But, Mr. Speaker, I will tell you, when I was in school in the 1950s and 1960s, they weren't teaching new math, so I just know how to do it the old way. And going by the old clock, it is 54 hours, 48 minutes, as of the time we gaveled in this morning, that had passed off the clock. 
   Now, the American people may be interested to know some of the things that have transpired in this 54 hours, 48 minutes. As I said, this is kind of the hang-on-to-your-wallet Congress, because it is expensive. And what we are seeing that they are doing in the first half of this 100 hours is passing legislation that our small businesses have told us, that the associations that work with many of these small businesses, the chambers, the independent business organizations have said would be crippling to businesses that create three out of every four new jobs in this country. 
   Now, you know, somebody may say, well, that doesn't sound that bad. You know what? When you go back to 2003 and you look at the fact that we have had nearly 7 million new jobs created since 2003, that is a lot of jobs. When you look at the fact that personal wages have increased over 9 percent in the past couple of years, that is a lot of money in the take-home paycheck. Then you see it makes a difference. Creating jobs, creating better jobs, creating 21st century jobs is so vitally important to have a robust economy that is going to work. And the body, the majority chose to pass a minimum wage bill that was an unfunded mandate on small business. 
   Now, I didn't come up with the total of what this is going to cost small business. I went to the Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office says it is going to be $5 billion to $7 billion in unfunded mandates on small businesses to meet this one piece of legislation alone. 
   Now, I tell you, my constituents in Tennessee's Seventh District aren't willing to fork over another $5 billion to $7 billion out of their paychecks. They want first right of refusal on their paychecks. They don't want the Federal Government getting first right of refusal on their paychecks. The Federal Government takes too much as it is. And we all know government doesn't have a revenue problem. Goodness gracious, government has brought in more revenue than ever before in the past couple of years, and it happened because of tax reductions. Government has a spending problem, and it has a spending problem because of programs that have been put in place from the new deal, put in place from the Lyndon Johnson years, programs that have grown and grown and grown and have never been reduced. That is why we have a spending problem. And I have said many years, the bureaucracy in this town is a monument to the Democrats. They are the ones that built it through the 1940s, through the 1950s, through the 1960s, and it is like that plant in Little Shop of Horrors: Feed me, Seymour. Give me more money. It is what it is going to take to keep it going. So it is an expensive, expensive 54 hours, 48 minutes. 
   My colleague from Tennessee mentioned a little bit about the tax and spending, and I pulled an article out of the Wall Street Journal. There again, not the opinion of me, but the opinion of some of those that are watching this process. And he spoke a little bit about making it easier to raise taxes and the provision that was adjusted in the rules package. And I think this is so important for our constituents to know. 
   We have had a rule went into place in 1994 with Speaker Gingrich that provided that a three-fifths majority of the House was required to raise taxes. Well, our friends, our colleagues across the aisle have decided to put a loophole that you could drop that or waive that rule with a simple majority. That is very unfortunate. Very unfortunate. And it is disappointing. 
   The way we are going to reduce the size of government is to reduce the size of spending. And as my colleagues have said, that is what the American people want. Government is too big, too bureaucratic, too arrogant and too unresponsive. We saw it in Katrina. We see it any time we try to get through to a Federal agency and dial a number and  get put on hold and told to punch another number and then told to select a language we want to hear it in. Those are the problems that frustrate every single one of us, and the way we address it is to reduce what government has to spend. As I said, crippling small businesses with the legislation that they have passed, making it easier to raise taxes. 
   Also the majority party refused to acknowledge morally sound proven life-saving stem cell treatments that are going to spend your tax dollars. They are going to spend your tax dollars. American people, I hope you hear this one. They are going to spend your tax dollars on ethically controversial research that has never produced results. That is in our stem cell legislation. And then today we have had a vote on the Medicare part D. They are voting to revamp a very successful, highly popular Medicare part D, has over a 75 percent approval rating, and they have voted to revamp that. 
   And in the midst of all of this, we have Tunagate. And the Speaker had I understand has retracted her comments or has said that she is going to have this provision addressed. But we had the Del Monte Corporation that owns StarKist Tuna involved in this, and it seems that American Samoa is where they have their plant. And, Mr. Speaker, it was brought to our attention that they were exempted from the minimum wage law.     
   We do hope that that is addressed. But I have pulled a sheet, again, not my thoughts but this is coming out of Congress Daily, and I just wanted to read a comment that was in the article discussing this employer from the Speaker's district with the work that they do over in American Samoa with tuna. And they are talking about the competitiveness of the tuna industry and why they don't need a raise in the minimum wage. 
   And it was so very interesting to me because this company and this delegate is saying, well, we don't want the minimum wage raised because it would hurt our competitiveness. Now, I guess, Mr. Speaker that it is fine for Del Monte Corporation or for American Samoa to say that but it is not fine for my small business owners in the Seventh District of Tennessee to say that. It is not fine for small business owners around the country to say that. But I guess the majority thinks it is fine to vote for $5 billion to $7 billion, with a ``b,'' worth of unfunded mandates on small businesses. 
   Now, these were the comments from the delegate from American Samoa today regarding the minimum wage, and I am quoting from Congress Daily: ``The truth is the global tuna industry is so competitive that it is no longer possible for the Federal Government to demand mainland minimum wage rates for American Samoa without causing the collapse of our economy and making us welfare wards of the Federal Government.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, every single business we have in this country is subject to global competition. It does not matter if we are in hardwoods or if we are in softwoods. If we are in hardwoods and producing furniture, we have got global competition. If we are in softwoods and we are producing pulp, we have got global competition. If we are in California growing tomatoes, we have got global competition. If we are a citrus producer and farmer in Florida, we have got global competition. If we are a shrimp farmer in Mississippi, we have got global competition. 
   Mr. Speaker, if it is good for American Samoa not to have a minimum wage, maybe we need to think about what we are doing to other small businesses and small business manufacturers. Do we really, really, really want to pass $5 billion to $7 billion worth of unfunded mandates on the producers of our Nation's jobs, three out of every four jobs, 7 million new jobs in the past couple of years? Mr. Speaker, I would submit to you that that is a failed policy. It is a failed policy. 
   What we need to be doing is continuing to do what the Republicans as a majority did in this House, which was looking after the American taxpayers' pocket and making certain that they kept more of that paycheck at the end of the month; making certain that small businesses enjoyed tax relief, increased expensing, increased opportunities for depreciation; making certain that they had the ability to grow those small businesses and invest in those small businesses because that, Mr. Speaker, is how you grow an economy and that is how you grow jobs. 
   And as I said earlier, we have seen it play out, that when you reduce those taxes, when you leave that money with the taxpayer, they reinvest it, they grow those jobs, and guess what. The Federal Government ends up with more revenues. We had record years in 2005 and 2006 in Federal Government revenues, and it happened because of good tax policy that left more money with the taxpayer. 
   I mentioned also that the Democrats had refused to acknowledge morally sound, proven, lifesaving stem cell treatments and they are wanting to use your tax dollars on controversial treatments. 
   At this time I would like to yield to Dr. WELDON, the gentleman from Florida, who is, indeed, one of our foremost authorities on this issue. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   And if you will yield for a question, I want to be certain that I understood a couple of the comments that you made pertaining to stem cells and pertaining to the research because you have been such a leader on this. And I think we both would commend Dr. Burgess, the gentleman from Texas, who crafted our motion to recommit yesterday and worked diligently on that to be certain that cloning could not possibly take place. 
   But I want to be certain that we are clear on this and my constituents are clear on what you were saying because finding answers to some of the debilitating illnesses that many of our family members and friends have is important to each and every one of us and it is something that we are committed to. 
   And the gentleman has practiced medicine for so many years. I have spent many volunteer hours working on different boards, not for profits, for health care associations, whether it is the Arthritis Foundation or the Lung Association or the Cancer Society, and all of them are interested in this issue. 
   But I want to be certain that I understood you correctly, that according to the Journal of Science, they have documented 25 years' worth of research that has been done on different types of stem cell research and stem cell therapies and that much of this is taking place at the NIH and that we are, indeed, funding much of that research at the NIH. And I think that is important for people to understand.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. This is something that has been funded here. There is funding that is there for the adult stem cell lines, the cord blood lines, and the amniotic fluid lines with the research that was presented last week from the scientists and researchers from Wake Forest and Harvard that are all proven. They are proven with results. 
   I thank the gentleman for the clarification on that and for the excellent work that he does for this body in making certain that the deception is peeled away and people realize where the commitment of the Republicans, the minority in Congress, lie in being certain that we protect the American taxpayers and we protect the morals  and values on which our Nation stands. I thank the gentleman. 
   Now I want to talk about the Medicare vote that took place today. There is a saying when I was growing up, Mr. Speaker, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
   This is a program our seniors will tell us over 75 percent are fine with this. If any of my colleagues were to say I get 75 percent of the vote when I go to the polls, that would be a landslide of monumental, monumental proportions. 
   But they want to take this program and change it for the sake of changing it. They have been asked by the American Legion not to do this, by the ALS Association not to do this. Epilepsy, don't change this, it is working. It is working. 
   The thing that I thought was so unfortunate was with our veterans and changing the pricing and price controls going into place, we have to realize the VA system is very different from the Medicare system. The VA system, it is comparing apples and oranges. The VA system is a direct provision of those health care services. Medicare Part D is an insurance plan, and we know that the prices come down on that. Some States have plans that are under $20 a month. The plan is about $200 billion less than was estimated when it first went into place. 
   So it is so interesting that the Democrats decided they wanted to change this plan. Let me just read some of the quotes from some of the groups that oppose the price controls that were put in place today. Groups that oppose, and I have heard estimates as high as $750 million extra that it is going to cost VA on this plan. Let me read the comments from some of these groups. 
   The American Legion, a group everybody knows, it is a veterans service organization, has nearly 3 million members and yesterday they sent out a letter opposing H.R. 4 asking for a ``no'' vote saying, ``It is not in the best interest of America's veterans and their families.'' 
   Again quoting, ``Every time the Federal Government has enacted pharmaceutical price control legislation, the Department of Veterans Affairs experiences significant increases in its pharmaceutical cost as an unintended consequence.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, those are not my words, those are the words of the American Legion on behalf of the 3 million veterans they represent asking that this not be done. 
   So in addition to passing $5 to $7 billion of unfunded mandates on to the Nation's small businesses, in addition to passing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of extra cost to our shippers because of the homeland security provisions, you also are going to put nearly three-quarters of a billion of extra cost onto the Veterans Administration health services. 
   I tell you what, as I said, Mr. Speaker, this is hang-onto-your-wallet Congress because in the first 54 hours and 48 minutes that is where we have gotten. It is a lot of money, and the tote board just seems to be adding right on up. 
   The ALS Association, Lou Gehrig's disease, voiced strong opposition to H.R. 4 saying, ``Legislation that authorizes the Federal Government to negotiate Medicare prescription drug prices will significantly limit the ability of people with ALS to access the drugs they need, and will seriously jeopardize the future development of treatments for the disease.'' Those are not my words, that is the ALS Association in their opposition to the legislation that this body passed. 
   Epilepsy Foundation, and I am quoting from their letter, ``Access to the right medications for epilepsy can make the difference between living in the community, being employed, and leading a healthy and productive life. The consequences of denying the appropriate medication for an individual with epilepsy can be life threatening and can include injury, emergency room visits, hospitalization or other types of costly medical interventions.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that is the Epilepsy Foundation asking that the bill the majority passed today, H.R. 4, not pass because of the implications for those who suffer with epilepsy in securing the medications that they need. 
   Now here is the National Alliance for Mental Illness. They have had reservations and concerns about this legislation. I am quoting from their letter, ``NAMI is extremely concerned that placing this new legal mandate on the secretary would directly result in loss of the all or substantially-all guidance in the six protected classes and therefore poses a significant risk to Medicare beneficiaries with mental illness.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, these again are not my words. They are concerns that have been expressed. They have been expressed by individuals that were concerned about what they saw happening in the first 100 hours in this administration. 
   What people thought they were going to see was transparency. They thought they were going to see openness. They thought they were going to see a willingness to step towards bipartisanship. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that what we have seen is missed opportunities. We have seen a closed process. The Rules Committee has not functioned. Legislation has gone straight to the floor. No debate in committee. No open process, and that has been unfortunate for the people of this Nation. 
   As I close, I will once again say that one of the things that does concern us is the impact on the American taxpayer and figuring out who is going to pay for this. Mr. Speaker, it does appear, it absolutely does appear that it is going to be the American taxpayer that is going to see government grow, government expand and government is going to continue to expand in the 110th Congress.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona. 
   And while I have the utmost respect for the chairman, I disagree with him on this resolution and I do rise to oppose the resolution today. 
   I guess I don't like the rhetoric of defeat. And I think that if we look at the situation in Iraq and if we look at the global war on terror, we have to ask ourselves: If we accept defeat at the hands of the terrorists, then what type message are we going to send? And I don't think that we would like that. Because if we pull out now, it is going to say that the U.S. is weak in the war on terror. It is going to say that we accept roving death squads in the streets of Baghdad, that we accept ethnic cleansing and a region engulfed in all-out chaos. That is the message we send. Just as when we were children, our actions carry a message with them. 
   Our soldiers deserve the confidence of their leaders, and not second-guessing by politicians that are a half world away. I think that they need to know that we are with them. 
   I had a message from a Marine parent. And they said, You know, we have our men out there fighting every day. They are using all the tools available to them. They are in combat. They are in patrols. They are using technology to stabilize, to train Iraqi troops. Then at night they come home, they come back to that post, that forward operating base, and they hammer out e-mails and blogs to those of us here to help combat the rhetoric coming out of Washington, DC. 
   General Petraeus, Ambassador Crocker have a plan, the Baghdad Security Plan. We find out now much of Baghdad is more secure than it was. Most of the troops to carry out this plan just landed, just got there 2 weeks ago to start implementing the plan. I think that for us to second-guess is inappropriate. I think that it may be the fashionable thing to want to pull out.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, today we will see another attempt by the liberal majority leadership to drive a stake between the American people and the brave men and women fighting in the global war on terror. Today's latest attempt is called a precipitous withdrawal. The American people would label it a cut and run. Our soldiers deserve the confidence of their leaders, not second-guessing arrogance by politicians half a world away. 
   The leadership thinks Iraq is lost, despite the fact that the new mission has shown signs of progress, including the fact that half of Baghdad has been secured, the Baghdad Security Plan. General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are going to provide us a progress report in September, but that is not fast enough for the liberal leadership. They expected the new strategy to win overnight. Don't they know that you don't find instant gratification in war? 
   One thing is certain: surrender and failure in securing Iraq hold catastrophic consequences for freedom, the U.S., and the Iraqi people. Surrender would send the wrong message. It will say the U.S. is weak, that roving death squads in the streets of Baghdad and ethnic cleansing are acceptable to us. It may be fashionable to want to pull out of Iraq, but it sends the wrong message.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia not only for his leadership on this issue of our Nation's security, but for his work on the Truth Squad as he always repeats the phrase, everyone's entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts. 
   That is so pertinent, Mr. Speaker, to the debate that we are having on our Nation's security. There is no issue that trumps the security issue. This is something that we know to be very important. 
   As I travel the country and as I travel my district, what I hear from people is, Why are you not taking this up? Why are you not taking the steps to make certain that we can find out who is trying to harm us? 
   You know, Mr. Speaker, it makes no sense at all. As I talk with moms that are in my district so regularly, they will talk about how concerned they are with security, security in our communities, security in our places of work, security in our children's schools. They want to make certain that the security to live peacefully is there for us here in our homeland. 
   They want to be certain that those protections are there for our troops who are deployed; and at this very minute, I have troops from Fort Campbell, which is in my district in Tennessee, and troops who are National Guardsmen from Tennessee who are deployed making certain that American interests are safe and making certain that Americans in our great Nation are also safe to live their lives freely in pursuit of happiness every single day. 
   Mr. Speaker, I find it absolutely revolting and unsettling that the leadership of this House continues to stand in the way of the Protect America Act. Our colleagues in the Senate have decided this is a very important issue. We all know what happens when you set aside work. You have to kind of pick it up off the table and move it over and say, we are going to come back to that, and we are going to get those items accomplished. But first and foremost, let's deal with the Nation's security. 
   So they put that on the desk. They made it the priority. They took it up and they said, it is not a partisan issue. We are going to find agreement on this because the security of this Nation trumps it all. The security trumps it all. 
   Now, if we wanted to go play the ostrich game or if we wanted to go play  Whack-a-Mole with the terrorists, we could do that. We could just rely on the 1978 FISA and pretend that we never had e-mail, that we never had cell phones, that we didn't have voice video and data just traveling on the waves through the air. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, that would be nice and make us feel good and comfortable, but the point is, it is not true. It just isn't true. And as the gentleman from Georgia has so eloquently said, we know, we know that the terrorists are using these new technologies to communicate, and we know that there are terrorists in foreign countries who are communicating with other terrorists in foreign countries who are trying to do harm to our troops in the field. We have evidence of that, Mr. Speaker. To our citizens in this country, we have evidence of that and to our citizens and our allies around the globe. 
   Well, what is so difficult to understand about this, Mr. Speaker? It just seems like when the evidence is there, as the facts are there, as my colleague from Georgia says, why can there not be an admission that those are the facts, they are the givens, everybody, everybody in D.C. seems to agree with this except the leadership of this body. And I find it very disconcerting.

That means that all of these new forms of communication that are out there, this is what the terrorist cells are using. Half of what we know comes from electronic surveillance, and get this, and the outdated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act had degraded those intercepts by two-thirds. 
   I just find it so egregious that we would hamstring and make it difficult for the intelligence community to carry out their jobs when they are seeking to serve this Nation, when they are seeking to work with the military and to make certain that we know who is seeking to do us harm.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The gentleman from Georgia is so right in what he is pointing out. What we're spending our time doing here are items that are not crucial, they're policy debates. They're policy debates about how you want to approach an issue. My goodness, the Government Reform Committee and my committee, Energy and Commerce, we have had hearings on steroids in pro sports. Now, we had plenty of time to parade people in and do these hearings, but we didn't have the time for FISA. We've had plenty of time to have committee hearings. Today, we were in Committee on Energy and Commerce on tobacco, and if we wanted the FDA, who already cannot keep the Nation's food supply  safe, they can't keep the Nation's drug supply safe, but we were spending time on that instead of putting time on FISA. 
   Now, as a mother, you know that children are going to put off to the very end doing the hardest thing. So, what you do when you're a mom is to say, no, we're going to do the hard things first. When we're doing homework, we're going to do the hard problems first, we're going to write the hard papers first because you get it out of the way. And then you know that regardless of how much time is left, you've attended to the things that are going to have the greatest impact. 
   Now, that is the way the leadership of this House needs to move forward. They need to go back and learn a Kindergarten lesson. They need to go back and think about what they learned there. You do the hard things first. 
   FISA is a difficult bill. We are pleased that there are some issues that take a lot of work, that we have to work to build consensus, that we have to look carefully and study these; the Nation benefits and our constituents benefit by that. But to put it off, to choose to not address it, to leave it at the back of the line for partisan political gain is dead wrong.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, this is quite a debate that we are having tonight, and I appreciate the vigor and the energy that colleagues on both sides are bringing to this debate. 
   Mr. Chairman, I do have to stand and really oppose some of the things that are being said here. How interesting it is that we are hearing spending reductions called irresponsible, that we are hearing that it is jeopardizing our foreign operations, that it is devastating. 
   You know, what we may want to do is reframe this debate. I want to commend the gentleman from Georgia for trying to make a 1 percent reduction. 
   Now we heard this referred to as the Matthew 25 bill. Maybe we should make it the Genesis 1:1 bill and go back and look at the beginning and talk about how did we get where we are today. 
   They want to talk about deficits. Well, it is historically what my colleagues on the left have done to grow a huge bureaucracy that continues to need to be fed and programs that grow and grow and grow. 
   Now one of the things that we have heard is that we are going to have to fix this now. My colleagues only want to talk about today, yesterday or the day before. They don't want to go back and talk about previous administrations where we have piled on, we have piled on, we have piled on, and now we want to grow this budget 9 1/2 percent. We want to pay for it with the largest tax increase in history. 
   I would offer to my friends that, yes, indeed, let's go back and make it a Genesis 1:1 bill and look at the very beginning. You tax too much; you spend too much. And it is right that we would choose to find a 1 percent reduction. What we are irresponsible to is the American taxpayer who is sick and tired. They are truly ill and fatigued when it comes to paying more and more of their budget.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Virginia. 
   Mr. Chairman, as I said, what an incredibly wonderful debate we are having. It is a philosophical debate. Government is not the answer. Government many times is the problem. More spending is not the answer. It is priorities and where you choose to put that money. That is where you find your answers in this. 
   Now one of the things that we are saying is make a reduction. My goodness, look at the States. Many of our States have made across-the-board reductions. You know what? Across-the-board reductions work. 
   My State of Tennessee, oh, my goodness, we were going to have to have an income tax. Oh, my goodness, they were going to shut down every program in the State, had to have it, had to raise taxes. You know what? We defeated that income tax, Mr. Chairman. The people of our State said, no, we have had it. We are not putting another penny into the State treasury. 
   Now what we see is a, believe it or not, Democrat Governor who came in and took what we Republicans had said and made across-the-board cuts. Not 1 percent. Not 2. Not 5 percent. 9 1/2 percent. 9 1/2 percent. And I would encourage my colleagues to know that greater efficiencies were there, that they now have record surpluses. 
   One of the things that we have to realize, the American taxpayer is tired of sending money to Washington and see it go into a bureaucracy and know that they are not seeing the results that they get. 
   Mr. Chairman, maybe it is because I have the old Davy Crockett district. I know that what you have to do is be very careful with the money that you have to spend. You have to make priorities. 
   And yes, indeed, national security is a priority. We know that. We know that border security is a priority. We know that. But what we have to realize is we have to be a good steward of the taxpayer dollar. 
   Maybe it is time for the bureaucracy to start to tighten its belt. Maybe it is time for the bureaucracy to realize it cannot grow. Maybe it is time for the bureaucracy to realize we need to be responsible to the taxpayer and reduce what we are spending at the Federal level. They are tired of paying for the largest tax increase in history. They know that government spends too much. They know that this budget is bigger than it ought to be, and they don't like it, and we are hearing about it. 
   What my colleagues and I are saying is, you know what, let's find some ways to make some reductions. Let's make certain that we are good stewards of every dollar that comes our way.

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, well, here we are again. Another day, another several billion dollars in new spending proposed by this ``Hold Onto Your Wallet'' Congress. They have already passed the largest tax increase in history, and they spend too much money. 
   Today's tax du jour comes in the form of the Foreign Ops bill. The bloated 2008 spending bill will fork over $34 billion of your tax money, an increase of more than $3 billion. A subtle change means that under the current bill language, t he Mexico City policy, which assures that nongovernmental entities that promote abortion would not be provided U.S. funding, could be completely disregarded and these entities would receive U.S. taxpayer funds. 
   The provision would mandate U.S. subsidies to organizations that actively promote abortion in foreign nations. Abortion has been a tragedy for many women here in the U.S., and it will carry with it the same hurt and trauma when it's used abroad. 
   If this language stays in the bill, the America n taxpayer would be actually paying for an abortion for someone half  a world away. I urge my colleagues to vote against new spending and ``no'' for taxpayer-sponsored abortions.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BLACKBURN. (AHMADINEJAD AND COLUMBIA -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>

   Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, you know, there is quite a bit of disgust with what is taking place in New York City today with Ahmadinejad at Columbia University. There is disgust also with the United Nations. And rightfully so. And we are hearing from our constituents about this. 
   And then to top it off, the New York Times, who for 2 weeks denied that they gave special price breaks to moveon.org for the liberal group's ad attacking General Petraeus, finally yesterday through their public editor or their ombudsman had to come clean with the truth. 
   Yes, indeed, moveon.org should have paid $142,000 for that ad, but somehow it was cut in half. The reduced price was a mistake, they said, and they admitted they had violated their own advertising policy of barring attacks of a personal nature. Two pretty glaring mistakes, don't you think? 
   The Times claims it is not a poster child for the liberal media, but in the recent admission that sometimes reporters had fabricated stories while management cut a deal to a liberal attack group and violated their own ethics, well, as my grandmother would say, their little actions sure are speaking a lot louder than their words. Bless their little hearts.
