<DOCNO>Mr. KUHL of New York. (HONORING SOUTHCO AS ROLE MODEL -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the special environmental achievements of a vibrant small business located in my district. 
   Southco, a manufacturer of access hardware, has reduced the amount of hazardous waste it generates from more than 3,200 pounds in 2002 to zero just 3 years later in 2005. Through systematic changes in their manufacturing process, they have completely ceased producing hazardous waste. 
   Moreover, Southco has committed to reducing its consumption of electricity by 15 percent over the next 3 years. Clearly Southco is a role model for our Nation's businesses when it comes to preserving our precious resources. There is a lot of talk about environmental conservation and energy independence, but through innovative thinking, Southco has delivered tangible results in the private sector and provided an excellent example. 
   This month, the Environmental Protection Agency has made Southco a member of its National Environmental Performance Track Program, designed to honor leaders who have demonstrated a commitment to reducing their negative impact on the environment. 
   I would like to personally thank Southco for being an excellent corporate citizen. 
   Madam Speaker, Southco is a leader in these efforts, and deserves our praise for its forward-thinking, socially conscious practices.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Walk. 
   Throughout the year, kidney walks will be held nationwide. Specifically, in my congressional district, a kidney walk will be held on June 9, this Saturday, at Eldridge park in Elmira, New York. 
   Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 20 million Americans; and, tragically, 80,000 people die each year from the disease. Additionally, in 2006, 17,000 kidney transplants were performed, yet more than 70,000 people are on the national waiting list for a kidney transplant. 
   The purpose of the kidney walk is to encourage Americans to educate themselves about early detection and prevention of kidney disease and to promote awareness of organ donation. The walks are for a good and a very important cause, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, it seems that every day we read about gas and diesel prices hitting a new record high as the pain at the pump continues to ravish hard-working Americans of their hard-earned money. The once nightmare scenario of $4 a gallon gasoline may soon become an even harsher reality. 
   While we have sat patiently and waited for Speaker Pelosi's commonsense solution, the cost of gas has soared $1.05 since the Democrats took the gavel. This increase represents more than a 43 percent jump in old prices. Enough is enough. 
   I'm sure that I'm not the only Member of Congress listening to their constituents worry about the consequences of the majority's inaction on energy legislation. And while our constituents cannot afford to drive to work or take their children to school, Democrats have voted four times to raise energy taxes in the 110th Congress. 
   Higher energy taxes mean higher gas prices, something that our constituents do not want or need. 
   It is time for Speaker Pelosi to fulfill her promise to the American people. Instead of voting to increase taxes again, Congress should immediately adopt legislation which will give America lower energy prices without raising taxes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, for the last several years my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee have worked to renew, and indeed improve, the Higher Education Act. 
   Last Congress, we passed H.R. 609, the College Access and Opportunity Act, which made important reforms to the Pell Grant program, the Perkins loan program, and provided more accountability in the area of college costs. Unfortunately, the Senate was not able to act, and the legislation died.     
   This Congress, the House has passed the reforms to address some of the problems that have arisen in the student loan industry and has passed legislation that made changes to the mandatory spending programs under the Higher Education Act through the reconciliation process. As of yesterday, the Senate has passed both the reconciliation bill and the Higher Education Act reauthorization bill. 
   The latest extension of the Higher Education Act expires on July 31, 2007. Today, we are passing another extension through October 31, 2007. It is my hope that the House will soon renew the remaining Higher Education Act, but in the meantime Congress must once again act to extend this bill, which we have done so previously on several occasions with bipartisan support. So today I rise in support of legislation to do so once again.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an issue that concerns all of us, and that is railroad safety. 
   On Tuesday night, there was a train derailment near my congressional district in East Rochester, Monroe County, New York. Fortunately, no one was injured. There have been dozens of other derailments in New York: Recently, on December 28 along route 15 in Gang Mills, in which cars were carrying butane. 
   According to an online Federal Railroad Administration database, defective tracks have been the number one cause of train derailments since 1996 in New York and Monroe County. 
   Madam Speaker, I understand the role of railroads and the importance they serve in transporting goods and people across the country. As a member of the House Transportation Committee which oversees the railroad industry, I firmly believe that Congress must provide more thorough oversight of this industry. 
   Furthermore, I believe that Congress, CSX, and the Federal Railroad Administration and the Department of Environmental Conservation must work together to identify what must be done to avoid similar disasters in the future. 
   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to create a safer, more efficient rail system for everyone.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 215, which would support the designation of a week as National Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Automated External Defibrillator Awareness Week. 
   I would first like to thank my colleague, Mr. Boren from Oklahoma, for joining me in introducing I this resolution and for his efforts in promoting CPR. I am truly grateful for his leadership and support on this issue. 
   I introduced this legislation because I believe that we must do all we can to bolster our efforts to combat heart disease and sudden cardiac arrest, as heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Approximately 325,000 coronary heart disease deaths occur outside of the hospital or in an emergency room every year, and roughly 95 percent of sudden cardiac arrest victims die before even reaching a hospital. These statistics serve as a clear reminder that we must take action to save lives at the local and community levels, and this resolution helps to do just that. 
   CPR more than doubles a victim's chances of surviving sudden cardiac arrest by maintaining the vital flow of blood to the heart and the brain. Over 75 percent of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur within the home, so CPR can mean the difference between life and death.  
   Additionally, automated external defibrillators are easy for even bystanders to operate and are highly effective in restoring a normal heart rhythm if used within minutes after the onset of sudden cardiac arrest. Communities with comprehensive AED programs have achieved survival rates of over 40 percent. 
   I am proud to have sponsored the New York State law that required public schools to have at least one such device on school grounds. As a State Senator, I worked with State Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg to advance this initiative after a young man from his area, on Long Island, by the name of Louis Acompora died from a blunt impact to the chest while playing lacrosse. Had an AED been available at the time, his life might have been saved. Thankfully, our efforts have helped to save over 35 lives in New York State in the five years since the law's enactment. 
   The American Heart Association, the American Red Cross, and the National Safety Council are preparing related public awareness and training campaigns to be held during the first week of June, and I am pleased to support this bill as a framework for their efforts. 
   This resolution will help us to save lives across the country and combat heart disease at the community level. I urge my colleagues to join myself and Mr. Boren in supporting H. Con. Res. 215.

   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, for the past 30 year, Norm ``Jack'' Snow has been a familiar face in the town of Milo, Yates County, New York, serving as councilman for 12 years before moving into the supervisor position for the last 18 years. Jack has offered his strength, his courage, his convictions to the town of Milo. He announced his retirement at the beginning of this year, much to the dismay of the people he represents. 
   A native of upstate New York, Jack grew up on a dairy farm walking one mile to a one-room schoolhouse, in which he jokes was ``uphill both ways.'' Jack didn't grow up dreaming of politics but decided he could make a difference in the community that he loved. Besides his 30 years of public service, Jack is an active member in the community serving as the President of the Shrine Club, which enables 700 school children from around the State to attend the Shrine Circus each year. 
   Jack cites that the reason he stayed in politics for 30 years was because of the terrific people he worked with every day. But it was us who were blessed to work with Jack, and more importantly, blessed to know him. I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.

The memorials beneath the Capitol steps honor the sacrifices made by the brave men and women who wore the uniform and put their country before themselves. They came from farms and cities, from mountains and villages, and from lives of privilege and lives of poverty. They each answered the call when their Nation needed them most. These men and women represented the best  America had to offer, and they served their country with pride, with honor, and with courage. 
   Next Monday is Memorial Day. It is a day to remember and honor those men and women who have given their lives for their country. It's a day to cherish and pray for those currently serving their country at home and abroad. 
   Support for our troops must always be an American issue and never a partisan one as our Nation's heroes are defending each one of our rights as American citizens. We must do what is best for veterans and active soldiers, not what's best for a sound bite, political propaganda, or election year politics. These are our Nation's heroes, and we must never let our fellow Americans forget their bravery and their sacrifices.

   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of National Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Automated External Defibrillator Awareness Week, quite a handle. It commenced just 2 days ago on Sunday and lasts until Saturday. 
   Last year, I introduced legislation to support designating this first week of June as National CPR and AED Awareness Week, and I am pleased that Congress passed my proposal to help bring an important issue to light. 
   Heart disease continues to be--and I repeat that--heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States. So I believe that we must do all we can to bolster our efforts to combat heart disease and sudden cardiac arrest.

   Communities with comprehensive AED programs have achieved survival rates of over 40 percent, as opposed to 5 percent, which is the traditional rate of survival. And I am proud to have sponsored the New York State law that required public high schools to have at least one such device on the school grounds. 
   As a state senator, I worked with my colleague, Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg, Long Island, who advanced this initiative after a young man named Louis Acompora from Northport, Long Island, died from a blunt impact to the chest while playing lacrosse.

And the National Safety Council is also offering a free online course of CPR and AED training all week long. This week, as a result of their efforts, it is our hope to train over 100,000 Americans in CPR and AED treatment opportunities. And Americans will have the opportunity to learn to combat heart disease at the community level and hopefully save lives all across the country. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this week, Mr. Speaker, it's a very important initiative.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, it is with honor and pleasure that I rise to recognize Corporal Jason L. Dunham, United States Marine Corps. Corporal Dunham will posthumously receive our Nation's highest award for valor tomorrow, on January 11, 2007, from our 43rd President, George W. Bush. 
   Corporal Dunham grew up in my congressional district in Scio, New York. He was known for his prowess in basketball, baseball and soccer at Scio Central School. He was also well known throughout the entire community, not just for the good-natured pranks that he pulled but for being a young man of enthusiastic yet humble spirit, someone who genuinely cared for others and could always be counted on if someone was in need. 
   He enlisted in the Marine Corps in July of 2000, because the Marines were known to have the toughest training but also the strongest brotherhood. He also felt a personal challenge to complete basic training and to do it well. 
   Following his first duty assignment with the Marine Corps security forces in Kings Bay, Georgia, Corporal Dunham was assigned to the Fourth Platoon, K Company, Third Battalion, Regimental Combat Team 7, First Marine Division. 
   Having quickly proven himself as a capable and concientious leader, Corporal Dunham was assigned as a squad leader and therefore was entrusted with the training, welfare and the lives of nine American sons. He soon earned the reputation for his unwavering commitment to his fellow Marines. He had a caring, a respectful and a humane style of leadership and believed above all in leadership by example. 
   On April 14, 2004, while conducting a reconnaissance mission in the town of Karabilah in Al Anbar Province, Corporal Dunham and his men heard rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire erupting two kilometers to the west. Their battalion commander's patrol had been ambushed while en route to visit L Company at Camp Husaybah right on the Syrian border. 
   Realizing that his unit was in a position to assist, Corporal Dunham ordered the vehicles of his combined anti-armor team to link up with his dismounted squad and advance towards the engagement to provide reinforcement. 
   Upon reaching the sight of the ambush, they were quickly barraged with enemy fire. Corporal Dunham ordered the vehicles to dismount and led one of his fire teams into the village to neutralize the ambush. 
   After having moved several blocks south into the village, they discovered seven Iraqi vehicles in a column attempting to depart to the east. Corporal Dunham ordered his Marines to block their movement and check the vehicles for insurgents. 
   As he approached the second vehicle in the column, an insurgent leaped out and attacked Corporal Dunham. In the ensuing hand-to-hand struggle, Corporal Dunham wrestled the Iraqi insurgent to the ground and immediately noticed that the insurgent was holding a live grenade. 
   Corporal Dunham alerted his fellow Marines and, aware of the imminent danger but without hesitation, he removed his helmet and covered the grenade, absorbing the brunt of the explosion and shielding the fellow Marines from a blast in a selfless act of bravery that most certainly saved the lives of a minimum of two of his Marines. 
   By his undaunted courage, intrepid fighting spirit and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of certain death, Corporal Dunham gallantly gave his life for his country, thereby reflecting great credit upon himself and upholding the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service. 
   Corporal Jason L. Dunham epitomizes the selfless devotion to duty that our young men and women have displayed time and time again in Iraq and Afghanistan, Africa and numerous other places around the world. Our Nation is blessed to have a military full of Corporal Dunhams who are serving with great distinction. 
   My heart certainly goes out to his family, to the townspeople of his hometown, Scio, New York, and the Marines, for they have lost one of America's finest.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, on Friday of this past week, New York's Governor, Eliot Spitzer, announced his immigration policy, which allows immigrants, including those entering the country illegally, to obtain driver's licenses. This decision solidifies the need for more aggressive immigration legislation in these United States. 
   Why are we rewarding the people who are coming here illegally at the expense of others who are law-abiding citizens? 
   Inviting potential terrorists into the State and allowing them to drive whenever they wish undermines the preventive measures that protect our country from national security threats. 
   Let's not forget that September 11, 2001, hijackers had at least 35 licenses which helped them to rent cars and open bank accounts. 
   In addition, it will wreak havoc on our social services programs and create a massive flooding of illegal immigrants to New York State, straining our resources in our schools and our hospitals. 
   We need real immigration legislation that strengthens our borders and does not diminish our national security by granting more privileges to those who have entered this country illegally.

   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5563 and to thank Chairman Miller and Chairwoman McCarthy for their efforts, including a motion to recommit that I offered to H.R. 2857, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act. 
   Last week on March 6, I offered the motion to recommit to strengthen H.R. 2857 and the national service laws. Recently, the corporation for national community service completed a rule-making process to institute background checks for any individual seeking Federal-funded national service positions within the Senior Companion and Foster Grandparents program and within AmeriCorps programs in which individuals have recurring access to children, the elderly or, individuals with disabilities. That rule-making process also prohibited individuals from serving in those positions if they were and are registered sex offenders. 
   While the motion to recommit will codify the corporation's regulations, it will also expand on the corporation's effort by requiring criminal history checks for any individual seeking a federally funded national service position and not just those within the foster grandparents and senior companion programs or just those AmeriCorps programs dealing with specific populations. 
   Further, in addition to prohibiting registered sex offenders from serving in federally funded national service positions, the motion to recommit includes those individuals convicted of murder as well. 
   Again, I applaud Chairman Miller and appreciate his courtesies last week on the floor and Chairwoman McCarthy for including the motion to recommit which expresses a loud and clear message, that this House of Representatives believes that those in need who are served by programs supported with assistance under these laws should be assured that they will not be placed in harm's way when approaching these programs for help. 
   Although I am pleased that the motion to recommit was included in the bill, I'm disappointed that the House majority has chosen not to take up the FISA amendments. The FISA amendments, which we've been hearing about all day, act to provide our intelligence community with the critical tools it needs to conduct surveillance on foreign terrorists without getting tied up in court. 
   The Senate, as we all know, passed this bipartisan legislation almost a month ago. So I urge the majority to bring this crucial bill up for a vote; and, again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill today before this House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4926, the Josh Miller Helping Everyone Access Responsive Treatment in Schools Act of 2008. Also, fortunately, we refer to it as the Josh Miller HEARTS Act. 
   This legislation would authorize the United States Secretary of Education to make grants to public and private elementary and secondary public schools to purchase automated external defibrillators, also known as AEDs, for school grounds and to train employees and volunteers on how to use these devices, which have saved thousands of lives all over the country. 
   An AED is a portable, computerized medical device that can check a person's heart rhythm to determine whether he or she is in cardiac arrest and having a heart attack. It can recognize a rhythm that requires an electronic shock and advise a rescuer when a shock is needed.     
   The AED uses voice prompts, lights, and text messages to tell the rescuer the precise steps he or she needs to take to operate the device. 
   Just as hundreds of students have found out, it is an extremely accurate and easy device to use. As such, the device is widely credited for saving hundreds of lives a year. 
   I firmly believe that expanding the availability of AEDs in schools will save the lives of thousands of students and teachers, and so I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Sutton) for taking a leadership role on this vital issue and for introducing this important bill. 
   This effort is a deeply personal one to me, as I have been involved in the effort to install AEDs in public and private elementary and secondary schools since before I came to Congress. 
   When I was in the New York State Senate, I heard about a young man who Mr. Yarmuth mentioned earlier by the name of Louis Acompora from Northport, Long Island. Louis was playing lacrosse at Northport High School. Like many high school students across the country, he played sports every day. He did exactly what he was trained to do, he blocked a shot on goal with his chest. Unfortunately, it was the wrong time, and after receiving the blunt impact to the chest, Louis went into cardiac arrest and died from that particular blow, a syndrome that affects healthy young athletes as a result of low energy, non-penetrating blows to the chest. 
   If an AED had been available on the field at the time, perhaps Louis's mother and father would not have watched him die on the field. 
   In response to this tragic event, I worked with my colleague, then State Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg, to introduce legislation that required all public schools in New York State to have at least one AED on the school grounds. Fortunately, the State legislature adopted this law, and as a result, I am proud to say that 38 lives in New York schools have been saved since its passage back in 2002. 
   As I said on the floor last week in support of the first annual CPR and AED Awareness Week, communities with comprehensive AED programs have achieved survival rates of over 40 percent where the normal survival rate is roughly 5 percent. 
   With this in mind, I believe schools are the logical place to put defibrillators since as many as 20 percent of the community population passes through its school's doors on a daily basis. 
   This bill would require that local educational agencies that receive a grant under the program to provide at least 25 percent match from non-Federal sources. It ensures that local paramedics and other emergency services personnel are notified regarding where the actual AED is located on the school grounds in case they ever have to respond to a situation on the school campus. 
   H.R. 4926 is an important piece of legislation that will help save lives all across the country. I compliment Ms. Sutton again on her leadership role on this issue, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1243, recognizing the immeasurable contributions of fathers in the healthy development of children, supporting responsible fatherhood, and encouraging greater involvement of fathers in the lives of their children, especially on Father's Day. 
   Pope John Paul XXIII once stated: ``It is easier for a father to have children than for children to have a real father.'' The truism of those words is exceedingly relevant today. 
   The presence of two committed, involved parents contributes directly to better academic importance, reduced substance abuse, less crime and delinquency, fewer emotional and other behavioral problems, less risk of abuse or neglect, and lower risk of teen suicide. 
   The research is clear, fathers factor significantly in the lives of their children. There is simply no substitute for the love, involvement, and for the commitment of a responsible father. 
   Fathers today have a responsibility to set aside quality time with their children, such as attending their children's school events, games and activities. They also involve their children in their lives and the adult world by taking them to work, or taking them along when the car needs to be repaired, or involving them in decisions that affect the family. 
   As advisors and role models, fathers help their children to understand the difference between right and wrong and to recognize how the decisions they make today can affect the rest of their lives.     
   Fathers instill important values and prepare their children for challenges and opportunities ahead by demonstrating true leadership. Their love and their devotion inspire the future generation of Americans to achieve their dreams, and demonstrate their true spirit of our country. 
   A father is one of the most important influences in a child's life. And on Father's Day, and every day, we honor our fathers who celebrate this special bond between a father and a child. 
   And so as fathers and children all across the country prepare this Sunday to mark that special day in which fathers are honored for all they do, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution. 
   Father's Day celebrations are a time of great happiness and family bonding. Many families will try to escape for a day, perhaps taking a trip to a favorite landmark or to the ball park, building precious memories for dad and children alike. 
   Unfortunately, for many families, these joyous celebrations will not be an option this year. With the price of gasoline reaching $4.02 per gallon just recently, for the first time in history, Americans are struggling to put fuel in their cars. They're struggling to make everyday purchases. And they're sacrificing the types of celebrations that would normally mark the occasion of Father's Day. 
   Although the majority has thus far refused to unveil its long-promised plan to bring down the price of gasoline, Republicans are not willing to stand by while our families suffer. That's why we've offered a plan of our own to increase production here at home, thereby creating American jobs, while also encouraging the development of energy alternatives and promoting conservation. 
   We owe it to the American families, including the fathers, who just want to be able to spend quality time with their children, to finally deliver solutions to the current energy crisis. We need to bring down the price of energy sources that fuel our lives. 
   I would like to reserve the balance of my time at this point, Mr. Speaker.

   Preventable injuries and death can also take place in the home, on the job, while driving, or really almost anywhere as we all know. That is why it is so important that we take the time to support efforts to promote safety in all aspects of life. 
   The National Safety Council is just such an organization with a vision of making our world safer. The mission of the National Safety Council is to educate and influence people to prevent accidental injury and death. 
   The council was founded in 1913 and chartered by Congress in 1953. It is the only organization promoting safety in the workplace, in the transportation arena, and in homes and in communities. Members of the council include 18,600 companies of all sizes from a broad spectrum of industries representing 33,300 locations and about 8.5 million employees around the world. 
   I appreciate the work of the National Safety Council along with that of employers, schools and community leaders, and all Americans who are working to make safe environments. 
   Later today, in just a couple of minutes, we will consider another bill under suspension that promotes safety, the Josh Miller HEARTS Act, which will help to place automated external defibrillators in schools around this country. 
   I am proud to stand in support of these and other efforts to promote safety, prevent injury and to protect the lives and the well-being of Americans. However, Mr. Speaker, I'm a little disappointed that we are not taking this opportunity today to promote another type of well-being for our citizens, their economic well-being. Over the weekend, our Nation reached a dubious milestone. The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline has now topped $4. This once-unthinkable figure has become the new norm unfortunately, wreaking havoc on the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans.     
   From filling the tank, to filling the shopping cart, Americans are being crushed by the high price of energy and its ripple effect on our economy. Our constituents are crying out for help. But to date, this Congress has refused to embrace the comprehensive energy solutions needed to wean our Nation from its dependence on foreign oil. 
   Republicans have proposed an energy plan that incorporates all the critical elements of energy independence and freedom. We are supporting the production of American-made energy, which will create jobs here at home, while being conscious of our environmental impact. We are promoting the development of new sources of fuel and we are promoting conservation. Taken together, the Republican energy plan will help finally ease the pain at the pump. 
   So while I urge the support of H. Res. 1225, I also urge action on the much-needed energy reforms. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUHL of New York. (WEST VALLEY DEMONSTRATION PROJECT -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to make the House aware of a serious problem in my Congressional district in upstate New York. 
   The West Valley Demonstration Project, which is located here, was created by Congress in 1980 to solidify in glass the nuclear waste left over from a variety of sources, including defense atomic waste. This project successfully vitrified all of the high-level waste on the site over the next 2 decades, placing the waste in safe gas containers ready to store in a permanent storage facility. 
   West Valley is unique in the Department of Energy system in that the site is owned by the State of New York, but the operation is funded 90 percent by the Federal Government and 10 percent by the State of New York. While there is little question that the waste is, in large part, Federal waste, the Federal Government is not owning up to its responsibility to completely clean the site so that it can be returned to the community of West Valley and reused for economic development opportunities. 
   There is now a grave problem that threatens all of us. Some of the radiation has leaked into the ground water and formed a plume, as shown here on chart 2. The plume continues to grow and threatens streams on the site. These streams feed into larger tributaries which empty into the largest body of fresh water in the world. I repeat that: the largest body of fresh water in the world, the Great Lakes. Lake Erie's shores are only 25 miles away. Better shown on this chart. West Valley Demonstration Project, the creeks to Lake Erie. 
   It was estimated that the cleanup of this plume would require the removal of 4 million cubic feet of soil just a few years ago. Current estimates suggest 30 million cubic feet of soil would need to be removed to eliminate the threat if done today. 
   The Federal Government has simply moved the ropes around the affected area. Rather than cleaning it up, a few years ago when the problem was first noticed, the Department of Energy has roped off the area, allowed it to grow and grow and grow. 
   I will be introducing legislation once again during this term of Congress, Mr. Speaker, to direct the Department of Energy to take immediate possession of the Western New York Nuclear Service Center at West Valley and remediate the entire site, including this dangerous plume. The Department of Energy would be responsible for all costs of the clean up, as New York State neither has the resources nor the ability to do so. This is a Federal problem that requires Federal attention. 
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission would be given authority to regulate activities of the Department of Energy at West Valley and consult with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in executing the remediation. 
   The West Valley Remediation Act will replace and supersede the West Valley Demonstration Project Act of 1980, if adopted, but does not reduce any of the act's decontamination or decommissioning provisions. 
   Appropriations of roughly $95 million per year would be authorized to implement the act, and additional appropriations would also be authorized to benefit the community. 
   The Department of Energy is then precluded from transporting any additional hazardous or radioactive waste to the site for the purpose of treatment or disposal. 
   Most importantly, the site would be cleaned and returned to its natural state, and the Great Lakes would no longer be threatened, taking care of a potential international environmental hazard of monumental proportions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope you and my colleagues will work with me and with the Senate to find a solution to this problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUHL of New York. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Chairman, constituents of mine have wisely questioned the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's plan to require United States citizens to present passports to travel between Canada and the United States. 
   In addition to standard application fees, the plan will require American citizens to pay for passport photos and travel to a passport application center just to take their families to the Toronto Blue Jays game or to Niagara Falls. 
   There is no question in my mind that we must protect our borders, I think all of our citizens agree with that, from illegal immigrants and potential terrorists. But we should not turn away legitimate business and visitors, as the U.S. and Canadian economies have become interdependent. 
   Therefore, my amendment requires that the Governmental Accounting Office conduct a study of the potentially adverse economic impact that this new requirement for land and sea travelers may have upon American business. I believe that we have a long, long way to go before our borders are finally and fully secured. But I believe that this amendment gets us moving in the right direction, without slamming the door on our neighbors to the north. 
   Mr. Chairman, I understand that there is potentially a legal problem with this amendment. Having actually put it before the Congress for its consideration, certainly the chairman, I believe it's appropriate to withdraw the amendment at this time, and I would do so.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Chairman, earlier this month a security breach occurred along our northern border when an individual on the no-fly list carrying a dangerous strain of tuberculosis successfully crossed the United States border. 
   This breach highlights the security gaps at our northern border that must be immediately addressed. If the Department of Homeland Security cannot adequately meet our Nation's growing security needs, then we in Congress must step in to provide our citizens with the oversight and action that they deserve, so that both our northern and our southern borders will be safe from future threats. 
   I am offering this amendment to take us a step in the right direction of securing our northern border. Most of the action that you are hearing today in this Chamber is dealing with the southern border. This amendment requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study examining the security of the northern border. 
   Specifically, it requires that the GAO evaluate the Customs and Border Patrol's ability to identify and eliminate all potential threats to the northern border under current funding levels. 
   In closing, this is a commonsense amendment that will take us a step in the right direction towards securing our northern border, and I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I also understand, Mr. Chairman, that my colleague, the ranking minority member, has a problem with the correctness of this amendment. 
   So not dealing in wanting to further challenge this, I would withdraw my amendment and my statement addressing the needs that I feel are appropriate at this time.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn. 
   There was no objection. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. If there are no further amendments to this paragraph, the Clerk will read.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I noticed that the gentleman from Iowa was a little quizzical and hesitant in congratulating a fellow Big 12 team from Kansas. But in any case, Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 948 congratulating the University of Kansas football team, affectionately known as KU, for winning the 2008 FedEx Orange Bowl and having the most successful year in program history. 
   On January 3, 2008, the University of Kansas football team won the 2008 FedEx Orange Bowl defeating Virginia Tech by a score of 24-20 for its first major bowl victory in university history. 
   The KU football team won a school record 12 games this past season and ended the season ranked seventh in the final top 25 polls released on January 8, 2008. This is the second highest final ranking in school history. 
   This past year's KU team set the school record with points per game, with an average of 42 points per game, and total yards per game, with an average of 479 yards. KU is the only school in the country to rank in the top five nationally in both scoring offense, which was second, and scoring defense, in which they were fifth. 
   Following the remarkable year, head coach Mark Mangino was awarded multiple national Coach of the Year awards. And, in fact, Coach Mangino has produced a minimum of six wins in three straight seasons, for the first time in 46 years for the KU football program. 
   The KU football team also produced two first team All Americans, cornerback Aquib Talib and offensive tackle Anthony Collins. Equally important, the team produced two academic All American recipients, Russell Brorsen and John Larson. 
   In addition to successful athletic programs, KU also provides faculty, academic and research programs of international distinction, and outstanding libraries, teaching museums, and teaching technology. These resources enrich the undergraduate experience and are essential for graduate-level education and for research. 
   From early existence, the University of Kansas has been fueled by high aspirations and has enjoyed a national reputation for innovation and academic excellence. I extend my congratulations to head coach Mark Mangino, all of the hardworking players, the fans, and to the University of Kansas. I am happy to join my friend and colleague in honoring this exceptional team for all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success. I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUHL of New York. (CONGRATULATING IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY FOR 150 YEARS OF LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - March 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 924, congratulating Iowa State University of Science and Technology for 150 years of leadership and service to the United States and the world as Iowa's land-grant university. 
   Iowa Agriculture College and Model Farm, now Iowa State University, was officially established on March 22, 1858. As a land-grant institution, Iowa agriculture college focused on ideals that higher education should be accessible to all and that the university should teach liberal and practical subjects. These ideas are integral to the land-grant university policy. 
   Even before Abraham Lincoln signed a law that gave birth to the land-grant universities, Iowa State was actively bringing knowledge to the people of  Iowa through farmers' short courses and farm demonstrations. The first official class, consisting of 24 men and two women, entered at Ames in 1869 and graduated in 1872. 
   Iowa State then was a leader and is now a leader in agriculture, engineering, extension, home economics, and created the Nation's first State veterinary medicine school in 1879. In 1959, the college was officially renamed Iowa State University of Science and Technology. The focus on technology has led to many research patents and inventions, including the first binary computer, the round hay baler, and many, many more. 
   Today Iowa State University has approximately 27,000 students, some change from over 100 years ago. With world-class programs in agriculture, technology, science and art, the ``U.S. News & World Report'' ranks Iowa State among the top 50 public national universities. Half of Iowa State University freshmen get an early boost in academic success by participating in Iowa State's highly touted Learning Communities Program. Additionally, Iowa State University is ranked 18th in the Nation for its study or work abroad programs. 
   Iowa State University is a very special place that is full of history; but what truly makes it unique is a rare combination of campus beauty, the opportunity to be part of the land-grant experiment, and to create a progressive and inventive spirit that they call the Cyclone Experience. 
   I extend my congratulations along with all my colleagues to the university president, Gregory Geoffroy, all of Iowa State University's faculty, its staff, certainly, its students and alumni, and wish them continued success. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues support this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, I join with my colleagues from Iowa and California in support of this resolution.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 493--Congratulating the women's water polo team of the University of California, Los Angeles, for winning the 2007 NCAA Division I Women's Water Polo National Championship, and congratulating UCLA on its 100th NCAA sports national title, making it the most accomplished athletic program in NCAA history. 
   On May 13, 2007, the UCLA women's water polo team defeated Stanford 5-4 in the championship game of the NCAA Division I Women's Water Polo National Championship tournament. 
   The victory gave head coach Adam Krikorian and the Bruins women's water polo team their third consecutive NCAA championship and was the team's fifth overall national title. 
   Kelly Rulon, a driver for the Bruins, was selected as the tournament's most valuable player; and Emily Feher, Courtney Mathewson, Jillian Kraus, and Kacy Kunkel were named to the NCAA All-Tournament First Team. 
   The UCLA women's water polo team finished the 2007 season with a record of 28 wins and 2 losses and now has a record of 90 wins and 6 losses over the past 3 seasons. 
   This national title makes UCLA the first school ever to win 100 NCAA sports national titles--only 58 years after the UCLA men's tennis team won the school's first NCAA title in 1950. Along the way, 16 different men's and women's sports programs contributed to the Bruins' 100 NCAA national championships. 
   UCLA teams have won 14 NCAA national championships during the tenure of Daniel G. Guerrero, the current director of athletics. Under the leadership of Chancellor Gene Block, UCLA continues to establish itself as one of the top research universities as well as top athletic programs in the Nation. 
   I extend my congratulations to Chancellor Block, Athletics Director Guerrero, Head Coach Adam Krikorian and his staff, all of the hard-working players, the fans, and to UCLA. I am happy to join my good friend and colleague Representative Lewis in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I proudly rise today to congratulate the University of California, Los Angeles--My alma mater--on its 100th NCAA team championship. 
   In a Nation with so many colleges and universities known for their strong sports programs, heck, in a city the size of Los Angeles with sports powerhouse USC right across town, this is a truly amazing accomplishment. 
   At UCLA, which has so many firsts in other areas, the 2007 UCLA women's water polo Team helped UCLA reach another first: the first to 100 NCAA team championships. 
   On May 13, 2007, the women's water polo team, led by Head Coach Adam Krikorian, defeated Stanford 9-4 in the last round of the Women's Water Polo National Championship tournament, thereby making history. 
   This was the team's third consecutive NCAA championship and its fifth overall national title. Team member Kelly Rulon was selected as the tournament's Most Valuable Player, and Ms. Rulon and four of her teammates--Emily Feher, Courtney Mathewson, Jillian Kraus, and Kacy Kunke--were named to the NCAA all-tournament team. 
   UCLA won its first national title in men's tennis in 1950. Since then, 16 different athletics programs--nine men's programs and seven women's--have won national championships in the sports of basketball, golf, gymnastics, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, and, of course, water polo. 
   In the last 5 years alone, under the leadership of Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, UCLA athletics teams have won 14 NCAA national championships in nine different sports. 
   This extraordinary achievement is a tribute to the skill and dedication of the many players, coaches, students, alumni, families, professors, staff, and fans who have helped to make UCLA an athletic powerhouse as well as one of the top academic universities in the Nation. 
   UCLA's accomplishment also demonstrates the success of Title IX. Of the 100 NCAA championships that UCLA teams have earned, women's teams have been responsible for 30. And the NCAA didn't even begin awarding championships in women's sports until the 1981-82 season. 
   To all the athletes of UCLA, past and present, male and female, you rock.

   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, we have been doing some serious work here. While the Members are departing for a district work period, I want to inform the rest of the House that 2 nights ago, a horrible accident happened in my district, in Canandaigua, New York, that took the lives of five young women from Fairport who were on their way to spend time on Keuka Lake, which is where I live. 
   All five of these young women were cheerleaders at Fairport High School and had just graduated from high school a week ago. They were all looking forward to a bright, fun summer together on the lake with friends, four of  whom were riding in a car behind them and were, thankfully, uninjured. 
   Madam Speaker, I am here to mourn the loss of Hannah Congdon. Hannah was known by friends as ``constant sunshine.'' She never said a negative word about anyone and was always smiling. 
   Bailey Goodman. The girls were headed to Bailey's family cottage on Keuka Lake. Bailey was the team's entertainment, according to her friends, and could always make her teammates laugh. 
   Meredith McClure. Meredith was known as the team's hardest worker, always the first one to try a new jump or a stunt. 
   Sara Monnat. Sara was jokingly referred to as the team ``boss.'' She would motivate and encourage her team in an amiable way, and was a born leader. 
   And Katherine Shirley. Katie loved her friends. She would spend hours putting together scrapbooks and surrounding herself with photos of her and her friends. 
   I offer my prayers and condolences to the families, friends and neighbors of these beautiful young women who were so violently taken from us. 
   I also rise, Madam Speaker, to ask that the House pause for a moment of silence in remembrance of Bailey, Hannah, Katie, Sara and Meredith.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of House Resolution 365, honoring San Jose State University for its 150 years of commitment to public higher education. I would like to thank my good friend, Mr. Honda, for introducing the resolution, and certainly my friend from New York for managing the bill on the floor tonight and recognizing the important role San Jose State University plays in educating the citizens of California and many other States and nations. 
   San Jose State University was founded as a California State Normal School by the California legislature on May 4, 1857, and is the oldest public university in California. The California State Normal School was itself derived from the Minns Evening Normal School, which was also known as the San Francisco Normal School. Led by Principal George W. Minns, the San Francisco Normal School trained elementary teachers as part of that city's high  school system from 1857 to their professional development and personal growth. 
   Silicon Valley firms are constantly seeking San Jose State University students for internships, summer work programs, and research and development. For a century and a half, San Jose State University faculty and staff has prepared its students for roles as leaders and highly productive professionals and citizens in society. 
   There is no better way of understanding San Jose State University's economic impact than simply visiting any Silicon Valley workplace, whether it is a tech company, government office, a hospital, or classroom, many of the people you will meet have ties to San Jose State University. In fact, San Jose State University has sent nearly 300,000 graduates into the workforce since it was founded in 1857, and I am honored to stand here today in support of this resolution and would say to my fellow colleagues: I would like you to support and congratulate San Jose State University's Don W. Kassing and all of the faculty and staff as well as San Jose State University students and alumni. I wish them continued success, and I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Joint Resolution 62, to honor the achievements and contributions of Native Americans to the United States and for other purposes. 
   The strength of our Nation comes from its people; and as the early inhabitants of this great land, the native peoples of North America played a unique role in shaping our Nation's history and culture. 
   Native Americans are the descendants of the indigenous native people who were the original inhabitants and governors of the lands that now constitute the United States of America. It was their tribal governments that developed the fundamental principles of freedom of speech and separation of powers. They're a model for those that formed the foundation of the United States Constitution. 
   The Founding Fathers based the provision of the Constitution on the unique system of democracy of the six nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. The Iroquois divided powers amongst the branches of government and provided for a system of checks and balances. 
   Native Americans have made a distinct and significant contribution to the United States and to the rest of the world in many fields, including agriculture, medicine, music, language, art, among other things. And Native Americans have distinguished themselves, as my friend Mr. Baca has noted, as inventors, as entrepreneurs, as spiritual leaders and scholars, among a few. 
   Their unique spiritual, artistic and literary contributions, together with their vibrant customs and celebrations, enliven and enrich our land today. As we move into the 21st century, Native Americans will play a vital role in maintaining our Nation's strength and prosperity. 
   Almost half of America's Native American tribal leaders have served in the United States Armed Forces, following in the footsteps of their forebears, who distinguished themselves during the world wars and the conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf. 
   Native Americans should be recognized for the contributions they have made to the fabric of our American society. This recognition will afford an opportunity for all Americans to demonstrate their respect and admiration of Native Americans for their important contributions to the political, the cultural, and the economic life of the United States. 
   The designation of Native American Heritage Day will encourage public elementary and secondary schools in the United States to enhance Americans by providing curricula and classroom instruction focusing on the achievements and contributions of Native Americans to the Nation, and the designation of the Friday following Thanksgiving of each year as Native American Heritage Day will underscore the government-to-government relationship between the United States of America and Native American governments. 
   On this day we should call on all Americans to learn more about the history and the heritage of the native peoples of this great land. Such actions reaffirm our appreciation and most certainly our respect for their traditions and their way of life, and can help to preserve an important part of our culture for generations yet to come. 
   Mr. Speaker, I join my friend and colleague, Representative Baca, in supporting the resolution and ask my colleagues to do the same. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 709, recognizing and honoring the 50th anniversary of the dedication of the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum on October 9, 2007, and for such other purposes. 
   Congressman Samuel Rayburn was born on January 6, 1882, in a rural area of Roane County, Tennessee. His interest in government coincided with his family's move to Texas, and it has been suggested that his curiosity intensified through the ``great golden age of Texas politics.'' 
   As he worked his family's cotton fields, Congressman Rayburn imagined himself making numerous political speeches and engaging in debates with current political leaders. Later in his life, Congressman Rayburn recalled that it was during one of these flights of imagination that he decided he would pursue a career in law and politics. 
   By 1937, Congressman Rayburn was elected majority leader of the 75th Congress, and in 1940 he was selected to replace the deceased William Bankhead as Speaker of the House, a position he held for a record number 17 1/2 years. 
   During the 80th and 83rd Congresses, the two periods of Republican majorities in the House of Representatives, he served as minority leader. During his time in Congress, Congressman Rayburn served with eight different Presidents and helped to pass several pieces of key legislation. He served as Speaker of the House throughout World War II and was instrumental in garnering support to fund the Manhattan Project. 
   Known by most as ``Mr. Democrat,'' Mr. Rayburn was permanent chairman of the National Democratic Convention in 1948, 1952, and 1956, and was named honorary chairman in 1960. Throughout his political career, the congressman was known for his ability to balance his strong Democratic partisanship with his unwavering sense of dedication to meeting the needs of the American people through working in bipartisan ways with Republicans. 
   Despite the status he was able to achieve in Washington as Speaker, he was still known as ``informal'' and a ``down home kind of guy'' who returned to his home in Bonham as soon as Congress adjourned for the session. When home, Congressman Rayburn would meet with his constituents concerning their needs, maintaining that his obligation was to the people and it wasn't finished. 
   Congressman Rayburn accomplished much during his lifetime by the fulfillment of his dream to become a politician. And he is a source of pride for those all over northeast Texas. 
   Sam Rayburn passed away in Bonham, Texas, on November 16, 1961, and was buried at the Willow Wild Cemetery, a few blocks from the Rayburn Library and Museum. His remains laid in state for 24 hours in the library he had established in October 1957 as a tribute to the people of his cherished Fannin County, Texas. Thousands of mourners from schoolchildren to national officials filed silently past his bronze coffin in tribute to his service and dedication. The Texas Department of Public Safety estimated that 15,000 people filled the streets on the day of Rayburn's funeral. President John Kennedy, former Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Harry Truman and future President Lyndon Johnson attended the funeral services. The entire Texas congressional delegation and 105 Members of Congress attended the services, many of whom came to the library. 
   Today, the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum exhibits photographs and original letters, political artifacts, and personal memorabilia relating to important events of the life and times of Congressman Rayburn. In addition to a research library, the museum centerpiece is a replica of the formal office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
   I thank the gentleman who sits behind me for whom I will yield in just a moment, Mr. Hall, for introducing this resolution and I ask my colleagues' support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hall).

<DOCNO>Mr. KUHL of New York. (FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2008--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 110-115) -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of overriding the President's veto of the farm bill. 
   When I was elected to Congress, I joined the Agriculture Committee because of my district's rich and deep tradition in farming. And as a member of this committee, I am committed to serving not only the needs of my district, but also to preserving our Nation's agricultural vitality. As such, I am extremely disappointed by the President's veto. 
   I am very pleased, however, by what our committee has been able to do in writing this farm bill. This farm bill fairly and accurately represents the interests of all our farmers and various agricultural industries across the country and was fashioned in a bipartisan manner. Particularly the dairy and specialty crops and conservation programs will be extremely beneficial to New York farmers. But, more importantly, this legislation contains reform. 
   For the first time in history there will be a hard cap on the adjusted gross income standard to prevent the wealthiest from receiving payments. As such, this farm bill has broad support from a variety of agricultural, nutrition, conservation, and consumer entities. This farm bill is an opportunity to make American farm policy truly comprehensive, competitive and cohesive, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to override this veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 472, congratulating and commending the Wichita State University's bowling team for winning the 2007 United States Bowling Congress Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship. On April 21, 2007, the Wichita State University Shockers, as they are called, women's bowling team defeated McKendree College two games to none to claim their eighth national championship. 
   In game one, both teams went head-to-head in a low-scoring match. However, the Shockers were able to capitalize on a McKendree split and pull out a win 138-128. Close match. In the second match, the Shockers completely outplayed McKendree as senior Felicia Wong and junior Emily Maier doubled in the third and fourth frame and again in the eighth and the ninth to close out the match and claim the title. 
   This year's title is the team's first since 2005 and the eighth overall, which is the most in all of college bowling history. This title also adds to the amazing legacy of Wichita State bowling, as it is the 15th in school history, eight women's titles, seven men's titles. 
   Founded in 1895, Wichita State University offers more than 60 undergraduate degree programs in more than 200 areas of study in six undergraduate colleges. The graduate school offers an extensive program, including 44 master's degrees in more than 100 areas and a specialist in education degree. It offers doctoral degrees in applied mathematics and chemistry, communicative disorders and sciences, psychology, educational administration and aerospace, and electrical, industrial and mechanical engineering. 
   Together with the City of Wichita, Wichita State University has built one of the most unique partnerships in Kansas, one that over the years has propelled each to new heights. 
   I extend my congratulations to head coach Gordon Vadakin, women's coach Mark Lewis, assistant women's coach Kristal Scott and President Donald Beggs, all of the hard-working players, certainly the fans and to Wichita State University. I am happy to join my colleague, Representative Todd Tiahrt, in honoring an exceptional team in all its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success. I ask my colleagues certainly to support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 762, supporting the goals of National Bullying Prevention Awareness Week. 
   According to the Health Resources and Services Administration of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, bullying is aggressive behavior that is intentional, repeated over time, and involves an imbalance of power or strength. 
   In practical terms, bullying happens when one child purposely hurts, scares or intimidates another. Bullying can seriously affect the mental and physical health as well as the academic work of children who are targeted. 
   Bullying can take place face to face, online or through other types of technology, such as text messaging over cell phones. The person being bullied has a difficult time defending himself or herself and feels victimized or abused. Usually bullying happens repeatedly, and studies show that between 15 and 25 percent of U.S. students are bullied with some frequency. 
   Bullying is prevalent, and children are concerned about it. In a 2003 Harris poll of 8- to 17-year-old girls commissioned by the Girl Scouts of America, bullying topped girls' lists of concerns regarding their safety. When asked what they worried most about, the common response was being socially ostracized, being made fun of, or being teased. To protect kids who are bullied, parents and adults must understand what bullying is, how harmful it can be, and the best ways to stop bullying behaviors. 
   According to the American Psychological Association, the most effective prevention strategies are comprehensive in nature, involving the entire school as a community working to change the climate of the school and norms of behavior. It's crucial that parents, educators and administrators, health care professionals and researchers work together to reduce bullying. Campaigns are taking place in the U.S. and abroad to teach children that they play an important role in the prevention of bullying and to raise awareness of the problem among adults. Children should feel comfortable in their communities and in their schools. They should not have to fear harassment, abuse or exclusion. We must continue to support efforts to combat bullying. 
   I thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy) for introducing this resolution. I ask for my colleagues' support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor Glenn H. Curtiss from my hometown of Hammondsport, New York. Glenn Curtiss was a true transportation pioneer. 
   This week, I introduced House Resolution 84 to recognize Glenn Curtiss for setting the world's speed record on the first V-8 powered motorcycle exactly 100 years ago today. In honor of that ride in 1907, the Curtiss Museum and the City of Ormond Beach, Florida, which is the ``birthplace of speed,'' hosted a Curtiss motorcycle run on the beach today, January 24, 2007. 
   In addition to his recordbreaking speed, which was 137 miles an hour, Mr. Curtiss was the founder of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, now part of the Curtiss-Wright Corporation. Glenn Curtiss also developed the first successful sea plane and manufactured the famous World War I Jenny training plane. 
   Again, Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to honor the memory of Mr. Glenn Curtiss, and I encourage all Members to join me in honoring the legacy of Mr. Curtiss and cosponsoring House Resolution 84.

   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and astounding contributions of Major General Charles D. Barrett, a resident of the 29th Congressional District of New York, who recently died. 
   Major General Barrett began his military career early in life, enrolling in the ROTC program while a student at Cornell University. He entered active duty in 1956 and served as a shop officer and company commander for 17 months with the Eighth Army in Korea. 
   During his four-plus decades of service to this country, he accumulated many honors, including the Distinguished Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, and the Army Commendation Medal. These medals exemplify the service, sacrifice, and the courage of this hero and represent Major General Barrett as a man who put his country before himself, a man who answered the call when the Nation needed him most, and a man who represented the best that America had to offer. 
   Major General Barrett served his country with pride, with honor, and with bravery, and there is nothing more noble than a person who is willing to commit themselves to a cause as important as defending our country. 
   Today I honor Major General Charles Barrett and all the brave men and women who volunteer to fight for what is good and right about our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating Chairman Peterson and Ranking Minority Member Goodlatte in bringing this bill to the floor in very difficult times. I rise in support of the farm bill conference agreement.  
   Agriculture is one of the most important industries in New York State, believe it or not. In the 29th District alone, there are over 6,000 farms covering more than 1.2 million acres and employing thousands of workers. Annually, the farm economy generates over $360 million in my district alone. 
   During the writing of the farm bill, I hoped to address some of the most pressing issues facing New York farmers without destroying important provisions for other States, districts or industries.     
   The committee held a field hearing in my district, where we heard about issues such as extending the MILC program, increasing funding for specialty crops such as apples and grapes, enhancing conservation programs such as FRPP and EQIP, augmenting nutrition and food assistance policy, and utilizing our crops to assist in developing a strong renewable energy portfolio. 
   This bill makes historic investments in priorities to strengthen the fruit and the vegetable industry and expands a variety of things like the snack program. I hope my colleagues will support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. KUHL of New York. (CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF CAMERON ARGETSINGER -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans and auto racing enthusiasts around the world look forward to each weekend for the invigorating sights, sounds, and experience of professional sports car racing. These fans owe a great thanks to one of the founding fathers of road racing, Watkins Glen's own Cameron Argetsinger who passed away this last month. 
   Today I join these fans in mourning the loss of this auto racing pioneer who has left an indelible mark on the automobile world and on the community of Watkins Glen, New York. What Cameron Argetsinger began in 1948 as a road race through and over the streets of Watkins Glen, New York, has grown over the last 60 years to now a private track that has hosted the best drivers in the world, from NASCAR to Formula 1, including the United States Grand Prix. 
   He has made the small town of Watkins Glen famous throughout the country. Almost every legendary auto racer over the last 60 years has visited Schuyler County to race at the Glen and to pay homage to a man who helped make auto racing what it is today. 
   Cameron Argetsinger inherited a love for fast cars from his father and in 1947 bought his first sports car so he could become a member of the nascent Sports Car Club of America. With the desire to race his car, he organized a sports car race designed to appear like a European-style road race through the streets of Watkins Glen. That first race in Watkins Glen had only 23 cars participating and followed the route that Cameron Argetsinger laboriously planned on his living room floor. 
   Ten years later, after the road races moved to a new 2.3-mile course, Argetsinger brought full international races to Watkins Glen. In 1961, he inaugurated the U.S. Grand Prix for Formula 1, which had a successful 20 years' run in the Watkins Glen circuit. 
   After leaving Watkins Glen in 1970, he was executive vice president of Chaparral Cars and was subsequently director of professional racing and executive director of the Sports Car Club of America, SCCA, from 1971 to 1977. He also served as commissioner of the International Motor Sport Association from 1986 to 1992. Cameron Argetsinger was a member of the inaugural induction class of the Hall of Fame of the Sports Car Club of America in January of 2005. He is also in the Schuyler County, New York, Hall of Fame. 
   Cameron Argetsinger loved sports cars and never looked back when chasing his dream. He was an attorney, a father, a grandfather, a racer, a husband, and an inspiration. He did what he loved, and he will be missed by the people of Watkins Glen, Schuyler County, and the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   This resolution authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the 100th anniversary celebration of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority. AKA, Alpha Kappa Alpha, was founded in 1908 on the campus of Howard University, right here in Washington, DC. The sorority performs various community service projects and encourages its members to contribute to the community, while pursuing academic excellence. 
   The centennial program on the Capitol Grounds will be just one part of the year-long celebration. The event will be free and open to the public. 
   Alpha Kappa Alpha will assume liability for accidents and will be responsible for event costs in accordance with the policies of the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police. 
   While we debate this concurrent resolution, which is strictly a managerial responsibility of this Congress, people across the country are worrying about how they will afford their next trip to the gas station, and not about this particular celebration. 
   Since the Democrats took over Congress, the price of gasoline has increased more than a $1.50 a gallon. It's unfortunate, but Democrats seem to ignore the law of supply and demand. 
   What you've heard here previously on the resolution before the House dealt with opening up the supply that's immediately available in this country, American energy supply. The current majority has done nothing to increase energy supplies, and then wonder why gas prices continue to soar. It is simply unbelievable that the Democrat majority refuses to debate the skyrocketing costs of fuel. 
   Madam Speaker, while I do support this resolution and request my colleagues to be likewise supportive, I would reserve the balance of my time at this time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Concurrent Resolution 311, sponsored by the majority leader, Representative Hoyer, authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the 67th Annual Washington Soap Box Derby on June 22, just a couple of weeks away, this year. For many years, Majority Leader Hoyer and Congress have supported this fun event, which allows children to show off their hard work and their creativity as they compete for trophies and the opportunity to race others in competition. 
   Boys and girls between the ages of 8 and 17 will race down Capitol Hill in homemade cars, hopefully without injury. Winners in each of the three divisions go on to compete in the National Soap Box Derby in Akron, Ohio. Last year, the Soap Box Derby marked a historic event when racer Kacie Rader won both the District's race and the national title in her division. 
   I support this resolution, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   The authorization of the use of the Capitol Grounds is part of the managerial work that we do here in Congress. But the issues the American people want addressed are being ignored. While Americans struggle, particularly in my district, to put fuel in their cars, we authorize the use of the Capitol Grounds. Gas prices are soaring above $4 in many parts of the country and this Congress must act. We must work to find a way to ease the burden of increasing fuel costs. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I rise in support of the resolution offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio, Representative Kaptur. 
   H.R. 3712 designates the Federal building and United States courthouse located in Toledo, Ohio as the ``James M. Ashley and Thomas W. L. Ashley Customs Building and United States Courthouse.'' 
   James Mitchell Ashley was an Ohio congressman who served five terms in the United States Congress where he served for 8 years as the chairman on the Committee of Territories. Representative Ashley had a prominent role in the passage of the 13th amendment, which abolished slavery. Following his service in Congress, James Ashley served as the Governor of the Territory of Montana, as you have previously heard, and helped to construct the Toledo, Ann Arbor and Northern Railroad. 
   His great grandson, Thomas William Ludlow Ashley, also served as a congressman from Ohio from 1955 to 1981, some 26 years. Representative Thomas Ashley served 13 terms in Congress, and was chairman of the Select Committee on Energy in the 95th Congress. Prior to his service, he served in the Pacific theater during World War II as a corporal in the United States Army. 
   This bill is a fitting tribute to their service and to their country. I support this measure, and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   While this legislation will name a courthouse in Ohio, it is not on the issue or not on the minds of people across the country as they travel to work. They are more worried about the cost of filling up their gas tanks than they are the managerial actions of Congress' naming a building after some very honorable people. The American people are really feeling the pain at the pump, and this Congress has ignored their calls for help. It seems that, every night, the news media proclaims that the gas prices have hit another record high. As Congress idles and as prices soar, the problem is being ignored. This is something that Congress must act on immediately. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 5599 names the new Census Bureau headquarters building in Suitland, Maryland, as the Thomas Jefferson Census Bureau Headquarters Building. 
   As the first Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson was a strong advocate of a national census, and he supervised the first census in 1790. Early population estimates misjudged the number of Americans in many areas, unfortunately, and it resulted in underrepresentation in many areas of this country in the first Congress. Under Jefferson's leadership, however, the census developed into a more useful and accurate process. 
   Thomas Jefferson's advocacy for a complete and accurate census land laid the foundation for the Census Bureau we have today. He believed that an accurate census was essential to ensure that the government represented its people effectively. So it is fitting that the new census building bear his name, and I support the bill and urge its adoption and applaud my colleague, Representative Maloney, on bringing it before the House for its adoption today. 
   But while we debate these matters, the issue persists, and that is the high cost of gasoline. And this Congress continues to ignore the rising cost of gasoline. American workers are struggling to fill up their tanks, and this Congress has done nothing to ease that burden. The Democratic majority has failed to provide the real leadership in addressing the high cost of fuel which requires an increased supply, American supply. 
   Thank you, Madam Speaker, for an opportunity to speak on this. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about Dr. Al Simone, an outstanding individual in the community of Rochester, New York. Dr. Simone retires this month from the presidency of the Rochester Institute of Technology. He was RIT's eighth president, the eighth in 177 years. 
   Dr. Simone came to Rochester from a place where the weather is a little bit more predictable. He was the president of the University of Hawaii system and chancellor of the University of Hawaii at Manoa for 9 years. 
   Dr. Simone has led RIT to become the one of the Nation's leading career-oriented universities with 15,500 students from all 50 States and more than 100 foreign countries, 2,800 faculty and staff, and an annual operating budget of more than $490 million. RIT is now the tenth largest private university in the Nation in terms of full-time undergraduate enrollment. The endowment has climbed to more than $570 million during his tenancy. 
   Dr. Simone is a prolific writer and has written several books and numerous journal publications on the application of mathematics, statistics, and computers to economics and business. In fact, Dr. Simone is collecting data and information for a book right now on higher education, which he expects to write within the next few years during his retirement on the sunny shores of Keuka Lake. 
   Dr. Simone is a real trailblazer. He was the first American university president, for instance, to officially visit North Korea, Vietnam, and Vladivostock when these areas were closed to the United States except for cultural and educational exchange. 
   A native of Boston, Dr. Simone received his B.A. in economics from Tufts University and his Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has taught at Tufts, MIT, Northeastern University, Boston College, Boston University, University of Cincinnati, and the University of Hawaii. 
   The community will certainly miss Al's leadership and I know I will miss working with him. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope you will join me in wishing him and his wife, Carolie, a long, happy, healthy retirement with their children and their grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KUHL of New York. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   I rise to offer this motion to recommit to strengthen the bill before us, H.R. 2857, and the national service laws to ensure that we are all doing what we can to protect those individuals being served by these programs and by the Federal investment in national service. 
   Sparked by a 2005 Inspector General report that found rampant, and I recognize and emphasize that word ``rampant,'' noncompliance with individual grant provisions requiring background checks, the Corporation for National Community Service recently completed a rulemaking process to institute background checks for any individuals seeking a federally funded national service position within the Senior Companion and the Foster Grandparent program and from the  AmeriCorps positions in which individuals have access to a vulnerable population.     
   The regs also prohibited individuals from serving in these positions if they were registered sex offenders. 
   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the administration for taking these steps to protect vulnerable populations being served by the national service programs. But I believe that we should go further and provide more protection. 
   First, this motion to recommit would codify the corporation's regulations, ensuring that these protections are not subject to the whims of future administrations. Despite current efforts, program audits conducted by the Office of the Inspector General have detected a disturbing pattern of noncompliance with criminal background check provision requirements. In some cases, programs have failed to conduct checks. 
   Just as disturbing, however, other programs have failed to retain the documentation providing this background check information that was conducted for members working with youth and other vulnerable persons. 
   Second, this motion to recommit would expand on the corporation's efforts by including, and I emphasize that, including all federally funded national service provision positions, not just those within the foster grandparents and senior competitive programs or just those AmeriCorps programs dealing with specific populations. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, in addition to prohibiting registered sex offenders from serving in these positions, this motion to recommit would include those individuals convicted of murder as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, our message is clear with this motion to recommit: if you are a program receiving assistance under these national service laws and are accepting participants to serve in federally funded programs and positions within your program, we expect you to screen those potential participants to ensure that they are not, and I emphasize again, not registered sex offenders or convicted murderers. And if you wish to serve in federally funded national service positions, some of which include as their reward an education award that exceeds that which is received by low-income students through the form of a Pell Grant, you are not welcome if you have committed these crimes. 
   Mr. Speaker, some people would ask, Why do we include these crimes? We believe that these crimes are so egregious that they demand Federal action. But also we hope that by requiring criminal history background checks, programs will have increased information with which they can exercise good judgment. It only seems to make sense. To repeat myself, we also hope that by requiring criminal background checks, programs will have the increased information from which they can exercise good judgment in deciding who deserves the rewards that come with federally funded national service positions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit, which would provide the Education and Labor Committee further time to deliberate on this important topic. This motion expresses a loud and clear message that the House of Representatives believes that those in need who are served by programs supported with assistance under these laws should be assured that they will not be placed in harm's way when approaching these programs for help. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
