<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (OUTLAW BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, CBS News recently ran an expose on the growing phenomenon of illegal aliens entering the United States in order to give birth to a child. The segment shed some light on what has become an increasingly costly burden to the United States taxpayer. 
   An estimated 300,000 children of illegal aliens are born in this country every year, largely because of a misguided policy of so-called ``birthright citizenship.'' This peculiar policy confers U.S. citizenship on any child born here regardless of what country their parents are from or whether those parents are here in the United States legally. We are one of few--in fact, we may be the only country now that still provides for this particular kind of citizenship. 
   And it's based on a very strange sort of interpretation of the 14th amendment, one part of the 14th amendment in particular. We all recognize of course that when the 14th amendment was written there was no such thing as illegal immigration. Certainly, there could have been no reference to it in the amendment itself. And what we need to do, frankly, is to pass legislation in this House and in the Senate, and the President needs to sign it, outlawing this practice and this habit, really, that we have gotten into, which is more than anything else a phenomenon of custom more than it is of actual law or analysis of the legal system or the Constitution of the United States. We should pass legislation to outlaw it and let it be tested at the Supreme Court. It results not just in the benefit for a child who is born as a U.S. citizen, it also makes it easier for the parent of that anchor baby or the illegal alien to become a U.S. citizen through that child. 
   The story on CBS focused on one woman who had crossed over the Rio Grande with her husband and two other children to give birth in the United States. She gave birth to a healthy 8 1/2 pound baby on American soil after American doctors performed a C-section, a procedure that carries a price tag of nearly $5,000, a bill that was sent to the American taxpayer. 
   Joe Riley, the CEO of the McAllen Texas Medical Center near the Texas-Mexico border, said this sort of thing is quite typical. He told CBS news that he had seen ``mothers about to give birth that walk up to the hospital still wet from swimming across the river in actual labor, dirty, wet, cold, here to have a child in the United States.'' 
   Mr. Riley's hospital alone is forced to provide uncompensated care worth more than $200 million each to cover the cost of nearly the 3,000 illegal alien births that take place there annually. Even more startling, that equates to about 50 percent of all the births in that hospital, meaning doctors are delivering almost as many children for illegal aliens as they are for American mothers. In California alone, by the way, the cost for illegal alien health care, not just for the births of illegal alien children, but the cost of health care for illegal aliens is over $1 billion a year; one State, over $1 billion a year. 
   With statistics like that, Mr. Speaker, it should come as no surprise that many American hospitals are on the verge of collapse--some, in fact, have gone that way--and that billions of taxpayer dollars are being squandered on illegal aliens that are taking advantage of the health care program. 
   It's time we yank back the illegal alien welcome mat, eliminate perverse incentives for illegal immigration like birth right citizenship and taxpayer services for illegal aliens.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (REMARKING ON THE POPE'S VISIT AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to also welcome Pope Benedict XVI to the United States and to Washington, D.C., and congratulate him for delivering an important message on the role that faith plays in the lives of every believer. 
   Over the years, the Vatican has been a strong voice for religious freedom, for human rights, and was an invaluable partner in defeating Communism during the Cold War. The Catholic Church has long been a source of charity and benevolence helping some of the world's most vulnerable people in some of the world's most dangerous places. 
   However, as President Bush welcomes Benedict XVI to Washington this week, Americans might be surprised to know that the Pope isn't here just to minister to his flock. He's here to lobby for amnesty for illegal aliens. According to news reports, the Pope met with President Bush yesterday to add his voice to the open border lobby by encouraging the President to give the 20 to 30 million illegal aliens in this country a free pass to stay here. 
   Now, I'm not taking issue with the Pope's moral authority. I respect his views on the threats of Islam, the sanctity of human life. But I don't think it's in his job description to engage in American political activities. 
   Worse yet, the Pope chided America, insinuating that immigrants are subject to ``violence'' and prevented from leading ``dignified lives.'' Madam Speaker, I would like to know what part of our American lax immigration policy is ``violent.'' I fail to see how accepting more refugees than any other Nation while providing free health care, free education, free housing and free social service benefits to millions of illegal aliens in this country is in any way degrading to them or undignified. 
   I would like to remind the Pope that America has long been dedicated to the principle of the rule of law, and there is absolutely nothing inhumane about American immigration statutes or the robust but civilized enforcement of it. 
   But perhaps the Pontiff has made these comments with a motive more broad than simply spreading the gospel. It's no secret that the Catholic Church has been having difficulty maintaining its membership levels and a growing number of religions are competing for parishioners. 
   Indeed, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that the ``Catholic Church has long been losing members and as much as a third of the native-born Catholic population is diminished. Meanwhile it has gained members among foreign-born (mostly Hispanic) residents.'' 
   Madam Speaker, it's possible and unfortunate that the Pope's immigration comments may have had as much to do with spreading the gospel as it does recruiting new members to the Church. 
   I regret that the Pope used some of his time with the President to engage in faith-based marketing trying to attract new parishioners instead of preaching amnesty for illegal aliens to try and enlarge the size of the global Catholic congregation. I would urge the Pope to subscribe to the wisdom of one of his cardinals, Cardinal Biffi. A few years ago, the cardinal told The Times of London, ``Countries can choose to let in whoever they want. There is no such thing as a right of invasion.'' 
   Madam Speaker, the United States already has a legal immigration system unparalleled in its generosity. In the meantime, we assist illegal aliens, and those affected by them, by reimbursing hospitals for costly illegal emergency room hospital visits, providing free public education to illegal alien children. I would challenge the Pope to name any other country on Earth that demonstrates this kind of compassion on such a large scale. 
   I hope, Madam Speaker, that the American people will welcome the Pope with open hearts and open arms but that they will reject his demand to replace our efforts to achieve genuine border security with a faith-based immigration system.

   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Chairman, in fact, this is not a unique situation, unique to the extent that the House has not acted before in a criminal case of this nature, but in fact, the House has acted in the past to intervene in cases where we have determined that the outcome was something we did not agree with. We've done it. We've stripped courts of certain abilities to actually hear cases. 
   In the past, we've actually passed legislation to change or overturn cases. One was, of course, the case of the Ten Commandments. Another one was, I believe, Congressman BERNIE SANDERS at the time passed a bill to overturn a case with regard to pension funds. So it is not unique that we would be doing this.

   Mr. TANCREDO. Reclaiming my time, it is again not the position that we are taking here that we are, in fact, changing the decision of the court in regard to their guilt or innocence. We are saying that the punishment handed down is far in excess of what it is they may have done wrong, and that is something I think that we have the absolute ability and right to do here. 
   These two gentlemen have served now 190 days, 180 days, something, already in prison, and for what? I mean, the most significant thing that we can actually determine, even according to some of the discussions that have been held and some of the statements that have been made by the prosecuting attorney, they're sorry. They made mistakes in terms of maybe using the type of prosecution that would require this kind of penalty. They have even said this may have been the wrong thing to do. Members of the jury have indicated that if they had seen all of the information now provided to them they would not have voted this way. 
   So it isn't an issue of the facts of the case so much as it is whether or not we believe these people have actually spent enough time in jail, have they been punished according to the crime. And I would suggest to the gentleman that if you look at this case carefully, certainly that is the case. 
   The person that brought this stuff through, the individual that actually was the drug dealer, he is walking free. I have visited Mr. Ramos in prison after he was severely beaten in his cell. They attacked him in his cell, of course, because they found out he was a Federal agent, and I went down there and visited him. You cannot imagine how, in a way, heartbreaking it is to see this guy in the orange jumpsuit, in shackles, and knowing that he is being deprived of the comfort of his own family, as is Mr. Compean, and here's a drug dealer that's going free in the meantime. It is absolutely incredible. This is a travesty. 
   We have begged the President to please become involved with this, please pardon, please commute. He has chosen not to. This is the only option we have open to us, and that is why we are doing what we're doing tonight. 
   And yes, to some extent, I understand that it is not a common practice here, but I think the situation is not an ordinary situation where we have two people who have sworn to defend and protect this country. They are in jail. They have served enough time; that's what we are saying. They have served enough time. 
   Please adopt the Poe-Tancredo-Hunter amendment.

   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1026, recognizing the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Congressional Club. 
   As the resolution states, the club was ``organized in 1908 by 25 women who were influential in Washington's official life and who wanted to establish a nonsectarian and nonpolitical group that would promote friendship and cordiality in public life.'' 
   Congressional spouses are active in the group, which is one of Washington's oldest and most venerable social clubs. 
   The Congressional Club has hosted the annual First Lady's luncheon for nearly a century, and makes numerous charitable donations in the name of the First Lady each year. The club also plays host to the spouses of foreign ambassadors serving here in the U.S. 
   For 100 years, the Congressional Club has contributed its time and efforts to numerous charitable causes, improved the cultural atmosphere in Washington, and extended a hand of friendship to the foreign diplomatic corps of countless nations. 
   The club deserves our recognition today, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (TO SECURE OUR BORDER -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Department of State recently issued a travel warning alerting American citizens about the deteriorating  security situation in Mexico. Violence has become so widespread and rampant that even the State Department is having difficulty papering over the problems with diplomatic language. 
   According to the travel warning, which was issued last month, a war between criminal organizations struggling for control of the lucrative narcotics trade continues along the U.S.-Mexico border. That's right, a war, and it's in our back yard. And the blood bath isn't only claiming Mexican casualties. According to the State Department, Americans have been among the victims of homicides and kidnappings in the border region. Dozens of U.S. citizens were kidnapped and/or murdered in Tijuana in 2007. There have been public shootouts during daylight hours near shopping areas. 
   And this conflict between drug cartels is not just a neighborhood turf war fought between dime store thugs with switchblades. According to the travel warning, the conflict between the Mexican Government and ``heavily armed narcotics cartels has escalated to levels equivalent to military small-unit combat and have included use of machine guns and fragmentation grenades. Criminals are armed with a wide array of sophisticated weapons. In some cases, assailants have worn military uniforms and have used vehicles that resemble police vehicles.'' 
   And endemic corruption in Mexico's government is tipping the scales in favor of the cartels. Police and soldiers desert their posts to give traffickers inside knowledge about tactics and surveillance. And because of their history of corruption and abuse, the police and army are often less popular than the drug cartels who hand out cell phones and employ taxi drivers and youth as lookouts. 
   Several high-ranking police officials have been gunned down in Mexico this month. This includes Mexico's Acting Federal Police Chief, Edgar Millan Gomez, who was killed by the Sinaloa cartel. In another case, a Mexico City district police chief was the target of a bomb that exploded near the police headquarters. Saul Pena, who was to be named one of the five police chiefs in Ciudad Juarez on the border with Texas, was shot dead earlier this month, making him the 20th police official to be killed in Juarez this year. 
   Just yesterday, a new Juarez police chief quit his post after receiving death threats. And more than 100 of the city's 1,700-member police force have quit their jobs since January. Several Mexican police commanders have crossed into the United States and are seeking asylum, saying they are unprotected and fear for their lives. And who can blame them? 
   According to the Associated Press, ``Police who take on the cartels feel isolated and vulnerable when they become targets, as did 22 commanders in Ciudad Juarez when drug traffickers named them on a handwritten death list. It was addressed to those who still don't believe in the power of the cartels. Of the 22, seven have been killed, three wounded in assassination attempts. Of the others, all but one have quit, and city officials said they didn't want to be interviewed.'' 
   The Zetas, an infamous group of soldiers turned drug hit men are perhaps the most notorious of the drug enforcers. In Mexico, they hang banners above bridges offering jobs, good-paying family benefits to soldiers and police who desert their posts and join the narcotraffickers. The message the drug cartels are sending, Mr. Speaker, is clear: ``Join us or die.'' 
   Many Americans might be shocked to learn that many of the Zetas receive their advance training courtesy of the American taxpayer. And the Bush administration is poised to make the problem worse by providing an additional $1.4 billion in assistance for this purpose. With just $1.4 billion in taxpayer aid, the argument goes, we can train Mexican police and military to better fight the armed elements of the drug cartels. 
   But we've been there before. Our border patrol agents in Texas and California have already seen U.S.-provided Humvees and other equipment being used by drug cartels and by rogue units of the Mexican military assisting the smugglers. 
   Mr. Speaker, handing out another $1 billion in taxpayer money to a Mexican government so rife with corruption so we can watch the scenario repeat itself makes about as much sense as dropping cash out of helicopters. A better use of the $1.4 billion, Mr. Speaker, would be to secure our own border before any more of this violence spills over to our country and across that dangerous frontier which is separating us from Mexico.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (TWO MICHELLES, TWO AMERICAS & SHAME V. PRIDE -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, an article came across my desk earlier today which I believe needs and deserves the attention of this House. It is titled, ``2 Michelles, 2 Americas & Shame v. Pride.'' It was written by Michelle Malkin. 
   She writes: ``Like Michelle Obama, I am a 'woman of color.' Like Michelle Obama, I am a working mother of two young children. Like Michelle Obama, I am member of the 13th generation of Americans born since the founding of our great Nation. 
   ``Unlike Michelle Obama, I can't keep track of the numbers of times I have been proud--really proud--of my country since I was born and privileged to live in it. At a recent speech in Milwaukee, Mrs. Obama remarked, `For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country, and not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change.' 
   ``Mrs. Obama's statement was met with warm applause from those who also are apparently devoid of pride in their country during their adult lifetimes. Or maybe it was a Pavlovian response to the word `change.' What a sad, empty, narcissistic, ungrateful, unthinking lot. 
   ``I am just 7 years younger than Ms. Obama. We have grown up and lived in the same era. And yet, her self-absorbed attitude is completely foreign to me. What planet is she living on? Since when was now the only time the American people have ever been `hungry for change'? 
   ``We were both adults when the Berlin Wall fell. That was an earth-shattering change. We lived through two decades of peaceful, if contentious, election cycles under the rule of law, which have brought about change and upheaval, both good and bad. We were adults through several launches of the space shuttle, in case you were snoozing. And as adults, we've witnessed and benefited from dizzyingly rapid advances in technology, communications, science, and medicine pioneered by American entrepreneurs who yearned to change the world and succeeded. 
   You want `change'? Go ask the patients whose lives have been improved and extended by American pharmaceutical companies that have flourished under the best economic system in the world. 
   ``If American ingenuity, a robust constitutional republic, and the fall of communism don't do it for you, then how about American heroism and sacrifice? How about every Memorial Day, every Veterans Day, every Independence Day, every medal of honor ceremony? Has she never attended a ``welcome home ceremony'' for the troops? For me, there is a thrill of the Blue Angels roaring over the cloudless skies, and there is the somber awe felt amid the hallowed waters that surround the sunken USS Arizona and Pearl Harbor Memorial.     
   Every naturalization ceremony I've attended where hundreds of new Americans raise their hands to swear an oath of allegiance to this land of liberty has been a moment of pride for me, so has the awesome display of American compassion at home and around the world when millions of Americans rallied to help victims of the 2004 tsunami on Southeast Asia, including members of the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group that sped from Hong Kong to assist the survivors. My heart filled with pride. It did again when the citizens of Houston opened their arms to Hurricane Katrina victims and folks across the country rushed to their churches and offices of the Salvation Army and Red Cross to volunteer. 
   How about American resilience? Does it not make you proud? Only a heart of stone could be unmoved by the strength, the valor and determination displayed by New York, Washington, D.C. and Shanksville, Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001. 
   I believe it was Michael Kinsley who quipped that a gaffe is when a politician tells the truth. In this case, it's what happens when an elite Democrat politician's wife says what a significant portion of her party's base really believe to be truth: America is more a source of shame than pride. 
   Michelle Obama has achieved enormous professional success, political influence and personal acclaim in America. Ivy League educated, she's been lauded by Essence magazine as one of the 25 Most Inspiring Women, by Vanity Fair as one of the ten World's Best-Dressed Women, and named one of `The Harvard 100' most influential alumni. She has an amazingly blessed life, but you wouldn't know it from her campaign rhetoric or her griping about her and her husband's student loans. 
   For years we've heard liberals get offended by any challenge to their patriotism. And so they are again aggrieved and rising to explain away Ms. Obama's remarks. Lady Michelle and her defenders protest too much. 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud of America for many reasons, not the least of which is because it helped shape the character of Michelle Malkin.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply suspends the Visa Waiver Program for fiscal year 2008. 
   The Visa Waiver Program was established in 1986 as a temporary, and I underline temporary, program to allow tourists or short-term business visitors to enter the United States for 90 days or less without obtaining a visa. The program was later made permanent by Congress and currently allows nationals of 27 countries into the United States with a simple stamp. 
   The Visa Waiver Program ill advisedly trusts the security of our Nation to the background check capabilities and passport procedures of foreign governments. There are numerous instances of terrorists and would-be terrorists who have exploited this program, or easily could have. 
   September 11 conspirator Zacharias Moussaoui is a great example of this. He exploited the Visa Waiver Program to travel to the United States. The 9/11 Commission stated that ``a maximum U.S. effort to investigate Moussaoui conceivably could have unearthed his connections. Those connections might have brought investigators to the core of the 9/11 plot.'' 
   It's an interesting case because, of course, he was actually under investigation at the time by the French Government, by their secret service. Had we required a visa program that allowed for us to conduct that kind of background check, we may very well have identified those connections and not allowed him the visa. It seems clear that a maximum effort would include a thorough vetting of those seeking access to the United States. 
   Would-be ``shoe bomber'' terrorist Richard Reid exploited the Visa Waiver Program to board the flight he tried to bomb. The London subway bombing was executed in large part by British citizens with known ties to terrorism. Under the Visa Waiver Program, any British citizen can travel to the United States without having to apply for a visa and without giving our government the ability to do even a cursory investigation as to whether he or she may have ties to a terrorist group. British citizen Hemant Lakhani is just such an example. He was busted in a sting in New Jersey in 2003 when he tried to sell shoulder-fire surface-to-air missiles to a Federal operative who he believed to be a Somali terrorist plotting against American jetliners. 
   Mr. Chairman, we cannot give those who wish to harm us open access to America under the cloak of the Visa Waiver Program. We need to suspend the program until we are equipped to check the criminal and terrorist background of every visitor who arrives at any port of entry to confirm the identity of each visitor using the biometric identifiers. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Chairman, if passports alone provided the kind of security that the gentleman suggests they provide, then of course we would not need visas at all. Why would we impose this particular kind of background check if passports alone gave us the kind of security that we need to make sure that the people entering this country are, number one, who they say they are, and more importantly, that their backgrounds do not show anything that might suggest that they should not be allowed into the country. 
   But don't just take my word for it. Listen to what former DHS Inspector General Clark Kent Ervin recently said: ``We ought to be ending the Visa Waiver Program, not expanding it. There is a reason why terrorists are keen to obtain passports from visa-waiver countries. They don't have to undergo extensive security checks.'' 
   So when you say there is no opposition to the program, I would suggest that that is not correct. There certainly are people involved with the program who feel as I do, that we need to abandon this particular visa-waiver idea. 
   And the IG isn't alone. Last September, the Government Accountability Office found that stolen passports from visa-waiver countries are prized travel documents among terrorists, criminals and immigration law violators. Based on a State Department report from January 2002 until June 2004, 28 foreign governments reported 56,943 stolen blank foreign passports. The Director of the U.S. National Central Bureau of Interpol has said that for 55 of the 181 Interpol countries, there were probably over 10 million lost and stolen passports that might be in circulation. In August of 2004, according to CBP, their database contains 1.2 million records of stolen passports. Notably, between January and June of 2005, DHS confiscated 298 passports issued by visa-waiver countries that travelers were attempting to use at ports of entry to fraudulently enter the United States.  
   I encourage the adoption of the amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's time has expired.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that I offered many times in the past. It was actually passed by the House, I believe, in the last session. The fact is that we need to, unfortunately, run at it again. 
   My amendment would prevent State and local governments who refuse to share information with Federal immigration authorities from obtaining Federal funds under this act. These are so-called sanctuary policies, and they are not only misguided and dangerous, but they also are illegal. 
   That is an interesting aspect of this that we have brought to the attention of the Congress many times in the past. There is in fact a law. It has been on the books now for over 10 years. Section 642 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 already makes it illegal for a State or local government to block communications between State and local police and Federal immigration enforcement authorities. 
   Unfortunately, there are no provisions for enforcement. Therefore, many local governments adopt policies that explicitly prevent their police officers from cooperating with immigration and Customs enforcement agents. 
   A recent example of this increasingly brazen defiance of Federal law is the City of San Francisco. Just a couple of months ago, Mayor Gavin Newsome assured a concerned audience that he would ``not allow any of his department heads or anyone else associated with the city to cooperate in any way, shape or form with these immigration raids.'' Unfortunately, San Francisco is not is not the only jurisdiction in this category. 
   When local governments refuse to share information with Federal immigration authorities, police departments often stop and/or arrest criminal aliens time and time again, only to release them without ever checking their immigration status. As a result, instead of being deported, these aliens move on to commit other crimes. 
   The City of Denver also has a sanctuary city policy that violates Federal law. Their police manual explicitly prohibits officers from initiating actions whose objective is to ``discover the immigration status of a person.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I can tell you from my own experience that there have been numerous occasions where this sanctuary city policy in Denver alone has resulted in the deaths of individuals, and certainly other kinds of crimes being perpetrated, because people that were involved with these murders and/or manslaughter charges that were brought against them were illegal aliens. They had come in contact at some time in the past with the authorities, but because of these sanctuary city policies, none of the authorities were able to communicate with ICE and therefore, of course, these people went undetected and otherwise almost certainly would have been taken into custody and deported and those crimes would not have been committed. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Chairman, talking about not telling local communities what they should do, we have a law. It is on the book. I am not imposing new legislation telling communities what to do, I am simply assessing a penalty for the law that already exists. 
   It is interesting that the gentleman would bring up New York City. As a matter of fact, in New York City there was a case where there was a woman brutally raped by five people, four of whom were illegal immigrants and had already come in contact with the police many times. It was that case that made New York City rethink, albeit temporarily, their whole sanctuary city policy, and they did take it away for a while because of that. They have sort of reimposed it. 
   Also, the 9/11 hijackers, had we known that they had been stopped before, which they actually had, if they had come in contact with the police, which they did, we may have been able to stop them had we not had sanctuary city policies in place, not just in New York but throughout the country. 
   These are cities violating the law at the present time. Honestly, I am not trying to make new law, just enforce existing law. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tancredo). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, the approaching vote on this resolution has caused me and I am sure many of my colleagues to give serious and considerable thought to the most difficult issue that faces America today. 
   Like many of my friends on both sides of the aisle, and like many Americans I am opposed to increasing our troop presence in Iraq. I am sure we have all asked ourselves individually what we would do if we were in the oval office at this time. 
   If I were in the oval office, if I were Commander in Chief, I would tell the Iraqis something similar to what Benjamin Franklin told a woman who asked him as he came out of the negotiations on the Continental Congress, Dr. Franklin, what have you given us? He answered, a Republic if you can keep it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe we have with our blood and treasure already won a great victory when we deposed a dictator and helped the Iraqis set up a fledgling democracy. Frankly, I believe it is up to them to keep it. 
   Mr. Speaker, the fall of Saddam has helped create a situation in the Middle East that we did not anticipate but one that can be exploited. I believe that the ethnic and sectarian earthquake inside and across the broader Middle East is underway. I believe the fault lines in this conflict can be seen moving today, not just in Iraq, but in Lebanon, Iran and elsewhere. 
   If I were Commander in Chief, I would do what I could to exploit the situation. I believe it can be exploited, but not if we are acting as a referee in what has become a civil war. I believe that prolonging or increasing the U.S. presence in Iraq will virtually guarantee this fault line will move in a way not advantageous to us. 
   Sure, if I was President, Mr. Speaker, I can tell you unequivocally I would not be sending an extra 20,000 soldiers. But I am not President of the United States, I am not Commander in Chief, I am a Member of Congress. And while I have every right as a Member of Congress to voice my concerns and objections to what I see as flaws in the strategies this President may choose to employ, neither I nor this Congress has the right to micromanage a war. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Constitution vests sole authority of the U.S. military in the President of the United States, not in 435 Congressmen or 100 Senators. Our Founding Fathers empowered the President, not the Congress, with the authority precisely to avoid the kind of group micromanagement of our military strategy that we are seeing on this floor today. 
   I differ with the President on many things, Mr. Speaker. Indeed one of them is the recently announced surge strategy. But while I am concerned about the wisdom of the strategic military decision, Congress does not have the authority nor the ability to manage this war or any other by committee. 
   I fear that this resolution is just the beginning of a long-term attempt by Congress to become the micromanager of the conflict in Iraq. As many Members have correctly noted, this resolution is nonbinding, but it has been described by its authors as just the bark from the Congressional dog. The bite will come as they say during the appropriations process. 
   As I said at the beginning, Mr. Speaker, for a time this resolution posed a dilemma for me. But after hours of listening to the debate, reading the Constitution, it helped me to decide how to vote, there is no longer a doubt in my mind. I accept the wisdom of the Founding Fathers and bend to the constraints of the document that we swear to uphold and defend. 
   I hope that Members of both sides will think carefully about the precedent that this debate will set for the future, for future Presidents, future wars, future soldiers. I would ask them to join me in opposing this ill-conceived resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING HIGH LEVEL VISITS BY OFFICIALS OF TAIWAN -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 136. ... 
   This common-sense legislation is long overdue. 
   This resolution will help open the lines of communication between government leaders in Taiwan, and their counterparts here in the United States. 
   The resolution makes it clear once again that the U.S. Department of State that they should not take actions to prevent high level exchanges between the government of Taiwan and the government of the United States. I say ``again'' because Federal law already makes it clear that high ranking Taiwanese officials are already explicitly authorized to visit the United States. 
   Public Law 103-416 says that the President of Taiwan or any other high-level should be admitted for discussions with U.S. government officials about important policy issues unless he or she is excludable under the immigration laws of the United States. 
   Unfortunately, like so many other laws this Congress has passed, is simply ignored by the State Department. The Department seems more interested in complying with communist China's demands than in following the laws made by this democratically elected Congress. 
   As a result of this defiance, it has become nearly impossible for President Chen, Vice President Annette Lu and other high ranking Taiwanese officials travel to Washington, DC even for routine meetings with administration officials. Instead, these officials are often confined to cities far from the Nation's Capital, and often only then as a point of transit en route to another country. This is unconscionable. 
   Mr. Speaker, we host all kinds of foreign leaders in Washington because a two-way dialogue is important for maintaining and improving our cultural, economic--and yes--security interests around the world. Keeping an open channel with our democratic allies in Taiwan is part of that process. 
   I am pleased that my friend Mr. CHABOT has worked so hard to bring this bill to the floor today. And I strongly support his efforts to help improve our communication with our friends and allies in Taiwan.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (RELIGIOUS WORKER VISA EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 5570, a bill which will again reauthorize the Religious Worker Visa. The new majority apparently thinks we need to add ``ministry'' to the list of jobs that ``Americans won't do.'' Then again, with the level of hostility the Democrats have towards religion in America, there may come a time when we do have to import religious workers. Fortunately, we aren't to that point quite yet. 
   Regrettably, this program is far from comical. Just last year, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service attested to the fact that this visa had been ``compromised.'' The fraud rate is ``excessively high'' according to Emilio Gonzalez, head of USCIS. In fact, a DHS fraud-prevention task force found that a whopping 33 percent of the visas in this program were granted based on fraudulent information. 
   Even worse, rampant fraud and abuse has characterized this program, practically since its inception in 1990. A GAO report about the program back in 1999 found that, ``As a result of . . . fraud investigations, both [the State Department and the INS] have expressed concern that some individuals and organizations that sponsor religious workers may be exploiting this category to enable unqualified aliens to enter or stay in the United States illegally.'' 
   Madam Speaker, some might point out that this program is not very large in the scope of the total number of visas. But I would remind them that we know the amount of damage a handful of determined enemies can inflict when they are allowed to abuse our visa system. 
   The last thing we want to do is perpetuate a program we know is fatally flawed, and continue a policy that just might be rolling out a welcome mat for some of the most radical imams in the Middle East. I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. Let's close this giant loophole in our national security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. I thank the gentleman. 
   Earlier someone indicated that we had thousands of supporters, thousands  of groups supporting this bill. Who couldn't get thousands of groups to support a bill by paying them $300 billion in subsidies? 
   We are poised here to pass a record-breaking, multibillion-dollar, Soviet-style central planning farm bill that takes tax dollars away from the general public and doles them out to a few people in the agricultural industry, some of them millionaires, at a time when crop prices are breaking records. 
   What benefit do the American taxpayers get from this bill? They get higher taxes for the privilege of paying artificially higher food prices. What a deal. 
   Mr. Speaker, when oil prices hit record highs, the Democrat leadership and some Republicans called for the imposition of a windfall profits tax on greedy evil oil producers. But when crop prices skyrocket, the same leadership comes to the floor of this House to hand out billions of dollars in subsidies to big agricultural businesses and wealthy hobby farmers. 
   America, what a country. Washington, what a disaster.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, earlier a gentleman who addressed the House talked about the issue of voter fraud, and he was concerned about the fact that there were States that were actually trying to do something about it using voter IDs in order to make sure that the person who is at the polls is, in fact, who they say they are. 
   Now, we may think that there is no such thing as voter fraud. The fact is that unfortunately there's an enormous amount of voter fraud. I recalled as I was listening to the gentleman speak on this issue, and I cannot remember now the county, but I remember hearing about a county that sent out a notice to all of its citizens with regard to being empaneled as jurors. And of course, one of the questions they asked on this is whether or not you were a citizen, and if you checked that, then you were not eligible to sit on a jury. 
   Well, they then went and took the information apparently and looked at the voter information rolls, and there were hundreds of people that had identified themselves as not citizens for the purpose of serving on a jury because they didn't want to do that, because they were not citizens and they were willing to say so, and on the other hand, they had registered to vote because they also wanted to do that. That was okay with them. 
   Of course, this is in just one particular county, and as I say, I can't recall it now, but I just was thinking about that as I heard him because there are all kinds of things that are happening throughout this country and have been happening for a long time that attack the whole concept of citizenship. 
   We keep taking things away from that idea of what it means to be a citizen, bestowing these same privileges on anyone who happens to be here. Simply a resident, that's all it takes anymore. 
   There are cities, of course, that call themselves sanctuary cities and allow people who are not even legally present in this country the ability to have all kinds of services, to stay essentially hidden from the authorities because  they have broken the law by entering this country without our permission, but they are given this special sanctuary status, and they were given not only that but a lot of other kinds of benefits. 
   Recently, just as sort of the, I don't know, one of these I can't believe it's true stories that I hear almost every single day, something happened in Los Angeles that really points out again the fact that we are moving ever more closely to making the term ``citizenship'' meaningless. 
   Madam Speaker, the L.A. Times ran a story about the illegal immigration epidemic in this country and how much it was putting pressure on our most vulnerable citizens, in this case, those awaiting organ transplants. And they picked out one particular individual, a lady by the name of Ana Puente who was here illegally.     
   She had already undergone three liver transplants, two in 1989, and a third in 1998, each paid for by taxpayers, in this case, by the taxpayers of California under a program that allows for any individual in California to be eligible for this kind of medical service up until the time that they are 21 years old. And if they are unable to pay for it, the State pays for it. 
   Well, when Ms. Puente turned 21 last June, she aged out of her taxpayer-funded health insurance in California. So what did she do? She found out something very interesting. She found out that if she was here illegally, which she was, and notified U.S. Immigration and Customs of that fact, then at that point in time she would be eligible for the service, a free service. She would be eligible for the medical service that she wanted. Why? Because illegal aliens in this country are entitled to benefits under the Medi-Cal system. So when she admitted her illegal status in the country, her benefits were restored, and she is now awaiting her fourth transplant at taxpayer expense. 
   Madam Speaker, what this means is that in California, if you're an illegal alien, you're entitled to taxpayer-funded health care for complex procedures like organ transplants. If you're an American, you may be out of luck. How much money are we talking about? Well, the average cost of a liver transplant and the first year of follow up runs about $500,000; anti-rejection medications alone can run about $30,000 annually. As we all know well, liver donors are also in scarce supply. In California alone, 4,000 people are awaiting livers. 
   It is amazing. We all know that the health care system is a triage system. Some things are allowed, some things are available. One of the things that should be considered is legal status in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (A STRANGE REWARD FOR HEROIC ACTION -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor as I have so many times in the past to address an issue dealing with our extradition policy. 
   Mr. Speaker, a gentleman by the name of Duane Chapman, a bounty hunter that goes by the name of ``Dog,'' faces the strangest of rewards for heroic action. 
   In 2003, Mr. Chapman received a tip regarding the whereabouts of a millionaire by the name of Andrew Luster. Mr. Luster was a convicted felon who had fled as an escapee from the California Department of Corrections 6 months earlier by jumping $1 million bail on charges that he drugged and raped three women. He was also on the FBI's Most Wanted List, convicted and sentenced to a term of 124 years of imprisonment in absentia for 86 counts of rape, drug and weapons offenses. 
   Mr. Chapman went to Mexico to act on this tip and was accompanied by a local Mexican police officer. He was also in communications with U.S. officials, who were aware of his activities. 
   Much to his credit, Mr. Chapman successfully located Mr. Luster and apprehended him. However, on the way to the jail to book Mr. Luster, Chapman's police escort disappeared, strangely. As a result, Mr. Chapman was detained for several days on the relatively minor charge of deprivation of freedom and conspiracy. Mr. Chapman then returned to the U.S. after posting bail. 
   Thanks to Dog, a serial rapist is now rightly serving a 124-year sentence and the situation seemed to have worked out for the best. But now, years after the fact, it seems that the Mexican Government is intent on extraditing and prosecuting Mr. Chapman. Incredibly, our State Department seems to have no problem being complicit in these proceedings. 
   I have written the Department of Justice at least once and the Department of State several times just asking them to justify what they have done. I wanted to figure out exactly what their reasoning is for handling this specific case in this way. 
   There are a lot of legitimate questions. For instance, how is it possible that the Department of Justice would decide to use taxpayer resources to send U.S. Marshals to Hawaii to take Mr. Chapman into custody?     
   This is an administration that routinely tells Congress that they cannot secure our borders and immigration system due to lack of resources. We are told that the U.S. Attorney's Office in the border States are simply overwhelmed with cases and cannot prosecute all of the violations, even very serious ones. We are told that ICE can't possibly tackle the task of deporting illegal aliens from the interior of our Nation. We are apparently supposed to accept the presence of roughly 100,000 criminal aliens inside our borders, a number that is growing every year, while the U.S. Marshals track down a successful bounty hunter instead. 
   After formally apprehending Mr. Chapman and putting him into a bevy of new legal proceedings, the question of extradition is raised. Though my observations of our extradition treaty with Mexico indicate that it is not absolutely binding, conventional wisdom has seemed to assume that the treaty between the U.S. and Mexico requires Chapman's extradition. But it is just this, conventional wisdom. It is not part of the treaty, apparently. 
   I am not the only one to question whether extradition ought to proceed. One recent news story reported that although the U.S. and Mexico informally agreed to recognize trans-border captures by bounty hunters as extraditable offenses, this provision was never fully incorporated into the extradition treaty. The report indicates that this ``informal'' addition to the treaty came after bounty hunters captured a gentleman by the name of Humberto Alvarez-Machain, a Mexican physician implicated in the torture and execution of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agent. Alvarez-Machain maintained that his capture violated the U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor tonight to speak on a subject that I have spoken on many, many times over the course of my career in this Congress. This will be the last time I will be able to address this body in a Special Order on this particular issue. 
   I am reminded of nearly a decade ago when I arrived in the House of Representatives in 1999 and there was really no organized effort to facilitate a discussion on the critical issue of immigration and immigration reform. The task I felt at that time was to bring it to the Nation's attention any way I could, being one Member of the House and as a freshman, there are relatively few ways to accomplish that goal. One way was to address the House through the Special Order process, and I did that night after night after night. 
   I would sometimes walk away from here thinking it may have been a futile gesture. I would leave here and it would be quite late walking across to my office in Longworth, and I would look back at the Capitol dome and I would see the light shining on it and I would think about the importance of what I was trying to accomplish here. And at my office, there were always lights on the phones, I could see people calling and hear the fax machine going, and I knew there were people out there who were listening to this discussion and who were responding to it and that always gave me the energy to continue the discussion, to come back the next night and do whatever I could to get people to focus on what I considered to be and what I still consider to be one of the most serious problems facing the Nation. Certainly it is one of the most serious domestic problems facing the Nation. 
   Now we are talking about a financial crisis and it has sucked up all of the energy in the room and all of the energy on Capitol Hill. All of the oxygen has been sucked up by this discussion, and I understand why. It is a crucial issue, crucial to our constituents and enormously important throughout the world, as a matter of fact. 
   It is important I think also to recognize there is an aspect of this discussion which does go back to the original issue of illegal immigration into the country, and it is no small part of the problem that we now face.  
   Several months ago in my own county, Jefferson County, Colorado, the district attorney indicted several realtors and mortgage brokers for fraudulently developing documents for people who were here illegally so they could buy homes. By the way, it is not necessarily illegal in the United States, as peculiar as this may sound, it is not illegal for someone who is here illegally to purchase a home, but it is certainly illegal to doctor the documents, to falsify the Social Security and tax records. Now this is a tiny story. How does it relate to this issue. 
   One county in Colorado, three or four realtors, three or four mortgage brokers, accounted for 250 homes being sold in just that county in Colorado. Across the Nation, this phenomenon accounts for hundreds of thousands of homes that have been sold to people who are here illegally. There have been major industries, certainly major banks in this country that were devoted to trying to identify illegal aliens as a niche market to both make them loans, to identify them as potential bank customers so they can get the mortgage. 
   We saw hundreds of millions, in fact hundreds of billions of dollars flow into these mortgages. Now what has happened? The economy has gone sour. Immigration reform efforts have gotten to the point where we actually are now conducting raids at some of the major factories and meat packing plants across the country. And also States have taken on this responsibility themselves and have passed laws. Because the Federal Government has been so lax, we have States taking up the burden and passing laws to do something about illegal immigration in their State, and local communities doing the same thing. 
   The result is lots of people are leaving, going home. To the extent so much so that in Mexico, the president of Mexico issued an urgent plea for us to do something to stop the flow of illegal aliens back to Mexico because they couldn't handle it. They wanted us to secure our border, maybe to build a fence. There were so many returning that they could not handle the influx. 
   What does that mean for us and the issue of this mortgage problem that we are having? It means that all of those people simply walked away from those mortgages, those hundreds of thousands of homes that were on the market. They walked away because of course they had nothing at stake. They were given 100 percent loans, sometimes even more than that. Their names were oftentimes falsified. They had nothing at stake, were illegally in the country, so it was easy to walk away. They walked away from the homes and we are stuck with the mortgages, and they are now part of this huge bailout we are trying to focus on and deal with as the Congress of the United States. 
   We haven't talked about that as an issue, but I suggest to you it is an enormous issue. No one wants to talk about it, just like no one wanted to talk about this issue for the last 10 years. 
   Only recently have we seen a bit of a change. In 1999, I founded the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus, and six people agreed to join initially. The task I felt again was something that I had to undertake. It was one of those things that I decided to add to the repertoire, if you will, of talking about it here at night, forming an immigration reform caucus and trying to get people to pay attention.     
   Well, there have been--I don't know--hundreds of speeches, literally thousands of radio spots that I have done and interviews that I have done on this particular issue, thousands of speeches that I have given around the country. 
   Things have begun to change, and I am extremely happy about that. We certainly have more members of the caucus now headed by BRIAN BILBRAY, over 100 members, both Republicans and Democrats, and a number of things have happened around the country that are worthy of note. 
   The Minuteman Project showed the Nation how a few hundred concerned citizens could shut down border traffic with lawn chairs and cell phones, just doing what they could do in their spare time as American citizens looking for a lawful way to address the issue of illegal immigration. Thousands of people did it. It was a wonderful thing to observe even though, by our own President, they were called vigilantes, and of course, they were the people who were actually enforcing the law as opposed to the President, who was ignoring it. 
   We've had governors of southern border States, Democrats and Republicans alike, declare states of emergency in their individual States because of the massive number of illegal immigrants who have come across the borders. We've had small towns, communities all over this country do what Mayor Barletta did in the small town of Hazleton, Pennsylvania when he passed ordinances against hiring or renting to illegal aliens. He earned national attention and a crucial battle with the ACLU for that. 
   Of course, I mentioned earlier there are other States, States like Arizona, Oklahoma, Georgia, that have taken up this issue themselves because, again, they looked for help from the Federal Government and could not find it, but they have passed wonderful bills to deal with this, saying that employers in their respective States have to use the E-Verify system to make sure that the people they have hired are here legally. 
   Legislatively, we've seen other things that seemed impossible a while back. In October of 2004, Speaker Hastert's H.R. 10, which came out of the 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act, was passed in the House, and it substantially targeted immigration-related weaknesses related to terrorist travel. 
   The following month, I used a rarely employed conference rule to force a Republican Conference meeting and postpone a vote on the Intelligence reform bills because immigration-related provisions had been stripped from the conference report. The shutdown resulted in the promise that became the Real ID Act, which became the law the following year. It mandates standards for the issuance of driver's licenses that would preclude the eligibility of illegal aliens. 
   In 2006, the Secure Fence Act became law, mandating the construction of approximately 800 miles of fencing and infrastructure on the U.S.-Mexico border. Three hundred miles of that fence have been completed. 
   The most important tool in forcing Congress to deal with immigration is the amendment process that we have here. In 2003, I began offering amendments to spending bills, seeking to enforce Federal laws that prohibit sanctuary cities. This was a new strategy, and I began to build a record for all of my colleagues. No longer could Members just speak in platitudes about immigration. They had to put their money where their mouths were and cast a vote up or down on these real issues. 
   I brought amendments on the sanctuary policy's temporary protected status by removing reimbursements for illegal alien health care, by repealing food stamps for immigrants, by suspending the Visa Waiver Program, by revoking visas for countries that refuse reparations. 
   As the votes began to pile up, the voting habits of my colleagues began to change. The first sanctuary amendment I offered in 2003 got 102 votes. Now we regularly pass these amendments. The real catalyst was President Bush's speech in 2004, which caused widespread outrage with the amnesty proposal. Our constituents showing the vast disconnect between themselves and the beltway elite started making their views known with the benefits of high-paid lobbyists. 
   Like most Americans, I was delighted to watch the immigration proposal go down to defeat in the U.S. Senate. First and foremost, it demonstrated how widely unpopular the notion of granting amnesty to illegal aliens is with the American people. More importantly, however, Congress' rejection of the bill may have signified the high watermark for advocates of ever increasing levels of immigration, both legal and illegal, into the United States. 
   Supporters of the President's immigration plan were forced to even change the rhetoric of the debate as they tried desperately to invent a nonoffensive euphemism for amnesty. We heard it referred to as ``earned legalization,'' as ``comprehensive reform'' and  as ``regularization.'' Despite their efforts, however, Americans made it quite clear that they opposed amnesty. 
   It's not surprising, but the amnesty proposal contained within the bill isn't the only fuel that fueled the grassroots brush fire that killed that bill. Dramatic increases in legal immigration levels proved to be nearly as unpopular as amnesty, and it also contributed to the demise of the legislation. 
   Public concerns about dramatically increased levels of legal immigration helped to derail a similar Senate proposal in 2006 after Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation analyzed how many foreigners the bill would allow into the United States over the next 20 years, some 60 million people. Sheer numbers began to transcend anecdotal stories about friendly immigrant neighbors on the minds of the American public. 
   Indeed, the protracted debate over immigration has voters increasingly focused on what is a very reasonable question: What kind of immigration policy serves our national interest? Not surprisingly, few have stepped forward to defend the status quo or the massive increases proposed by the Senate leadership or the President. Mr. Rector penned a report applicable to that year's Senate concoction. Despite all the talk about how critical low-skilled immigrants are to economic growth, his study confirmed what many already knew, that low-skilled legal and illegal immigrants are a net cost to taxpayers, not a net gain, just as their native-born counterparts are. 
   The Senate bill would have cost our children and grandchildren $2.5 trillion due to amnesty provisions and increased levels of legal immigration authorized by the legislation. Again, it was Mr. Rector's analysis that deeply shook the public's confidence in the Senate's credibility in handling the issue. Once more, the question about legal immigration became relevant in light of that information. 
   Now, I'm not saying that America is ready to install a ``no vacancy'' sign on the Statue of Liberty. At the same time, we cannot discount the increasingly disconcerting public feeling that honoring our tradition of immigration while decreasing the yearly total of immigrants to more sustainable levels are not mutually exclusive goals. A significant decrease similar to that one in the Commission on Immigration Reform advocated in the mid-1990s would be a good first step toward creating a more orderly and sustainable immigration policy in America, such as, by the way, eliminating chain migration and the visa lottery. I continue to believe that a return to traditional immigration levels as well as stepped up enforcement can be won in a matter of months and years, not decades. 
   For one reason I believe that this is what will happen in this seminal legislative moment in my House tenure is that Mr. Sensenbrenner, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, began the process in late 2005 of crafting a comprehensive immigration reform bill--the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act. It passed 239 to 182. Not only did the enforcement bill first receive broad bipartisan support on the final passage but so did stand-alone amendments to build border fencing and to reduce legal immigration by eliminating the Visa Diversity program. 
   Our immigration caucus played a vital role in making sure that not so much as a sense of Congress was allowed to suggest that we needed guest workers. 
   There is still, of course, much to do. I am proud of the accomplishments of the caucus. I am proud of the accomplishments that my colleagues and I, who have fought for immigration reform, have made to this point in time. 
   Certainly, it is the reason, by the way, that I ran for the Presidency of the United States, for the Republican nomination for the Presidency of the United States. With little idea, in fact no idea, that I would actually become the President of the United States in that process, I was nonetheless inspired to do what I did and run for the nomination for President in order to force the people who were on the stage with me during that period of time to address this issue. There was a reluctance in doing so. I know I started the process out in February of last year and ended it in December, and between that time that I started in February to December, there was a complete change in the way each person who was running for that nomination addressed the issue of immigration. Finally, every single person, including the present nominee of the party, agreed that we had to secure the borders first. We must do that. There was no longer ambiguity in their statements about this. Our borders have to be secure. 
   Now, I hope of course that the rhetoric turns into action. I commend to my colleagues here who will be returning next year that their task will be ahead of them to make sure that that is what is done. 
   So we have done a great many things. There are still a lot of concerns that most of us have about where we go from here. It is imperative that we stay strong in our opposition to amnesty of any kind. It is imperative that we push for a border fence and for one that is, in 
   fact, a real deterrent to the flow of illegal immigrants into the country. 
   It is imperative that we never, ever do to anybody else what we've done to Agents Ramos and Compean, who are still imprisoned for essentially doing what they were hired to do in protecting our borders. 
   There are threats to our sovereignty like the Security and Prosperity Partnership and the North American Union. They continue to exist in some form or other. Legal immigration is still at an historical high. The effects of our language and of our culture threaten not only what kind of a nation we will be but whether we will be a nation at all. 
   This leads me to the next part of this discussion and, perhaps, even to the more serious part that we must begin to work with as we have now accomplished a number of goals that we have set and that I have set, essentially, for myself here, which is one of the reasons why I chose not to run again. I mean, when I look back at where I started in this process and where we are now 10 years later, I feel like I have accomplished many of the goals I set for myself in this body. There are many people here who I can turn to now and hand the baton to and know that they will take it up--it's wonderful--to Judge Poe and to STEVE KING. I could go on and on with the number of people who are here today who are committed to doing something about true immigration reform. Hence, I feel very comfortable in taking my leave of this place at this time, but I do so with this caveat: 
   We must never forget the real threat that exists as a result of massive immigration, both legal and illegal, into this country when it merges with what I have often called the cult of multiculturalism. It permeates our society, this cult does. It is an emphasis on all of the things that pull us apart as a society--an emphasis on creating linguistic and cultural enclaves, on turning us into a cultural and linguistic Tower of Babel. It is a focus on all of the negative aspects of Western civilization and the United States' exemplification of Western civilization's greatest attributes. 
   The colleges and institutions of higher education and certainly even our high schools and our K-12 educational system is fraught with this idea of this cult of multiculturalism and the attitude about America and about the west. It permeates all of the textual materials of most of the professors who are at these institutions, who always confront the issue of America and the west and western society in the most negative terms, who are always tearing us down--who we are, what we've built, what we're all about. This is the cult of multiculturalism. When millions of people come into this country, either legally or illegally, who are also interested in ideas and who are interested in things other than becoming an American, we become susceptible to a disease that really will destroy us. It is a disease that works its way from within the body politic in this country, and it is susceptible to an attack from without. 
   We see what's happening today. We have been calling it a war on terror. It is a misnomer. It is incorrect to label it that way. It is not a war on terror that we face and that we are trying to advance. It is a war against radical Islam. Terror is a tactic of radical Islamists. It is not the entity with which we are at war. 
   Lao Tzu, of course, is a famous Chinese philosopher, and he has stated and  has been quoted over the years because of his insight into both the nature of war and into the nature of human beings. He said at one point that there are two things that are desperately needed in order to be successful in any clash. One is the knowledge of who your enemy really is. Who are they? What makes them tick? Why do they do the things they are doing? The other is, he says, a knowledge of who you are. We have to understand who it is we are fighting. Again, it is not simply terrorists.     
   It is radical Islam. Islam's hostility towards the West has nothing to do with American troops in Muslim lands or America's support for Israel or the plight of the Palestinians. The first thing we must understand is that Muslims believe the Koran is the word of god as dictated to Mohammed. It cannot be interpreted by man. This is troubling because the book's passages call for the destruction of opposing religions, the extermination of non-Muslims, and the imposition of a worldwide caliphate. 
   Among other things, the Koran tells Muslims: those who disbelieve we shall roast them in fire, they may feel the punishment. When you meet the unbelievers, smite them, and when you have caused a bloodbath among them, bind a bond firmly on them. Take the infidels captive and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. They that reject faith, take not friends from their ranks and make them flee in the way of Allah ..... seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take no friends from their ranks. Fight them until there is no dissension, and religion is entirely Allah's. Instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers. Prepare for disbelievers chains, yokes, and a blazing fire. Cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve and strike off their heads and fingertips. 
   This is Islam's instruction book, and the instructions are quite clear. 
   So whether we want to admit it or not, the Western world is locked in a struggle against this form of Islam--a religion whose practitioners and adherents are inextricably linked to terrorism. And if we are to successfully defend ourselves against the desire of our enemies to impose a caliphate on the world, we must first be willing to openly identify them, say who they are. 
   Politically correct politicians in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are quick to dispute notions that Islam is inherently violent, and they flatly reject that Islam is engaged in a global struggle to dominate the world. But a quick look around the globe tells a different story. 
   While the most obvious clashes between Islam and the West are taking place in the streets of Israel, in the mountains of Afghanistan, and in the deserts of Iraq, Islam's foot soldiers are waging their war against non-Muslims in all corners of the world. 
   In Sudan, the conflict between the north and the south was basically a conflict between Arab Muslims and southern black Christians. 
   A visiting teacher from Denmark was jailed for insulting Islam after she let her class name a teddy bear ``Mohammad.'' 
   In Thailand, a nation of more than 60 million that is more than 95 percent Buddhist--a nation that is known worldwide for its friendly people and enduring spirit of hospitality--some 3,000 Thais have been killed in brutal uprisings by Muslims who are determined to replace Thailand's democratic kingdom with an Islamic State. 
   Last week, Islamic militants in the southern Thai town of Pattani shot a state official some 30 times with a machine gun as he arrived to visit a school. After the attack, the gunman dragged his body out of the truck and chopped off his head in front of the horrified students and teachers. 
   In the Philippines--a former U.S. territory known more for its food and cathedrals than for Islamic extremism--the government has also been struggling with Islamic militants seeking to overthrow the democratic system and ``return'' the country to its ``pre-Christian 'Moor' national identity.'' 
   This insurgency has gone on for decades and claimed more than 120,000 lives. Over the last few years, Filipino soldiers, priests, other Christians, and non-Muslims have been routinely captured and beheaded. 
   In Indonesia--which is struggling to maintain a democratic system amid calls for the imposition of Sharia law--dozens of demonstrators recently attacked the local ``Playboy'' magazine office, injuring police officers and damaging property. Keep in mind that the Indonesian version of the magazine does not even contain nudity, and is primarily dedicated to Western pop culture and fashion. 
   After the incident, it was not the militants, but Erwin Arnada--the magazine's editor--who was arrested and forced to face charges of violating the country's indecency laws and faces a long prison sentence. 
   For more than 40 years, Malaysia--a former British colony--has successfully balanced its democratic secular form of government with the plurality of its citizens' Muslim roots. Slowly, however, these roots are ripping up the fabric of freedom in this country. 
   In 2005, the country's Federal court system dismissed appeals by four Muslims who were sentenced to 3 years in jail for wrongfully attempting to convert from Islam. Despite the Malaysian constitution's guarantee to all people the right to profess and practice one's own religion, the court disregarded the Federal constitution and ceded jurisdiction of the case to a Sharia court. 
   In 2007, over the objections of his Hindu wife and family, Emm Moorthy--part of the first Malaysian team to climb Mount Everest and an army commando--was declared a Muslim after his death and buried as one. 
   In another case, local authorities refused to recognize the conversion of a Muslim woman to become a Catholic. In addition, the local registrar refused her application for marriage to a Catholic man because Islam prohibits Muslims from marrying non-Muslims. Courageously, she filed suit, optimistic that the Malaysian constitution's provisions for equal protection and freedom would win the day. Unfortunately, amid Islamist protestors' shouts of ``Allah-o-Akbar'' inside the courtroom, a judge dismissed her application finding that ``ethnic Malays'' are constitutionally defined as ``Muslims,'' making conversion from Islam and her marriage to a Catholic man illegal. 
   The judge went on to say that he could not allow her to change her religion because granting her such an exemption would encourage future converts. 
   That's part of the world that we seldom hear about but where actions like this are everyday occurrences. These developments in Asia and Africa are problematic, but the wave of Islam is also washing over Europe's shores. While Islamists work to eliminate legal protections for free speech and free association in Asia and Africa in order to replace pluralism with Islam, they are using these freedoms and the legal system in Europe in order to determine democratic institutions and replace them with Sharia Law, undermining democratic institutions. 
   Sharia Law calls for brutal punishment, such as the stoning of women who are accused of adultery or having children out of wedlock, cutting off the hands of petty thieves, lashings for the casual consumption of alcohol and a failure of women to wear a veil or head-scarf. 
   Muslims in the UK recently used a loophole in the Federal arbitration law to make Islamic Sharia Law and the decisions of the Sharia court legally binding in civil cases in the United Kingdom. 
   A recent poll conducted by the Centre for Social Cohesion in the United Kingdom found that some 40 percent of Muslim students in the United Kingdom support the introduction of Sharia law there, and 33 percent support the imposition of an Islamic Sharia-based government worldwide. Another 32 percent of the British Muslim youth living believe that killing for the religion is acceptable, while 20 percent are unsure. 
   Just days after the London subway attack, Tariq Ali, a prominent British Muslim activist, was quick to suggest that London residents ``paid the price'' for British support in the Iraqi campaign. 
   Another academic, George Hajjar, went even further proclaiming, ``I hope every patriotic and Islamic Arab will participate in this war and will shift the war not only to America but to ..... wherever America may be.'' He added, ``There are no innocent people,'' and referred to the victims of the attack as ``collateral casualties.''  
   In the Netherlands, the number of Muslims has grown from just 54 in 1909 to almost 1 million in 2004. These changes have not come without costs. 
   2002, Pim Fortoon, a politician who expressed concern about the rapid influx of Muslim immigration, was shot six times in the head as he walked to his car. During his court appearance, the killer told the judge in killing Fortoon he ``acted on behalf of the country's Muslims.'' 
   2004. Theo Van Gogh, Dutch filmmaker who had the temerity to make a movie critical of Islam's treatment of women, was shot and killed by a 26-year old Dutch born Muslim in broad daylight in a busy Amsterdam street. After shooting Van Gogh, the jihadist pinned a note to his body threatening the co-author of the script. Then he began the task of decapitating Mr. Van Gogh's lifeless body. 
   Another Dutch politician who has raised concerns about the danger of Islam's rise in Holland, Geert Wilders, has received numerous death threats and is forced to travel with 24-hour day security. According to Mr. Wilders, the Dutch government has completely capitulated to Islamists in the wake of these politically motivated murders. 
   He recently told the Hudson Institute, ``We have gone from calls by one cabinet members to turn Muslim holidays into official state holidays to statements by another cabinet member that Islam is part of Dutch culture,'' to an affirmation by the Christian Democrat Attorney General that he is willing to accept Sharia Law in the Netherlands. And there is another majority. 
   We now have cabinet members who pass with passports from Morocco and Turkey. More alarming still, one half of Dutch Muslims say they understand the 9/11 attacks. 
   Before I go on, going back to the United Kingdom for a moment. The largest mosque in the world is being built outside London. Recently Archbishop of Canterbury said they should have two tracks, a two-track system in England: one Sharia Law and one traditional English law. Mohammed is now the most popular name in England for a child. 
   France is also gripped by the crisis. Muslim rioting gripped the country for weeks last year resulting in death and unprecedented destruction of private property. There are hundreds of areas inside Paris and inside and around Paris where police do not go. They are entirely Muslim areas, and the police are essentially afraid to go in there. 
   The PEW Research Center reported that more than half of all French Muslims loyal to Islam is greater than their loyalty to France, and one in three do not object to suicide attacks. 
   The demographics, of course, are significant, and that is what is causing a significant change in the entire attitude of Western Europe about such things as Islam and the changing of Western laws. 
   That is the point of this, that all of this comes with a cost. There is a challenge to western civilization. We have a system that was established by the concept of the rule of law and many other things that unite us as a Nation in the past and united the West in the past are being threatened and destroyed. 
   Before liberals in America roll out the Islamic welcome mat any farther, they ought to look closely at Europe. As I noted, many Muslims in Europe openly expressed a desire to replace secular democracies there with Islamic caliphates. Hardly surprising when you have an immigration policy that allows for the importation of millions of radical Muslims, you are also importing the radical ideology, an ideology that is fundamentally hostile to the foundations of Western democracy, such as gender equity, pluralism, and individual liberty. 
   These lessons are unfolding in plain sight across the Atlantic in Europe, but what many Americans don't realize is that these same problems are beginning to manifest themselves here in the United States in parts of Michigan, New York, and Virginia. Yes, yet America's political leaders remain asleep at the switch. 
   The PEW Research Center, for example, asked American Muslims between the ages of 18 and 29, When are suicide bombings justified? Twenty-six percent said that they were always justified. Another 15 percent said they were often justified. 
   Another potential threat, settlement poses to the United States is made worse by the fact of the sheer volume of both legal and illegal immigration into our country. Combine that with the rise of culture relativism, political correctness, and the lefts' obsession with diversity, and you have a recipe for disaster as immigrants are prevented from assimilating and separate ethnic cultural communities spring up all over the United States. 
   We are again confronted with this situation, and we are made less able to deal with it because of this, the political correctness that--and this multicultural society that we are creating here. It makes us weaker as a society to deal with this. 
   We are told constantly, as I said earlier, about the deficiencies of the West and that we are not really a country at all, that the United States isn't just a Nation of sovereign people, it is just a place on the planet. Just a place on the continent. 
   It's called America, and if you live here, you're an American. There are no other ties that should bind us, certainly not a linguistic tie, certainly not the English language. That's what they say. I say it is the imperative tie that must bind us. It is the glue that holds our society together. It is the thing that allows us to communicate with each other. And it is imperative that we have something because we have so many things in this country that pull us apart, it is imperative that we have something, anything, that pulls us together. Language is that one thing. 
   Our people come from everywhere around the world from every different kind of culture, religion, color, historical background, and language. We have--something when they come here has got to begin the process of assimilation because immigration without assimilation is creating a phenomena that is like putting a gun to our heads. 
   Examples of this kind of political correctness go on and on. Los Angeles Roosevelt High School. An 11th grade teacher told a nationally syndicated radio program that she hates the textbooks that she's been told to use and the State-mandated history curriculum because they ignore students of Mexican ancestry. Because the students don't see themselves in the curriculum, the teacher has chosen to ``modify the curriculum'' by replacing it with activities like mural walks intended to open the students' eyes to their indigenous culture. 
   A friend of the teacher invited to help with the mural walk went on to tell the students, ``Your education has been one big lie after another.'' 
   In a textbook called, ``Across the Centuries,'' which is used widely across America for the teaching of 7th grade history, the term ``jihad'' is defined as ``to do one's best to resist temptation and overcome evil.''     
   In 2002, the new guidelines for teaching history in the New Jersey public schools failed to mention America's Founding Fathers, the Pilgrims, or the Mayflower. After this became public, New Jersey changed the guidelines. 
   In a Prentice Hall history textbook used by students in Palm Beach County high schools, titled ``A World Conflict,'' the first five pages of the World War II chapter cover such topics as discrimination against women in the Armed Forces, racial segregation during the war, and internment of Japanese Americans, far fewer than are dedicated to the 292,000 Americans who died in the conflict, fighting against totalitarianism and genocide.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (THE PURSUIT OF OIL: ITS ECONOMIC AND NATIONAL SECURITY RAMIFICATIONS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, the other day, I went to fill up my car with gasoline, and the price tag was a little over $75. I gulped because, of course, it's always a shock, and it has been for the last several months every time I've filled up my car, and I know it has been for most persons. 
   Most Americans, I'm sure, do not consider this to be just the price of doing business and having to go to work. ``Okay. No problem. I'll just do this and not complain.'' But, you know, I thought about it, and there are so many people to thank for this situation we're in that I'm paying $75 to fill up my car, and it's probably going to get worse by the way. We all recognize that. I was wondering who to thank for this situation, who to thank every single time I go into the gas station. Who is really responsible? Of course, I think, for every single American, every time they go in to get their gas and every time they look at that pump and have it say something startling back at them like $75 or more, of course, thank your local environmentalist first. Start off there because, of course, it has been years since we've had the kind of control that they've exercised over especially the Democratic Party. As a result of that control that they exercise and the power that they bring to bear, we have been unable to drill for oil in the United States, off of our coasts or in ANWR. 
   So thank them first of all. 
   Then, of course, you could also thank your Democrat Congressman or Senator, if you have one, because, for years now, they've been able to avoid either allowing us to drill for oil in the places where we have oil in this country or, in fact, in the last few months, they've been able to even block any sort of vote on it whatsoever for fear, of course, that they would have to explain such a vote to their constituents. 
   So there are people who we can thank for $75 when you go and fill up your car at the gas station. I just hope every single time this happens to every single American and that, every time they go in and put the credit card in the reader and see that money deducted, they remember who to thank. 
   Also, they should remember this: That it's not just this economic issue. It's not just what it's going to take out of their pocketbooks--mine included--that is causing great pain and consternation. It's also the fact that this is a national security issue. It's not just an economic issue. People are going to have to recognize that we are in a situation, in an international situation, where we are funding our own opponents. The people who want to do us harm are being funded to the tune of billions of dollars a day, every single day, in order to accomplish their goal to eradicate the United States of America from the face of the Earth. 
   Ten years ago, Osama bin Laden said a strange thing. Well, he says many strange things, but this was a particularly odd statement. He said that he wanted to see $144-a-barrel oil. Now, this was 10 years ago. Of course, oil was nowhere near this price, and everybody looked at that statement and thought it was peculiar to say the least, but he said that's what he believed it would have to be in order for the West to pay the price that he believed was deserving by all the Muslims in the world who have had their oil stolen from them over the years. 
   The point is he used oil. He talked about oil as being a tactical part of the war against the West. 
   Well, who would have thought we'd be right at that $140-a-barrel mark within the 10-year period of time that he projected? Who would have thought that that was possible? 
   It also is an indication, as I say, of the fact that we are facing a much bigger problem than just the economic burden. It is imperative that we strip oil of its strategic value. Not only are billions of dollars flowing outside of the United States into countries that are enemies of the United States', but in fact, those dollars do come back to the United States often in terms of investments that are made by countries through things we call sovereign wealth funds. These are funds that are  controlled by governments. There is $3 trillion, we believe, that is controlled by sovereign wealth funds that are primarily in the Middle East or in countries, again, that are opponents of the United States'. $3 trillion. 
   With that money, a lot of things can happen. You could probably even affect, to a certain extent, the futures markets, but you could also, certainly, buy up a lot of stock in a lot of companies. Well, to a certain extent, that's good. That's healthy. I'm not going to argue with the fact that we're getting investment back out of some of those dollars, but some of those dollars go into companies that have very important information available to them that are part of the technological base we have in the United States that we rely upon to keep us one step ahead of the game. Although we try our best to make sure that significant technological advances in strategic areas are not available to countries outside the United States, when you own a lot of stock in those companies, believe me, you have access to a lot of information, and they are making use of it. 
   So there are ramifications to this outflow of dollars in the pursuit of oil, and there are a lot of things we have to do. Yes, build wind towers. Absolutely. Any kind of alternative fuel you want to talk about and pursue is find with me, but when it comes down to it, we have to drill. All of those other things will not solve our problem and certainly not in the time frame that will allow us to breathe easier with the thought that the enemies of the United States' are not actually being enriched by our own need for their oil. We have it. It's abundant. There are trillions of barrels of oil just in the Colorado-Wyoming plateau that are locked up in shale now, but there is technology available that will allow us to extract it. 
   There are all kinds of things that we can do if only the government will get out of the way and allow it to be done. That is what is required. Let's do it as soon as possible.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (PRESIDENT BUSH INSULTS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH HIS SELECTIVE PARDONS AND COMMUTATIONS -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, on March 25, President Bush pardoned 15 people and granted one commutation to crimes that ranged from falsifying records, conspiracy, bank embezzlement, dealing in firearms, distributing marijuana, conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, heroin importation, selling migratory bird parts in violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, aiding and abetting the escape of a prisoner, distributing more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, and a variety of other crimes. 
   This brings to about 157 the number of pardons and/or commutations that President Bush has distributed in his administration in his term in office. And although that number is fewer than other presidents, it in fact is reflective of something that I consider to be a serious problem, and that is this, that although the President has been compassionate or for whatever reason chosen to commute or pardon 157 people up to this point in time, he leaves two Border Patrol agents in jail today because I believe of the misbehavior of the U.S. Attorney in that particular district. And this is unconscionable. 
   This House actually voted last session unanimously to in fact deny funding to the Department of Justice to continue to hold Border Patrol agents Ramos and Compean in the Federal prison where they have been incarcerated now for well over a year. And their terms are for 11 and 12 years. This is because they have been sentenced because of the testimony of a known drug smuggler by the name of Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila, who was given immunity from prosecution by U.S. Attorney Sutton. 
   The SUV that Aldrete was driving was found to contain 743 pounds of marijuana. The jury in the Ramos-Compean trial was never told of Aldrete's criminal background. They were led to believe that Aldrete was a one-time smuggler trying to make money to help a sick relative. In fact, he was a professional drug smuggler, and his history was known to the DEA and to Johnny Sutton, who was the prosecuting attorney, at the time of the trial, but this history was kept from the jury. 
   It has been revealed in documents since the trial that U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton deliberately delayed the arrest of Aldrete for a subsequent drug smuggling incident that occurred while Aldrete was under the grant of immunity but before the trial date. All of this information, of course, was withheld because it would have revealed Aldrete as a professional smuggler, not an innocent victim of the Border Patrol agents. This is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. 
   These mistakes were compounded by asking for a mandatory 10-year sentence for Ramos and Compean for the use of a firearm in the commission of a ``crime.'' The law was never intended to apply to law officers who use their weapons in the performance of their jobs. 
   The key question at the trial was whether the drug smuggler Aldrete had a weapon and had pointed it at one of the Border Patrol agents. Mr. Aldrete denied having such a weapon. It was his word against the testimony of the Border Patrol agents, so the credibility of each witness was critical to the jury's evaluation of the incident, yet the jury was kept in the dark about Aldrete's other arrests and his history as a drug smuggler. 
   The mistakes made by Ramos and Compean in trying to apprehend Mr. Aldrete should have been handled as a violation of agency rules, the failure to write and file a report of an incident involving Aldrete, and punished by a 5-day suspension, not by criminal prosecution. For that reason alone, this conduct rises to the level of reprehensible, the conduct I believe of the U.S. Attorney in this case and of the President of the United States. 
   To compound the injustice in this case, it is widely known that the U.S. Attorney is a friend of the President, going back to his days as Governor. But Bush's refusal to issue a pardon or a commutation amounts to a coverup I believe of this misconduct in this trial. 
   Ramos and Compean have appealed their conviction to the U.S. Circuit Court and a decision on that appeal is due shortly. At the very least they deserve a new trial. President Bush has it within his power to end this injustice now by issuing a pardon or a commutation. I sincerely hope that he takes that responsibility seriously and offers this to Mr. Ramos and Mr. Compean, who are languishing in prison for literally no good reason.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANCREDO. (SANCTUARY CITY SAN FRANCISCO -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, some in the most radical elements of the pro-illegal immigration groups advocate something called ``Reconquista,'' or that is to say, they want to have that part of the United States that was ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. They want to have it voided, and either that chunk of America returned to Mexico or become a second nation. I mean, it's pretty bizarre, but that's what they push for. 
   Sometimes I hear some of the things said by some of the officials in San Francisco. And I would suggest that if advocates for this Reconquista would agree to take San Francisco first, I might be sympathetic to their particular point of view. Because some of the things that are done, some of the statements that are made are quite bizarre, to say the least, and would indicate a lack of willingness on the part of its citizens, or at least expressed by some of its public officials, a lack of willingness to adhere to the laws of this United States of America. 
   The San Francisco Chronicle reported recently that Mayor Gavin Newsom announced a new initiative advertising his city as a sanctuary for illegal aliens. According to this report, San Francisco plans to spend $83,000 to print brochures in half a dozen languages reassuring illegal aliens that they are welcome to stay and access public services. He went on to declare that, we don't care what your status is, we want you to participate in the life of our city. 
   It goes without saying that this is dangerous policy, and it makes no sense in a post 9/11 environment. It's also a flagrant violation of Federal law. In 1996, Congress passed and President Clinton signed immigration enforcement legislation making policies like San Francisco's that provide sanctuary to illegal aliens and potential terrorists by refusing to report them to Federal authorities, making that action illegal, as I say. But unfortunately for America, the Bush Administration doesn't seem to care. 
   Dozens of major cities have enacted these kinds of reckless policies, barring law enforcement personnel from cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement efforts, and with disastrous results I might add. In Denver, a sanctuary city, a police officer was shot and killed and a second officer critically wounded on Mother's Day of 2005 by an illegal alien who was later arrested. He had been stopped twice for driving without a license and had to appear in municipal court twice. In April, less than one month before the shooting, the man was in court with a Mexican driver's license, yet no one asked him about his immigration status because of Denver's sanctuary city policy. If the perpetrator had been deported in April, that police officer might still be alive. 
   This tragic case is just one example, and there are countless others. These policies are responsible for thousands of major crimes around our country, and could have been prevented. These irresponsible city leaders gamble not only with the safety of their own residents, but with the residents of neighboring communities and the entire United States as well. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people have demanded an end to these dangerous policies, and Congress has responded by passing legislation to outlaw them. So the question is, will President Bush allow this rogue mayor to put the rest of the country at risk, or will he finally live up to his oath of office and enforce the law?

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Tancredo-Chabot amendment would prevent the State Department from expending any funds to enforce several arbitrary and archaic guidelines that inhibit or altogether prevent U.S. officials from communicating with their counterparts in Taiwan. These restrictions range from just silly to downright absurd. 
   Among other things, the so-called guidelines do not permit meetings with Taiwanese diplomats or elected officials in State Department buildings, the White House or Old Executive Office Building. They prevent executive branch personnel from the Foreign Affairs agencies and those above the rank of GS-14 from attending Taiwan's annual reception in Washington. They prevent executive branch personnel from attending meetings at Twin Oaks, the former residence of Taiwan's Ambassador here in Washington. They prevent travel to Taiwan by officials above a certain rank from the Defense Department and the State Department. They prohibit executive branch personnel from corresponding directly with Taiwan officials.

   The Federal statute in question instructs the State Department to discontinue the issuance of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas to citizens of countries who refuse our attempts to repatriate or deport their nationals. As I mentioned, the State Department often chooses to disregard this statute. 
   In fact, some dozen nations around the world routinely refuse to accept their citizens who have come here illegally or violated the terms of their visas. Iraq is just one example. As a result, Iraqi aliens who would otherwise be deported are free to remain in the United States. 
   Last year, I sent a letter to Secretary Chertoff asking why an Iraqi national by the name of Gavan Alkadi was not deported but instead was released into the public. Gavan Alkadi have been convicted of an aggravated felony and has been arrested nearly 70 times in Colorado.
