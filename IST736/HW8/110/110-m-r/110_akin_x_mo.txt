<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Archbishop Raymond Burke who, for the last 4 years, has served as the head of the archdiocese in St. Louis. Recently, Archbishop Burke was appointed to the position of the Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura in Rome. 
   During his short tenure in St. Louis, Archbishop Burke helped to revitalize the Catholic community. Under his leadership, the seminary has continued to flourish with respect to the enrollment of the archdiocesan seminarians. I have no doubt that any man with Archbishop Burke's firm convictions and leadership capabilities will flourish wherever he goes. 
   I congratulate Archbishop Burke on his recent appointment to the position of the Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura. It's my hope that St. Louis will always be a place he can call home. 
   Those of us who know him personally know him as a guileless man and a committed defender of truth. Very best wishes, Archbishop Burke, in your new position.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, congressional Democrats are looking to fund $190 billion in spending projects. However, they don't have $190 billion. So the Democrats seem to be disguising the truth from the American people by playing hide and seek. They are hiding $190 billion by claiming it's in a reserve fund. But there isn't any reserve fund. 
   So where will $190 billion come from? Well, the Democrats have voted to terminate the Republican tax cuts of 2001 through 2003. The money will come from the American taxpayers. 
   As much as I strongly disagree with tax increases, the least the Democrats can do is to level with the American people. 
   Rather than playing hide and seek, the Democrats should have the political courage to admit that they are  taxing and spending. The American people deserve to know the truth. After all, it's their money.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (TAX INCREASES HARM THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, as we start a new year, one of the things that we are seeing in the economy is signs of stress. The unemployment is rising somewhat, we see the trouble with the housing market, the savings and loan crisis. Over the past year, the Chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, warned that the Democrat tax increases increasingly threaten our economy. Last year, the Democrats passed a $528 billion tax increase here in the House and proposed the mother of all tax increases, a $3.5 trillion tax increase, the largest in the history of our country. 
   That is exactly the wrong medicine in an economy that is struggling. Instead, what we should be doing is we should be returning a portion of that money that people earn so that it can be invested and strengthen the economy and put us back on the road to recovery, just as we did in 2001 and 2002. It's time for us to understand that tax increases are exactly the wrong medicine when the economy is struggling. I hope the Democrats remember that.

   The first thing I would like to ask, because you are the expert, but I have a little bit of a sense of what's going on here, and first of all the problem is that we are trying to collect intelligence on terrorists that are trying to kill our citizens. Is that what we are dealing with?

And that, I guess, you could look at it as an amendment on the motion to recommit. It was merely a sentence or two. And that sentence said something to the effect that nothing in this bill will prevent us from trying to capture bin Laden or prevent us from gathering information on al Qaeda, and they're attacking this country, something to that effect.

   Mr. AKIN. Well, I appreciate the good work that attorneys do, Mr. Speaker, and I particularly like different attorney jokes. And this one particular joke is the only one I have heard that isn't funny, and that is, how many attorneys does it take to collect intelligence on our enemies? And the answer, exactly as the lady said, should be zero. There should be no doubt about this. 
   Now, you have talked about somewhat subtle or finer points of law, but the bottom line is there is an agency that is charged with following the law and protecting our citizens. Now, the opinion of that agency on this point is what is critical, isn't it? Because if they believe they can't do the collection, then there is going to be 60 percent or more of intelligence gathering that is going to be hobbled. They are not going to have that capability. And their belief is that what you are saying is true because you quoted them; is that right?

   Mr. AKIN. I believe that what you have described is pretty much what we worked out last summer. Just going back to last summer when this problem reared its ugly head, we were approaching September 11. The Democrats had been unwilling to deal with it. We had been going back and forth and back and forth. And as I recall, we basically told the other party we are not leaving for summer break until you get this thing fixed because our Nation is exposed. We are not collecting the information that we need and we have to deal with that. So at the last minute, we passed a 6-month, if you will, patch that takes us to February; is that correct?

   Mr. AKIN. So until February we are able to do this collection at this point, but we have to deal with this problem. 
   Now, the gentlewoman from New Mexico made reference to September 11, and I think each of us have our own memories. But mine was being at the site in New York City and seeing that wall along the side of a city block, four-by-eight sheets of plywood. Covering over the wall was a piece of that kind of slick, greasy plastic that's waterproof, and it had little dots of mist because it was a misty day. And underneath it were pictures. Some black and white, some in color, a picture of a guy with his dog, a husband and wife. And as I looked at those pictures, it reminded me of the many times in the  morning where eyes had met gently saying good-bye for the day, a gentle brush of the hair that would be no more, that ended in violent, fiery tragedy and death. And for us to hobble our Intelligence Committee and knock out 60 percent of their intelligence gathering is un-American, it is something that we will not tolerate in this Chamber, and until we get it right, I will never be quiet on this subject. And I know the gentleman feels as strongly as I do.

   Mr. AKIN. If I could just interrupt for a minute, I don't think any of us want to impugn anybody's motives. Our objective here is and the reason we were sent here by our constituents is to solve problems, which you have outlined is a reasonable balance between the privacy rights of Americans and the necessity of the government to do what it is number one tasked to do, which is to protect our citizens. But when we get that balance wrong and the director of the people that have to collect that intelligence say that we have got to have judges, you are going to knock out more than half of our intelligence-gathering capability, then it says we need to get back to the drawing board and get this thing done the right way. 
   I certainly appreciate your attention to the details to looking at the language. And I certainly hope that our Democrat colleagues will allow enough debate and discussion to solve the problem.

   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to discuss the question here about our dependence on foreign oil. 
   The leadership in the House of Representatives because of the last election has changed, but the problems that confront our Nation remain the same. The question is how are we going to deal with our dependence on foreign oil, and that is a serious question for many reasons. 
   Well, there are different ways to approach it, but it is certainly hard for the party of the Democrats that are now in charge to advocate a lot of nuclear because they have a lot of people who do not like that. Very well. And they really do not like burning a lot of fossil fuels because of global warming. 
   Well, what tool are we going to use? Well, we use our favorite tool, a tax increase. The only trouble with a tax increase, though, is what it is going to do is it is going to make the problem worse because when you increase the taxes on American oil and gas by $10 billion you make it less competitive, and if they are less competitive that means OPEC fills in the gap. 
   Now, is this just about the problem of $3 gasoline? The answer is no. It is about a lot more than that. When you go over to the Middle East, particularly a human rights trip that I took about a year or two ago to Pakistan, what you find is that there is a very nice country by the name of the Saudis who are funding private education so the little kids in Pakistan can learn. Well, until you find out what they are learning. They are being trained to be radical Islamic terrorists. And who is funding this? Saudi oil money, OPEC oil money. 
   So this question before us today is not just about SUV owners paying $3 for gasoline. It is a question about where is that money going and the radical Islamists that we are going to fund essentially with this tax increase. 
   So this is a bill that is trying to deal with a problem that is a serious problem, but a tax increase is not the way to go.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, we come here today, we have spent most of the day on this, to discuss a resolution. It has two parts. The first says that we support our troops, and the second says that we are opposed to the mission that the troops are sent on. 
   Now, the problem with the resolution is that it is self-contradictory right up front. If we were going to say we are supporting our troops, we would give them body armor. We would give them up-armored Humvees. We would give them tanks. But would we withhold the most important in our arsenal and that is other American fighting men and women? So to say that we are going to support our troops, but we are not  going to send them any reinforcements is on the face of it contradictory. Could you picture Davy Crockett at the Alamo looking at his BlackBerry, getting a message from Congress: Davy Crockett, we support you. The only thing is we are not going to send any troops. I am sure that would really be impressive to Davy Crockett. 
   The second problem with this resolution is that it really misses the job of what Congressmen should be doing. Look, I am an engineer by training. If we are about to make a mistake or we are doing something wrong, I am open minded to my Democrat colleagues saying to me, TODD, we are going down the wrong path. That is a bad idea. You should do it this way instead. I was always trained that if you are ready to criticize somebody, you at least offer an alternative. But the problem with this nifty little resolution is that it says we support the troops, but we are not going to give them any reinforcements, and then it is blank. There is no recommendation. There is no leadership. They are just saying we are going to stand on the sidelines and say, It won't work. But don't we owe our soldiers something positive, something specific, a positive recommendation? 
   The Democrats have been elected to majority. That means leadership. That means if you have got a better idea, put it on the table; but if you don't, shut up and don't undermine the morale of our troops and encourage our enemies. That isn't very helpful. 
   Now, I have heard people talking about the fact that this is a civil war. This isn't a civil war. If we leave, it will be what is a real civil war. Right now there is a lot of ethnic clashing and violence, and what is that caused by? Guess what, terrorists. They said they are doing it intentionally. They blow up a holy place of the Shias, and the Shias react and they go shoot up a bunch of Sunnis, and so, yes. But who started all of this? Well, of course, it is the terrorists. It is their intention. And do we think if they can destabilize Iraq by fomenting strife between racial groups that they won't take the same strategy to the other barely stable nations in the Middle East, nations where you have a Sunni leadership and a Shia majority? Are they not going to do the same? Or are you going to say, oh, but it is a civil war, so we can wash our hands of it, it is nothing to worry about? 
   Now, we had the ambassadors to Egypt and to Jordan, and they pleaded with us today, do not rapidly withdraw your troops. So we started to ask, well, what would happen if we were to do this? Well, nobody knows. But there is one thing we can kind of assume. All the way through history, the history of mankind, whenever there is anarchy, it lasts but a short time; and it is immediately filled with some kind of very strong dictator. Now, do we think that the dictator is going to be a moderate, reasonable sort of guy, or if we pull out of Iraq immediately, is it not likely that we are going to get an Islamoterrorist dictator? I think that that makes at least some sense. So then now what do we have? Now we have Iraq with the oil money supporting it, with this crazy dictator spreading this same kind of radical Islam all over the Middle East. That is a minimum for the scenario of what we are potentially looking at if we rapidly withdraw. 
   Now, it seems to me that all of us, as Americans, need a little bit of a direction check. And I think sometimes when we need direction, it is helpful to look at the people who came and founded this great Nation before us. And so I go back to a question that I ask audiences, not only school kids but adults. I ask them, What is it that makes America so unique and so precious? If you take America like an onion and take all the outer layers off, when you get down to the heart, what makes us who we are as a people? And invariably I hear the word ``freedom.'' But that is not quite sufficient because it isn't quite complete. You see, the people at Tiananmen Square, those little kids in college, wanted freedom, but they greased the treads of Chinese tanks. Just because you want freedom doesn't mean you can have it. 
   There was more to what our Founders understood, and they set it forth before we embarked on our first war as a Nation eloquently in our Declaration of Independence. It says: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident.'' Rather flowery language. Any idiot should know this: ``That all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these is Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.'' And our job in government is to protect those God-given rights. It is not just an idea; it was a conviction. People say ideas have consequences. Many idiots have ideas, but an idea that you die for has consequences. And this idea was powerful. It is the engine that has driven America. It has guided us in times of war because we will say, yes, we believe there are certain fundamental God-given rights that all people are given. 
   And that is what I taught my son when he was a little kid. Here he is with the Marine Club, just a little guy, saluting Old Glory with a whole bunch of little kids in some motley uniforms they bought from the used equipment store for military services. Here he is posing just as proud as can be. Founder of the Marine Club, taught, taught that there are some things in this world that are worth dying for, and those convictions are the fact that God gives us life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And I believe America still believes that. 
   There is the little marine. He has grown up now. That is the cache of terrorist arms that was found in Fallujah. That is the gang that he had the proud opportunity to lead as a second lieutenant in Fallujah because he believes that there is nothing particularly strange for us to be fighting terrorists. 
   Why would it be so odd for us to fight terrorists? What do terrorists believe? They believe that you blow up innocent people. What do we believe? That life is a gift from God.     
   What do terrorists do terrorism for? To take your liberty away, to compel you to do something you don't want to do, to make women into slaves, to take away people's freedom, to take away your liberty. That is what terrorism is for, and that is fundamentally against the idea that God made people to be free. That is why he fights. 
   That is why America has always fought. There is nothing weird or unusual about this. Is it worth fighting terrorists? Is it worth risking your life for freedom? I taught my son yes. When I went over to visit him, together we reaffirmed what we were doing in Iraq. 
   What? Is it so unusual that we have a debate about whether we should be going to war or not? That very first war was over the Declaration of Independence. There was a gentleman from Virginia who said, What has there been in the conduct? But perhaps maybe we could adjust his words. 
   What has there been in the conduct of the terrorists that gives us any room for hope? The terrorists say the only good Jew is a dead Jew, the only good Christian is a dead Christian. That doesn't leave you a lot of room for negotiation. 
   If we want to stay free, we must fight. Millions of Americans that are armed in the holy cause of liberty are invincible by any force which the terrorists may send against us. A just God presides over the destinies of nations. Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of the terrorists running the world? Forbid it, Almighty God. 
   I know not what course others may take, but as for me, and as for my son, we will choose liberty.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL ENGINEERS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, I thought it would be appropriate to make a comment or two about engineering because I was trained as an engineer. I must not have been much of one because I ended up in politics. It doesn't happen that often that people who have an engineering background end up in the political sector; but it is quite common in engineering for people to get the undergraduate degree and then to move into other kinds of areas, and the engineering background gives them a tremendous problem-solving basis to be able to be quite effective in various other kinds of careers. 
   It is a national concern to us as Americans that we are producing fewer and fewer engineers. What happened was, in the era of Sputnik when I was a kid, everybody realized we were technologically behind, particularly behind the Soviet Union, and realized the urgency in having people develop an interest and background in science and engineering. At that time, we produced a good number of engineers, and they were fine engineers. They now work for many of our household-name large corporations, certainly many in my own district, Boeing Corporation, for example. 
   These engineers have also started all kinds of different businesses and been very successful, and have been very successful in producing a lot of the technology that keeps our young men and women safe on the battlefields. It also is technology that has given us a wonderfully high standard of living and has allowed America to prosper in many ways. 
   Unfortunately, now there is a tremendous dearth of engineers. We have a number of small companies that produce products that are related to the defense industry that I know of in the St. Louis area, just as an example, and they are saying that we would give anything to be able to hire engineers. We just can't get any of them. The only engineers we can get are coming out of India or some other country far away, and our own students, Americans, are not choosing careers in engineering. That is distressing. 
   I suppose that there are reasons for why this is going on. Perhaps one of them is the malaise and the very lukewarm kind of results that we are getting out of secondary education in America. The SAT scores are continuously changed year to year, and they can be adjusted downward. Engineering is very rigorous. It requires an understanding of mathematics, and it is a very hard undergraduate degree. Many people that start in engineering end up in something like political science. It is far easier than engineering. 
   But there are rewards in engineering, and if there are young people that are paying attention to what we are discussing here on the floor of the U.S. Congress today, I would encourage them that engineering is a fantastic undergraduate choice, and it doesn't have to end up behind a drawing board. It ends up in all kinds of positions and opportunities to those who have a disciplined mind and are capable of understanding basic principles of how things work. 
   I have to say, in Congress it is tremendously helpful. I serve on the Committee on Armed Services, and we are constantly getting involved in technical kinds of questions, things like armor on Humvees, body armor, how to defeat IEDs, all of the technology of software and people tapping into databases. On the Science Committee, as well, we deal with all kinds of areas, everything from exploration of space to the simple use of materials. 
   I would encourage all young people to seriously consider engineering.

   Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, America has a problem because we have not been developing our American energy. The tip of the iceberg is particularly obvious now at $4 a gallon, but there were warning signs--nuclear reactors, 1960s vintage technology, no new refineries sited in 30 years. That's going back to the Vietnam era. We have not been developing American energy. Why? It is not because we don't have American energy. We have plenty of varieties of American energy that we could be developing, and it is not because we don't have the technology or the innovation to be able to develop American energy. 
   No. Unfortunately, this is strictly a matter of will. It is a decision, and it is strictly a party-line decision. 
   Over the last 8 years, Democrats on all kinds of votes on energy have voted 90 percent of the time not to develop American energy. Republicans have voted 90 percent too. Whether it is recycling nuclear fuel, drilling in ANWR or in the Outer Continental Shelf, we need to agree that the time has come to develop American energy.

   Mr. AKIN. When I traveled in rural Missouri a number of years ago, I had a favorite truck stop. And on the wall among the things they sold was a picture of a little John Deere green wagon with yellow wheels, had a bail of hay, and it looked like a wheel was sort of stuck on a bump. And there was a little kid with Oshkosh overalls pushing on it, and another kid with the tongue, and he is looking over his shoulder, and in the caption, ``Are you pushing or are you pulling back there?'' And that picture kind of comes to mind when I think of our Democrat leadership. 
   We have got 130,000 troops in the field and they have already declared defeat; and I am kind of wondering, are you pushing or pulling back there? 
   And then we have unanimous consent for General Petraeus, and before he can deliver the report that the Democrats asked to have delivered, they are savaging him in the New York Times as ``General Betray Us.'' And I am thinking, are you pushing or pulling back there?

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. It's a pleasure to be able to join our discussion tonight on the subject of Iraq. I approach the subject this evening from several perspectives; one, as a father of a marine who is now a captain who has been in Iraq; also as someone who has visited Iraq a number of times myself, but particularly, and more recently, as the ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee of the Armed Services Committee. That is a committee that we have been hearing now, for quite a number of weeks, of witnesses, Republicans, Democrats, all kinds of different positions and people with ideas that are supposedly experts about what we should be doing in Iraq. 
   Now, one of the things that has jumped out, after having to sit through hours and hours and hours of testimony, is a certain pattern. Every single witness, conservative, liberal, Republican, wacko one way, strange the other way, anybody, every single one of them, there were two things that they always said, and that was, the first one was, if we pull out rapidly, it will be, first of all, a huge blood bath of Iraqis killing Iraqis. We're talking about millions of people dying, which will, of course, all be reviewed in all the gory detail on the media. And second of all, the region will become extremely unstable. Both of those, regardless of who they were, political party, anything else, those were the two common themes. 
   And what emerged after weeks and weeks of listening to all these experts was, there is no gracious, easy way for us to try and tuck our tail between our legs and quit. We're like the bear that's going through the woods. We're more than halfway there. 
   The most logical, the most common sense, the most economic, the least loss of life course for us is to proceed forward logically and win this war. And there is even reason to believe that we can. 
   And the strategy is becoming more and more obvious as to how that has to happen. The first basic principle is that our troops are doing a very good job in Iraq. The second basic principle is that we've fallen into this sort of belt line, beltway mentality thinking that America's greatness all came out of Washington, DC and therefore the problems have to be solved in Baghdad, and that's just wrong. The political solution in Baghdad is not working properly. Where we are having success is the very way that America was built 300 years ago, and it's being built in local communities and local cities, local towns and various states as they built this great Nation and the same way. That's what's happening over in Iraq. 
   We are having very good success on the local level working with local sheiks, giving them a sense that it's their country, they can shape it, and what we need to be doing is aggressively giving those local governments authority and limiting the Baghdad authority to certain very specific items. We call that federalism in this country, and that's where we need to be going. We can win this, and it is the most inexpensive, the lowest loss of life and the very most positive results we can expect by just using the same principles that we found that built America. So I think that's where we need to be going. 
   The Democrats are wrong. You can't pass a constitutional amendment that says everybody's going to get along with each other. Even if you put a gun to the head of the Iraqi Baghdad Government, they couldn't do that. They couldn't succeed in that. 
   They're wrong in being against the surge. The surge is proving to be effective. It is helping us to build local governments. And they're wrong in the sense that everything is lost and we ought to quit. That's not true, and none of the witnesses suggested that it's wise for us to pull out precipitously. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding me some time, and I appreciate the comments of my colleagues that understand the importance of this and understand terrorism.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. My colleagues, a week ago we were approached by Secretary Paulson, and he told us that there was a crisis and that he had a solution. He gave us the horns of a dilemma, two sharp, shiny points that we could impale ourselves on. One, that the financial system was going to collapse and  implode, and the sky was going to fall. Certainly we wouldn't want to choose that. The other, we could write a $700 billion blank check. Those were our two choices. 
   Reasonable people started to ask there has got to be a better alternative than this, and at every turn, we saw a resistance to a clear definition of the problem and an ability to talk about the different alternatives or possibilities. 
   Now, one of the things that is very dangerous in problem solving is not being careful in defining what the real problem is. What we find when we look back and start to talk to other authorities is that this is not the first time this kind of thing has happened, and that it did not need $700 billion. It needed very little public money to solve the problem back in the Reagan days in the savings and loan crisis. 
   So what we have before us, and our leadership has led us into, first into the Pelosi Congress not allowing the committee process to operate properly; and, second, by some Republican leadership also trying to force us onto one of these two alternatives, is a solution that doesn't fix the problem. Mark my words, that if we pass this bill, in another couple of months we will be back here with a lot of failed banks and say, oh, my goodness, something is wrong. The banks are failing. 
   The problem is, this doesn't solve the problem. It's nice to take a bullet for the team if it's going to do some good, but this isn't going to solve the problem. All the people I hear in favor of this say we have got to give up some principal in order to save principal. You never save principal by giving it up.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Recently, congressional Democrats cut funding that was planned for modernization of our military. And while we've heard statements that the Democrats are supporting our troops, their actions speak louder than words. 
   In a strict party-line vote, Democrats slashed the Army modernization program with a 25 percent cut, casting a cloud over the first major modernization program in four decades. Future combat systems are designed to create a real-time battlefield information system. It promises increased safety and efficiency for our troops. This is nothing new. In the 1970s, the Democrats slashed military spending, and our servicemen and -women were forced to apply for food stamps just to survive. Again, in the 1990s, the Democrat Congress caused our Nation's forces to lose their technological edge. From future combat systems to missile defense, Democrats demonstrate a shortsightedness that will cost our sons and daughters the tools they need for a safe mission. My children and our children will pay the price.

   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, last week on ABC's news program, Charlie Gibson announced the news in Iraq. He said, ``The news is, there isn't any news.'' That's right. Across all of Iraq, there were no fatalities, shootings and bombs going off. As the media has started to recognize that we have turned the corner and are winning the war in Iraq, this pressing question, once again, comes before the House, and that is, what are the Democrats going to do with the bill that we have already passed and that the Senate has already passed to provide money for our veterans? 
   Eighteen million dollars every day is being wasted for the last 130 days because we won't bring this veterans funding bill back for final approval. It has the votes. What are we waiting for, post-traumatic stress syndrome? Veterans hospitals? Veterans clinics? We have to ask the Democrat leadership why a 130-day wait. 
   It's time for us to fund our veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 966. It's fitting that this Congress is also considering the gentlelady from Texas', Mrs. JOHNSON's, resolution on the same day that we're celebrating National Engineers Week. 
   H. Res. 966 honors African American inventors, past and present, for their leadership, courage, and significant contributions to our national competitiveness. Three of the men we honor today were engineers; the fourth, a renowned biologist. Their contributions to our Nation are many; their drive to achieve success, often in the face of adversity, admirable; and their recognition today, highly deserved. 
   We owe a debt of gratitude to Garrett Augustus Morgan for the contributions he made to public safety with safety helmet, gas mask, and traffic signal inventions. 
   Ernest Everett Just's cellular work to help find a cure for sickle cell anemia and cancer helped him become one of the most well-respected scientists in his field. 
   Many of the roads we travel on in the D.C. area, including the Tidal Basin Bridge, the Whitehurst Freeway and much of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, were designed by Archibald Alphonso Alexander. 
   Considered an expert in heat transfer, ventilation, and air conditioning, David Nelson Crosthwait, Jr., invented numerous practical heating devices. These include an improved boiler, thermostat control, and differential vacuum pump for larger buildings, such as Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. 
   These men are role models for our next generation of scientists and engineers. This Congress, through America COMPETES, has made great strides to ensure that our Nation continues to attract the best and the brightest to these admirable and important careers. 
   I support H. Res. 966 and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (GETTING THE NATION BACK ON TRACK -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Well, thank you very much for yielding me some time here. I agree with you entirely that Congressman Hensarling from Texas really does us proud, and we think an awful lot of his constituents for sending Mr. Hensarling here. He is a great leader and really understands the basic principles and levers on what makes Congress work. 
   Mr. Barrett from South Carolina, I appreciate your managing the time before us this evening, and your integrity and leadership, and the fact that you are pretty smart and on top of these issues. We need people like that here. 
   The question before us tonight, do we want tax increases or tax decreases. It is a pretty simple choice: Tax increases or tax decreases. Historically there were two guys, one guy plugging each one. One was called little Lord Keynesian economics. That is the one that said what we want to do is we want to do tax increases. If the government just spends enough money, by golly, it is just like standing inside a bucket, grabbing the handle and lifting up, and we will just float our way out of any economic problems. So the idea is government will spend a lot of money and increase taxes. That is a Keynesian approach. 
   The other approach was advanced a little later, after Keynes, and it was Milton Friedman. He said no, when you have your economy in trouble, you are starting to get into a recession, you want to do tax decreases. Now that might sound like a crazy idea because if you cut taxes, you think, I won't be able to pay for all of the things that government is doing. We already have a deficit, how can you cut taxes. 
   Well, one of the ways to take a look at which one of these ideas is a better idea is take a look at how it has worked historically. We have a long record on that, actually. You can go back to the 1920s, and Calvin Coolidge cut taxes at a time when the economy was having a hard time, and the economy surged. In fact, they gave it a name, they called it the Roaring 20s. 
   Next was FDR. Now FDR in his earlier years, he was in trouble politically, so he got a clever idea. He said I am going to take some Federal money and start building using Federal money in the States where I need some votes. He goes out and doubles and then triples the budget of the Federal Government. The Federal Government was only spending about 3 percent, and he took it up to 9 percent. That was the 1930s and 1940s. And, of course, the Great Depression was brought on by that extensive spending on the part of the Federal Government and the tax increases that were necessary to try to cover that. 
   In 1960, and this is a place where we step a little out of the political pattern. In general, Republicans have been on the side of cutting taxes. But here was a Democrat, John F. Kennedy. In 1960 he said the economy is in trouble, and we need to cut taxes. JFK did that, and we had 7 or 8 years of very strong economy. 
   So again, when you cut taxes, the economy surged and did better. 
   In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan was stuck with a very difficult economy. He did a huge tax cut. Everybody says Reaganomics, it was foolish to cut taxes, except it worked. We had a tremendously strong economy. It was that strong economy that allowed Ronald Reagan to spend money on defense and basically economically break the back of the Soviet Union, thus winning the Cold War. 
   Then we came back with Bush I and Clinton. They went back to the raise-taxes formula. The economy gets in trouble. Bush II comes into office in 2000, and we have a recession starting. What happens, in 2003 he does a major tax cut particularly where it was necessary to help small businesses to help invest in the economy, and now we have had about 5 years of a very strong economy because of the tax cuts. 
   Well, where are we today? 
   The Democrats today are really into the idea of tax increases. Not only have they raised billions and billions in additional spending in 2007, but they have proposed the mother of all tax increases. That does make me scared around Thanksgiving when you hear about the mother of all tax increases, a $3-plus trillion tax increase. That is going to repeal all of the Bush tax cuts. 
   So now you have the economy that is pretty shaky right now, and what are you going to do; you are going to slam it with massive tax increases, and that is the formula that goes right back to little Lord Keynesian that the Democrats are pushing. 
   The question could be asked, we are not being able to cover all of our bills, how can you talk about cutting taxes, being responsible when you talk about cutting taxes, wouldn't you have to pay all of these bills for the government. Well, here is an interesting thing, and it is one that I heard talked about but I never really quite analyzed it. I would like you to picture in your mind that you are king for the day and your job is to try to raise some money for your government to do some programs. The only thing you get to tax is a loaf of bread. 
   So you start to think this one out. You see this loaf of bread sitting in front of you, and you think, am I going to put a one penny tax on a loaf of bread, and you start calculating how many loaves of bread that we use in the country, and figure out what you raise. You think, why not charge $100 for taxes on a loaf of bread. 
   Then you think maybe no one would buy the bread then. Common sense says somewhere between a penny and $100 there is some level of tax on the loaf of bread that if you increase it, you will lose tax revenue. And if 
   you decrease it, you will lose tax revenue. So what is going on here is that there is some optimum level of taxing, and when you go beyond it, even though you raise taxes, you are actually crashing the economy and you are not going to collect as much money because the economy is going to die. 
   You think about the fact in this last Bush administration people were complaining about the tax cuts and the cost of the war. The interesting thing is if you add the cost of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan and the cost of the tax cuts, they don't equal as much as what the recession was costing us in the beginning of 2000. Recessions are very expensive. So if you drive your taxes too much, the economy slows and you don't get the tax revenue. You can raise taxes as much as you want, but if  the economy is sick, you are not going to get revenue in. 
   So that's the logic. It is like a loaf of bread. If you tax it too much, you actually get less revenue coming into the government. 
   Now the thing that I find ironic about this whole thing, we have all of this history in America and we know that tax cuts are the medicine you need when you have a recession. We don't want excessive spending, and we cannot afford these huge tax cuts. And the ironic thing is that the socialistic Europeans have figured this out. We have the economists who figured it out, and yet we are not acting on the intelligence that we have. The Europeans, they figured hey, this is a good deal, we will cut taxes and our economy will grow. And so they whacked taxes 8 or 9 years ago, and their economy is going gangbusters. All of Europe asks, What did Ireland do? Oh, Ireland cut its taxes. And so good old socialistic Germany and socialistic France, they are working to cut taxes. They figured it out. 
   And here we are, the people who actually came up under Milton Friedman with this understanding of economics, and what are we doing, we are talking about the mother of all tax increases. This is insanity. I can't understand why the Democrats want to do this. If I were a Democrat, I would want to hand out pork and programs to people; I would want a strong economy. I would want to cut taxes so I would have more money to spend. It doesn't make sense to pass these huge, massive tax increases. 
   I think we could learn from history, or we could just learn from the Irish. 
   I certainly appreciate the gentleman from South Carolina yielding me the time to talk about this. The question is are we going to do tax increases or tax decreases? If you care about the economy and if you care about the future of our children, the answer has to be that we have to use the Milton Friedman approach and we have to get control of our spending and we have to cut our taxes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 917. House Resolution 917 supports the goals and ideals of National Engineers Week, which will be celebrated this year in just a few days, starting February 17. 
   The National Society of Professional Engineers established the first National Engineers Week in 1951. Through all of the next week, a wide range of activities are planned around the theme of ``Engineers Make a World of Difference'' in order to increase the understanding of and interest in engineering and technology careers and to promote K-12 literacy in math and science. These activities will also highlight the contributions that engineers have made to our society. 
   Historically, Engineers Week is celebrated during the week of George Washington's actual birthday to honor his contributions to engineering as a military engineer and a land surveyor. As our Nation's first President, he put our Nation on the path toward technological advancements, invention and education. 
   We continue down that path today, which has grown exponentially into multiple and complex highways of innovation. It is our engineers, literally and figuratively, who build those highways and help keep us ahead of the innovation curve. From landing a man on the Moon to designing bags to carry our groceries, engineers play a role in nearly every facet of our lives. 
   Just a few weeks ago, the National Science Foundation released the 2008 Science and Engineering Indicators loaded with statistics on our Nation's engineering future. It's essential that we capitalize on opportunities such as National Engineers Week to raise awareness of the valuable work and contribution of engineers to society to attract young people of all ages to this rewarding profession. 
   I support the goals and ideals of National Engineers Week, and I urge my colleagues to join me with their support. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, I think it may be appropriate for me to add here a little interesting perspective that was not in the script today. It's an incident that occurred about 19-plus years ago. It seems like just the other day. 
   I had just been elected to be a State legislator in the State of Missouri, and I was very pleased and proud of that. No one in my family had ever run for political office or slid that far down the totem pole of life, but I was still looking forward to serving as a State representative. And the first thing on my agenda was to go to an early morning breakfast with other legislators. I got to the breakfast, but it was so early I was there just a little bit late. Just about the time I was sitting down at the table, one of the prominent legislators at the table said, You know, we ought to have a law against engineers serving in the legislature because they are just way too rational for the legislative process. And I was just taking my chair when somebody said, You're not an engineer, are you? And I said, Yes, I am. 
   So I'm thankful to be one of those seven or so engineers that serve here in the U.S. House. I do believe that there is always a use for the discipline of problem solving that engineering brings. So if there may be someone that's young and considering that career in engineering, I would advise them very strongly in favor of it, even though it involves a certain amount of suffering in undergraduate school. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (NATIONAL OCEAN EXPLORATION PROGRAM ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1834, the National Ocean Exploration Program Act. 
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, is the Nation's lead agency charged with conserving and managing our coastal and oceanic resources. As such, relevant and high-quality research and development is vital to NOAA's ability to better understand the marine ecosystems it manages. NOAA's ocean exploration efforts have been organized in a systematic and strategic manner in order to investigate the farthest depths of the Earth's oceans. NOAA's undersea research programs allow for direct access to undersea environments through submersibles and indirect observation through the use of robots and sea-floor observatories. These programs provide invaluable information that enables us to learn more about our environment that covers more than two-thirds of our planet. 
   H.R. 1834 authorizes two existing ocean programs: the Ocean Exploration Program and the National Undersea Research Program. Under this authorization, NOAA is required to work with the National Science Foundation to map out a coordinated national exploration program that promotes collaboration with other Federal ocean exploration programs to prevent duplicative efforts. This bill also requires NOAA to conduct an undersea research, exploration, education, and technology development program that coordinates with similar efforts of the academic and marine and ocean science communities. 
   Most of these research and exploration efforts are conducted by outside groups who receive grants and funding from NOAA. H.R. 1834 requires that such funding shall now be distributed through a competitive bid process. Competition for funding will encourage existing research centers to select their most valuable research projects and partner with each other on other research programs. This competition is essential to ensure that the best research programs and ideas are adequately funded, something that, unfortunately, has not always been the case in the past. 
   Madam Speaker, at a time when our Nation is struggling to divide resources among a greater number of programs, we cannot afford to allow spending on research programs that do not provide pertinent information related to NOAA's important mission. The authorizing of these two programs and the competitive grant process that is established in this bill will ensure that NOAA is able to fund only the most useful projects and leverage taxpayer dollars in a way that provides the most useful information to understanding and managing our ocean environment. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 1834. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to yield now such time as he may consume to my colleague JIM SAXTON from the State of New Jersey. He has a long and very well-established reputation here, and, by the way, this is part of his legislation.

   Mr. AKIN. America by this time understands that we have not been developing American energy. There are three things required to develop American energy. First, you have to have natural resources. America is blessed with a great supply and diversity of natural resources. 
   The second thing you have to have to develop American energy is the technology to be able to develop energy in a scientific and an environmentally friendly way. We are very clever with our technology. We have that in America. 
   And the third thing that you need is political will, the desire to develop American energy; and in that regard this Congress has failed. The Pelosi Congress refuses to put the gears in motion and take action. 
   Now, I can understand if you like $4 a gallon gasoline, you prefer to see it go to $6, that is a political policy. If that is what the Democrats want to do, if that is what Pelosi wants, fine. 
   But what we have on the floor today is a sham. It pretends to be an energy bill and pretends to say it is going to drill, and it doesn't. It has nothing in there for clean nuclear and nothing to allow real drilling in Alaska. We have 748 sites to drill, every one blocked by a lawsuit. There is no reform in this bill. This is a sham.

Well, it is not Christmas, but you might as well almost think it was a Christmas present when you take a look at the American economy that has been strengthened by the tax cuts of a number of years ago. 
   This boom that the Republicans set in place has added 46 months of straight growth in job creation. The unemployment rate is at a very low 4.5 percent. The Dow has just made all kinds of records at crossing the 14,000 mark, and the deficit has been cut in half. 
   In the face of this good news, the Democrats have passed a $392 billion tax increase, the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. And just like the Grinch, the Democrats seem to be wanting to steal our economic joy.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, there is a cynic that once said that one of the things that we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history. I don't accept that entirely, but it certainly appears to be that way on the floor of the U.S. Congress today. 
   You don't have to look in the recent past; you go back to 1640 in England. And they had wage and price controls. They thought it was a compassionate thing to set a price on a loaf of bread, a day's labor and a ton of coal. Then the Black Death came along and killed a whole lot of their workforce, and the price for a day's labor remained the same. England and their economy languished until a guy came along that the Brits don't even like by the name of Oliver Cromwell, and he abolished all of the government wage and price controls, and the economy surged. 
   The effect of an increase of 40 percent on minimum wage is going to be several things. The first thing it is going to do is: any job between the current minimum wage and the $7 is going to do one of several things. First, it will be exported overseas. If it is not exported, it will be taken on the black market by, perhaps, some illegal immigrant who is willing to work for less than the minimum wage. Or it will just be passed on to everybody as an increase in cost of living. 
   Those are the alternatives. It would be very nice if we could, by mandate from this floor, say that everybody is going to make a lot more than that. Why not $20 an hour? The reason is because what happens is we become less competitive, and we ship the jobs overseas. 
   We are proposing that if we are going to do this, particularly to all of these jobs in small businesses, that we at least give the small businesses some kind of a break to compensate and to try to provide some health care for some of those people. That is the reason why we are opposing just a straight 40 percent increase, because the effect is going to be, yes, some people are going to get more money, but a lot of jobs, it is just like taking the old chain saw out and chopping off another low rung in the ladder. 
   There are people who will end up in welfare accordingly. Vote ``no'' on House Resolution 2.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today on a subject that is of great deal of interest to the Army, and that is what's called the Future Combat Systems. 
   The Army has one basic modernization program, the only comprehensive modernization program that they've had in the last more than 30 years. So obviously this is of great interest to the Army, and the Army would like to see it funded at the level that it came across from the administration. And what we've done is we've cut over $200 million from Future Combat Systems. My amendment simply restores a portion, $100 million plus, of that $200 million cut. 
   Now the thing that we have to understand about this is this is a very complicated program. And next year, at least in theory, there is a ``go, no go,'' either we're going to support this program or we're going to cancel it, and there is no fallback position. So here we are, 1 year before the final decision, and what we're doing is one more time inflicting a death of 1,000 slashes. Now, last year we tried to just slit its throat with $800 million, but this year we're simply cutting it a little over $200 million. It seems to be a very bad time when we are just 1 year away from making the final decision, go or no go, to cut money from it. 
   Now, if there is one way that you want to make a scheduled slip, the best way to do it is cut money out because then you don't have as many people working on it, it causes delays in the program. So do we want to cause delays in the program? I think not. 
   The one question might be, well, how do you fund this extra $100 million? Well, we're getting the money from the same place where we got $1 billion. The committee took $1 billion earlier, so this is a small amount more. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, before us tonight is yet another Democrat plan, a plan for failure. I guess it's really not quite so much a plan as just a schedule for failure. 
   It seems ironic to me that when there is actually success, the Democrats are having a hard time seeing the success. And that's, perhaps, because the success that is going on in Iraq is not a big government, Washington, D.C. beltway kind of success. It's not the Parliament in Baghdad where the success is going on. No, it's a uniquely American and a special success. It's the success that bubbles from the hearts of the very people that are involved, from the local communities, from the streets, and particularly from the sheiks. It's the kind of thing that happened in America where local communities stood up against the biggest military power in the world and defended our declaration in the same way these sheiks now are paying a tremendous price. One, Sheik Meshin al-Jamari, he was encouraged to come back from his safe haven in Jordan. He came back to take up responsibility for his tribal area just to the east of Fallujah. And what was the cost when he turned on al Qaeda? First, his daughter was killed, then his brother shot, and then his family rounded up inside a house in Karma, and the house imploded upon their heads. And yet, that sheik is standing firm because he does have a vision for the possibility that there will one day be an Iraq where people can be free. 
   Our General Allen was asked by some of the Iraqis in his tribe, they said, When the British left, they left us a big skyscraper. When America leaves Iraq, will you leave a skyscraper? And General Allen said, No. We'll leave the ideas that leave you a free people. And one day there will be Iraqis who come to us and they will say, Hey, GI Joe, we believe it too. We believe that there is a God that gives inalienable rights to all people, the right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and we will also stand with you because you have that hope. 
   It is my hope that the Americans and the Democrats will rediscover why we have always gone to war in America, because we do believe in our battle cry from years ago that there is a God that gives basic rights to all people and that we must have the courage to stand behind those things. I hope that the Congress will vote to reject a plan of defeat.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, my concern with this supplemental is that it is designed to fail. 
   In section 1904, funding for the Iraqi security forces will be cut if the new government does not pass a constitutional amendment to ``promote reconciliation,'' whatever that is, to ethnic groups, I suppose. In short, to amend the Constitution in a way that is not defined in a period that cannot be completed. 
   Now, earlier on this floor, Representative Conyers stated that it would take 10 years to pass an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to protect D.C. voting rights, and yet we expect Iraqis to pass a constitutional amendment to fix ethnic tensions in 6 months, not to mention the other tough challenges imposed by this bill. 
   This supplemental is like a promise written in disappearing ink: it is designed to fail. 
   During World War II, the Japanese stole blueprints of some U.S. submarines. They built a submarine, but when it launched, it turned upside down and sunk because it was designed to fail. 
   This substitute is designed to fail. It is designed to fail because it is going to defund the Iraqi security forces which are our best hope of success. Of all of the blood and the sweat and the tears that has been spilled in the desert of Iraq, is this how it is going to end, by a bill that is designed to fail by not funding the Iraqi security forces? 
   The trouble with the submarine, Mr. Speaker, is that my son and the sons and daughters of Americans across this Nation are inside. We cannot allow this substitute to pass because it is designed inherently to fail.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (THE ENUMERATED POWERS ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss and to support the Enumerated Powers Act introduced by Congressman Shadegg. The Enumerated Powers Act is most important to protect the tenth amendment. We understand that with the word ``federalism.'' 
   People perhaps, though, are not so aware of where the concept of federalism originally came from. They think some brilliant founders got together in Philadelphia in 1789 and came up with the idea of federalism, but, in fact, that is not quite true. 
   The concept of federalism dates way, way back to 18 years after the arrival of the Pilgrims in the Plymouth Colony. It goes to the time when the State of Connecticut was being founded and a great preacher by the name of Hooker preached a series of sermons outlining how the government in Connecticut should be structured. Those sermons resulted in what was called then the ``Fundamental Orders of Connecticut.'' And what it said was that Hartford had certain enumerated powers and of anything not specifically enumerated for Hartford to handle, the other towns would have those powers. 
   So it was that we started with the idea of federalism, that is, that there is only specific power granted to the central organizing authority, in this case the U.S. Constitution.     
   Now, the Enumerated Powers Act requires that all bills introduced in the U.S. Congress include a statement setting forth the specific constitutional authority under which the law is being enacted. It would, of course, enforce, then, the reexamination of the proper role of the national government and it will fundamentally alter the ever-expanding reach of the Federal Government. The Enumerated Powers Act requires scrutiny of the Federal Government to slow this reach, particularly in the sense that it will require that there be a properly cited constitutional authority to precede the legislation proposed. 
   Now, the Constitution gives the Federal Government only 18 specific enumerated powers. But ignoring the principles of Federalism in the Constitution, starting with FDR and continuing through LBJ's Great Society right down to the modern day, Congresses have displayed a willingness to ignore the 10th Amendment in order to greatly expand the Federal Government. 
   The size and scope of the national government has exploded over the last seven decades. Congress has created ineffective costly programs, incredible annual deficits and a huge debt exceeding $7 trillion that will be passed only to our children and grandchildren. State and local governments are now dependent upon the Federal Government for funding, and the Feds now tamper with issues that are best understood by States and localities, with education and welfare reform being two cases in point. 
   I believe that Ronald Reagan had it right: ``I have always felt that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.''' 
   We need to uphold the entire Constitution, not just the parts we choose to use for our own ends.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (SLIDING GREASY PORK THROUGH WASHINGTON IS THE WRONG THING FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO BE DOING -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, it's been 144 days since the House passed the Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. This is a bill which does research on prosthetic kinds of devices. It helps to rebuild veterans facilities. It helps to treat things like traumatic stress disorder. That's the purpose for the money that has been waiting now since we passed it 144 days ago. 
   Unfortunately, that bill has been held up in order to connect it with other legislation ladened with pork on the HHS bill. 
   Now, it's been many years since I was a combat engineer in the Army, but my son is freshly back from Fallujah, and to hold our veterans hostage in order to try to slide greasy pork through Washington is the wrong thing for the Democrats to be doing. 
   They need to allow the bill to stand on its own base, let the people take a vote, and respect the veterans that we want to respect.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (ENSURING MILITARY READINESS THROUGH STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY DEPLOYMENT POLICY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, I have to say in terms of sympathy, I understand the motivation I believe and the interest in our troops that this legislation is designed to deal with. I have two marines that are my sons. I have visited the one when he was in Fallujah. I talked to a number of their troops. I think I understand the stresses that are involved in warfare, also as somebody who served as an officer myself. 
   That said, however, I think there is a danger when we take a look at a specific problem and we try to micromanage a solution from the position of Congress. It didn't work during the War of Independence. And the trade-offs as to whether or not you are going to leave somebody in theater longer, there are a lot of different factors that you have to balance and a lot of special situations. 
   To give you one that seems a little bit obvious, I suspect that General Petraeus and other generals have been in theater a pretty long time. They probably would have to get a special waiver from the President to do their jobs. 
   We understand it would be better if they could take a break and see their families more, but the specific situation in their situation calls for the fact that this sort of blanket rule we are going to top-down impose as Congressmen or Congresswomen doesn't make a whole lot of sense.     
   To try to set up a policy now and to hamstring all the military planners and to apply it just specifically to the situation in Iraq effectively reduces our options, makes it more complicated for us to get our job done, and effectively makes it so that we have less practical combat strength. 
   I think all of us have agreed that we've seen that we need more troops, and that's something that we need to deal with and have the courage to put that into the budgets in the future. But I think this is a micromanagement. While it may be inspired by good intentions, and I do know that there is a lot of stress on Marine families and Army families as well, I think this is the wrong to go, and I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (THE SCOURGE OF ABORTION IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, today the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the protection of life, and this ruling affirms Congress's role in guarding and protecting that special gift of life. As Justice Kennedy stated, Congress determined that the abortion methods it prescribed had a disturbing similarity to the killing of a newborn infant. 
   In the past 30 years or so, our Nation has seen an appalling rise in the disrespect for the dignity of human life. And when a culture of life is not respected, a culture of death rises to fill the void. This culture of death has been eating away at our Nation's character, at America's soul. It seems that day after day we are inundated with new stories of senseless acts of violence and death carried out on innocent victims. It would be easy to try to turn and look away; it would be easy to pretend that that crisis does not exist, but it would not be right. Who is it who will defend the innocent that is led off to slaughter? Who will stand for the right to life in America? 
   I am reminded of William Wilberforce, the recent movie about his life's efforts to end the practice of slavery. The moving movie ``Amazing Grace'' demonstrates the value of this cause and the tireless efforts that Wilberforce went through year after year, constant criticism and rejection, until he collected the votes to finally send slavery in the British empire to the dust bin of history. We as Members of Congress could learn from his great example. Will we show our own Nation the same love and respect for the dignity of human beings? 
   If there is one thing we should take away from this 5-4 decision, it is this, that when human life is threatened by such a gruesome procedure as partial birth abortion, all true sons and daughters of liberty, all true patriots, all true people who respect those rights that have been passed on to us by our Forefathers will take a stand for that precious, precious idea that God gives us life. And it is my sincere hope at this time that we can continue to build on this important victory and to create a new culture of life in our land. 
   There was a time years ago, many years ago, when America was just a dark forest almost on the horizon, when a young man in 1630 was aboard the Lion. He became, as we know Winthrop, Winthrop, the Governor of Boston, known as the George Washington of the Puritans. And as he was coming along the coast of Maine in the Lion and the wind was blowing across the pine forests out to sea and he smelled the smell of the pine and the balsam on the breeze and he put pen to paper and he started writing, ``A Model of Christian Charity.'' And in there, he held a vision for America that America could be as a shining city on a hill, a light to people all over the world. And today, Mr. Speaker, that vision of a shining city seems just a little bit closer and a little bit less dim and a little closer to a reality that one day, one day that shining city on a hill, a vision of hope for all people of the world, a vision of a city where life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are truly enshrined in every law and precept of this great Nation; may that vision come to reality even within our own days. Thank you. God bless you all.

   As they had a chance to develop a systematic form of government and to lay out the very most important things that they had suffered so hard for. The very first amendment to the Constitution was about free speech. The Founders believed that it was critical to protect property, and of all forms of property. The thing that issues from a man's heart is the most precious. For a person to be able to have a belief and to be able to speak that freely is a precious thing not only to our Founders but to all who have been defenders of the first amendment.

So the Democrats have voted to administer a dose of their favorite medicine, tax increases. They plan to increase taxes on American oil and gas. But the oil companies will simply raise the price of gasoline. In addition, by making American oil more expensive, it will further make us dependent on Middle Eastern oil. 
   The Democrats should look at drilling for American oil and liquefying coal, two things that they have opposed in the past. The Democrats are writing the wrong prescription and they make a bad situation worse. I just hope the patient doesn't die.

Now, certainly each of us individually, and even as leaders and nations, is tempted at various times in the face of overwhelming odds to quit and to give up; and yet greatness in leaders and greatness in nations is frequently measured by a stubborn and cussed determination to carry on. 
   We think, of course, immediately of George Washington at Valley Forge, we think of Winston Churchill challenging the people of England to rise up and to be strong against the Nazis; he loved to mispronounce it to bait Hitler. But we also recall in our own history how we were in Vietnam, how we bombed North Vietnam, and in the observation of Jeremiah Denton, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, how we were just very close to victory. North Vietnam was about to capitulate because of the bombing, and then we cut and run. 
   The test before us today is for the courage and the heart of not just the Iraqi people, but the American people. What are the measurements we should be looking at? It is not the day for the sunshine patriot, but for the cussed and the strong and the brave.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, one of the things that I think most people in politics know is that the ratings of Congressmen are very, very low. And perhaps part of the reason for that is the public can see that we are playing more political gotcha than we are in really solving problems. 
   Today we have just seen an example of that as Democrat after Democrat condemned the President for this SCHIP bill, which has all these little hidden gizmos, among other things that we are going to provide health care to the children of illegal immigrants. It is a massive expansion of basically Hillary socialized medicine. And yet we are going to use this children's health issue as a way to play political gotcha. 
   We don't need to do that with the veterans bill. The House and the Senate have both approved funding for veterans, which comes down to $18.5 million of extra money for veterans hospitals, for prosthetics, for our wounded soldiers. Those bills are just sitting, waiting. 
   Are we going to use that as another way of doing political gotcha, or shall we just start solving problems and serving the American people?  
   Mr. Speaker, for the past few years we have heard the Democrats in Congress say they support our troops and veterans even if they do not support the war in Iraq. 
   Yet, many of those brave veterans who served in Iraq, as well as other military campaigns, are being denied as much as $18.5 million a day in veteran's care that was promised to them. 
   The Democrat majority has delayed a vote on a bill to fund veterans care. These delays are denying our veterans millions of dollars that would fund prosthetics for our wounded warriors and amputees. 
   Are the Democrats hoping to save a vote on veteran's health for later in the year? Maybe, they plan to attach wasteful earmarks to that bill? 
   Members of Congress, you can't say that you support our troops and veterans if you won't fund their care. It's time we make good on our promises. Give our veterans what they need.

But after hearing from witnesses of every political stripe week after week on the oversight subcommittee, this profound reality became obvious: The least costly and best alternative for America is not to lose. It is to win. 
   We are more than halfway through the campaign, and it is too costly to quit and to go back. The concept that we can win is novel to Democrats perhaps, who think in top-down solutions in Washington and in Iraq. But our new military strategy is proving successful. 
   Just as our Nation grew from the bottom up, town by town, State by State, so also federalism shows success in Iraq. Local communities are working closely with our military to curb violence. For this reason, we must ensure that they have the freedom and the autonomy to continue to develop.

If you're late to the car pool, a couple of people have to sit there and wait and you've got to choke your breakfast down a little bit quicker so you don't inconvenience someone. 
   But you know the Democrats have been very late. But when the Congress  is late, it is really a big inconvenience, because the Democrats knew that they had to pass the AMT patch some months ago and they didn't do it. And so what does that mean? It means not just a few people in the car pool. What it means is 32 million Americans will not get their tax refund; $87 billion will be late to 32 million Americans because the Democrats are late in dealing with the AMT tax patch. They tried to put it together with a $3.5 trillion tax increase, the mother of all tax increases. Of course that didn't work, and now we're late.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Thank you very much, and thank you for taking some time to run through a series of events that actually in the last couple of days seem a little puzzling to me, I might have to say. 
   My recollection is is that General David Petraeus, his credentials were reviewed over in the other body, and they took a vote as to whether or not he was the guy that we're going to put front and center to be in charge of the  entire campaign in Iraq, and he got a unanimous vote in the other legislative body. That says an awful lot of people had to vote for him to get a unanimous vote over there. 
   Also, as I recall, it was just not so long ago that the Democrat party, who's in charge of both the House and the Senate, made the request that in September General Petraeus would come before the legislature and would make a report as to what the findings were, would let us know how things were going. Many people were very skeptical about the reorganization, the restructuring of our war in Iraq, around the idea of the surge, but people trusted General David Petraeus. They trusted him because he has an excellent reputation and record as a soldier, but he also is a straight shooter. He doesn't sugarcoat things. He explains it the way it is. 
   And so it was with some sense of alarm and a little bit, I have to say, with a sense of frustration that we saw in the New York Times this calling General Petraeus where they say ``General Betray Us.'' 
   What we're doing is taking somebody that before we thought they had good credibility, we're going to guess what they may say to us, we think we may not like what he has to say, so now we're going to try to destroy his reputation. I think that's a shame. 
   My son has served over in Fallujah. As you have mentioned, I also am on the Oversight Committee.     
   One of the things that has been consistent with every witness, week after week over a period of months, every witness we could scrounge up, conservative, Republican, liberal, Democrat, you name it, the one thing those witnesses said was, first of all, they said if we pull out of Iraq rapidly, there is going to be a huge bloodbath there. 
   The second thing is that the whole region will be destabilized. Everybody agreed to that. Now, some people said, well, there is nothing we can do about it, so we ought to pull out now and cut our losses. Other ones said, no, there are some things we could do about it. But everybody agreed that a rapid drawdown of troops is not what we should be doing in America. 
   After listening hour after hour to all these experts, I came to the conclusion of this simple fact, and that is, it is the least-cost, most logical best alternative for us to just go ahead and win the war in Iraq. 
   We are more than halfway, and trying to turn around and back out, make excuses and try to lose is just going to be much more costly than moving forward and doing a good job. 
   That's what the general has outlined today in very credible testimony. I was very thankful that he is here. I am thankful that you took the time to help us to be able to talk about this very important subject about how we proceed and the sense of good news. There is a little light at the end of the tunnel is what it seems like to me.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, the rule that we are considering does not allow a very critical amendment which we voted on in committee. Several of the votes that were most important in committee were not done in a bipartisan way. They were strict party-line votes. This was one of those. One was missile defense; the other is the modernization program for the Army. 
   The modernization program for the Army that I am talking about was cut by 25 percent, a massive slash in that particular program. What that program does is, it provides the first major modernization program in the last 40 years for the Army. What the program does is, it provides real-time online information, networking, a whole group of different sensors, satellites and individuals on the field, tanks, unmanned aerial vehicles, pulling all that information together to give us accurate and timely information in the battlefield. 
   Now, anybody who's studied military warfare will tell you that if you just had this piece of information or that piece of information, the tide of battle would have shifted, and so this whole system is designed to provide that information for our warfighters. It has been slashed 25 percent. It is called Future Combat Systems. 
   Why is that important? First of all, it means you've got to go all the way back to the drawing board with this program, changing all the time schedules. It is tremendously complex. 
   The second thing is that this program really is the forerunner for things that will be used by the Marines and the Navy. The Navy calls it more network centric warfare, but the concept, the software, will be the same. 
   Now, we are denied an opportunity to try to restore some funding to the Army's first major modernization program in 40 years. The result is that our sons and daughters will have to pay the price. My own sons will have to pay the price because we have not gotten the information that is absolutely critical to our warfighter there at the time that we need to do it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Madam Chair, one of the things that you can be only an amateur student of are various battles, or military history, and it becomes immediately obvious, the importance of information. Just randomly, you can think of Pearl Harbor, knowing whether the Japanese are coming. Or, particularly, the Battle of Midway, where you have the Japanese force, far superior to the American force, but the Americans knew where the Japanese aircraft carriers were and the Japanese only knew where one of the American aircraft carriers was. As a result, America won that significant Battle of Midway, even though we had an inferior force, based on information. 
   Now, I have heard discussion about how proud we are of Future Combat Systems, which is a fancy word for a computerized system to help our warfighters have the information that they need in order to do their job. That program is the first major Army modernization program in 40 years, and under this bill, it is being cut by 25 percent.     
   This was not a feel good kind of vote. This was a strict party-line vote, the Democrats voting to cut it by 25 percent, the Republicans trying to restore funds and being turned down in that request. 
   Now, when you cut a program by 25 percent, particularly as complicated as this is with all the computers that are talking to each other, the software, the communications disciplines and the platforms involved, that is a significant change and a significant slowdown to a very important part of our future, and that is the ability to have real-time, online information for our warfighters. 
   This is not just important to the Army, as important as it is to the Army, because the Marines and the Navy are going to be waiting also for perhaps a lot of this software to be the prototype for their systems that they develop later. So what we are doing is basically pushing back, slowing and delaying and cutting down 25 percent, or $867 million, from this program. We have tried to replace those funds some, with some things that are completely not necessary, such as a high speed boat for the Army, which hasn't even been designed, and have been turned down and not even allowed to offer that amendment here on the floor. 
   Now, who is it who is going to pay for this degradation of the modernization of our Army? It is going to be our sons and daughters, my own sons that are involved, and this is not a good thing. This is not a good trade-off. We must advance the modernization. Information has always throughout history been critical to warfare. It is all the more so now. 
   And so I am strongly opposed to this significant cut and the hurting of our ability to get information to our warfighter.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer this amendment to the Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act. As many involved in the Federal contracting world know, the 8(a) program currently serves small businesses owned by citizens who are socially and economically disadvantaged. 
   Since the 1960s, the 8(a) program has remained the primary vehicle through which minority-owned businesses enter the Federal marketplace. There is no doubt that since its inception the 8(a) has helped many minority-owned businesses grow their firms, enabling them to become real players in the Federal contracting world. In fact, over the course of the program, nearly 20,000 companies have received almost $100 billion in Federal contracts. 
   During committee markup of this bill, I expressed my reservations to Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez regarding certain provisions in the bill that exclude the equity in a business. I'm concerned that this provision undermines the argument concerning the competitive capacity of the business owners. I will explain. 
   Many owners reinvest their earnings into their businesses, thus increasing the value of the business. If the 8(a) program is a business development program targeted toward socially and economically disadvantaged firms, why should the business owner with a valuable asset be permitted in the program and benefit from its existence? I would argue that the scarce resources available to assist these business owners be devoted to those business owners that are truly economically disadvantaged. 
   My amendment is a straightforward amendment that I hope will address some of these concerns. Essentially, the amendment would ask the administrator of the Small Business Administration to conduct a study to determine what changes would be required to provide greater Federal contracting assistance to participants in the 8(a) program that have less equity in their business concerns than other participants in the program. 
   I appreciate Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez's willingness to work with me on this important issue, and I believe that adoption of my amendment is one step towards ensuring that minority-owned small businesses who truly need assistance can continue to benefit from the opportunities provided to them by the 8(a) program. 
   I would urge my colleagues to assist and support this amendment. 
   In closing, my point on this is the following: As a business is small and most in need of the 8(a) program, we want to make sure that they can get as many of these programs as possible, and that will build their business up. As the business then prospers and grows through the years, they will continue to get these different 8(a) kinds of contracts, which give them essentially a 10 percent advantage. 
   But as the business becomes bigger and stronger, what I'm interested in doing is creating a sliding scale so that those valuable contracts will be guaranteed to go to the most needy businesses, and as a business gets stronger and stronger, the number or the percentage of those contracts will tend to diminish as they become stronger and more able to survive on their own. 
   I think that's a concept that has been understood and to some degree approved within the committee. The question is how do we mechanically work that out, and the purpose of this amendment is to give ourselves a little time to actually figure out mathematically how do you make sure that those contracts go to the most needy, and as  people become less needy, that they have less and less dependence on. 
   I very much appreciate the chairwoman's willingness to work with us on this, and hopefully we can figure out mechanically some way to do that that everybody could agree to. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, while not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Thank you, Congressman Hunter, for yielding. Let me just take a moment to thank you also for your great leadership on this committee through the many years. What a fantastic teacher you've been to some of the newer members. I'm so thankful for your leadership, your patience. 
   And also the gentleman from Mr. Everett's district, Mr. Saxton, great leadership. 
   Then I would also like to say, Chairman Skelton, thank you very much. You make the people from Missouri proud for the way that you've continued the good tone of the committee. I think it was really a classy thing to name this bill after Congressman Hunter, and it just shows the quality of leadership that you've provided, and so I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, as well. 
   As the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Dr. SNYDER has been doing a great job. We've had a chance to look into a number of different subjects, particularly progress in the reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. This bill contains some of the things that we discovered particularly in the importance of Provincial Reconstruction Teams and the important work that's been done on that subcommittee. 
   I would just like to say that there's a lot of criticism of Congress. In fact, I think our popularity rating publicly is maybe not too good. But on the other hand, I think what the public would really like to see is they'd like to see us stop bickering and just plain solve some programs. I think this committee and the subcommittees have been largely a good example of that, and that's because of the tone of the leadership that we've seen. 
   As others have before, I have my opinions about how this bill could be improved, and there are several areas that I am concerned with. The first are the significant cuts to missile defense and particularly the missile defense that needs to be built in Poland and the Czech Republic. I believe that that missile defense is critical for the defense of our country from Iran and also some Western European nations from Iran.     
   I think it's the wrong time to be cutting missile defense. We have just had a very successful demonstration of this technology, as we shot down a rogue satellite that had a lot of hydrazine in the fuel tank, and we were able to get rid of that threat very effectively. 
   So aside from missile defense, there's one other area that I am distressed about, and that is the only comprehensive major Army modernization program in the last 30 or 40 years, which we now know as Future Combat System. That has also had a number of hundred million dollars removed from it. It's something we have discussed in committee. I think it's a wrong decision. Next year, we are going to make a go or no-go on this overall program, and to be continuing to slash and cut away at that budget, I think, is counterproductive. 
   This said, my only other complaint is there's just not enough money in this budget to fund defense the way I wish we could. But if there are constituents who would like to see people who are just rolling up their sleeves and solving problems, all they need to do is come to the authorizing committee of the Armed Services.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, coming from the Second Congressional District, my memory is just long enough to recall some actual personal encounters with Bob Young. Bob was almost a caricature of politics in North County, St. Louis. Bob was a guy who was a pipefitter, he was a war hero, he was in the Third Army under Patton, came back, got into politics. 
   He served 20 years in the Missouri legislature, house and senate, and then came down here for about 10 years or so and was very plain spoken. He wasn't noted for sugar-coating things, but he had a wonderful sense of humor, fiercely loyal to labor unions, but reasonably conservative in a lot of other regards, left a family that was involved in politics as well. 
   But somebody who had a real cheerful twinkle in his eye, a good sense of humor and somebody I know that the St. Louis area will long remember as a good leader and a good man. So we are sorry for his passing. On the other hand, we are thankful for the richness of his life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, February 1 is an extremely important date for us in terms of American security. You might wonder why that is, and that is because a law that we passed last summer is expiring and our intelligence agencies are going to be greatly crippled in their ability to make intelligence intercepts because of the change in the law. 
   What has happened is the Democrats are trying to get us to go through a very complicated procedure with the FISA court to check on surveillance before we can actually make the wiretap. What the result is going to be is that it is going to make it very, very difficult to do these intercepts. 
   Now we debated this at the end of last year, and we found that with the law that was being proposed, we wouldn't be able to arrest bin Laden even if we knew where he was going to be and what time he was going to be there. Since World War II, we have done these intercepts. We have intercepted Japanese and German wire transmissions. 
   The bottom line is quite simply we are going to lose 60 percent of our intelligence gathering if this law is not fixed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, one of the things that can be a problem here in Congress is tardiness or lateness. And we've certainly seen some examples of that. One of the examples is the alternative minimum tax. It's something that every year just keeps reaching down and taxing more and more Americans. And so through the last years, Republicans passed patches to push that alternative minimum tax back. Unfortunately, this year, we're late. We don't have that done. The IRS has got to have that done by tomorrow, or else they're going to take a whole long time to change tax forms, and 50 million Americans will have their tax returns and the money that's owed them by the government late because we're just not on time with getting the AMT patch fixed. 
   It's also true with the veterans bill. We passed a bill, Republicans and Democrats agreed to it, put more money into the veterans, take care of post-traumatic stress and all kinds of other things that are expenses that the veterans face. The trouble is that bill's been sitting around. We're late again. Let's get a move on.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (THANKSGIVING -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, it's a treat to be able to join you and take a look at a very interesting subject, a subject that we in America will all be thinking about here before so very long, the subject of Thanksgiving. There are, of course, many different Thanksgivings that each of us have enjoyed with our families. But I am here to talk particularly about a little group of marines, they might be considered, a group of marines that undertook a great adventure to America, and that is, of course, the story of our Pilgrims. 
   There is some debate and some belief that there was a Thanksgiving celebration in the area of Berkley or the Jamestown area in maybe the 16th, 17th-ish vicinity. But the one that springs to most people's minds is the story of the Pilgrims. Perhaps the reason is because the Pilgrim story is such a fantastic adventure. It sparks the imaginations of not only children but adults as well. It goes back some time. 
   So I thought what I might share this evening is this great adventure story, but with a purpose. The purpose is to suggest that there was something far more significant. In fact, a number of things more significant than the Pilgrims brought us, even in the tradition of our turkeys and cranberry sauce, better than the tradition of Thanksgiving, and far more significant to particularly those who meet in this Chamber. 
   The story of the Pilgrims goes back a long way. The idea and the thing that separated the Pilgrims, to a certain degree, were the writings of a theologian from Scotland that followed Knox. As he looked into the Old Testament, he saw a pattern that had been overlooked by many in European history. He looked into the Old Testament and he noticed that there was a Moses, and that Moses seemed to run the government, but there was Aaron, who seemed to run the worship of that which you might call a church. 
   Through the Old Testament he noticed there was a difference between church government and civil government. Now this was, in a way, a novel idea because those two had been confused for hundreds of years in European history. So he started to write about the idea that really maybe the church should be separate from the civil government. 
   Now in those days in jolly Old England it was James who was King. He wasn't exactly the model of a good church leader, perhaps. So there were those who, as they read these writings, took them to heart. They were called Brownists or Separatists. They came up with the idea that they would start their own church separate from the King. 
   Now this idea didn't go over politically very well at all. So this group of people met together, created their own little, if you would, New Testament church. They elected their own leaders and they met in a manor house in Scrooby, England. Well, the King, in response to these things said, I am going to hurry them out of England. So he put them in stocks and he taxed them and harassed them and charged them falsely with all kinds of things and persecuted them to the point that these Separatists had to leave England, one group after the next. There weren't that many, maybe several thousand in England at the time. 
   They went, as many of you know to Lieden, over in the Netherlands and Holland. There they worked a very, very hard existence and had their difficulties there trying to learn a new language and trying to find a way to make a living. 
   One of the things they found after they had been there some period of time was that their children started picking up some bad habits, in their opinion, of the Dutch children. So they determined that they needed to do something different. It was then that they looked around for the idea of perhaps finding a different place to build a new civilization based on new ideas that they had been thinking about. 
   So the Separatists, particularly under the leadership of their pastor, John Robinson, started to consider the idea of coming to America and planting a colony. That, of course, required a lot of money. So they looked for some people to finance this expedition. They found the merchant adventurers. The merchant adventurers helped them raise the capital to fund the Mayflower. They also hired another smaller ship called the Speedwell. The picture of the Speedwell you can see on the rotunda, as the Pilgrims were having a prayer meeting aboard the Speedwell. 
   So it was after a period of time these Separatists or Brownists, as they were called, got onboard.     
   They traveled from Leiden, which was their hometown, to Delfthshaven. You can see in the Capitol Rotunda Delfthshaven in the background, and the Pilgrims at prayer about to leave to come over to England, where they would rendezvous with the Mayflower and other separatists who were going to be making this expedition, along with just some plain old families, jolly old blokes off the street of England. So this expedition was taking shape. 
   The trouble was the Speedwell was a pretty leaky ship and the captain wasn't too enthused about going across the ocean. They put the gear into the ships, started to try to get off in the summertime and made one start. And the Speedwell started leaking after 3 days. They had to turn around and come back. They re-caulked the ship and set off again. It started leaking again. They could find no leaks in it. They finally decided to leave the Speedwell behind. The Mayflower had to put off with just the people they could fit in the Mayflower. 
   Now, as they took off, you can imagine what started to happen. You have got men and women and children, a little over 100 of them, cramped in very tight quarters aboard the Mayflower. And if you have been at ship at sea for a little while, you know what happened. They started turning greenish in color and started getting violently seasick. 
   In the meantime, they had a bosun that made kind of a sport of making fun of them, saying, ``Puke socks, we have seen this before. We will be soon wrapping you up in a sail and sending you down to feed the fish.'' 
   So it was that they started this very long and difficult voyage in the Mayflower across the stormy North Atlantic. 
   Now, these people were praying people, a good many of them, and you can imagine they were hoping they would get a nice, easy voyage. But it didn't happen that way. Instead, the storms just howled around them, and they continued seasick. And it was about a 66-day voyage that they were pretty much not quite locked, but kept completely underneath the deck. 
   There was one of them that just couldn't stand this, the foul air down in the cabin with all of these kids crying and mothers and everybody seasick, who came up on deck, and a wave about washed him overboard. And he was in the ocean for a while, and he put his arm out, grabbed a rope and was hauled back into the ship. He was about blue, he was so cold, and he went down under the deck and didn't stick his head out again until they finally sighted land. 
   Well, as they were about two-thirds or so away across the Atlantic, the ship was pitched from side to side in the huge storms. There was a groan and a terrible creak as the main beam that supported the mast, the main mast of the Mayflower started to give way. It was cracking and sagging under the weight of the mast and the duress of the wind and the sails of the Mayflower. 
   The captain, taking a look, thought they might have to put back, but they were in very bad shape with the beam cracking this way. It was then that some of the passengers remembered the big printing press that was in the hold of the Mayflower. They wrestled it into position, jacked it up and forced the huge oak beam back into place, and the Mayflower continued on.  
   Finally sighting land, not in Virginia where they had intended to go, but blown north of their course by the heavy storms and sighting the windswept coast of Cape Cod. Now, they immediately tried to sail south to get down toward the Hudson River. The south side of the Hudson River in those days was known as the Virginia area. It was really what we think of as New York. And the storms did not allow the Mayflower to make that. The ships are not very good at running close hull to the wind, and the treacherous shoals and sandbars around Cape Cod were threatening. 
   The decision was made then to anchor in Provincetown Harbor and then to find a suitable location for their plantation north up in the area that we now know as Cape Cod and Massachusetts. 
   This brought on a little bit of a political crisis, and it is one of the beginning and most amazing stories of the Pilgrims, because when they were there in Provincetown Harbor, the people that were not so much known as Christians, the jolly old blokes off the street of England, they were known as strangers. There were saints and strangers. The saints were known as the Christians. The strangers were just the people off the streets of England. 
   The strangers said, hey, when we get to shore, no rules, mate, like down under, and we will do whatever we want. 
   Sensing a certain amount of anarchy, the saints decided on a course of action. They took out a piece of paper and they wrote the Mayflower Compact. It starts out, ``In ye name of God, Amen. We do covenant and combine ourselves together unto a civil body politic for the glory of God, for the advancement of the Christian 
   faith,'' and it goes on to say ``to frame such just and equal laws as would be meek and necessary for our little plantation.'' 
   In other words, what had happened, the very first time in all of human history, a group of free people under God created a civil government covenantly and elected their own leadership to that little civil government. This was the first written constitution in all of history that we know of, and it was the very beginning of all of American civil government. 
   If you think about that formula, under God, a group of free people creating their own civil government to protect their basic rights to make basic laws, this was essentially the Declaration of Independence 170 years earlier. And it was in extreme contrast to what was going on in Europe, because in Europe, the basic model of all of government was the divine right of kings. When the king says ``jump,'' everybody is supposed to say ``how high?'' But here in America, there was a new model, completely new technology, the idea of a written Constitution, that under God a group of free people could create a civil government to be their servant. 
   And so it was that the Pilgrims at this very time in Provincetown had taken their idea of a New Testament church, a group of free people under God, covenanting together to create a church, and they picked up the idea, even though they knew very well that there was a difference between church government and civil government, but they used the same pattern, and they picked it up and carried it across and applied it in the Mayflower Compact. So you have in the first time in history the beginning of a whole new view of how a country should be built. 
   Now, this was very much in keeping with the sermon that Pastor Robinson had given to the Pilgrims as they left. He had been a wonderful pastor to these people in Leiden and steered them from a lot of dangers. But as he said good-bye to them, knowing probably that he would never see them again, he said, Now, be very careful when you go to America to plant this Christian civilization, be very careful what you adopt as true, sayeth he, for it is unlikely that a Christian civilization should spring so rapidly out of such anti-Christian darkness. 
   What he was saying was that the patterns of the way things had been done in Europe were maybe not consistent with the Bible, and that they should be very careful how they built this new civilization. And this first step, this creation of a covenant, the Mayflower Compact, is essentially the beginning of all of our civil government in America. 
   Well, of course, they couldn't stay in Provincetown forever. They took a prefabricated boat called a shallop that it was put together in the hold of the Mayflower in pieces. They took it out and assembled it on the shore. It had been damaged by the storms, and they continued to explore around the inside of Cape Cod. As they did, they had an encounter with the Indians who attacked them. Fortunately, nobody was hurt on either side. 
   The Pilgrims continued on around, almost freezing and getting caught in the surf, and, miraculously, almost at the time when there was no more sunlight, the wind was blowing hard and the ice was freezing on their clothes, they came into the shelter of an island, which they didn't really know quite where they were, and they had sailed around the inside of Cape Cod over to Plymouth Harbor. 
   In the morning they discovered that they were on an island that was safe, there were no other Indians there, and they made a whole series of discoveries that they were in a harbor that was more than twice deep enough for the Mayflower. They found there was land that had been cleared and nobody appeared to claim it, fresh water coming down the hillsides of what we now know as Plymouth, even a pretty good size rock, I suppose, that they could land on. 
   So, taking the shallop back to the Mayflower, the Mayflower came across from Provincetown over to Plymouth, anchored in the harbor, and they started there late in December on putting together their little civilization. In fact, it was Christmas Day that they started in on some of the buildings in Plymouth Plantation.     
   Well, things became very difficult for the Pilgrims at that time. They started to die. They died from what they called the general sickness. It was probably caused by scurvy and colds and pneumonia and various things that weakened them. In December, eight of the 100 or so Pilgrims died. And then it got worse in January and February. By the time they got to March, almost half of the crew and half of the Pilgrims had died. 
   Now, that I suppose would be kind of a discouraging thing for people who felt that they had come over here with this noble expedition in mind, the idea of building a new civilization on new principles. 
   At that time the captain of the Mayflower, who had been standing with them, the Mayflower had been anchored in Plymouth harbor, said: it is about time for us to go back to England. It has been a great try, but half of my crew is dead and half of you are dead. You need to get on the Mayflower and come back to England with me. 
   You can picture yourself now on the shore of Plymouth and the boatswain is giving the calls. The anchor cable is winched up from the bottom of the harbor, covered with seaweed. The boatswain gives the commands and the yardarms are swung to the wind. At first large and then small, the Mayflower disappears over the horizon. The wind is blowing through the pine trees behind and 50 people, a little over 50 people, the Pilgrims, left standing on the shore amid some primitive huts they had been able to build. 
   You may ask: What was the dream? Why would these people dare take such a tremendous risk? 
   And the answer was found by the sermon Robinson preached about the idea of building a new civilization on new ideas. So it was then not so many days later that they were greeted by a cry from the lookout: Indian coming. 
   You mean Indians? 
   No, Indian coming. 
   Here walking down the main street of their little village was an Indian with nothing but a loincloth. It was very cold weather, and he said in very broken English, Do you have any beer? 
   What an interesting thing to ask for. It turned out it was Samoset. He was an Indian chief from up in Maine. He had a little bit of wanderlust and he was down visiting Massasoit. He heard about the settlers that were trying to make a go of things at Plymouth, and he came over to see how they were doing. After they fed him a good meal, they told him about the Indians they had seen in the distance, but none had bothered them at their site in Plymouth.  
   What they found out was that the Indians that had lived in the land there at Plymouth were the Patuxets, quite a war-like tribe, but the war-like tribe had been destroyed by a plague a few years before. Almost all of the Patuxets was dead. There was one at least alive. He had been taken by a sea captain and was going to be sold into slavery in Spain, and he was rescued by some monks and managed to get to England and later got across the ocean back ultimately to find his village and home gone because of the damages of the plague that had come before. 
   So it was that Samoset introduced them to another Indian by the name of Tisquantam, one of the last of the Patuxets. Tisquantam, or Squanto, as we know it, had not really had a whole lot to live for. But when he came to see these hard-pressed Pilgrims, he felt sorry for them so he taught them how to plant corn and how to find those eels by going barefoot in the mud by the side of the streams. And he helped them to survive through the first year. And following that and their being able to plant some corn, they celebrated in the fall their first Thanksgiving. 
   The idea was that the settlers, the Pilgrims, invited Massasoit, who turned out to be a very fine Indian chief, and contrary to some people's understanding of history, was very loyal and followed all of the treaties they set up and was a good chieftain, as was his son. 
   Massasoit was invited to celebrate the first Thanksgiving that the Pilgrims had, and he decided to bring some of his other Indian friends along, quite a few Indian friends, so you had even more Indians than there were Pilgrims at the first Thanksgiving. They had a good meal. The Indians weren't in any mood to leave, and so Thanksgiving continued for 3 days. There was wrestling and foot racing and sort of military drills, and all kinds and manner of things. The Indians did the hunting for turkey and deer and the Pilgrims were cooking and baking fruit pies, perhaps, and things like that. So they celebrated Thanksgiving, not just for a day but for 3 days, and it was an event that was a great celebration and was a great success. 
   So we have the tradition that particularly the Pilgrims and other groups passed on to us. Thanksgiving became a popular day in the colonies. All sorts of towns celebrated it on different days and times of year. 
   To my knowledge, the first national Thanksgiving was declared in 1777 by the Continental Congress many, many years later. That was to celebrate the victory at Saratoga. That also is depicted in our rotunda in the beautiful, large Trumbull-painted rendition of the surrender of the British at Saratoga. So that was a national day of Thanksgiving that was recommended by the Continental Congress. 
   The words of these Thanksgivings, for instance the actual declaration of Thanksgiving by the Continental Congress, were explicitly Christian. It starts out: ``Forasmuch as it is the indispensable duty of all men to adore the superintending Providence of Almighty God; to acknowledge with gratitude their obligation to Him for benefits received and to implore such further blessing as they stand in need of; and it having pleased Him in his abundant mercy not only to continue to us the innumerable bounties of His common Providence to smile upon us as in the prosecution of a just and necessary war for the defense and establishment of our unalienable rights and liberties.'' 
   And it goes on to talk about Christ and the Holy Ghost. This is a product of the Continental Congress in 1777 after winning the Battle of Saratoga. There were other Thanksgivings, and then eventually George Washington declared a national day of Thanksgiving in 1789. He says: ``Whereas it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protections and favor.'' That is Washington as he declared a day of Thanksgiving in celebration of the adoption of the U.S. Constitution. 
   So that is the tradition of Thanksgiving. The Pilgrims passed Thanksgiving along to us, and of course this first Thanksgiving was a pretty good one. It lasted 3 days with the Indians. 
   If we look back and think about this little group of heroes that came to America, what we find was it was an awful lot more than Thanksgiving they gave us. They gave us a whole view of civil government, the idea that government is created by a group of free people and that there is no sovereign. 
   In fact, in the War of Independence, the battle cry was ``No King But King Jesus.'' It was the idea of a group of people created under God to defend a set of rights. And as we later worded it, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   So they give us this idea of a written Constitution in 1620. They also understood that we celebrate civil government from church government. That may seem ho-hum to most Americans, but we have to realize that the Europeans still use tax money to pay for their churches. And, of course, the Islamists tend to mix civil and church government completely together. So this technology that the Pilgrims brought us was extremely significant, far more significant probably than the celebration of Thanksgiving. 
   So we have the whole constitutional form of government, the separation of civil and church governments, and then later in the fall, the Pilgrims took another step. The loan sharks in England who had arranged the journey over on the Mayflower had insisted that everyone work in a common store. That was socialism, that is, everybody owned everything. Well, that didn't work. 
   Governor Bradford took a good look at that. It was not working. The people were going to starve to death, and so they basically canned socialism and he wrote in his history of ``Plymouth Plantation'' as though men were wiser than God and the ancient conceit of Plato and others who thought that they were smarter than God and he said this thing has been tried among Godly and sober people, and it just doesn't work. And so they pitched socialism out and were able to do a lot better in the colonies.     
   Even so, it would be another 7 years before Governor Bradford would write that they could relax and taste the goodness of the land. It was a very hard time for the Pilgrims in this time period. 
   But I think it is important for us to remember as we join together with our families and we enjoy the wonderful tradition of Thanksgiving, to remember the other blessings that this little group, this adventuresome little group of men and women and children that came to this land. Of course, Jamestown was settled by men; they called them adventurers. But they were not women and children so much. These were people that put their families onboard ship and risked it all to make a beachhead in a new land. And they came with new ideas, ideas that have been a great blessing to us. I think it is important for us to remember how it was that God heard their prayers and used them. And Governor Bradford would write a little wistfully saying that he hoped that as a candle can kindle other candles, yet that they might be a bit of a light to a whole new country that would be born. Little did he know what would happen as a result of the blessings that they brought us across the ocean, this first little group of waterlogged marines as they landed in Provincetown and then Plymouth Harbor. 
   And so the story of Thanksgiving is mixed tightly and connected tightly together with our heritage as a Nation, and I think it is important for us to remind our children and our families the high price that was paid even at an early date. 
   Another thing that many people don't understand or don't know is that when the first Constitution in the Mayflower Compact was 1620, it was only 18 years later in the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut that you had the entire U.S. Constitution, the whole technology for our U.S. Constitution pretty much in place in Connecticut in 1638. The license plates in Connecticut say ``The Constitution State,'' and with good reason, because the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut had federalism and most of the developments in terms of civil government that we now have in the U.S. Constitution. 
   People sometimes say, well, this was the product of enlightenment thinking. This was way, way before the enlightenment. This was the result of a group of people who came here, first of all,  the Pilgrims, who took their principle of a new testament church and simply applied it to government; and, following that, by a pastor by the name of Hooker, who was Cambridge educated, came from England, first landed in Boston, was a friend of Winthrops, and then went to found Connecticut. And as a result of his sermons, this Fundamental Orders of Connecticut is drafted. 
   I think the only thing that is missing possibly is the bicameral nature of the legislature, and some of us in this body are not sure that the Senate was a good invention anyway. But be that as it may, you had this Constitution, which is pretty much the U.S. Constitution, as early as 1638. 
   And so as we celebrate Thanksgiving once more, I think we can remember the idea of separating civil government from church government, the idea of a written Constitution, the idea of pitching socialism out, and the tremendous courage and dream that they had for a new Nation, which we have inherited and have been blessed with. So it is a beautiful time to celebrate Thanksgiving. 
   Thank you for sticking with me as we think a little bit about this little group of courageous people that settled these shores.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (WE NEED AN ENERGY PLAN -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   In the last little more than a year, gasoline prices have gone up $1.33 cents a gallon. That's a larger increase than what we've had over the previous 5 years before that. The Democrat leadership said that they had a plan at that time, this is a year ago, to keep the gas prices from going up. Yet the gas prices have gone up. 
   Now I don't think the American public wants us to bicker between parties. They want us to be solving problems. And I don't believe it's the Democrats' fault necessarily that the gas prices have gone up internationally. But what is a problem is that we're not dealing with the problem. What we should be talking about is how do we move off of our dependence on foreign oil to American energy? What we should be seeing would be movement in the direction, depending on which way people want to go, additional refinement capacity. There have been no new refineries built in over 30 years. Investment in new nuclear technology. Our nuclear technology is old, many, many years old. It's a good source of energy. The idea of getting liquid fuel from coal. We have tremendous coal resources. Shouldn't there be something being done in that area? 
   But nothing in any of these areas. A lack of a plan is unacceptable. It's not the Democrats' fault that gas prices go up, but it is a problem when we don't have a plan.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (OVER-CLASSIFICATION REDUCTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I agree completely with my friend from St. Louis here, and H.R. 6575 makes a whole lot of sense. 
   When we face direct threats, it's easy to assume that the best thing to do is to conceal, protect, or hide information, and, in fact, it's probably the worst thing that we can do. That's what the 9/11 Commission decided as it reviewed the American classification process that existed before the 2001 attacks. This is a quotation: 
   ``Current security requirements nurture over-classification and excessive compartmentalization of information among agencies. Each agency's incentive structure opposes sharing, with risks, criminal, civil, and internal administrative sanctions, but few rewards for sharing information. No one has to pay the long-term costs of over-classifying information though these costs, even in literal financial terms, are substantial.'' 
   The result is that the United States for a long time has tried to protect a huge body of secrets using an incomprehensibly complex system of classifications and safeguard requirements. Worst still, this body of secrets is growing and no one can say with any degree of certainty how much information is classified, how much needs to be declassified, or whether the Nation's real secrets can be adequately protected in a system so bloated it often does not distinguish between the critically important and the merely embarrassing. 
   Our classification practices have been highly subjective, inconsistent, and susceptible to abuse. Over-classification often confuses national security with bureaucratic, political, or diplomatic convenience. 
   With this legislation we intend to reduce improper and over-classification and consequently increasing government-wide information sharing and the availability of information to the public. We accomplish this by instructing the Archivist to promulgate regulations which will standardize decisions on the classification documents. 
   The legislation also establishes systems for challenging whether information ought to be classified and instructs agency IGs to randomly audit classified information to assess whether proper classification decisions are actually being made. 
   Finally, this legislation creates a record attached to each classified document stating who made the decision to classify. The current system of organizational silos restricts the free flow of information from agency to agency. This system reduces this Nation's overall security by making sure no one gets a view of the entire mosaic. The legislation presents a government-wide solution to protect what must be protected but requires sharing what ought to be shared. 
   Mr. Speaker, our future safety depends on moving from a ``need to know'' culture to a ``need to share'' culture. This legislation will help us reach that goal. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6169, a bill I introduced to honor the life of Peter J. Navarro by designating the post office in Baldwin, Missouri, as the ``Specialist Peter J. Navarro Post Office Building.'' 
   A resident of Wildwood, Missouri, Specialist Peter Navarro was part of Company A, 2nd Battalion, 70th Armor Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division. On December 13, 2005, Specialist Navarro was one of four soldiers killed when a roadside bomb detonated near their Humvee during combat operations in Taji, Iraq. 
   A graduate of Lafayette High School, Peter declined his acceptance at Truman State University so he could join the Army right after graduation. 
   When Peter returned home for his younger brother's funeral, he was faced with the undeniable risks of serving his country; however, he returned to Iraq, telling friends and family ``they need me there.'' Peter was a dedicated soldier willing to give the ultimate sacrifice to protect his country and the men and women who reside there. 
   As Peter's father, Jose Navarro, said, ``He cared for the soldiers he worked with. He would do anything for his friends. And he told me he believed in the mission that he was involved in.'' 
   As a father of two marines, one of whom has served in Iraq, it is a privilege to stand here today to honor one of our fallen soldiers. Peter's commitment and dedication to his country is a shining example of how our military men and women are the finest our Nation has to offer. 
   His and his family's sacrifice should serve as a reminder to all that the freedom we enjoy as Americans is not free, but the result of the tremendous bravery and selfless service of men and women willing to put themselves in harm's way for freedom's cause. 
   Our Nation will be forever indebted to Specialist Peter Navarro. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me today in honoring Peter by voting ``yes'' on H.R. 6169.

   A resident of St. Charles, Missouri, Lance Corporal Drew Weaver was part of the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division,  1st Marine Expeditionary Force. On February 21, 2007, Lance Corporal Weaver died while conducting combat operations in the al Anbar province in Iraq. As Captain Mark C. Brown noted, Drew was ``known for his enthusiasm and his ability to motivate people around him.'' 
   Drew's contribution to his country was honored by his community when hundreds of people showed up to his memorial service and procession. A graduate of St. Charles High School, friends and family of Drew remember him as an energetic young man who was eager to serve his country. Ryan Hanson, his best friend and a fellow serviceman, said, ``Drew loved what he was doing and was proud of what he was doing for the Marine Corps.'' 
   As the father of two Marines, one of whom has served in Iraq, it is a privilege to stand here today to honor one of our fallen heroes. Drew's commitment and dedication to his country is a shining example of how our military men and women are the finest our Nation has to offer. 
   His and his family's sacrifice should serve as a reminder to all that the freedom we enjoy as Americans is not free, but the result of tremendous bravery and selfless sacrifice of men and women willing to put themselves in harm's way for freedom's cause. 
   As Reverend James Benz noted during Drew's funeral, ``I think we can learn from them that the freedom we enjoy in this country is precious, that it is special, and it must be preserved sometimes at great personal cost.'' 
   Our Nation will be forever indebted to Lance Corporal Drew Weaver. Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me today in honoring Lance Corporal Drew Weaver. 
   Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6168.

   A resident of Ballwin, Missouri, Lance Corporal Matthew P. Pathenos was part of the 3rd Battalion, 24th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division of the Marine Forces Reserve. On February 7, 2007, Lance Corporal Pathenos was killed during combat operations in the Anbar province of Iraq. 
   Matthew was often described by friends and family as a friendly young  man who always had a joke to tell, had a smile on his face. Matthew decided to join the military in order to follow his older brother into the country's service with the hope of helping those who could not help themselves. Matthew's then girlfriend, Erin, calls Lance Corporal Pathenos her hero and wishes that she might one day ``possess a fraction of his bravery and discipline.'' 
   As a father of two marines, one of whom has served in Iraq, it's a privilege to stand here today to honor one of our fallen soldiers. Matthew's commitment and dedication to his country is a shining example of how our military men and women are the finest the Nation has to offer. He and his family's sacrifice should serve as a reminder to all that the freedom we enjoy as Americans is not free but it is the result of the tremendous bravery and self sacrifice of men and women willing to put themselves in harm's way for the cause of freedom. 
   Throughout the many, many years of our Nation's existence, America has been unique at one particular regard and in many particular regards. America is the only Nation that has a political and religious motto, a code that we go by. It's expressed and it was expressed as the reason why we fought our war to gain our independence in that great sentence. It says that we believe that there are certain inalienable rights that come from God. Among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The sentence goes on to say that governments are instituted among men to protect those basic God-given rights. That has been the reason why we have gone to war, to protect our God-given rights down through the ages, in the War of Independence and other wars as well, and this war is no different. 
   Matthew Pathenos understood in his heart and in his gut the basic idea that he was defending his family and his homeland.     
   And so he joins the ranks of those who are still on patrol, whose names we will regard. He joins the ranks of the people who made the ultimate sacrifice; that you and I and future generations of Americans may go free. And in that regard, we honor him by naming this post office after Matthew Pathenos. Please join me by voting ``yes'' on H.R. 6208.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Madam Chairman, I have been enjoying hearing the debate here today. As usual, sometimes Republicans and Democrats appear to be passing each other a little bit in the night. It seems to me from hearing comments now from a number of Democratic speakers that there is an implicit assumption based on all of their arguments, and that is, hey, this is important, education is important, and this is important, and heating oil is important, and all this stuff; therefore, the government has to do it all for everybody. 
   Now, I think the other assumption, and this is the assumption that I make, is that Americans are buying an awful lot more government than we can afford. That is what my constituents are telling me. That is common sense. Going back to my district, things are getting more and more expensive. We keep increasing everything that government does. 
   The idea is, well, you are not compassionate because you don't want to add more money to government subsidies to do this and government subsidies to do that. Hey, the logical conclusion on that is the government would get 100 percent of your paycheck. I don't think that is why we are competitive. 
   I have also heard people say that we are in a global economy, as though being in a global economy somehow excuses that the Federal Government should do everything for everybody. I am not buying that assumption. The reason we are competitive in a global economy is because of free enterprise. There is one thing about a safety net. But we are buying too much government. 
   To add insult to injury, now the Democrats have just passed the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States. They are griping about one-half of 1 percent of a cut in one little bill in discretionary income, and they are adding the average of $3,000 per household across this entire Nation. Now, it would be interesting enough if they just add $3,000. The trouble with doing that this year is, guess what, you will get the $3,000 next year and the next year after that and the next year after that. But the spending is even more. 
   So we are hearing an objection, and it is all couched in this, oh, don't you care about poor people with fuel oil heating bills and about education and stuff. The trouble is, we are spending too much. What part of that don't we get? So somebody offers this timid little amendment for one-half of 1 percent, and it is like the wheels are going to fall off. 
   I have to say in answer to the questions, look, we are just buying too  much government. We have to start somewhere. I appreciate the gentlewoman's amendment. She is at least starting on one piece of one bill here. While I call it a little bit of a timid amendment, I am certainly prepared to vote for it.

Every single one of us has something in common if you are from Congress, and that is that we have people in our districts, some who call themselves pro-life and others who call themselves pro-choice, and many of them are deeply convicted of their views on this issue. 
   Now, the question before us today is, is it reasonable to force people who really do believe that abortion is killing children, is it reasonable to force them to pay money to subsidize that killing? Is that respectful to do that? Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in America. Is it reasonable to compel some of our constituents who believe that this is killing to take part in that?

   Mr. AKIN. I rise to call attention to a tragedy of our own making. In May of this year, a U.S. soldier, Alex Jimenez, along with several of his friends, were captured by al Qaeda. As our intelligence officers wanted to tap into wires to try to find his whereabouts, they were hobbled and had to wait 10 hours for lawyers to get through the FISA Court to allow them to get the critical information they needed. That information lost, this soldier and his compatriots have never been found, although the bodies of one or two have been found. 
   The Democrats want to expand this FISA process now to our warfighting capabilities and hobble our soldiers to have to wait for hours and hours for lawyers to approve gathering information. 
   Back when I was in the State of Missouri, we had jokes between farmers and lawyers. They were kind of funny. But this is not a funny joke. How many lawyers does it take to rescue a hostage? The answer should be zero.  
   Now, the Democrats want to undermine our relationship with Turkey which will cripple our military's efforts. 
   If the Democrats want to pull our troops out of Iraq then have the courage to defund the war. 
   Otherwise, stop handicapping our military with bureaucratic red tape that will undermine their mission. The lives of our military personnel are on the line.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great tragedy that occurred in Kirkwood, Missouri, in my  district this last Thursday. On what seemed to be a typical night in what has long been considered an almost idyllic community, Charles Lee Thornton shot and killed Police Sergeant William Biggs outside of the Kirkwood City Hall. 
   After entering City Hall, Mr. Thornton then shot and killed four dedicated civil servants and severely wounded the mayor before he himself was shot and killed by responding Kirkwood police officers. 
   Today, Kirkwood Mayor Mike Swoboda continues to struggle for his life. 
   Those killed in the City Hall were Police Officer Tom Ballman, Councilwoman Connie Karr, Councilman Mike Lynch, and Public Works Director Kenneth Yost. Kenneth Yost had served in that position for 35 years. 
   As Kirkwood and surrounding communities lay to rest officers and public servants, one cannot help but be moved by the deep sense of faith expressed by the family and friends they have left behind. What has also become so clear is the deep commitment that these individuals had for their community. 
   With that service in mind, I would like to refer to Matthew 20:28, which states: ``Among you, whoever wants to be great must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be the willing servant of all, like the Son of Man; He did not come to be served but to serve and to give up his life as a ransom for many.''

   Mr. AKIN. As America is becoming painfully aware, there has been a result of us not developing American energy. We have reports of police cars sitting idle because of the cost of gasoline; various assembly lines and automobile manufacturers closed down because of the fact that there's no demand for the type of vehicles that are being produced. We have a situation where parents have a hard time just putting enough gasoline in the tank to get the kids to school. And we have the AAA saying that the increase in motorists without gas has increased 15 percent. 
   Since Speaker Pelosi took office, gasoline prices have skyrocketed 71 percent. Now, I am an engineer. The good news is there's a solution to this. It's called American energy. We need to stop looking at the American energy as something that is an environmental hazard and rather look at it as an asset that we can develop. 
   The Democrats, year after year after year, 85 percent of the time, are voting against increasing supplies of American energy. We have to develop our own energy.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (GENERAL PETER PACE -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Thank you, Congressman Kline. And thank you for providing this opportunity for a number of us to make several points. 
   The first that I would make would be to show a respect for General Pace for his 40 years of service. I have two sons who are graduates of the Naval Academy, one who is returning from his second visit to the Middle East as an officer and as a Marine, and another who is just going off to his basic school this July. And I have a third son at the Naval Academy who hopefully will be graduating in another couple of years, and he might also choose the Marines as well. So I have a respect for the Marines just from what I have learned from my own sons, and particularly as a Congressman, having watched and had a chance to observe General Pace's leadership. 
   We are here partly this evening, in talking on this subject, because General Pace is not being renominated by Secretary Gates and the President. And he is not being renominated primarily because of concerns about his political correctness. In fact, a certain prominent Democrat in the other body has criticized Pace because he is ``not in touch.'' Now, that is a significant concern to me. 
   My own personal background, while I was in the Army some, has been more in the business world. But any organization can atrophy if the organization makes an effort to fill the organization with yes-men, with people who don't have the courage to speak up and to speak their opinions. 
   Now, throughout America's history, we have had generals, some who don't even speak up very delicately, but do express their opinion and have had to pay a political price. And I think that history in many cases has shown that while what these men may have said may not have been popular in their day, yet it was accurate. I think particularly of people like General Patton, who, when he had finished his business of crushing Naziism, said, Let me after the communists and the Russians and the Soviets because they are no different than the Nazis. Well, looking back historically, we realize what he said was absolutely right, but he was not politically correct. He wasn't a yes-man. 
   But it's my opinion that the reason the First Amendment is the first amendment is because Americans appreciate somebody who will speak in a forthright, straightforward manner and  can give their opinion respectfully, but still with some level of force.     
   I think that General Pace has done that and is now going to pay the price politically for not being a ``yes'' man or lining up with somebody's preconceived political notions. I think it is a sad day in America's history where we don't have more respect for the first amendment and have way too much respect for political correctness and trying to go along and get along and just be a ``yes'' man and keep everybody happy. 
   I think that one of the great things about our generals is that they do take a look at the details, they analyze the situation, and they say what is right, what is wrong, and what their opinion is. I think it is a shame that this general should be penalized for that particular situation. 
   I would be happy to yield back to my good friend, Congressman Kline. I appreciate your giving me a chance to say that I think that our organizations need to have room for people who don't always necessarily agree. I think we are better Americans, we are stronger Americans, when we can look each other in the eye and say, I love you, brother, but this is my opinion on this subject.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, I believe that the reason that Americans send us here to Congress is to have us to solve problems. And I don't think any of us mind, and I certainly don't mind, the accusation by Democrats to say that the war and the situation in Iraq is incompetently planned, or that we should change course, or that we should have bold, new initiatives. In fact, I think that's what we should be discussing. But unfortunately, what we have here today is not a matter of solving problems but rather of playing politics. Because the bill in front of us is not a bold plan. It doesn't have any segment of a plan at all. It just simply says, we're going to pull a bunch of troops out at a particular time. It  doesn't say how many; it just says we are going to pull some troops out. You know, the people who fought World War II would have liked very much to have ended the war more rapidly if they could just put something on a wish list and say, we're going to bring some troops home. But you can't do that until you win a war. And what we have before us is not a bold plan, and it's not a constructive suggestion to say, hey, you've incompetently managed the war, so here's a better way. There's no better way. It offers nothing other than just a bunch of wishes. 
   Now, if we want to send this to whoever it is that wants to grant wishes, that might be useful, but it's absolutely useless in terms of solving problems. And that's why we should be here. 
   I have to take the Democrats to task. You forgot, you guys are in the majority. The people elected you to solve problems. This doesn't solve a problem, it just simply says we want to bring some troops home. It doesn't say how or what we're going to do or what the strategy is. It says, oh, we've already done this one thing for a month, and now we just want to turn around and bring the troops home. 
   I think one thing that we can understand and one thing that we need to do is to stand away from this problem a little bit and put it in the broadest terms, and that is the terms as Americans. 
   There is one thing that has joined us together that we just celebrated, and that's the Fourth of July. And the Fourth of July we signed a Declaration of Independence, and the heart of that document, the heart of what America believes in is the fact that it says we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights; among these is life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And we stand tall on the Fourth of July when we remember that set of principles. 
   So the job of government is to protect those rights. And who is it that our sons and daughters are now fighting? They're people who believe that we blow up innocent people to make a political statement. They're people who believe that we use terror to compel people so that they don't have freedom and that people cannot pursue happiness and women cannot be educated. And so, is it so odd that we find ourselves fighting against people who believe the diametric opposite of everything America has ever stood for? 
   I taught those principles to my little kids when they were children. And they started the ``Marine Club.'' Here is a picture of them at a flag ceremony in their rag-tag uniforms bought from their Army surplus store, a bunch of little kids. Now what has happened is they have implemented those ideas. Well, what has happened is this little kid here is now Special Forces Air Force Academy, just graduated last month. And this other one, my son, has graduated from the little Marine club to the big Marine club. Here is a cache of weapons found in Fallujah. There is my son. And the reason that they are there and the reason that he risked his life numerous times is because he does believe there is a God that gives rights to all people, and that governments should protect life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And when we, as Americans, forget that, then we start to lose our sense of direction in what we're doing. 
   Until there is a specific proposal, then there is nothing being offered at all. There is not leadership. And this is merely politics.

   Mr. AKIN. Americans love to compete and to set records. In fact, people all over the world record their records in the Guinness Book of World Records. But there are some kinds of records called Darwin Awards for foolish behavior where people eliminate themselves by doing something unusual. One man took a pistol and decided to rob a gun store and got shot. 
   The Democrats are not using a pistol, but they have been setting some records. They have just set one this year, that is, the largest tax increase  in the history of this country. It comes out to about $290-some-billion. But that means to the average household a $3,000 tax increase. What household can absorb a $3,000 tax increase in just 1 year alone? 
   Unfortunately, that is not the only record being set by the Democrats. They have doubled that record in terms of how much money they have spent, over $800 billion, which would come to $6,000 per family. American people would be better if we didn't set records like that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, we rise today to discuss this resolution that is in two parts before us. The first part says that we support our troops. The second part says that we are not going to send them reinforcements. This seems to be kind of a curious proposition, almost a nonsensical proposition. How do you say you support and then say, but we don't want to send them any reinforcing troops? Certainly we say that we want to give them body armor, we want to give them up-armored Humvees, we want to send them tanks; but the most important thing that you need sometimes as troops is some other troops to support you. So we are saying, oh, we want support, but we don't want to support you. 
   Picture Davy Crockett at the Alamo. He has his back to the wall. Santa Ana has got thousands of troops. So he gets his BlackBerry out. He checks with Congress. Congress says, Hey, Davy, we really support you but we're not going to send you any troops. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. 
   Now, as I said, this resolution has two parts. It says, We support you but we're not really going to send any troops over. 
   The third part is what concerns me the most. As Congressmen, we have the responsibility to listen, to pay attention. If somebody has a better idea, that is just fine. Send your better idea forward. We are ready to be taught or to learn. If there is a better way to approach Iraq and the situation there, good. But this proposal has no positive suggestion whatsoever. It just says we support and we don't support. All that does is to encourage our enemies. And without any positive recommendation, this can only be viewed as something which strengthens our opponents' hands. They say, Goody, we've got the Americans all confused. They're saying support and don't support at the same time, with no positive recommendations whatsoever. 
   Now, I have heard people say that this is a civil war. It is not really a civil war yet. If we pull all the troops out immediately, it will turn into a civil war, no doubt about that. But what we do have is, we do know this, that the terrorists have been involved in setting one group of people against another. They blow up a holy place of the Shias and the Shias start fighting the Sunnis. And so, yes, they have sparked a whole lot of unrest, particularly in Baghdad. It is not a civil war yet. But do we think that the terrorists aren't going to do the same thing in other countries where you have the one leadership with a majority of people in the other tribe. 
   So I don't think it is much of an escape to say, oh, well, this is a civil war. What it is, it is a war against terrorists. Regardless of how you want to speculate what might happen if we leave all of a sudden, at least I would respect the Democrats more if you  would just simply say, we need to cut and run, or we need to stay where we are. But don't just leave a blank piece of paper and say we support and don't support. It doesn't make any sense. All it does is help the enemy. 
   It seems to me that we need to as Americans one more time as we have in the past take a good, serious gut check. I have a chance to speak to American audiences everywhere and lots of little kids and I always ask the same question. I ask the question, If you were to take America that you love and condense it down as to what do you really believe about this country, what is the heart and core of America? The answer that I almost always get is the word ``freedom.'' 
   But freedom needs a little bit more definition. The Tiananmen Square Chinese students wanted freedom and they greased the tank treads with their bodies. But they didn't get freedom. Just because you want freedom doesn't mean you can have it. 
   So what is the heart of what we believe as Americans? Well, I will tell you. The first time we went to war we stated that and we had quite an argument and discussion about it. And it was put in the Declaration of Independence: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these is life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And the job of government is to protect those basic, fundamental, God-given rights. That is what they believed and they had to decide: Are we going to fight the British or not? Those are the things that I taught to my children. 
   This is a picture of the Marine Club with my 9-year-old son standing here, saluting the flag as it is going up. We taught him that there are some things in this world that are worth dying for and that one of those things is the fact that God gives us basic inalienable rights. That little Marine Club kid has grown up. 
   There he is in Fallujah in 2005. That is the cache of terrorist weapons that they found in Fallujah. He has grown up. He understands the risk to his life. He almost died in Fallujah. He believes, as I do, that there are some things in this world that are worth defending. This is not a war about a civil war. This is head to head with terrorists. 
   And is it surprising that we find ourselves fighting terrorists? Terrorists believe, we blow up innocent people to make a political statement. We believe that the right to life comes from God, that it is an inalienable right. The terrorists terrorize people to compel you to take your liberty away and we believe that liberty is a gift that comes from God. We are going head to head with people that have always been the enemies of America, and I am concerned that if we do not stand up and show that we not only think that it is a nice idea in our Declaration but it is a conviction that we will defend with our lives, that we will be fighting the terrorists here.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the resolution that is before the House. It is a resolution in two parts. The first part says we support the troops. The second part says we are not going to reinforce the troops. That is kind of curious in a way, I suppose, isn't it? That we would support them with up-armored Humvees, with body armor, with tanks, but oh, no, we are not going to allow other troops to help the troops that we have there. It seems like you can't have it both ways. It is self-contradictory. 
   You picture Davey Crockett at the Alamo, and he is there and Santa Anna's army has got him back to the wall, and he gets his BlackBerry out and he checks with the Congress, and the Congress says, yeah, Davey Crockett, we support you, but we're not going to send anybody to help. I don't think you can have it both ways. 
   When I was a legislator in the State of Missouri, I kept track of some of what I considered to be the silliest legislation I had seen. One of them was this lady who got so enthused about volunteering, that she created a bill called ``Mandatory Volunteerism.'' That was odd. And here we go, we are saying support, but don't support. This is curious, and it undermines people like my son, who has served in Fallujah.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (RIGHT TO LIFE -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Thank you very much. I'm just so thankful for your willingness to take this special hour and organize things here on the floor of the U.S. Congress, and your leadership. The people of Minnesota are blessed to have you, and I'm just very thankful to be able to be a small part. 
   But one of the things that those of us who are Members of Congress do, as you can imagine, is that we do give speeches. We talk to different groups of people, young and old, on all kinds of different issues. 
   But one of the questions that I love to ask, and it's something that we should know the answer to rather quickly, and yet, most Americans don't really have the answer quite on the tips of their tongues, and that would be to ask the question, what is it that has made America such a unique and a special place for all of us to live? 
   Now, if you live here, sometimes you can take for granted some of the things that we enjoy every day. But America is extremely different. 
   First of all, there are all these people from other countries that want to come here because they believe that this is the land of opportunity; this is where your dreams can become true. 
   Aside from that, America has been engaged in a number of huge and colossal wars. We find ourselves as the dominant military power on the planet. And so through these different wars, did we create empires? Did we build kingdoms? The answer is, of course, no. We have named no emperors, no kings. In fact, what we did was we voted to tax our constituents to rebuild our enemies after we had defeated them. 
   America is a unique and special place. But what is it that makes America so special? Why do all these different people from different nations all come together here for the American Dream? What is it, if you were to define it, if you're looking at it like an onion and you're to say you peel off the outer layers of fireworks and apple pie and the flag and you get to the center of what makes it tick? 
   One of the words when I ask this question frequently is the word ``freedom.'' But freedom doesn't really describe the core principle or the logic of on which basis America tips. You know, the people in Tiananmen Square, they wanted freedom. They stood up for freedom. They were willing to die for freedom. They were greased underneath the treads of tanks and they gave their lives, but they didn't get freedom. 
   So what is it that produces the freedom? What is it that makes America what it is? What is the formula? 
   Well, if I were asked that question, I would cheat a little bit. I would go  back to our first great war when America wrote a statement of what we believe and what we stand for as a people. It is, of course, called the Declaration of Independence. It was the reason why we would dare to challenge the biggest military power in the world. And that second paragraph, the sentence, ``We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these is life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'' And then the sentence goes on after ``pursuit of happiness,'' and says, ``And governments are instituted among men deriving their just power from the consent of the governed.'' And it goes on to say, the purpose of the government is essentially to protect these basic rights. What rights? Well, life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   So the engineer in me says, now, let's break this down. How does the formula that defines America work? Well, it's based on these ideas: One, that there is a God; second of all, that that God grants basic fundamental rights to all people; and lastly, the job of civil government is to protect those rights. 
   Now, if you take a look at that equation then you say, well, what does that mean? Well, first of all, we can take away from that the fact that if you take God out of the equation, you don't have any fundamental rights and the whole American system starts to come unglued. 
   Second of all, you notice that the rights are not just Americans' rights. These are rights for all human beings. This is a powerful idea. This idea is being exported overseas, and other people are enthused and caught up in the possibility that there is a gracious, loving God that gives fundamental rights to all people. 
   Another rather straightforward conclusion would be this: that a government that does not protect the most fundamental right, the right of life, is a government that is not doing its job. It is broken. And for those of us in America over these years to have tolerated selling the lives of our unborn down the river of convenience, we have violated the most fundamental and basic logic of what America has always stood for. 
   Abortion is so un-American. It's something that people weren't paying attention on, and the Court slipped it in on them, and pretty soon people started to wake up and say, Oh, my goodness, this is horrible. And all across America, people are starting now to wake up. 
   Now, because of the nature of the way that the Court usurped their power and authority and decided to take the power to themselves to create law out of thin air, we have one of the most polarizing issues that has confronted our Nation since the days of slavery. And yet, just as slavery is fundamentally un-American, so, even more so, anything that violates the most fundamental right, the right to life, is contrary to everything that Americans have stood for and fought for. 
   Now, some people are aware of the fact, now that we're engaged in a great war, a war against terrorists, should that surprise us? Well, think about it a little bit. What is it that terrorists believe? Terrorists believe that, hey, it's okay to blow up a few people to make a political statement. 
   And what do we believe? We believe right to life is a fundamental, God-given right. We are completely on the opposite side of the page of the terrorist. The terrorist is a terrorist. And what does that mean? Well, it means he wants to compel you into doing something because you're so afraid of him. That's not very similar, is it, to what we believe; that God gives people the right to life and then the right to liberty. The right to liberty is to be able to follow your own conscience without being terrorized by some opponent. So it is no big surprise that we fight the terrorists because they are fundamentally un-American. And yet we have terrorists in our own culture called abortionists. 
   One of the good pieces of news why we are winning this war is because there are not enough heartless doctors being graduated from medical schools. There is a real shortage of abortionists. Who wants to be at the very bottom of the food chain of the medical profession? And what sort of these places do these bottom-of-the-food-chain doctors work in? Places that are really a pit. You find that along with the culture of death go all kinds of other lawbreaking, the not following good sanitary procedures, giving abortions to women who are not actually pregnant, cheating on taxes, all these kinds of things, the misuse of anesthetic so that people die or almost die. All of these things are common practice. And all that information is available for America. And the day is coming when this public discussion will continue and America will say we're tired of abortion because it's so fundamentally un-American. And this, like a bad nightmare, will pass away, and there will be a day, just as there is today, where people say who would ever support slavery. In the future there will be a day when men will say who would ever have supported something so un-American as abortion. 
   I'm so thankful for the gentlelady for her leadership and for allowing us to have a time to engage in this public discussion, something that's not going to be done by political tricks, but by the conscience of the American public being raised to the point where they say, No more. The bad dream is over. We are going to once again honor what Americans have always stood for, the God-given right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   God bless you.

<DOCNO>Mr. AKIN. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AKIN. Mr. Speaker, I would comment that one of the things that the public would really like to see in Congress is for us to come down here, put our partisan differences aside and actually solve some problems. We don't always do a good job in that regard on many topics. But this is quite an exception today. And I think it's a time that the public can be very thankful for Chairman Skelton from the great State of Missouri and also for Ranking Member Hunter. Both of them have rolled their sleeves up and have put together an authorization bill that actually deals with the problems that face our country and have a very credible solution. 
   This is a ``hats off'' for people who've worked very hard. We're very thankful to have a chance to get the bill passed, and it's that tone of our leadership that is willing to solve problems instead of squabbling like a bunch of cats. This is a very bright day. We're thankful for that leadership.
