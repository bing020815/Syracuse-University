<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Madam Speaker, the basic principle of this economic stimulus package I agree with, and that is allowing taxpayers to keep more of what they contribute to the government in order to keep more of what they earn so they can spend it for their families and the communities. 
   Yesterday, the Speaker said that she estimates that each dollar of broad tax cuts leads to $1.26 in economic growth. Now, that's a wonderful thing, 26 percent return on your investment for allowing people to keep what they earn. That's wonderful and that's a very good thing. Tax relief spurs economic growth. That is true. 
   But we have to also go a step further in this economic stimulus package. At a time when people are concerned about high gas prices, rising costs of health care, as well as keeping their homes, we have to be acutely aware of helping them. And I think what we can do as a Congress is go a step further in this stimulus package, one step further, and that is to take the rising taxes, the tax increases that are on the table and take them off the table. 
   Look, we need to do a whole lot more to keep this economy strong, to keep it consistently strong. We need to make permanent the tax relief from 2001 and 2003. I think it would be immoral for Washington politicians to take more out of people's hard-earned incomes for wasteful spending programs. And I think we have to go further. 
   By taking that tax increase off the table, we will help every kitchen table in America, for every middle-class family in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (MY FIRST VISIT TO ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, traveling to the Holy Land in August, I saw firsthand the challenges facing our ally and friend, Israel. From Syria, the terrorist state in the north, to Lebanon and the chaos existing there further to the north, to the enemies that surround the state, I saw the challenges traveling down the Galilee to the Jordan, down to the Dead Sea and going to the capital, Jerusalem. 
   While it was my great privilege to walk on that sacred holy ground, I also realized the eye-opening national security issues that they face as a nation. Israel is our greatest ally in the war against Islamic extremists, and it is our function to support them in Israel. It is our imperative to support them. That's why our 10-year security agreement that we recently signed between the United States and Israel is so necessary for the ongoing security, not just of Israel, but of the United States. Israel's enemies are our enemies. We share a common cause, and it is necessary that we stand strong for Israel because it makes us that much stronger. 
   I encourage the American people to support our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Madam Speaker, we are often told safety doesn't happen by accident. And it is no accident that Caldwell County has been kept safe under the careful watch of Lenoir Fire Chief Ken Briscoe, who has been fighting fires for more than 30 years. 
   Chief Briscoe wrote the book on firefighting, literally. He developed extensive training curricula while working with the State fire marshal's office, sharing his wisdom and experience with more than 1,400 North Carolina fire departments. 
   Chief Briscoe then returned to the front lines of firefighting, taking the helm of the Lenoir Fire Department, and we have been fortunate to have him. The Lenoir Fire Department is a top-notch organization. And because of his leadership there, Chief Briscoe has recently been named North Carolina's top firefighter by the North Carolina State Firemen's Association. 
   In the words of one of his lieutenants, ``Chief Briscoe is a firefighter's fireman.'' I am honored to know such a public servant and call him a friend. 
   Congratulations, Chief Briscoe. We are very proud of you. You have earned this award, and you have kept the people of western North Carolina safe. Thank you for your service.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (EARLY ACTIONS OF NEW DEMOCRAT MAJORITY -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, this is a nice occasion at the end of the week to wrap up what we have been doing and talk about how we have been active this week, but before I start, I would like to yield to the distinguished former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, my colleague from California (Mr. Hunter), to discuss points that he illuminated in his first 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend Mr. McHenry, and again, I thought it was important, as we move into this new era and my great friend Ike Skelton takes over the Armed Services Committee to reflect on where we stand and what we did in the last Congress. 
   Again, just to reiterate, we culminated a 40 percent pay increase for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the United States Marine Corps, and the National Guard in this last 8 years. Along with that, we increased family separation pay, which is the pay a family receives when the loved one is separated, maybe is in theatre, or maybe is deployed far around the world in this global war against terror. We increased that from $150 to $250 per month. We increased combat pay. We increased a number of our insurances. And also, Mr. Speaker, we increased TRICARE coverage for National Guard personnel and for their families. 
   Along with that, we did something that was really the special project of the outgoing readiness chairman, Mr. Hefley of Colorado, which was to bring in to full flower this privatization of housing on military bases across the country so that military wives and family members could move into really great housing. 
   I have to tell you, in visiting bases across America, it has been heartwarming to see these military families coming into wonderful new housing that often has an entertainment area in maybe a common area with a pool and tennis courts and reading rooms in the center of one of these housing projects where the families can go for entertainment and take their children for good quality time. 
   So the quality of life for America's military families has been greatly increased over the last 8 years. 
   Now, what have we done in terms of firepower? Mr. Speaker, I can tell you that beginning with this administration and meetings that we held with the Secretary of Defense and with the President, one concern that I had, and a number of members of our committee had, was the amount of what I would call precision firepower. That is the ability to deliver a smart bomb or a precise system. Instead of, for example, having to drop 100 bombs on a bridge to knock a bridge out, to be able to send a smart bomb in, hit one strut on that bridge, and bring the bridge down. 
   We all know now that this is the age of precision firepower, and we wanted to greatly expand our precision firepower because that gives the United States the capability to project enormous power around the world when we have to. So, Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to report to the people of the House, to our great colleagues and to the American people that we have in the last 8 years more than doubled, more than doubled our precision firepower. 
   A lot of that is manifested in what we call LGBs, or laser-guided bombs. A lot is manifested in what we call JDAMs, or joint direct attack munitions. But for our adversaries, that means that America has the power now to send in more than twice the firepower in precise places, at precise targets with enormous effect. That is very important for America's troops and for America's strength. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, also people have asked what have we done in terms of enlarging the size of the two ground elements of America's military, the primary ground elements, the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps? We have increased the size of the Marine Corps now from 175,000 personnel to 180,000 personnel. We have increased it right at, in fact, exactly 5,000 Marines. And the last time I checked, we were something like 100 Marines under that limit. But we have gone from 175,000 Marines to 180,000 Marines. We are right at that exact number, a few people short, but we have those Marines actually on the ground, deployed, showing up for roll call each day in their particular position in the war against terror. So we have increased the size of the United States Marine Corps. Now, we may need further increases, but at least at this point we have a 5,000 troop increase. 
   With respect to the Army, we took the Army end strength from 482,000 to 512,000. That is a 30,000 person increase in the United States Army. Now, a number of us on the Armed Services Committee have done an analysis parallel to the QDR, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and we feel we may have to increase the Marine Corps and the Army further, and you can see those recommendations manifested in that report. But we have actually increased the Army and we have increased the size of the U.S. Marine Corps. 
   Now, if you ask, and a number of people have asked since Ronald Reagan  made that speech in 1983 and said, in essence, we are entering the age of missiles, and the United States, to secure its people, has to have the ability to shoot down incoming missiles, a number of people have asked us and asked regularly where are we in terms of missile defense. And I am pleased to report, Mr. Speaker, that for the first time in the history of the United States, we actually have a very small, very limited, but nonetheless very real missile defense for the first time. It is manifested in the interceptor missiles that we have in place on the Pacific coast and Alaska that could handle, on a very limited basis, a rogue missile or several coming into the United States. 
   Now, some people may say, well, that is not much. And my answer is, that is more than we have ever had in the history of this country. We have deployed a missile defense and we will be building on that deployment. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I just thought it was important to lay out some of the things that this Congress has done and that this Armed Services Committee has accomplished for the American people. A 40 percent pay increase for our troops, increasing the size of the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, putting together the first missile defense in the history of the country, and more than doubling the precision firepower of our armed forces. 
   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, the President will be making a statement very soon about this adjusted policy on Iraq, and I just wanted to once again tell my colleagues the recommendation that I have made. I know a lot of us have made recommendations to the President and to the Secretary of Defense. 
   Right now, there are 18 provinces in Iraq. And in half of those provinces, nine of those provinces, there are virtually no attacks taking place. They average less than one attack a day. In those quiet peaceful provinces, there are 27 battalions of Iraqi soldiers located and stationed. Twenty-seven battalions is a lot of soldiers, Mr. Speaker. It is a lot of firepower. It is a lot of personnel. 
   My recommendation to the President and to the Secretary of Defense for the last several months, and I hope that this has been a part of their conversation, I have urged them, and a number of other of my colleagues have joined with me in urging them to take the 27 Iraqi battalions that we have trained and equipped and move them into the battle. Now, that means that the Ministry of Defense is going to have to give orders to those battalion commanders and those brigade commanders in the quiet peaceful sections of Iraq and tell them to saddle up their forces, get them on the trucks, and move them to Baghdad. 
   They need to do that. That should be nonnegotiable. It should be a requirement by the American war fighting commanders that cannot be delayed, cannot be finessed, and cannot be put aside. That is something that should be nonnegotiable, especially against the backdrop of the enormous American effort that has given birth to this new government in Iraq. 
   So I know the President is going to come out with his suggested policy soon, but I thought it was important to lay out this fact, that right now we have 27 Iraqi battalions in quiet areas which can be utilized in the fight, can be put into the fight. In my estimation, their value in an urban setting, especially one like Baghdad, where speaking the language is important, and where knowing the communities is important, their placement in those positions before we move any additional American troops into those urban situations is, I think, something that we should do, and that we should require of the Ministry of Defense of Iraq.     
   I want to thank Mr. McHenry for letting me come out and talk a little bit about these issues and take some of his valuable time. I certainly appreciate the gentleman's allowing me to come out and say a word or two.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, it is an interesting moment in our Nation's history, an interesting moment indeed, with a new Democrat majority coming to these hallowed halls of Congress. The American people spoke in November and they wanted a change. 
   As someone who was formerly in the majority party, now in the minority party, I respect the power of democracy to change our Nation and change the direction of our Nation in important policy areas. I think some of that is going to be beneficial to our economy, and other proposals that the new Democrat majority are putting forward are going to be hurtful to our economy and to our national defense and our family security. But I think it is important that we talk today about some of the early actions of this new Democrat majority. 
   During the campaign season over the last few years, the last 2 years, the Democrats campaigned on openness and accountability. They campaigned on many things. 
   In the opening days of Congress, we have seen a far different reality than what they campaigned on over the last 2 years. It is disheartening to me as an American citizen and someone who is hopeful and optimistic about this new Congress, hopeful that we can work on a bipartisan basis, and I think it is important that we talk about these opening day actions and the actions they have taken over the last 2 days of this new Democrat majority. 
   The first action and the first course of business of this new Congress was to pass a very closed-off process for consideration of the so-called 100-hour agenda of the Democrat party put forward by the new speaker, Ms. Pelosi of California. 
   What we see in this closed-off package is far different than when they campaigned on. They campaigned on an open process, open and fair debate, a dialogue across the aisle, so that we could work in a bipartisan way for the American people. The first action they took was to lock out all dissenting voices, even within their own party, but also among the Republicans represented here today. The Republicans represent 140 million Americans here in the U.S. House of Representatives. Their first action after campaigning on openness and bipartisanship was to close out dissenting voices, to close out the amendment process. 
   I was surprised by this, because looking at then-Minority Leader PELOSI'S words, I believed that Minority Leader PELOSI would be a very open Speaker Pelosi. What we see with her words and actions, and I have a visual aid here to that effect, now, Speaker Pelosi, then Minority Leader PELOSI, said a few things about the minority having rights here in this institution. 
   Then-Minority leader PELOSI said in 2004, her Minority Bill of Rights includes fair principles. ``There is a very excellent chance that the Republicans will be in the minority next year, and what I am saying is this is the way the House should be conducted, in a bipartisan way, and whether he,'' meaning Speaker Hastert at the time, ``agrees to it or not, this is the course of action that I will take.'' 
   What is striking to me is the date on that is June 2004. We are in the second day of a Democrat majority and we have, instead of a Minority Leader Pelosi, a Speaker Pelosi. What is striking here is ``that is the course of action that I will take.'' Those are the Speaker's words. 
   To that end, I took the very letter that Minority Leader PELOSI wrote at the time and we filed that legislation and we offered it here on the House floor yesterday, and it was flatly rejected. Every Democrat to the person voted against it. 
   It is striking to me that in their first day as a majority, as a Democrat majority, they are already going back on the words that they campaigned on, they campaigned on in 2004, 2005 and 2006. 
   What did they say in 2005? Then minority leader Pelosi said, ``Mr. Speaker, I implore you to end the repeated abuses of the rules by the Republican majority to ram legislation through in such a secretive and unfair manner.'' That is 2005. 
   What we see today and yesterday by this new Democrat majority is that they have a secretive process, because it says that we cannot offer any amendments on the legislation that we will soon be able to see. We can't even see the legislation in their 100 hours. They have not let us or the American people or even many in their own party see the legislation which we will be voting upon and for which we gave initial approval to today. That is very striking to me, especially after the language and rhetoric used in 2004 and 2005 by Speaker Pelosi. 
   ``Additionally, in 2006, so 3 years running, more than 2 years ago, I first sent Speaker DENNIS HASTERT Democrat proposals to restore civility to the Congress. I reiterate my support for those proposals today. We must restore bipartisanship to the administration of the House, reestablish regular order for consideration of legislation and ensure the rights of the minority, whichever party is in the minority. The voice of every American has to be heard.'' 
   Now, 2004, 2005, 2006, Minority Leader Pelosi talked about openness and bipartisanship. Speaker Pelosi, the first act of office, goes completely back on these very words. This rhetoric did not become reality on the first opening hours of the Democrat majority. I am hopeful, as all Americans should be, hopeful that there is openness tomorrow. As Americans, we are an optimistic people. 
   I think it would be amazing, in fact, I think we would all be amazed, if their second act was for openness when their first act, their first principle, was closing off debate and closing off any input from rank and file Members of this body and the people that we represent at home. 
   What I would say is that beyond just the words, we need to look at the values and the principles of this majority. We offered this minority bill of rights that then minority leader Pelosi proposed, and it simply says that legislation should be considered in the committee process and we should have full open debate and discourse. 
   In essence, we outlined what all fifth graders in this great country are taught about the legislative process here in the House of Representatives, that a bill is filed, it is sent to committee, it is amended and debated and compromised there, it goes to the floor and goes through that same process, when in fact that is not always the course of operation of this House. 
   So the problem is that it is not simply about the process. The issue today is that the process corrupts the policy. When you stack the deck on the outcome, you corrupt the policy of this House Chamber and the laws of this land. So process and policy are intertwined. When one is corrupted, so is the other. With the Democrats shutting down debate at a critical moment in our Nation's history, we have to question their judgment. 
   There are a number of proper proposals they are putting forward in the initial 100 hours of debate here in the House of Representatives. One thing that is very important to Americans and our national security is the 9/11 Commission recommendations outlined in the fall and over the last few years. We have heard them very well. 
   The Democrats campaigned that they wanted to and would, if they were given the majority, fully implement the 9/11 recommendations. No matter whether or not they were good public policy or not, they are going to implement all of them. 
   Well, as it turns out, the Washington Post reported on November 30, 2006, that ``With control of Congress now secured, Democratic leaders have decided for now against implementing the one measure that would affect them most directly, a wholesale reorganize of Congress to improve oversight and funding of the Nation's intelligence agencies.'' 
   It is striking that just days after the election, they are already going back on their proposal to implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. Now they are saying that they will implement some but not all. It is kind of surprising, because the American people heard in an almost unanimous voice from Democrats that they were going to implement all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. I didn't hear candidates out there and Members of Congress on the Democrat side saying some, but not all. No, they said all 9/11 Commission recommendations. 
   Only through press reports do we know what this legislation says. They have not given this out, other than their allies on K Street and the lobbying community. But they haven't given this out for the American people and for the press and for all Members of Congress to see. So we have some concerns about this, because there are many of us who want to offer perfecting amendments, to make sure this policy is right and secures our Nation in a proper way. 
   Thomas Kean, who is a former distinguished Member and Governor of New Jersey, was a cochair of the 9/11 Commission. He called these important overhauls in the congressional process of oversight and intelligence vital. 
   What we have to do is make sure that the Democrats uphold their promise. We don't want broken promises. We don't want them to campaign on good ideas and be corrupted by an ugly process here that results in bad policy. National security is, of course, of key and utmost importance, and I am glad they are at least bringing that up in the first 100 hours. 
   Additionally, many of us in this Nation are concerned about research and ensuring that we have medical cures that comfort, that our government policy upholds not just ethical and moral research, but lifesaving research. 
   Next Thursday, from press reports, the Democrats will vote to enact legislation to expand Federal taxpayer funding for research that destroys human life and human embryos, and they call this stem cell research. 
   Well, while I don't support the destruction of human life, I do support stem cell research, adult stem cell research that has led to cures. Unfortunately, due to the process that they have here in this new Democrat majority, we are not going to be able to offer amendments to ensure that life is not destroyed and that human embryos are not destroyed in this process of research. 
   But if you look at embryonic stem cell research versus adult stem cell research, there have been wonderful cures coming out of adult stem cell research, but no cures coming out of embryonic stem cell research. And we are not even questioning whether or not embryonic stem cell research should come about. It is a question of whether our taxpayer dollars should be used to destroy human life, or what many Americans believe to be a destruction of human life. 
   Even if not all of us agree on whether or not life should be protected at its most basic and precious moment, we should all agree that we shouldn't have unethical processes and research funded by our Federal taxpayer dollars. In fact, the National Institutes of Health spends roughly $600 million per year on stem cell research already, including $40 million for research involving certain types of embryonic stem cell research. But the type of research they conduct does not destroy human life.     
   Additionally, nearly 100 million of it is for nonhuman embryonic stem cell research. So this is already being done, yet it is a nice rhetorical device, just like the Democrats campaigning on implementing all the 9/11 Commission Report recommendations and just like openness and fairness. American people like the sound of that. But what is concerning, whether it is embryonic stem cell research, the 9/11 Commission, or openness and fairness, is that it was only rhetoric. The Democrats didn't want to implement it and make it reality here in policy and in law for our Nation. 
   Beyond that, we have another provision that we voted on today, and this is Pelosi's PAYGO legislation. Now, PAYGO is a shorthanded word for pay-as-you-go. It is a nice way that we talk about it here on Capitol Hill. We call it PAYGO. Now, it sounds very good. The American people want us to pay for government policies as we enact them, and so that is a great rhetorical device as well. Pay-as-you-go. Well, what is devilish about this proposal is that it will lead to a backdoor tax increase down the line. 
   As the Wall Street Journal editorial said today: under Pelosi's PAYGO plan, new entitlement programs and all new tax cuts would have to be offset by either cutbacks and other entitlement programs or tax increases. This version of Pelosi's PAYGO is a budget trapdoor designed to control expenditures but to make it easier, easier, to raise taxes while blocking future tax cuts.  
   That is from today's Wall Street Journal. 
   Now, the fundamental budget problem is not spending too little and taxing too little; it is the fact that right now in our country Federal revenues climbed by $550 billion over the past 2 fiscal years, and that is as a direct result of the economic support and economic growth of the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts. As the economy grows and more people are employed, fewer people use government services. As fewer people use government services and are making money on their own, they actually begin to pay taxes. When people are paying taxes, revenue to government goes up. It is a basic process. And through this robust economic growth that has come out of these tax cuts, we have had more revenue come into government. 
   So pay-as-you-go is a way for the Democrats to establish later the reasoning to go to the American people and say we need to raise your taxes. Now, I think it is a faulty and flawed policy, because the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 have not limited income to government; in fact, what the American people must know, Mr. Speaker, is that the government revenue to the United States Government is the highest it has ever been in the history of our country. The highest revenue of any time in our country's history. Beyond that, actually to say it more broadly, we have more government revenue coming into the U.S. Treasury, your tax dollars coming into the U.S. Treasury. Even after tax cuts, we have the most government revenue in the history of man and the history of the Earth. No government has ever received as much in tax dollars as ours does today; yet, still, the Democrats put a proposal on the floor today that will let them raise taxes later. 
   It is so shocking and so surprising that they would do this in their opening week in Congress. Now, I knew there were tax-and-spenders on the other side of the aisle, and that is a liberal focus, to grow the size of government, increase the revenue to government; but I didn't realize they would do this at the very beginning of their new majority in Congress. I think the American people should be shocked by that. 
   But what this pay-as-you-go, or PAYGO, proposal ignores is that all the appropriations we have made in the past, the current government programs that we have will not be under this rule. So we won't analyze the entitlement programs to see where they need to be reformed; we won't analyze existing government programs to see that they are getting the proper result or they are being efficient with their dollars. It will only apply to new spending. 
   So let's look at the 100-hour plan and total up the tax value of it and the spending value of it. And what you see as a result of this plan is pretty simple: $800 billion of new spending in this 100-hour plan. Now, think about that. I think the American people should stop for a second, Mr. Speaker, and think about the fact that in 100 short legislative hours, over just a few days, the new Democrat majority will spend $800 billion. That is shocking. 
   Now, I know that there are these free-spending ways in Washington, and as a conservative I am opposed to that, especially as someone who considers themselves a fiscal hawk. But to spend that much money in such a short period of time has got to strike the American people as egregious, especially when you campaigned as the Democrats tried to in the last election as fiscal conservatives and a party that wants to balance the budget. Yet, they are offering $800 billion worth of new spending in their first acts of office. 
   So how do they get that money to pay as they go? They are going to come to our tax dollars, our personal tax dollars. They are going to ask more from every American. That means that when you get your paycheck, whether you work in my district in Hickory, North Carolina, or Mooresville or in Cherryville, where I am from, you are going to pay more out of that paycheck to fund the programs that the Democrats who are in control of this place want to implement. So the average working man and woman in this country will pay more under Democrat leadership than they will under Republican leadership. 
   Beyond that, this 100-hour proposal completely, completely ignores some of the most pressing issues in our country, certainly ensuring that our troops in the field are funded fully. Now, that is very important. Completely ignored in the 100-hour plan in the Democrat agenda for this Congress. What about entitlement reform? Because, after all, that is the largest section of the budget of our Federal budget, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. Very important programs. But we need to make sure that they are fiscally efficient, that they are fiscally sound, and it is clear that they are not either 
   efficient nor sound. 
   So we need to look at entitlement programs, yet the Democrat majority has completely ignored entitlement reform in their agenda. They have completely ignored making Social Security solvent for future generations. And as someone who is eligible for retirement the same year that Social Security goes finally broke, I am concerned about that, and my generation of Americans should be concerned about that as well as all generations of Americans. 
   What else is missing? Well, obviously the cost of litigation on small businesses across this country, completely ignored that, certainly because the trial lawyers I think have helped write the Democrat agenda for this Congress and there is a big difference between what trial lawyers seek and what the average small businessman or the average family doctor in this country seeks. And so they have completely ignored reforming and limiting litigation and the cost of litigation on the American society. Completely ignored that. 
   They have also ignored helping small businesses with health care either through health savings accounts where individuals can save tax free, something that we as Republicans have worked very hard, and free-market conservatives like the idea of people being able to save tax free without Uncle Sam reaching into your savings and pocketing that money; or association health plans where small businesses can come together, link up, and increase their affordability and their buying capacity to give their employees health care. Completely ignored with the Democrats' agenda. 
   In fact, the Democrats came on the floor, some of these that campaigned on the other side of the aisle as helping small businesses, one of their first votes was to vote against letting small businesses pool their resources to buy health care. That hurts. That hurts in the opening days of Congress. 
   Beyond that, they have ignored border security. I think the American people have demanded border security and a sane immigration policy for this country. There are many leaders on my side of the aisle on the issue of border security, and I think we need to engage in that discussion on how we reform our immigration policy in this United States and how we plan to do that. I think most Americans agree that we must begin with the border, to ensure that we have an immigration policy that is enforceable, realistic, and real for this country. 
   So though we are just in a few opening hours of this new Congress, some things are clear. Some things are very clear. The rhetoric that the Democrats campaigned on was good. It was good. The American people supported it. The American people put new Democrats in office, Democrats that campaigned some as fiscal conservatives, others as social conservatives, most certainly as moderates in this last election. But their opening hours, their opening hours go back on those pledges for fiscal sanity due to the high cost of their opening plan and proposals, $800 billion worth of spending in just 100 hours. 
   It goes back on this openness concept. It goes back on fiscal sanity by covering up with this Pelosi PAYGO plan that will raise our taxes later in the year or later next year, certainly tax increases in the future, though. It fully ignores their proposal to fully implement the 9/11 Commission proposals by kind of sort of doing a few of them that they think are politically palatable rather than following through on their promise. It uses a great rhetorical device of stem cell research. But when they come here and they vote, they ignore the cloning issue, whether or not we are funding human cloning, whether or not we are destroying human life.  
   So the rhetoric in the campaign is very much removed from their actions in this new Congress. 
   They also ignore their pledge to work with all sides on issues of importance to the American people, to work in a bipartisan way. They even go back on their pledge and demand for minority rights here in this institution. So we see hypocrisy from the Democrat majority. Many would say it is ironic that you campaign as a conservative, yet come in and govern as a liberal, which we are already seeing in just two days of Democrat control. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I think the American people are an optimistic and hopeful people. We have a new week, we have a new day coming where the Democrats can change, and I am hopeful that they will, that they will go back to what they campaigned on that the American people endorsed in the last election for bipartisanship, for openness, for national security and the defense of our country, for good strong family values, and fiscal sanity. And when that happens, I will be happy to reach across the aisle and work with my colleagues in the Democrat majority to ensure that these things happen. 
   But until that day comes, I will point out the fact that they are going back on their words to the American people, and I will not restrain myself from calling it as I see it, and I think as the way the American people should see it as well, that in order to govern effectively you have to fulfill your promises, you have to make sure it is not empty campaign rhetoric, that in fact it is a full implementation of the agenda that you sought in the election. 
   I think the American people want change in Washington. I don't think they got change in the last two days, though. I think what you saw with this new Democrat majority is this same type of abuse of power that they had in 1993, in 1992, through the 1980s and the 1970s. The majority may be new today, but the Democrat chairmen are the same as they were 20 years ago, on the larger part of the Democrat majority and for the larger part of the committees that they have organized. And the policy proposals that they offer going forward after this 100-hour proposal will be much the same as they offered in the early 1990s and the 1980s and the 1970s.     
   Those policy proposals are pretty simple: Raise your taxes, weaken national defense, and go the opposite way on family values. But I hope that we can work with moderates on the other side of the aisle, moderates on the other side of the aisle that are willing to look at fiscal sanity, willing to stand up for traditional values and willing to do the right thing for the American people and will work together. I am very hopeful that we will have that opportunity after this 100-hour proposal is done. And hopefully, it will be done quickly.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin, the ranking member on the Budget Committee, on which I have had the pleasure of serving for the past 2 years. 
   And it is ironic that I follow another colleague from North Carolina who is in favor of the Pelosi PAYGO plan that we have before us here today on the House floor. It is unfortunate that it is being offered in a closed rule, in a setting whereupon Republicans cannot offer any constructive amendments or perfecting amendments to ensure that tax increases don't arise out of this Pelosi PAYGO plan. 
   According to the Wall Street Journal editorial today: ``Under her,'' Pelosi's, ``PAYGO plan, new entitlement programs and all new tax cuts would have to be offset by either cut-backs in other entitlement programs or tax increases. This version of PAYGO is a budget trapdoor, designed not to control expenditures, but to make it easier to raise taxes while blocking future tax cuts.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask to include the Wall Street Journal editorial from today, entitled ``Tax As You Go,'' for the RECORD.  
   Tax As You Go 
   Congressional Democrats are dashing out of the gates to establish their fiscal conservative credentials. And as early as today House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will push through so-called ``pay-as-you-go'' budget rules for Congress. Keep an eye on your wallet. 
   ``Paygo,'' as Washington insiders call it, sounds like a fiscally prudent budget practice: If government spends more on program A, it has to spend less money on program B, and thus budget deficits will be restrained. We're all for that. But when Republicans proposed exactly that budget rule in recent years, House Democrats voted it down. 
   Ms. Pelosi has something different in mind. Under her paygo plan, new entitlement programs and all new tax cuts would have to be offset by either cutbacks in other entitlement programs or tax increases. This version of paygo is a budget trapdoor, designed not to control expenditures but to make it easier to raise taxes while blocking future tax cuts. 
   Supporters of paygo claim it will help restrain entitlement spending. It won't. Paygo doesn't apply to current entitlements that will grow automatically over the next several decades. Ms. Pelosi's version of paygo applies only to new entitlements or changes in law that expand current programs. And on present trajectory, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, food stamps and the like are scheduled to increase federal spending to almost 38 percent of GDP by 2050, up from 21 percent today. Paygo won't stop a dime of that increase. This may explain why one of the leading supporters of paygo is the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal outfit that favors far more social spending. 
   Paygo enthusiasts also claim that when these rules were in effect in the 1990s the budget deficit disappeared and by 2001 the budget recorded a $121 billion surplus. Sorry. The budget improvement in the late 1990s was a result of three events wholly unrelated to paygo: the initial spending restraint under the Republican Congress in 1995 and 1996 as part of their pledge to balance the budget; a huge reduction in military spending, totaling nearly 2 percent of GDP, over the decade; and rapid economic growth, which always causes a bounce in revenues. Paygo didn't expire until 2002, but by the late-1990s politicians in both parties were already re-stoking the domestic spending fires. 
   What paygo does restrain are tax cuts, by requiring that any tax cut be offset dollar-for-dollar with some entitlement reduction. Congressional budgeteers always overestimate the revenue losses from tax cuts, which under paygo would require onerous budget cuts to ``pay for'' the tax cuts. As a political matter, those spending cuts will never happen. 
   First on the chopping block, therefore, would be the investment tax cuts of 2003 that are set to expire in 2010. Last year Democrat David Obey of Wisconsin, the new Appropriations Committee chairman and a prodigious spender, gave this strategy away when he urged paygo rules so he could enact new social spending and pay for it by canceling the Bush tax cuts for those who make more than $1 million.  
   Never mind that, in the wake of those capital gains and dividend tax-rate cuts, federal revenues climbed by a record $550 billion over the past two fiscal years. Incidentally, thanks to the current economic expansion and the surge in tax revenues, the budget deficit has fallen by $165 billion in just two years--without paygo. 
   Given all of this, it's especially puzzling that even some conservatives seem tempted by paygo's fiscal illusions. Our friends at the Heritage Foundation have of late become obsessed with future entitlement forecasts and have advised Ms. Pelosi to enact paygo rules to stop it. But Heritage notably did not insist that tax increases be excluded from any paygo rule. Had such logic prevailed in 1980 or 2003, it's possible that neither the Reagan nor Bush tax cuts would ever have become law. As a political matter, paygo is about returning Republicans to their historical minority role as tax collectors for the welfare state. 
   That's not to say that new budget rules aren't highly desirable. The line-item veto, a new Grace Commission to identify and eliminate the billions of dollars of waste and failed programs, and an automatic spending sequester if the budget rises above agreed baselines would all help to restore spending discipline. But it is precisely because these rules would restrain spending that they are not on the Democratic agenda. 
   Paygo, by contrast, gives the appearance of spending discipline while making it all but impossible to let taxpayers keep more of their money. It should really be called ``spend and tax as you go.''  
   The fundamental budget problem here is spending too much, not taxing too little. Federal revenues climbed by $550 billion over the past two fiscal years because of the 2001 and 2003 tax relief packages. Now, this has led to a robust economic growth for our country; and as a result of that economic growth, we have had higher tax revenues to government. In fact, government revenue this year is the largest it has ever been in the history of man. Not just the history of the United States, but we have more revenue flowing into government. 
   So we have a spending problem, Mr. Speaker. And with this PAYGO trapdoor, the Pelosi PAYGO plan ignores the annual appropriations, and it only applies to new spending. So this is an absolute trapdoor that will lead to tax increases put forward by this new Democrat majority. 
   I urge us to vote this down and to actually have real constructive budget reform.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague from Ohio for offering this amendment. 
   We're debating now on a 3.5 percent across-the-board cut to an appropriations bill. It's an amazing thing in Congress; with one vote, we can slash $1.3 billion out of an appropriations bill. 
   What we're debating here is not simply a small cut. We're debating on whether or not the American taxpayers can depend on the Bush tax cuts from 2001 and 2003. We're trying to determine what kind of economic growth we'll have as a Nation, based on how much the government spends in taxes. 
   This is more than a debate about spending. This is a debate about the size and scope of government. 
   Well, let's put the facts on the table. The American Government costs $2.7 trillion a year. That is the largest government on Earth. And further perspective here: It's the largest government in the history of mankind. 
   Now, to put this further into perspective, there are only two economies outside of the United States that are equal to the size of our Federal spending. That's Germany and Japan. And what is amazing about this, what is absolutely amazing about this, is that we have a Federal Government that's larger than most economies on Earth. In fact, our Federal Government spends more than the whole of China's economy. 
   Now, that's simply amazing. I think it shows that, while we're debating on extending the Bush tax cuts, the American people understand that we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem here in the United States. 
   This Congress is addicted to spending. In fact, in just a week's time, they appropriated $100 billion. Now, that's fast work even for Washington, DC. 
   The American people, Mr. Chairman, understand that we need to tighten our belt. A 3.5 percent across-the-board cut is a good start. That'll save $1.3 billion of the American taxpayers' hard-earned money. 
   I commend my colleague for offering this amendment, and I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (BRING DOWN GAS PRICES BY INCREASING SUPPLY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, one day we will end our dependence on foreign oil and empower our economy with alternative sources of energy. But until that day comes, we have to do everything in our power to strengthen our economy by making energy more affordable by increasing domestic American production. Roughly 70 percent of what we pay at the pumps comes from the price of oil in the global market, which is driven by relationships between supply and demand. 
   To lower gas prices, we have to use American energy resources. Right now, the U.S. produces 41 percent of the petroleum we use. We can do much better than that. Just by opening up a small portion of Alaska for oil production, we can recover 15 years of Saudi Arabian crude oil. By streamlining rules for energy exploration off the Outer Continental Shelf, we can access roughly 115 billion barrels of oil, enough oil to power 60 million cars for 60 years. 
   With gas prices over $4 a gallon, this Congress must act. We have to increase supply. Doing anything else would be irresponsible.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, this evening I'm here to address the House and take a moment to talk about something that's on my constituents' minds and my mind and that's energy policy. We have a real need for a strong energy policy in America. Actually, to go further, we have a need for an energy policy in America, and we've not seen leadership out of Washington on this issue. Period. 
   In 2005, we had an energy act that was passed out of this Chamber, enacted into law that helped get the refining process working. Actually, more pointedly, it helped move forward nuclear power and new plants with nuclear power production, and there were other small changes for the refining process and the licensing and things of that sort, but that wasn't enough. We've not done enough. 
   Earlier this week, this House passed by a wide margin thankfully, a bipartisan majority that I was happy to vote in favor of, that would suspend the addition of more oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Now this, according to most economists and folks that look at oil and energy production, according to them, it would reduce gas prices just a little bit. Well, the reason why it would reduce it just a little bit is because it would take less demand off the marketplace, thereby keeping the same supply that we have but reducing demand, and as such, as most people know with economics, when that happens prices fall. 
   I think we have to go one step further, and that one step further is increasing capacity. That means we have to have American energy production. That means off the deep waters of our coasts we need to find oil and natural gas. In remote areas of Alaska, we need to harness the oil that is there. Whether it's oil shale in the Rocky Mountain West or energy production and drilling in the Dakotas, I think these are the things that we have to be about, and Congress must put forward a bold initiative to do that.     
   And that's the legislation that I have cosponsored here in this Chamber, to increase capacity and production. 
   But beyond that, I think most Americans know that simply getting more American oil is not enough. Getting more American natural gas is not enough. Increasing refineries here in the United States is not enough. It's a start, but long term we have to have a massive investment, a 21st century Manhattan Project that harnesses our power and ingenuity here in the United States to end our reliance on foreign oil, and go one step further than that, end our reliance on oil. That should be a national priority. 
   Kennedy demanded that we put a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s, and we did it. In a dire time, with the greatest war the world has ever known, we developed the Manhattan Project to produce a devastating weapon that would hopefully end all wars. That didn't happen in terms of ending the war, but we did produce nuclear power and a nuclear weapon in a few short years. 
   We must have that same priority here in the United States and demand energy independence from the rest of the world by embracing our alternatives that we have here domestically, embracing our ingenuity, and going that final step to true energy independence. That's what we should be about. 
   This should not be a partisan issue. We should have a bipartisan majority that says, yes, we will do these things, and we will do these things in a short period of time because that's what the American people deserve. 
   My constituents are hurting. They have to drive automobiles. We don't have mass transit in my district of any substantive form, really. So my constituents are hurting. And it's a question about being able to take your kids to the beach this summer. But beyond that, many families are struggling just to buy food, keep shelter. I think we have to be very sensitive to the demands of our constituents and realize that they're hurting. And energy and gas prices are the central reason why they're hurting. 
   We have to get serious about this, put politics aside, and do what's right for our American people. It's the right thing for our American people. It's the right thing for our economy. It's the right thing for our future in the United States. 
   I look forward to us working together in a bipartisan way for true energy independence.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (LUMBEE RECOGNITION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague from Alaska for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to my friend and colleague from North Carolina's bill, the Lumbee Recognition Act. 
   My position on this bill is very straightforward and fair. All groups seeking Federal acknowledgment as Indian tribes should go through the administrative process of the Department of the Interior's Office of Federal Acknowledgment. 
   This office is staffed with expert historians, anthropologists and genealogists. Their focus is to evaluate data provided by petitioning groups and determine the merits of a group's claim that it is an Indian tribe. This includes whether the group existed since historical times as a distinct political entity. 
   In this case, the Department of the Interior said the 1956 Lumbee Act prevents the Lumbee from going through this process. Congress should act and lift that restriction. Like other groups, the Lumbees should have the opportunity to attain Federal recognition as a tribe. I agree with that. 
   However, I cannot support this legislation which will allow the Lumbee or any other group for that matter to circumvent the process. This would be unfair to already existing tribes like the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in western North Carolina who have a significant historical and cultural impact on my region of the State. They don't want to see their cultural identity undermined by legislation such as this. 
   Prominent genealogists have also raised serious questions about the tribal identity of the Lumbee. 
   Paul Heinegg, award-winning genealogist and author, whose work is recognized by the American Society of Genealogists, has concluded that the Lumbee are ``an invented North Carolina Indian tribe.'' 
   Dr. Virginia DeMarce, former chair of the National Genealogical Society, has published her research on the history of the Lumbee, with findings that contradict H.R. 65, the bill we're debating today. Her research finds that many Lumbee families migrated to Robeson County, North Carolina, from other areas prior to 1,800. 
   Her research has been corroborated by other notable genealogists who refer to other self-identified Lumbee families as residing in other areas prior to any colonial settlement in Robeson County. 
   In fact, the name Lumbee is based, as the chairman mentioned earlier, on this group's proximity to the Lumbee River and is a modern creation that the group selected as its name in 1952. In fact, this Lumbee group has petitioned Congress numerous times under the names Cherokee, Siouan, Croatan and Cheraw, among others. 
   I, along with members of the North Carolina delegation, in bipartisan fashion, have sponsored legislation in this Congress and sponsored legislation in the last Congress that would fix this problem. They could actually have the Lumbee go through the normal process. 
   In fact, my colleague, Mr. Shuler, has authored legislation this time, which I'm a cosponsor of, that his predecessor sponsored as well, that would clear the way for the Lumbee to go through the normal process. I think we should accept that. In fact, Mr. Shuler, Mr. WALTER JONES, as well as Mr. Shays and I offered the amendment that was ruled out of order by the Rules Committee. In fact, the Rules Committee would not let us offer that as an amendment here on the floor today. In fact, that's a responsible way to deal with the Lumbee issue. 
   Federal recognition matters get caught up in emotion, and let's face it, politics. So, rather than going through this legislative body, I think we should go through the regulatory process for the longstanding government-to-government relationships the United States has established with tribes. 
   We should take the politics out of Federal recognition and allow the experts at the Office of Federal Acknowledgment to do their jobs. I think that's a responsible way to deal with this issue. 
   And I would ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill so we can deal with this in a responsible and reasonable manner, going through the longstanding process that we have established as a Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, this is a very fair and simple motion to recommit. This takes the emotion of politics out of the Federal recognition process and allows the experts at the Office of Federal Acknowledgment to do their jobs. 
   This amendment, Mr. Speaker, is something very familiar to the chairman as well as all of the members of the Interior Committee. They've seen it before. It's very familiar to the members of the Rules Committee as well because they've seen it as well. It's the very same form and shape that my colleague, Mr. Shuler, has filed, along with myself as a cosponsor, with me as a cosponsor I should say, and a number of our colleagues from North Carolina. It's a bipartisan bill as originally constructed. 
   And what this motion to recommit does is allow us to have a vote on this issue here on the House floor. It's the very same text as the amendment, I said that Mr. Shuler offered, as well as Mr. Jones and Mr. Shays, that we offered through the Rules Committee, and it was not allowed by the majority party through the Rules Committee process. In fact, there was a partisan vote on that issue, eight Democrats voting ``no,'' two Republicans voting ``yes,'' even though it was a bipartisan amendment to the bill. 
   In simple terms, this motion will put the Lumbees in the front of the Federal recognition process, in the front of that line, and it removes the bar on the Lumbees and other groups described in the 1956 Lumbee Act from petitioning for recognition through the administrative process. 
   It extends recognition to the Lumbees under the terms and restrictions of H.R. 65, this bill, only when the Secretary makes a final positive determination on the Lumbee petition. It's a very fair and balanced way to allow the Lumbees to be recognized as a tribe. 
   The Lumbees oppose the motion because it does not allow them to circumvent the process. But it is fair to the other 561 federally recognized tribes, including the Eastern Band of Cherokee in western North Carolina; all of whom went through the proper rigors of the recognition process. 
   Now, what is important about this is that we have a vote on it. My colleague from North Carolina, Mr. Taylor, originally wrote this bill that my colleague, Mr. Shuler, has refiled again in this Congress. 
   This bill is bipartisan, as I said. And this motion to recommit is the very same language of that bipartisan bill. 
   Now, what was wonderful is that, over the last 10 years, Congressman Taylor, my friend and former colleague here in this body, was able to prevent this Lumbee recognition bill from being put forth and, in essence, made sure that the Lumbees went through the Federal process. 
   It's unfortunate this bill has come to the floor today. It's even more unfortunate that this motion to recommit was not allowed as an amendment to this bill. And so what this bill does is allow it to go back to committee so that the committee can actually go through the normal process of marking up this bill and to hear from outside groups as well but ensures that we go through the normal process that my colleagues from North Carolina, many of my colleagues from North Carolina, on a bipartisan basis, seek. 
   And I think, Mr. Speaker, I think it's important that my colleagues vote for this motion to recommit because it is fair. It will be a bipartisan vote, I believe, and I'm very hopeful that it will be. And I think it's going to be the best thing for the Lumbees and the best thing for this process of Federal recognition of Native American tribes. 
   And I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit because it's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do on a bipartisan basis.

   Sheriff Clark cared deeply for the needs of families and relentlessly pursued drug dealers and criminals in Caldwell County. He made a career of that. 
   It was Sheriff Clark's passion for fighting against the scourge of methamphetamine and drugs that brought the White House drug czar to Caldwell County. His progressive innovative vision for law enforcement will create enormous benefits for years to come, not just in Caldwell County, but across western North Carolina. 
   Caldwell County lost a hero and heaven gained a treasure. My prayers are with his family and with his friends in this time of loss. He lived a determined life, a proud life. And the legacy he leaves continues on because the good a man does lives long after he is gone.

It even appropriates $50 million for a Capitol Hill power plant. And they do this in the name of funding the troops. I think this is, again, Washington hypocrisy at work. 
   The most egregious part of this bill, I find, is that there are billions of dollars in this bill for livestock, which the American people, Mr. Speaker, should know is literally pork for pork. 
   And it is all about getting votes together to fund the troops in harm's way, but instead of funding the troops in harm's way, they are funding pork-barrel projects here in the United States. 
   I believe, Mr. Speaker, this is wrong for our troops in battle, but it is a great gift for Washington Democrat politicians who are in power here in the House today. 
   This is a failure to understand what ``emergency'' means, what ``war'' means and the fight we have going in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Madam Speaker, yesterday afternoon in western North Carolina, a routine traffic stop netted 11 illegal immigrants. How do we know they were illegal? Because when they were asked for identification, they presented their Mexican voting card; and when asked by the sheriff's deputy whether or not they were illegal, they said, ``yes.'' 
   The sheriff's deputy called the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency in Charlotte, North Carolina, to which the reply was, ``We are sorry; we can't pick them up.'' So the sheriff's deputy let them go on their way. According to the illegal immigrants, 11 in the car, they were going to New York City to get a job. 
   This shows in real form the need for real border security and real border enforcement. It also shows the need for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency to get with the times, to get rid of this bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., that is hamstringing the agents in the field, to increase their budget. 
   And, Madam Speaker, I call on the House of Representatives to act to make sure that we have more border enforcement agents and Customs agents in this Nation to make sure a travesty like this never happens again.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, April revenue showers. That is what the Wall Street Journal called the large government revenues received by this Federal Government in the month of April. It was $70 billion over revenue in 2006. It shows that tax cuts work. The Democrats, on the other hand, want to raise taxes. They want to raise the taxes that American people pay. 
   What we believe in and what the President has done in just the five short years he has been in office is to actually cut taxes that the American people pay, which, in the end, through greater economic growth, will lead to more government revenue. 
   A case in point: the capital gains tax cut and the dividends tax cut, those two things have resulted in a 30 percent increase in revenue under those two provisions. It shows that tax cuts work. 
   They are good for the economy and they are good for the American people, and we need to extend the tax cuts.

   Mr. McHENRY. After months of campaigning against ``Stay the Course,'' the Democrats are proposing just that, a stay-the-course resolution here on the House floor.

   Democrats have held 52 hearings on Iraq since taking control of Congress. So let me get this right. The Democrats have held 52 hearings so they can show one resolution on the House floor that has no bearing on the President's policy, does not have the force of law, does not advocate the withdrawal of troops, and does nothing except have a tantrum here on the House floor. So please explain this new direction, Madam Speaker. This is not a new direction, it is political posturing of the worst kind.

   ``We will restore civility to our debate. We will restore bipartisanship to the administration of the House, reestablish regular order, and ensure the rights of the minority are heard. The voice of every American has a right to be heard, and that is what the American people expect and deserve.'' 
   Those are the words of Speaker Pelosi. But the actions of Speaker Pelosi and this Democrat majority are very different. And it is no surprise that this week, just like last week and the previous week, the Democrats are railroading legislation through this House. This time it is a $460 billion spending bill that won't see a committee hearing, won't see a committee markup, that won't see the light of day, Madam Speaker, and will cost every taxpayer in America $3,500 apiece. 
   The Democrats believe that regular order is still out of order. They also believe that campaign promises are not worth keeping. 
   I believe the American people deserve better, and I think we should vote down this continuing resolution that spends $460 billion of our own taxpayer money.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague Dr. Price for offering this amendment. Certainly the American people can relate to this amendment. It simply says that we will not spend 1 percent of the bill as currently written, 1 percent. Well, that equates to $500 million, a substantial sum of money even in the context of the Federal budget. 
   What we have in Washington, D.C., is a spending problem. We don't have a problem with income to government. The government will receive about $2.7 trillion this year on a Federal budget that actually spends $2.9 trillion.     
   What is absolutely fascinating about this is that there are only two countries on Earth with whole economies that are larger than the Federal Government here in Washington, D.C., and that is the governments of Germany and Japan. When we talk about China and the growing threat of China's economy, well, look at the size of the Chinese economy. The whole economy of China is $1.9 trillion. What we have here in Washington D.C. is certainly a spending problem. 
   What this amendment proposed by Dr. Price says is that we should be able to slip off just a little bit of that spending, just a little bit, show the American taxpayers that we can tighten the  belt just ever so slightly, which means, instead of eating that whole cake, which is what the Democrat leadership proposes for dessert, eating that whole cake, we are just going to take off just a little bit of the icing, just a taste of the icing, rather than eating that whole cake. 
   Now, certainly we can do that. Certainly the American people understand the Federal Government could save 1 percent. Every family budget across America can save 1 percent. 
   I urge my colleagues, even the liberal Democrats on the other side of the aisle, my friends from the other side of the aisle who said that we want to spend more and more and more. They certainly can say we will, when we are increasing spending so rapidly, what the Democrats are doing here, we could say that just 1 percent, we will take off 1 percent right off the top. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this reasonable and commonsense measure that shows some level of restraint, even with bloated Democrat spending in Washington, D.C.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from West Virginia for yielding. The ranking member is very generous with yielding. 
   I want to thank the committee chairman, my colleague from Massachusetts, for having an open and fair process in the committee. We had a number of amendments through that whole process that were vigorously debated, and there was a lot of discussion about continuing that vigorous debate on the House floor to work out some compromises, and the committee Chair honors his word in committee. I want to thank him for that. 
   Unfortunately, the Rules Committee did not allow these amendments to come forward to the House floor, and that is a great shame. I think the work product coming off this House floor will be less than it could have been had we had an open and fair process here on the House floor. 
   It is obvious and true that the National Flood Insurance Program is already in deep trouble. It's $18 billion in the hole. Since 1981, over the last 26 years, it's borrowed from the Treasury 14 times, $18 billion in the hole. Certainly it needs reform. 
   I think the underlying reforms for flood insurance in this bill are appropriate and good, and I appreciate the chairman of the committee, and I appreciate my colleague from Massachusetts accepting my amendment in the committee that says that new and renewing multi-peril policies shouldn't be extended in a time when the National Flood Insurance Program is borrowing from the Treasury. I think that's proper, and I appreciate him accepting that in this bill. 
   But overall, this addition of wind will actually step into the private sector and private market that is largely working and has largely worked for the last 100 years in this country. There have been a number of failures, and that is on occasion what happens; but with the private sector, it can be done on an actuarially sound basis. 
   What we're doing under this bill by adding a wind proposal is exposing the taxpayers to tens of billions of dollars' worth of additional unfunded liabilities, and that's why I'm going to have to sadly vote against this bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

   Mr. McHENRY. I want to thank my colleague from Texas for putting together a great bill. I know he has been a long-time advocate of the best care possible for our veterans in this country. And as a military general, I want to commend him for the great work he has done on a bipartisan basis. And I thank you for that, Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to bring attention to the shortcomings of the Department of Veterans Affairs in addressing the infrastructure needs of community-based outpatient clinics. These clinics provide convenient care to our veterans on an outpatient basis. 
   There are currently 64 pending clinics that have received approval from the VA either in fiscal year 2007 or fiscal year 2008. One of those clinics is set to be established in my district in Hickory, North Carolina. When opened, this clinic will serve approximately 10,000 veterans on an outpatient basis annually. However, since the VA Mid-Atlantic Health Care Network announced last June that the clinic in Hickory would open in January of this year, there has been nothing but delay after delay after delay. Now, veterans in western North Carolina are frustrated with these delays, as many of us are, and there seems to be this common issue throughout the system. 
   This particular clinic has been in the works in some way or another for roughly 12 years, Mr. Chairman. The time is up for delays, and veterans of these 64 regions are entitled to answers. 
   Last month, my two North Carolina colleagues in the Senate and I formally requested an update about the status of the outpatient clinic in Hickory. Unfortunately, we have yet to receive a response to our inquiry. Our veterans, I believe, deserve better. 
   I would ask that as this bill moves forward to the Senate and to conference, the chairman and the ranking member work to get answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs, answers to why we have these continued delays for pending outpatient clinics. Veterans in Hickory, North Carolina, and across the country have sacrificed too much for our country and deserve to have, at the very least, convenient health care. They deserve a proper explanation and progress report as well. 
   I also want to finish by commending the chairman for his, again, hard work on increasing funding for our veterans. I know that on both sides of the aisle we are very pleased with the work you've done, both the chairman and the ranking member, and we are looking forward to passage.

But it very much is important to the American people to give scrutiny to these pork-barrel projects and earmarks contained within these billion-dollar bills.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Minnesota. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think we need to have a serious discussion here on the floor today, as we did yesterday. There have been some accusations about what we did when we were in the majority. But, look, let's face it, there is a new majority. There is a new regime in town. They called for a new direction. I guess there is a new direction. Congress' approval ratings are the lowest they have been in decades. 
   Nothing has been achieved in this Congress. In fact, the Democrats' agenda, the Six for 06, the vaunted Six for 06 agenda, has been Zero in 06. Zero of these bills have been enacted into law. 
   So it is wonderful for the Democrats to point at the Republicans. But, let's face it, the Democrats are in the majority, and it is their obligation to govern, and they have not yet done it. 
   They spent 133 days in power, the new Democrat majority, and what have they done? Well, they had a lot of debate about whether or not to defund the troops who are in harm's way. They played politics with the troops. But yet they didn't take any time at all to review the earmarks in this bill. They have had 133 days. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee has had 133 days to review these earmarks, but yet he will not open it up to public scrutiny. 
   All we are asking for these earmarks and for this Democrat excessive spending is for it to see the light of day so the American people can see what their money is going towards. So while they play politics with funding the troops, they do nothing when it comes to pork-barrel spending. They do nothing when it comes to earmarks. They do nothing to control spending. They do nothing to enact their vaunted Six for 06 agenda. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think the American people need to understand what this new Democrat majority, this new direction, is all about. It is about politics. It is about politics. And what we are talking about here today, what Republicans and conservatives are saying is that we need to have those earmarks laid out for public scrutiny so the press and Members of this body can actually see what the chairman wants to insert at the 11th hour in this legislation. We want to see what is in that slush fund within this bill. We want to see where our tax dollars are going. But we also want to spend. Beyond that, we want to make sure this money is appropriated wisely.  
   What the ranking member on this subcommittee has said is there is too much spending. We have got too many bureaucrats being thrown into the Department of Homeland Security. This money is not being spent wisely. It is not being spent in the right ways. We are not funding defense like we should. We are not funding border security like we should. We are not funding intelligence capabilities like we should. Yet there is a large increase in spending in this appropriations bill. Where is it going? Where is it going?     
   And where is that money, that slush fund, going? I think the American people, not just my colleagues in the House, not just the committee chairmen, not just a committee, but all the American people deserve to see where their money is going. That's the right thing. 
   That's what we're debating about here today and what we were debating about last night. And while the Democrats forced us to go into 2:00 a.m. voting on this House floor, in the middle of the night, voting on important matters of public policy, the Speaker sleeps. While we were forced to stay here until 2:00 a.m., voting on procedural motions to hold the Democrats accountable, the Speaker slept.

Actually, they haven't implemented many of the things that he claims, Mr. Chairman. The one thing on his list he forgets, though, is the largest tax increase in American history. I don't know why he doesn't brag about that.

   Mr. McHENRY. Let me just say this. The largest tax increase in American history, that is really the backdrop of these spending bills. 
   The gentleman points out an interesting quandary, I must say. He says that Republicans are delaying the implementation of homeland security funding. The Department is funded through October 1. Beyond that, if it were important for us to put our priorities first, we would start, Mr. Chairman, with the Department of Defense, for national defense purposes. Instead, he's pulling a political game on us, Mr. Chairman, to simply say that we are harming national security because we're trying to restrain pork-barrel spending within this appropriation. 
   He actually points out a very important thing the American people need to understand. If the Democrats wanted to focus on priorities, we would have started with homeland security and national defense on day one. Instead, the new Democrat majority played politics with our troops in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan. They played politics with that funding, Mr. Chairman. They played politics for 100 days. And they're continuing to play politics with the funding for our troops in harm's way, Mr. Chairman. And we should oppose that. 
   And the American people are reacting to that. They don't want to defund our troops in harm's way. They don't want to do that. 
   I would ask my colleague from Texas, to, if he would, yield for 15 seconds to the gentleman from Ohio for his comment or question, because that is much more generous than he did earlier. And I would love to respond to what he says or claims.

   We want to make sure the taxpayer dollar is spent wisely, efficiently, and effectively. This is a healthy debate, because we on this side of the aisle want to restrain the growth of government while those on the other side want to grow and grow and grow the government in all the bureaucracy, especially here in Washington D.C.

   Mr. Chairman, I would like to respond to my colleague from Florida. What she said was factually incorrect. The Republican Congress put in a strong earmark reform so the American people can see what we are spending here on this House floor. It's a matter of transparency and openness which the Democrats campaigned upon. What they have done in this whole process is put those earmarks back in the shadows, in the shadows of the chairman's pocket, and the chairman can divvy them up as he sees fit. 
   That is not the direction we should be moving in, and we are not delaying this bill. What we are doing is having a debate on the size and scope of the government and whether or not we should allow pork-barrel projects to invade our appropriations process or whether or not we should have openness and restrain the size and growth of government. That's what this debate is about, and it's a good debate.

They expect to be protected, they expect politicians to be wise with their tax dollars, and they expect government to stay out of their way. And they expect us to accomplish this in an open and fair way. But maybe that was asking too much for the new majority, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to urge my colleagues to support my good friend from Washington's amendment. It is a good amendment because, as a sheriff, he knows, firsthand, homeland security. And what he also knows is the most important thing we can be doing in this time of war is funding our intelligence capabilities domestically and internationally. And what this legislation does is reduce our capacity to gather intelligence through this homeland security appropriation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think what my colleague from Washington has offered is a very sensible thing. This bill actually has $23 million less in funding for intelligence resources than the President requested. And what my colleague does is restore the funding level to the prior year's funding for the intelligence-gathering resources of the Homeland Security Department. 
   I think overall what we have to discuss as a Congress is whether or not we are going to fight an offensive war. Are we going to do the necessary things, the intelligence gathering that we need to do as a country and as a nation to make sure that we are safe and secure when we are dealing with these very complicated threats both internationally and domestically. 
   We saw what has happened over the last few years with intelligence-gathering capabilities that during the 1990s were decimated. Our intelligence-gathering capabilities were decimated. And what we have to do as a nation is make sure we have the proper funding so we don't have those threats, we don't have those scares, that we don't have that level of war here at home. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I commend my colleague for offering this amendment. I urge its adoption. And I think we can do this on a very bipartisan basis to ensure that we have a strong homeland and have the proper intelligence-gathering resources funded by this United States Congress. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to yield to my colleague from the great State of New Jersey.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the last word. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to speak before the House, and I appreciate the fact that we are taking this amendment up under an open rule which allows for a wide-ranging debate on the important issues of the day. 
   Now, this amendment is very simple. It saves the taxpayers money. It saves the taxpayers money, Mr. Chairman, and I think that is what is very important for us to understand here on this House floor. If we do not spend this money in the appropriations bill, it will reduce our deficit. 
   As the chairman of the full committee said in his speech here on the floor a few minutes ago, he believes Republicans are simply filibustering.  Well, he is in the wrong Chamber for filibustering; it is across the hall in the Senate. 
   What we are doing here today is bringing out the fact that we as Republicans, our side of the aisle, we actually want to reduce spending and balance the budget. We have had some tough times since 2001, since this war began, when we were attacked in 2001. But, Mr. Chairman, what we have to do is understand as a nation, we have to cut this deficit and balance this budget and start paying down the national debt. We have to make sure that we have a balanced budget. 
   How do we begin that process for a balanced budget? It is not by raising taxes, which the other side of the aisle already proposed and actually adopted through their new budget that they put in place this new Congress. They made it clear that they want to roll back to the prior level of taxation, the very high level of taxation that we as Americans faced. 
   But what we believe in as conservatives, and on this side of the aisle especially, is that the way we balance the budget is not by raising taxes on the American people. We have plenty of income coming into the government, but we have a spending problem here. So with this amendment we are taking a small step, a very small step, but a step nonetheless, that will help us reduce spending. 
   The chairman of the full committee said they have been very busy spending for the Iraq war, the supplemental vote. Well, as we well know, within that Iraq war funding bill they have plenty of pork barrel spending, plenty of earmarks. Well, we believe over $20 billion in earmarks was in that final version of the bill. They were too busy spending on special interest projects to actually put in the details of this legislation so the American people can see what kind of pork barrel projects they have tucked into the legislation before us. 
   So first of all, the process is wrong. 
   Second, the spending is too high. The American people understand that, and they want us to do something about it. As conservatives, we need to take that first step. That first step is offered by my colleague from Iowa, Mr. King, who has offered a very reasonable, very simple, very straightforward amendment that is good for the taxpayer and is good for Americans. 
   We all care about homeland security, Mr. Chairman. We believe it is in the interest of our government to fund homeland security and national defense effectively, but not blindly. Not simply because a number is put forward, do we have to accept it. And that is what the debate is about here today, about whether or not we are simply going to accept a high level of spending and look the other way while the deficit increases, while the American people are asked to spend more on government through their taxes. 
   But we have to take that first step. A small step, but a very good, very important step, nonetheless. I will be proud to vote for the King amendment when we get that chance here in a few minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to come forward with a consensus that these important spending matters deserve an open, honest, fair debate. It is not simply about getting it done quickly. We know that legislation takes awhile to craft. We should have an open debate and allow a real exchange of ideas about how to best spend our homeland security dollars. 
   Mr. Chairman, the American people understand that their government costs too much. So let's support my colleague, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), his amendment here today, that allows us to take a step in the right direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   We've had a long discussion tonight about my colleague from North Carolina's amendment. I certainly thank her for offering it. I think we've had a healthy debate about the size and scope of government. 
   I think what the American people understand, Mr. Chairman, is that we should have this debate on the House floor. Mr. Chairman, our colleagues should have this grand debate about whether or not to increase the size and scope of government, even in areas of grave national importance. This is a serious debate. This is a very serious debate, and I think the American people should be proud of the kind of debate we're having today on the House floor. 
   As a conservative, I can see that there's waste, fraud and abuse in all areas of government, even in the Department of Homeland Security. I think we should be wise with how we spend the taxpayer dollar, even in the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Even if this President requested tons more money, billions more money, as a conservative I would say, no, Mr. President, we don't need those billions of dollars in new spending. And I must tell you, as a conservative I've been outspoken, trying to hold this President accountable when it comes to spending. 
   Yet my Democrat colleagues, Mr. Chairman, would say the President requested money, more money for the Department of Homeland Security. I think that was valid in this time of war, in this time of great national security issues. 
   The President requested more money for intelligence spending; yet this Democrat majority in this House, Mr. Chairman, said no to the President's increase when it came to intelligence spending. Instead, Mr. Chairman, the majority decided to spend intelligence money on this debate about climate  change, about global warming. I'm not exactly sure, Mr. Chairman, what this majority was thinking when they allocated intelligence resources, intelligence money to the debate on global warming, but they did. They said that was just. 
   When the President requested more money for homeland security, a $3 billion increase over last year's funds, the Democrats said that is not enough, and they went $2 billion over that. Mr. Chairman, even in Washington, D.C., $2 billion is a lot of money. 
   We know that the Department of Homeland Security's well funded, and what we're having a debate on here today, tonight, Mr. Chairman, is whether or not we should lard up the Department of Homeland Security with more bureaucrats at the top level; not people that are screening the airports at the lowest level, not people who are out gathering intelligence at the lowest level, but they're larding it up for the Secretary's budget, for the management's budget. They're not allocating money to get it out on the streets. They're allocating money for more bureaucrats here in Washington, D.C. And as a conservative, even if it's a Republican in the White House and a Republican administration, I will say no to that. We don't need more bureaucrats here in Washington, D.C. 
   We need more agents out on the streets tracking terrorists. We need more intelligence capabilities out in the streets, catching the bad guy, finding out what they're doing, how they're plotting and planning against us. That's the debate we should have here on this House floor, Mr. Chairman. That's the debate the American people want and deserve. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is an important debate about how we're going to allocate our homeland security dollars. Should we put it with more bureaucrats sitting in an office in Washington, D.C., or should we spend that money in a better way, to make sure when you go to the airport you have an airport screener, somebody to get you through that line effectively, people that are well-trained to track the bad guys through our intelligence capabilities, that actually have good plans in place if, God forbid, heaven forbid, we have another attack? We don't need more money for bureaucrats in Washington. We need more funding to get the bad guys. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have a serious debate here tonight, and I think this has been a very worthy debate of this House. My friends and colleague, Mr. Chairman, have all stated their opinions tonight, and I think there's a good consensus from the American people, good consensus from the American people that we need to cut spending to a greater degree.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, the amendment before us today is a second-degree amendment to my colleague from North Carolina's amendment to the bill. 
   This second-degree amendment is very simple, very straightforward. Instead of striking $1,241,000 from this legislation in the Secretary of Homeland Security's personal budget for his office, we've increased that number to actually $8.9 million.  
   What this amount difference is a result of the debate we've had here on the floor. What is very good is that we've had an open debate, an open rule, one of the rare that we've had in this new Democrat majority, Mr. Chairman. This open rule has allowed a free form of debate, which has allowed all my colleagues to engage in this discussion about decreasing the size and scope of government and curbing the excess of the growth of bureaucracy here in Washington. 
   As a result of this debate, I've analyzed the last amendment debates we had. My colleague from California (Mr. Campbell) offered an amendment that would take the Secretary's budget back to the 2007 level. His amendment would reduce the spending by $9,961,000. Well, that amendment failed, unfortunately. I'm very happy, though, that my colleague from California offered it, though, because the House got to vote on fiscal discipline, and 201 Members of this body voted in favor of striking that $9,961,000 from the bill. Unfortunately, though, 221 voted ``no,'' so the amendment failed. 
   Well, watching the last series of votes, I also noticed that our colleagues voted to strike $79,000 from the Secretary's budget, as well as $300,000 from the Secretary's budget, which through this debate I really analyze that. I really had to think about those votes and see what the will of the body was on restraining government spending and the rise in growth and the bureaucracy here in Washington.     
   What I realized is that maybe my colleagues weren't ready to cut $9.9 million. But perhaps, just perhaps, we could try this out and see if my colleagues would cut $8.9 million. Now, it's not quite as much as I would like to cut from the fat of the Secretary's budget, but it's close. It's a savings to the taxpayers. 
   So let's try this out. Let's have a vote on this; let's have a debate on whether or not we can cut $8.9 million from a budget, if I may state, from a budget as proposed in this Chamber of $36 billion, if I have that correct. Can we cut $8.9 million from a $36 billion budget? 
   Well, my colleagues, 221 of them said ``no'' to this cutting $9.9 million. Let's see if they will cut $8.9 million; it's close, and it's $1 million. The American taxpayers understand the difference in $1 million. But if we could cut $8.9 million, I think we would be happy. It would be a step in the right direction. 
   I hope my colleagues concur. 
   My colleagues would say ``yes'' to cutting $300,000 from this $36 billion bill. They cut $300,000. They cut $79,000. But I wonder if my colleagues would, instead of cutting $1.2 million, which my colleague from North Carolina seeks to do, if they would cut $8.9 million. 
   Let's try this out. Let's have a debate on whether or not $8.9 million is enough money to cut from this $36 billion bill. Let's see if we can return that money to the taxpayers. Let's see if we can reduce the deficit so we can balance this budget. Let's see if we can cut spending so we can continue the tax cuts and continue the economic growth that we have seen over the last 5 years. Let's see if we can make sure that the American taxpayers get to keep more of what they earn. Let's see if we can cut off some fat, even just a little fat from the Department of Homeland Security. Let's see what we can do to reduce bureaucracy here in Washington. 
   I am not sure if $8.9 million is the right amount, but I would like to hear from my colleagues to see if they agree or if they disagree.

   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague from Nebraska for yielding. 
   Let me answer the chairman's questions, because I do appreciate my colleague's leadership, and he has crafted, largely, a good bill. 
   My disagreements are oftentimes with my Republican administration, my colleague in the White House who is of my same party. What they have requested here is a good bit more bureaucracy at the top. 
   Let's face it, they have mismanaged the Department of Homeland Security. Look at the response to Katrina. I agree wholeheartedly with my Democrat colleagues. But I am of the opinion that simply because they have mismanaged does not simply mean you add to their budget. 
   I appreciate my colleagues' clapping. I appreciate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle clapping for me. That is so wonderful. I am excited about that. I am hopeful they will vote for my amendment, especially my good friends back there. 
   But let me tell you something. What I am attempting to do is get the numbers back to last year's spending level, to make sure we maintain this. My colleague from North Carolina said he spoke with the administration and realized that they wanted this amount of money. I have spoken with the taxpayers. They want some more of their money back. They don't want to deal with tax increases. 
   We need to get back to closer to last year's spending levels on management of the bureaucracy. We saw how the border is still porous. Let's put that money into the border. 
   We see how FEMA was mismanaged. Let's pour that money into getting people out there with supplies when catastrophic events come. But let's not spend on our bureaucracy here in Washington. Let's bring those numbers back closer to last year's budget levels.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, the disastrous effects of our Nation's dependence on foreign oil are being seen in every new tank of gas and every cent we send overseas to pay for Middle Eastern oil. Rising gas prices are a product of rising demand and not enough supply. 
   The time is now to revolutionize the way we produce and consume energy. That's why I am proposing a 21st Century Manhattan Project to spur the ingenuity of our American private sector, to deliver free market solutions for our Nation's energy problem. 
   I am introducing legislation to create a $1 billion prize, the Independence Prize, as I call it, that will go to Americans who develop revolutionary products that substantially reduce our dependence on foreign oil, eliminating our dependence on foreign oil. The Independence Prize provides incentives to American entrepreneurs to get transformational innovation to consumers, and more importantly, put Americans on a path to energy independence. Independence is the key. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. McHENRY. Madam Speaker, I rise to join with millions across this Nation who applaud the Supreme Court's recent decision to uphold the ban on partial-birth abortion. 
   Partial-birth abortion is unrivaled in its gruesome brutality. There is no question it has caused the vicious destruction of viable human life, babies, whose only crime is inconvenience. 
   The Court's decision is a victory in the quest to restore basic human dignity and human life. No longer will the  most vulnerable and innocent among us be subject to such cruelty. 
   It also is a victory for the Constitution, which liberal activist judges have demeaned for far too long. It is encouraging to see the Court's decision move toward our Founders' vision and intent to not only respect opinions and the vision for our country, but also to protect human life. 
   Let us never forget our responsibility to uphold the basic sanctity of human life granted by our Maker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Madam Chair, of all of the budgets before Congress, this one hits the taxpayers the hardest. 
   Over 5 years, the Progressive Caucus budget will raise taxes by $949.3 billion. Over 10 years, the Progressive Caucus budget will raise taxes by $2.4 trillion. Over the next 10 years, they will essentially double the budget. 
   There is nothing progressive about Democrats raising taxes. That has been their only fiscal strategy over the last 70 years. This budget spends $643 billion over 5 years and new entitlement spending over and above what the President has asked. 
   It also spends far less when it comes to military spending on our national defense. It drastically cuts military spending by $781 billion over 5 years. This is unconscionable. 
   Beyond that, it says that Iraq and Afghanistan and our global war against Islamic extremists is the largest single waste of U.S. taxpayer money. That is coming from their budget. Their budget assumes a dream world where we are not fighting a global war on terror. It is the ostrich approach, where you stick your head in the sand and hope everything goes away. It is ridiculous, and it is not safe for the American people. 
   Alternatively, the Republican budget that we propose here today takes Social Security off-budget, stops the raid on Social Security, and achieves balance while not raising taxes. It is a huge difference between what Republicans are proposing and the liberal left of the Democrat Caucus is proposing here on the House floor. 
   Beyond that, what the Democrats are saying with their full budget on the floor, as well as this Progressive Caucus budget, that they are going to punt on entitlement reform. Every known economist says we must reform entitlements. I oppose this budget.

Imagine the consequences of Iran developing nuclear weapons. It would destabilize the Middle East in an unprecedented fashion, ramp up the threat to our greatest ally, Israel, and give Islamic extremists the means to satisfy their gruesome goal, which is to bring chaos and death to our Nation and world. 
   In confronting this perilous threat, the United States must employ every element of our national power to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons program. The House will take a strong step today in that direction by passing the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act, which discourages investment in Iran's energy sector. 
   Countering the Iranian threat requires a steady, rational assessment of the world around us. And when a country led by Islamic extremists vows to attack our greatest ally and our country, you better believe we will stand firm and stare down the enemy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I am happy that the Chair is accepting this amendment, but I would like to speak on it as an opportunity to speak about cutting government spending. 
   Though it's just $50,500, that's far more than the median income in my district. I want the American taxpayers to know that this is an important step, and it's good that they're accepting a limitation on the rapid increase in spending within this legislation. 
   There are a lot of good points that we have to consider here. We have to consider the totality of government spending when we're debating here on the House floor. The government spending for this fiscal year is over $2.7 trillion. To put that into perspective, Mr. Chairman, that is larger than all the economies of the world, except for two. It is far larger than even the Chinese economy, which is about $1.9 trillion. 
   The reason why I bring this up is that when we're discussing each of these appropriations bills, we tend to focus on small parts of the appropriations process. We tend to focus on an amendment here, an amendment there, maybe increasing funding here and there and increasing funding in a particular appropriations bill. But we have to talk about what's that doing to the whole of the budget. And if we spend money here in the Department of Agriculture, we may not have that money to fund this SCHIP proposal that the Democrats are bringing to the floor at the end of this week. 
   Now, to talk about that bill, what they're going to do is not simply cut government spending elsewhere in the budget, elsewhere in the government, reforming programs, eliminating programs that are ineffective and no longer cost-effective for the American taxpayers, but what they do is they go out and find new revenue and raise taxes under this SCHIP proposal. 
   The Agriculture bill we have here today increases government spending, thereby forcing this new Democrat majority to go out and raise taxes for their new programs. And, Mr. Chairman, they've proposed a lot of new programs, this new Democrat majority, and what we have to do is focus on making sure we balance the budget. Now, balancing the budget, to me, as a fiscal conservative, does not mean going out and getting new revenue.     
   It means doing things, sensible things, such as the Congressman from Georgia, Mr. Gingrey, my good friend and colleague, is doing here. It cuts 1 percent out of the administrative budget of the Department of Agriculture, just 1 percent. 
   I have an amendment that I would like to perfect. If 1 percent was acceptable to the Chair, I would like to see if maybe 2 percent would be acceptable and see where we can actually draw the line in cutting government spending, where the breaking point is in this House of Representatives. To that end, I think it is important that we have a discussion on what that proper number is.  
   I know my colleague from Georgia may have another amendment similar to this next up, I hope, at which point I would like to see if we can actually go a little bit further in cutting government spending. Let's talk about not just the Agriculture appropriations bill, which is the key focus of today, but also the long-term consequences of our just having a narrow, myopic focus on the current bill on the floor. Let's talk about the totality of government spending, ways that we can reform the government, limit the government, and actually get back to what is sensible. 
   We have a big debate going on right now about the war in Iraq. We have a big debate going on about children's health care. We have a big debate about whether or not the farm bill that we passed last week was the right thing to do and whether or not you should actually have a massive tax increase in order to implement the new programs within that formula. Many of us agree that that wasn't the right thing to do, but, unfortunately, the majority in the House did vote for that massive tax increase. 
   It is important that we have a discussion on health care and agriculture and the long-term consequences of these issues going forward. Certainly, the bill today and the chairman's willingness to accept a 1 percent cut in the administrative budget is a step in the right direction. We can be thankful for that. 
   I hope, as we go on in the debate, the Chair will be willing to accept other amendments that limit the rapid increase of funds going to the Department of Agriculture and we can actually rightsize the government. There are many on this side of the aisle who want to cut the size and scope of government. I know that the chairwoman has been willing to examine programs and reform those programs. I hope that she will be willing to accept many of the amendments we have here today. 
   I also know my colleague from Georgia has a number of amendments like this. It is important that we discuss the long-term consequences of our failure to limit the growth of government. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McHENRY. Thank you. I appreciate your kind words, Congressman Barrett, and I really appreciate your leadership. I know the people of South Carolina do as well. As deputy ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, he has his work cut out for him leading us on the Budget Committee. 
   I want to bring out just a few facts for the American people tonight, Madam Speaker. Congressman Jordan pointed out very aptly the size of the Federal Government, just so the American people can understand what a $3 trillion government costs, what that actually means though. You say $3 trillion. What does $1 billion look like? 
   Well, sure, Bill Gates could tell you what $1 billion looks like. He's got that in his checkbook. But for the average American, what does that mean? 
   And to point out the fact that it's larger than most countries are. We have the third largest economy in the world held just in our Federal budget; greater than the whole economy of China. It's absolutely amazing. 
   But when we talk about boondoggles in government, folks in North Carolina know about that. Look, in western North Carolina, where I represent, in Hickory, where I'm from, Cherryville, I've got to tell you, the American people know the government's wasteful. 
   If you're out in the eastern part of the State like in New Bern, for instance, if you're out there, you recognize this stuff, but let's talk about a great, enormous in size and scope boondoggle that we have here in Washington, DC. 
   There are 111,000 bureaucrats here in Washington, DC. Some don't do much. Others are very active. But 111,000 bureaucrats. The average wage for those bureaucrats here in Washington, DC is $89,561 a year. That's amazing to me that the sheer size of that, the average wage is so high. It's enormous. 
   But in the Department of Education, we know that education is critical. It's especially critical in western North Carolina. We have 3,224 bureaucrats here in Washington, DC in the U.S. Department of Education. The average wage is $93,773. Now imagine that. The average teacher in America makes $47,000 a year. I would much rather take that money from the bureaucrats and put it in the hands of teachers who are actually educating children. 
   Madam Speaker, we have a crisis on our hands with the size and scope of government. We have to limit the size and scope of government. We have to bring the budget to balance and do it without raising taxes. 
   I appreciate and applaud my colleague from South Carolina for hosting this special order so we can bring out these facts to the American people, because as their family budgets tighten, so should the Federal Government's budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my good friend from Georgia, Dr. Price. Thank you for your leadership and for being here on the floor and being so active. Your constituents should be proud of you. And I thank them for electing you. 
   Madam Speaker, here on Tax Day, in 2007, I hearken back to the words that Ronald Reagan said. He said, our Federal Tax Code is, in short, utterly impossible, utterly unjust, and completely counterproductive. It reeks with injustice and is fundamentally un-American and has earned a rebellion, and it is time we rebelled.     
   That is a quote from Ronald Reagan in 1983. 
   Well, I think it is high time we rebel. Today is one day in every American's life where they realize how complex and how horrible our Federal Tax Code is. The Tax Code stands at an astonishing 16,485 pages in length, and there are 1,638 different tax forms on the IRS's Web site. That is outstandingly horrible for the American people. 
   In 2006, the average taxpayer spent 37.8 hours crunching numbers to complete even the most basic tax form, Form 1040. That is nearly an entire work week spent in filing taxes. Even worse, small businesses spend about 80 hours in preparing their tax returns. That is a 2-week vacation for the average working American family. 
   And, in total, the American people in a recent poll think the Tax Code is obscene. Eighty percent think the Tax Code is too complicated while only 3 percent believe the Tax Code is just fine the way it is. I concur with that 80 percent, Madam Speaker. 
   Although just empowered a few months, the new Democratic majority in the House with our new Speaker, they have proposed the largest tax increase in American history. The largest tax increase in American history. They propose a $2,066,675,000,000 tax increase. What does that mean for the average American? Well, the average American, a family of four making $50,000 a year, will see a tax hike of roughly $2,092 this year. What is worse is that my constituents back home in North Carolina will see an average tax increase of $2,671 per year. That is money they could be spending on education. That is money they could be spending on their kids. That is money they could be spending in their community. Instead, the Democrats want that money to come here to fund the bloated bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. 
   Now, you understand the Republicans have cut taxes over the last decade, and that is very positive. Actually, as the Republican majority for 12 years, we proposed a tax cut every year. Every single year we proposed that. Now, Democrat President Bill Clinton didn't support it, but once we got George Bush in office in 2001, he proposed a massive tax cut. 
   What has that done? Well, the Democrats say that it is not enough money coming into government. Well, they are wrong. They are absolutely wrong. The Democrats are wrong when they say government doesn't have enough money. 
   Just this last year, government income amounted to over $2.4 trillion. Now, let's put this in historical context. That is the largest income to any government in the history of the planet. Now, let's think this thing through. $2.4 trillion, is that enough to fund our Federal bureaucracy? According to the Democrats, the answer is ``no.'' They want more. They want the American people to give more to the Federal Government. 
   Let's put that $2.4 trillion in context. Well, there are only two countries on Earth that have economies larger than our Federal Government. Aside from ours, Germany and Japan are the only countries on Earth that have economies larger than our Federal income. Now, the scary part is that Germany only barely beats the Federal Government with its roughly similar size economy. 
   There is a lot of talk about how the Chinese economy is booming and it is on the rise. Well, it is true and it is a big threat to our jobs here in the United States, and it is a big economic concern for us as a nation. But the Chinese economy, though booming, is only $1.9 trillion, and that means it is a half trillion dollars smaller than our Federal income. The total gross domestic product of China is smaller than the income to our Federal Government. 
   So, Madam Speaker, if we look at a recent poll by Pew Research, people were asked what they thought was the best way to reduce the Federal deficit, and in that poll the result was pretty simple. Only 9 percent said that tax increases were the best way. A combined 69 percent said they would rather see government reduce spending. Now, not only do I agree with the 80 percent of the American people that say the Tax Code is too complex, that it is obscene; I also agree with that 69 percent that say the way to reduce government is to reduce spending. That is pretty simple. It is common sense to the American people. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge this Democrat majority to rethink their tax increase strategy, because it is going to raise taxes on every American who pays taxes. And, furthermore, those that are in the low income of our economy are actually going to see their taxes increase as well because they are going to roll back all the Bush tax cuts over the last 7 years. I think that is the wrong thing for the American people. It is the wrong thing for my constituents of western North Carolina. And I think that that is something that is going to harm our economy, the strength of our growing economy. So I  think the Democrats should rethink their tax increase strategy and do what is right for the American people. Reform the Tax Code. Cut taxes at the very least, but reform the Tax Code so we can actually inject more capital into the marketplace and allow people to keep more of what they earn because it is good for their families and good for our economy, and I think it is generally good for America. 
   With that, I thank you, Congressman Price, for hosting this important hour, especially on such an important day to the American people when they have to go file those tax returns. We know how frustrated they get because we have to file those same tax returns, and it is important that we remind our constituents that we are subject to the same laws that they are, and that is a very good thing and a great motivation for tax reform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, tax receipts are up, and the deficit is down. Pro-growth policies are working. The President's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 have had an enormous impact on our economy and on government revenue. 
   The Office of Management and Budget announced today that the Federal deficit is actually $205 billion, the lowest since 2002, the lowest since the tax cuts went into effect. What this shows is that with pro-growth policies, the economy grows. And when the economy grows, tax receipts to the government go up as well. When that happens, we can balance this budget if we have the reasonable approach of restraining spending and keeping in place the tax cuts that were put in place in 2001 and 2003. 
   I urge my colleagues to continue this pro-growth policy of keeping taxes low and helping the American economy grow and prosper.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for yielding this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think there is a critical point that is being overlooked in this debate on the minimum wage. We need to talk about the people that this minimum wage increase will be a barrier to their employment, for example, the physically, emotionally and mentally handicapped in this country. 
   I have in my district, in Cleveland County, Cleveland Vocational Industries, a community-based organization. What they do is they train workers with disabilities to fulfill certain assembly line packing and labeling projects, what some of us would call menial labor or very simple tasks. But it is a very positive thing. It is a great way to train and employ people that otherwise cannot be trained and employed. 
   What is going to happen is these are about 8 percent of the total minimum wage earners in this country, those with disabilities. What that is going to do is harm them in their ability to get contracts with businesses. 
   This is a very nice idea, to raise people's wages, but the impact it is going to have among the least among us will be that they will simply not have a job. I think that is being lost in this debate, and I think that is what we need to be concerned about. 
   Let's talk about the facts about the minimum wage. That is what is lost here. This is high-minded rhetoric. What the Democrat majority wants to do, Mr. Speaker, is use other people's money to pay other people. Well, that is a very nice thing to do, a nice offer, a very nice thing, to write a check for somebody else. 
   All right. Let them pay somebody else. That is a nice obligation that we are passing on, this unfunded mandate. 
   Eighty-five percent of minimum wage earners in this country are teens or adults who live alone or second earners; a married couple, one goes and works part-time. Eighty-five percent of them fall in those categories. So they are talking about making a minimum wage on this and providing for a family of 10, or whatever. It is just empty rhetoric and crazy talk. 
   So let's talk about affecting and helping people through training and access to health care and support the Republican alternative.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Thank you, Congressman Price, thank you, Dr. Price. As an expert on medical subjects and as someone who has treated thousands of patients over his career and saved hundreds of lives as well, a humble doctor would not say that; that is why I must say that for you here tonight, Tom, because you have done a fantastic job of leading our agenda as someone who is very engaged in these medical issues that are so important to all Americans, these large health care issues that affect every American. 
   Today we have had a lot of debate here on the floor about minimum wage, about raising the minimum wage. But what is omitted from the Democrat's 100-hour agenda and from this debate about raising the minimum wage is a matter of access to health care. 
   It was a Republican Congress that instituted Medicare part D, and which provided a prescription drug benefit for the first time for seniors. There was a lot of debate before Congressman Price and I came to Congress about the structure of that and how it is going to work. We were not a part of that debate because we were not here yet, but we were affected by it as Americans and as policymakers here in Washington D.C. 
   But looking back at that record, Congressman Price brought up a very, very strong point. As they are going through the committee process, now close to 4 years ago, 3 to 4 years ago, the Democrats wanted to guarantee that all Americans would pay $35 per month for their insurance premium to get the Medicare part D prescription plan. 
   Well, they wanted a guarantee of $35, and they said that the Republican plan was going to be too costly, too expensive. The Republicans said, you know, what if we actually put this out into the free market and provide this plan through market-based forces; in essence saying you can compete between different plans, different companies can offer this prescription drug benefit, and so they go out and they compete for seniors' business? That means a couple of different things. 
   Instead of waiting in line at the Social Security office for the government, because there is no competition because we are government, waiting for hours, or waiting on hold for hours with a government agency, you have these individual plans. These businesses want to keep the business of seniors so they provide better customer service. 
   But the additional thing, rather than some government bureaucrat sitting here in Washington, D.C., saying you can take Lipitor but not Crestor to reduce your cholesterol numbers. 
   Well, as a nonmedical expert, I don't know the details of how these medications work, but those are the types of people, without a medical background, making the decisions on who has access to those types of medicine. But the plan we put in place is a little different. The plan we put in place said, we are going to have competition in the marketplace. 
   These plans say to seniors, we will give you choices, choices. Do you want to pay $35 a month and have a choice of any medication you want, period, or do you want to have a more limited plan with fewer choices but you will pay less per month? 
   But seniors get to make that choice, not some bureaucrat sitting here in Washington, D.C., and not your Congressman. Because, unlike Dr. Price, there are very few medical experts here in Congress that can make those decisions. 
   As my colleague would say, it is not even a good idea for a doctor in the House of Representatives to dictate what an individual patient could receive in a certain part of Georgia or a certain part of North Carolina; much less, it doesn't work. One-size-fits-all doesn't work. 
   But what the Democrats put out here on the floor or what they are putting out, I should say, later this week, is they want to institute price controls, what they call negotiating for Medicare part D.

   Mr. McHENRY. It is an excellent point. We are talking about negotiating. Who is better at negotiating, somebody sitting at a desk in Washington, D.C., employed by the government, or those health care experts employed by the companies offering the plans? 
   I would submit that the free market will always negotiate better prices than some government bureaucrat can ever do. And the fact is what the Democrats are going to push will raise premiums for individual members or individual constituents. 
   So, market forces. The Democrats want to say $35 a month, everyone has to pay that for their Medicare part D benefit. Well, you know the market forces have created a premium average which you said that gets lower and lower. The earlier numbers from a few months ago, the average is $24, and here now we are hearing that it is closer to $22 on average nationally. 
   So we have a couple things, by the way, that free market conservatives insisted on this plan being written. It says we will have a choice, meaning individuals. Our individual constituents, our individual seniors that we represent will have that choice with their plans and thereby have a choice over the medications that they can access. 
   The second thing is lower prices, meaning that taxpayers don't have to pay extra money and seniors don't have to pay extra money. It is a wonderful bargain, it is a great idea, and this is something that we need to talk about, not some sham or idea that is a political red herring. We need to talk about the choices that seniors are given and the price savings that they receive.

   Mr. McHENRY. The fact that you said just strikes me as so funny. Think about negotiating with the Post Office and the IRS. As an average taxpayer, think about the IRS. They say you are going to do this or we are going to send you to jail. Talk about compelling individuals to submit. 
   Now, here is what I think is interesting about this is like negotiating with the IRS: You will pay the price no matter what, and there is only one consequence, you going to jail or you paying. But with this plan, the market forces will have a ripple effect on long-term cures and long-term medical technologies coming on the market, and I think that is the devastating impact. It is not just a jail sentence. It is actually a sentence for all Americans to have less access, less choice, and less long-term cures and benefits from the wonderful cures that the pharmaceutical industries have created over the last two generations.

So we are going through this whole process of debate, and let's just hope that this is not an empty promise or empty rhetoric for the campaign, this idea of negotiating price controls, which certain of us have this hunch that maybe it is just empty rhetoric. But to confirm that it is not empty rhetoric, Congressman Price, I know you are very much in tune with the fiscal issues of this House and this Nation. Certainly there is going to be some benefit to the taxpayers and to consumers if the Democrats pass their plan. Do you have any facts on that?

   Mr. McHENRY. The gentleman has a wonderful point, because we had this meeting which I was happy to attend with you just the other day with Secretary Leavitt, who, as those listening and watching tonight, Mr. Speaker, very well know, he is the Secretary of the Health and Human Service Department here in Washington, D.C. He would be in charge of negotiating these price controls. 
   Now, what is interesting is you are talking about giving more power to someone in government. They normally like that. They normally seek that out. As we all well know, it is human nature. And his answer is pretty simple: I know we will not be able to get any benefit out of this and I know that it will have a harmful effect on the program and access to consumers' choices and access to the medical pharmacology that they need. 
   So he said he does not want this. It is not necessary. And he concurs with the  CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, analysis of this; and the fact is that CBO says the government could not negotiate a lower price than what the free market is already doing. 
   So the facts are out there. And I am led to believe with the facts you just discussed, Dr. Price, that this is pretty much a sham. It is a political issue used by a select few here in Washington, D.C., for political purposes. 
   Look, I know, I know, you know, politics in Washington, oh, what a shock. But the emptiness of this rhetoric from the majority side is quite glaring, and in fact I am led to believe that it is really a red herring. Let's make this the big evil issue. When in fact going back to the Clinton administration they had the very same language on how to get the best price from government purchasing pharmaceuticals. And so they are going to a different direction in order to win a political issue and they are going back on what they advocated just a few years ago in the Clinton administration and even what they supported in committee here in this House just less than 4 years ago.

   Mr. McHENRY. Thank you so much again, Congressman Price. Again, it is an honor and a privilege to be on the floor with two physicians who have this hands-on knowledge of how a very complicated government program works in terms of people. And I think that is what we need to be concerned about as policymakers, is the impact that we have on citizens and the choices and options they are able to have, the cost out of their pocket both through tax dollars and through their premium payments every month through the Medicare part D premium. 
   What we have to do in this House as a minority party now is to make sure that what the Democrat majority does is honest and has integrity, and I believe that this issue is a red herring used for political purposes. It is a sham. It will have little to no effect, and any effect that it does have will be negative for seniors, and it will be negative for our taxpayer dollars, and it will have a long-term negative effect on our pharmaceutical industry in this Nation where we have developed wonderful cures for such complex ailments that have perplexed generations of Americans and citizens in this world. 
   So what we have to do is make sure that we focus on the price to consumers, the price to taxpayers, and the choice and options that consumers are able to have in the free market. So let us not get off on tangents here. That is what this issue is all about, price and choice. So let us stand on the side that provides our constituents with the best options available, the most options available, at the lowest price possible. 
   So, Congressman Price, I thank you for your leadership with the Official Truth Squad. It is a great, great day when you are able to take the House  floor and I am able to watch you in action making the points that need to be articulated to the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to serve in this House and be able to carry out those agenda items that are going to help Americans and also stop the bad things that will hurt Americans that some in this Chamber offer, some more frequently than others. 
   Thank you, Congressman Price, for your leadership not just on the prescription drug benefit issue and medical issues but your overall leadership of holding this majority party, the Democrat majority party, accountable for their words, their rhetoric, and their actions. Thank you, Congressman Price.

   Never mind that tax revenues increased by 11.5 percent last year because of strong economic growth, economic growth created by the Bush tax cuts over the last 6 years. Never mind, never mind, the economy is strong. Never mind that last year the U.S. Government took in more revenue than any government in history. Actually, in the history of the planet. 
   But yet that is not enough revenue for the Democrats' plans, yet they talk about pay-as-you-go in order to tax the American people more.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from California for that warm introduction. 
   Today was a historic day for the House of Representatives: A new Speaker, a new majority, and, in their words, a new time in Washington. To use the new Speaker's words, this is about respect for every voice, to work for every American, to seek common ground for the common good. 
   Those are high words and high values that we should seek here in the House of Representatives that all Americans desire in their government. And as a key part of what the Democrats campaigned on in the 2006 election, one of the key tenets was open and honest bipartisan governance. But their first act on this House floor is to push down the throats of this institution a closed rule that closes off debate, that disallows dissenting voices, that simply waves off that open, fair, and honest process. 
   To that end, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question. And if we defeat the previous question, I will be able to offer this minority bill of rights, the Pelosi minority bill of rights. To use the words of the new Speaker, the minority bill of rights includes guidelines for bipartisan administration of the House and for the regular Democratic order for legislation. The principles are fair and will provide for the full and open debate that the American people expect and deserve. Now, those are not my words. Those are the words of the new Speaker. Then-Minority Leader Pelosi wrote those words in June of 2004. 
   Now, while the new Speaker and I may not agree on much in terms of policy, tax policy, or the policy on national defense, I think we have the same values when it comes to fair and open and honest legislative debate. And to that end I sought to outline her principles and put them into the minority bill of rights. So let us defeat the previous question so that we can vote on this minority bill of rights, the Pelosi bill of rights.

   If we defeat the previous question, we can then have an honest vote on the Pelosi minority bill of rights package. It is a very important thing for us to have an open, bipartisanship debate on opening day of this new Congress, for the new majority to be able to say clearly to the American people that their rhetoric is becoming reality on the opening day of this Congress. For if they do not do that and they do ram down the throats of all Members here on this floor this previous question, then all people will be locked out from offering debates on this House floor; and, from the Republican side, 140 million Americans who voted for our side of the aisle, their voices will be stifled in this process. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members, both Republicans and Democrats to come together, defeat this previous vote, and then we can move on to an open, fair debate on the minority bill of rights, the Pelosi minority bill of rights. That is a fair thing to do.

   Mr. McHENRY. Thank you, Congressman Price. I appreciate your leadership, friendship, and support in our first term in Congress and as we begin our second. And I appreciate you pulling together the Official Truth Squad and taking this from an idea and actually making it into reality. After all, that is what this legislative process and indeed this House of Representatives is all about, is taking an idea, a powerful idea and making it happen for the American people. 
   To that end, the Official Truth Squad is here to make sure that the American people know what happens here in these hallowed halls of Congress. And I think it is important, what you point out today from the Democrat leaders' words and actions on their opening day and the lead-up to taking control of this new Congress. It is indeed a new day here, and the American people know that. And I think what the American people see is that the Democrats worked very hard in the campaign and were rewarded by taking control of this wonderful Congress of us, the people's House, and they campaigned on a number of things. But one of the key tenants and key principles upon which they ran their campaigns and the rhetoric they used during the campaign was about openness, honesty, and fairness. 
   This openness idea, it is a wonderful thing to talk about and I think it is something that I stand for and I know my colleague from Georgia does as well, and we have worked very hard during our times in public service to provide this for the American people. But it was their number one tenant in the campaign, their number one principle, openness. 
   Well, on the opening day of Congress, we were hoping as the new minority that this new Democrat majority would ensure openness and fairness. And that is why Congressman Price and I, along with some of my other colleagues, joined together to offer the minority bill of rights. And what the minority bill of rights is, in essence, is what all fifth graders in America are taught: It is the legislative process that, when you file a bill in this House, it goes to committee or subcommittee, and it is heard, it is debated, it is amended, it is crafted, and there is compromise in the process. All sides, Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, moderates, liberals, they are all heard. And then it comes to this House floor, where it again goes through that very same process of compromise and input. Well, that is what the minority bill of rights is all about. And what we offered as the minority bill of rights and what we offered here on the House floor today with our two procedural votes today, was ensuring that these principles, which then minority leader Nancy Pelosi, now Speaker Pelosi, advocated just 3 years ago. 
   So what we offered was, in fact, the Pelosi minority bill of rights. It is not simply a Republican idea, it is actually the minority leader, now the Speaker, her ideas on the way this place should be governed. And when we offered it here on the floor, it was flatly rejected. So it became clear here on the opening day, the opening hours of this new Democrat majority, the campaign on openness, that they really advocated closed process and they only want their ideas, their few ideas heard. They don't want any input or any dissenting opinion. 
   The bottom line is that Speaker Pelosi thinks that Minority Leader Pelosi was wrong. I think some people call that hypocrisy, some call it ironic to campaign on that. I think it is ridiculous on the opening day of Congress, after a new majority is elected on openness, that they cram down the throats of all the Members of this House a closed rule that does not allow for input, does not allow for amendment, doesn't allow for full, open, and fair debate, on their opening day of their first act as a majority. That is what is so egregious about what we saw here on the House floor. 
   In fact, this type of abuse has never happened before in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives, the idea that you put a rule out, a rule forward that closes off debate on an unknown bill. We can't even see the text of the bills that they are offering in their 100-hour proposal. They have closed it off from minority view. Simply because I have an ``R'' beside my name, they believe that I am not able to view it.  
   Well, I have got news for them. I have got news for this new Democrat majority. 140 million Americans voted for a Republican for U.S. Congress. They are not simply silencing a Member of Congress from North Carolina or a Member of Congress from Georgia; they are silencing the constituents who elected me. That is not fair. That is not openness. That is not a new way of operating. In fact, it is a very old way of operating that the Democrats used when they were in the majority before. 
   So I think that we should set aside the first day and be hopeful for a second day and a new beginning. We like second chances as Americans. Let's give the Democrats a second chance for true openness, input, and dialogue in a bipartisanship basis; not simply use it as a rhetorical device during the campaign, but to actually govern that way, to actually do it, make sure it happens here on this House floor, not for us as Members of Congress, but for our constituents and for the American people.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman's quotes are quite illuminating about the rhetoric that the Democrat Members used versus their actions on opening day. Your expertise on the Rules Committee is quite prescient. 
   There are three additional quotes that come to mind from earlier today. In the new Speaker's speech today, her rather elaborate speech today about the agenda for this new Congress, she said three things that are of importance to what we are talking about here. She said first, respect for every voice. That is what their new majority is about. And it is also to work for all of America. And, finally, it is for common ground for the common good. 
   Those are wonderful things and wonderful ideals that this House should live up to. But as my colleague from Georgia said, it shouldn't be simply a speech. It shouldn't simply be rhetoric; it should be reality. It should be the practice of this House to seek common ground to work for all of America, even  those that didn't vote for the Democrat majority, all of America, and respect every voice, even if you have an ``R'' beside your name, respect for every idea that comes out of this place so that we can do what is best and right for America. It is not simply about process. 
   I think my colleague from Georgia said that very well. It is not about process. It is about the effects that that process have on public policy and the outcomes. If you rig the process, which I think there are countries around the world that rig their voting process, that is not true democracy. Fairness and openness, that is what brings about the best result for all of America. It is not about a Democrat idea or a Republican idea; it is about doing what is right on a bipartisan basis for the American people.

   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Last year our friends on the other side of the aisle declared that they were going to ``clean up the swamp'' and get rid of the budget and its rampant waste, fraud, and abuse. In December of 2005, Speaker Pelosi proudly said, ``The budget is a statement of national priorities and our values as a Nation.'' 
   Well, sadly, the Democrat values represented in this budget are waste, fraud, and abuse. It is very sad. But for my district, Mr. Chairman, this budget represents an average tax increase per taxpayer of $2,631 per year. Additional loss of income in a number of studies, because rising taxes will curb economic growth, an additional loss of $1,600. This budget is harmful to American values and American families. 
   I asked my Democrat colleagues to justify this for me. Why must we raise taxes by this rate? And yet nothing. I would be happy to yield to my colleagues to answer that question, why rising taxes are good for the American people. I hear nothing. I am willing to yield, but they have nothing. And what for? Waste, fraud, and abuse. Rising taxes. A government that is so large, and yet nothing is done to reform. 
   There are thousands of ways that we can eliminate this rampant growth of government. There are 91 programs that the administration targeted for elimination; 85 of them continue to be funded. In fact, half of them had increased funding last year under this Democratic Congress. 
   But what else is egregious, if you look at a Treasury Department report, you will find a section called ``Unreconciled Transactions.'' Well, they account for $25 billion worth of taxpayer funding that they know it was spent, but they don't know who, what, when, where, how, or why it was spent. This is rather disturbing. 
   We have the opportunity to right-size government, to reform government. When the U.S. Department of Education bureaucrats in these beautiful buildings down the street here, when they have an average wage of $93,000 a year, yet our average teacher in America only makes $47,000 a year, we know these values are wrong in this Democrat budget.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   A major component of the Democrats' energy legislation and the Democrats' answer to our energy crisis is, hold on, wait one minute, wait one minute, it is promoting the use of the bicycle. Oh, I cannot make this stuff up. Yes, the American people have heard this. Their answer to our fuel crisis, the crisis at the pumps, is: Ride a bike. 
   Democrats believe that using taxpayer funds in this bill to the tune of $1 million a year should be devoted to the principle of: ``Save energy, ride a bike.'' Some might argue that depending on bicycles to solve our energy crisis is naive, perhaps ridiculous. Some might even say Congress should use this energy legislation to create new energy, bring new nuclear power plants on line, use clean coal technology, energy exploration, but no, no. They want to tell the American people, stop driving, ride a bike. This is absolutely amazing. 
   Apparently, the Democrats believe that the miracle on two wheels that we know as a bicycle will end our dependence on foreign oil. I cannot make this stuff up. It is absolutely amazing. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I bring you the Democrats, promoting 19th century solutions to 21st century problems. If you don't like it, ride a bike. If you don't like the price at the pumps, ride a bike. 
   Stay tuned for the next big idea for the Democrats: Improving energy efficiency by the horse and buggy.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague from Iowa for his leadership, and I wanted to echo what you were speaking of earlier. And it is interesting what we are experiencing right now in Congress, an interesting time. 
   The new Speaker comes to office with a new Democrat majority, and what the Speaker pledges is ``respect for every voice,'' and another quote, ``working for all of America.'' Well, all of America except American Samoa, a small island in the South Pacific where they have been exempted from the Federal minimum wage. 
   Now, Nancy Pelosi during the campaign, then-Minority Leader PELOSI said, ``The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 will increase the Federal minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 over the next 2 years, providing families with additional funds to cover the increasing costs of health insurance, gasoline, and home heating and attending college.'' 
   There actually was a press release just a few days ago when the Speaker of the House issued this press statement. That is good. That is a high honor which the new Speaker had of increasing the Federal minimum wage, and it is a high honor for some politicians in Washington, D.C. to use other people's money to increase other people's wages. It is not coming from the pockets of D.C. politicians; it is coming from small business owners across the America who are going to be impacted and perhaps lose jobs over this. 
   But the bad item in this is the Washington Times report from just today that ``the Democrats' minimum wage legislation exempts American Samoa, another Pacific Islands territory, that would become the only U.S. territory not subject to the Federal minimum wage.'' That is from the report from the Washington Times today. 
   Now, it is peculiar. Why, I ask, would American Samoa be exempt from the Federal minimum wage? It seems an oddity, does it not, Congressman King? It seems an oddity that a small island of all of our territories in this great Nation, of all the States in the Nation, that an island is exempt. One island. Why, I ask, would that island be exempt? It just seems perplexing to me. I mean, it seems like good news that the new Democrat majority and the new Speaker want to raise the Federal minimum wage to help people, to help families with their health insurance, gasoline, home heating, as well as attending college. 
   If it is not good for American Samoa, how could it be good for the United States to have an increase in the Federal minimum wage? And if it is good for the United States, if it is good for America, why is not American Samoa given the same benefits? It is America, too. Well, perhaps the new Democrat Speaker doesn't think so. 
   The question I raise, Congressman King, is why could that be? We are just simply asking the question here tonight, why could that be the new Democrat Speaker would want to exempt a single island from a large piece of legislation? In fact, it is one of their six items in their 100-hour program. It is an amazing question to me, Congressman King. It is an amazing question with perhaps a simple answer. 
   Well, going back to the Washington Times article, if I may quote from there: ``The loopholes please the tuna corporations that employ thousands of Samoans in canneries there at $3.26 an hour. One of the biggest opponents of the U.S. minimum wage is StarKist Tuna, which owns one of the two packing plants that together employ more than 5,000 Samoans or nearly 75 percent of the island's workforce. StarKist's parent company, Del Monte Corp., is headquartered in San Francisco, which is represented by--.'' Well, we will fill in the blank, that is, for someone else to fill in the blank. 
   But certainly something is fishy. Something is indeed fishy when the Federal minimum wage is good for all Americans as espoused by the Democrat majority, yet we exempt a small, in many terms economically struggling, island. 
   Now, I submit, Mr. Speaker, if it is good for us in this Chamber to vote to raise the Federal minimum wage, is it not good for all Americans, even in the territories? Is it not a matter of fairness to extend that to all the territories? It is an amazing happening, Congressman King, in these opening hours that I would ask you, why could this be? I mean, if we are going to work for all America as the new Speaker said, why not all of America, even the territories? 
   Congressman King, there are many questions here, but I raise the question, how could this be in the most ethical Congress in history?

It is an interesting oddity in press reports that this is raised. And, like I said, Congressman King, I believe it is just fishy. It is very fishy that this would happen in the opening week of a new Congress that espouses really high ethical standards which we all hope for and we strive for as individuals and as a collective body. It is a very strange happening in the Democrats' 100-hour provisions that they even go back on their campaign pledge to have the Federal minimum wage across America, not exempting certain areas or certain islands or certain peoples, but actually have a uniform standard. It is very  fishy that these things happen just at the beginning.

   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague from Iowa for asking that question. It's an overly broad answer, it seems. Yet the other interesting avenue here on exempting a certain area of America with a certain business interest that is represented by a certain individual, well, it is interesting to me because in many ways what the Democrats promised was an end to earmarks. Earmarks, the American people know very well that earmarks are simply pork-barrel spending. Well, I will tell you something, this may be tuna, but it smells like pork. And this special provision, I would submit to you, should fall under this earmark reform that the new Democrat majority wants to pass on this House floor. 
   I think it is a high goal for us to have, that is, to have fundamental earmark reform so we eliminate pork-barrel spending programs. But this bill in the first full week of the Democrat majority has an earmark. 
   And my colleague from New Jersey has joined us, and Congressman Garrett is very involved in the fiscal conservative agenda, as my fellow colleague from Iowa is, Congressman King. Now, would you define this as an earmark, Congressman Garrett?

I think it is a wonderful thing because we know that our colleagues perhaps, Mr. Speaker, would be watching this debate and perhaps they could join us and answer some of these questions that we are trying to wrestle with on this important piece of legislation that the House took up just yesterday and passed under a closed rule, under martial law, not allowing any dissenting voices to offer any amendments to perfect it, perhaps extending the Federal minimum wage to even American Samoans or, in fact, change the bill so that it helps small businesses transition with this increase in the Federal minimum wage. 
   We have many questions, and I would love for our colleagues to join us here on the floor to answer these questions because we need the answers from the Democrat majority who control this place. And I would dare say, if the Madam Speaker would like to come before us here tonight, we would be happy to yield plenty of time for her to explain these actions of this new Democrat majority. We would love to have some input from our other colleagues on the other side of the aisle. In an air of bipartisanship, let's share our time, Congressman King, during this leadership hour and make sure that we have an open dialogue and we answer questions.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, there are many good and decent people who are in financial distress right now across this country. Some with mortgages they can't afford. Some made poor financial decisions. Some were victims of fraud. Some were simply speculators acting on their instincts. 
   But the reality is that most borrowers are paying on time. They are making their mortgages; 92 percent of borrowers are paying on time across this country; 6 percent are late but not yet in foreclosure, and 2 percent are actually in foreclosure. This bill is directed to the 2 percent on the backs of the 98 percent. That means that 110 million households are meeting their obligations. This legislation under consideration today would require that those 110 million families bail out the lenders on Wall Street. And I will tell you it's simply a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
   We are sending the message to financial institutions and Wall Street investors that when those investors make poor choices and take ill-advised risks that the Federal Government will step in and bail them out. That's a bad decision. In fact, this is a $300 billion taxpayer bailout that will cost the American taxpayer $5,000 for every foreclosed loan that is dumped into the program. And make no mistake about it. They will be dumped into the program. And it's not the homeowners who will control this. It will be the lenders and servicers who will decide to take advantage of this for their own personal advantage, the servicers and the lenders. 
   The one thing that we know for sure is that those lenders and servicers are only going to submit those loans that they don't believe will pay. The American taxpayer will instead be punished. Ultimately, the real losers are the American taxpayers who are left to guarantee the loans that nobody else wants. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the past couple of months, I received several calls, letters, conversations I have had with my constituents, talking about the struggles that they are making in order to pay their mortgage. They don't want to have to pay somebody else's mortgage. They are struggling enough to make their ends meet with high gas prices, the rising cost of health care. And I'm not advocating that we do nothing. In fact, I have been working very hard in my district with foreclosure prevention seminars, working with the Hope Now alliance, which has helped 1.4 million homeowners stay out of foreclosure, keep their homes. 
   These are the things that Congress should be doing, is helping individuals get through this crisis. We shouldn't have a massive bailout of lenders on Wall Street. We shouldn't bail out the servicers. They took ill-advised risks, and as such, the losses should be carried by them, not by my constituents who are paying on time. 
   Let's oppose this legislation and do what's reasonable and right for the taxpayer.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, this past March, Burke County authorities pulled over an SUV in Morganton, North Carolina, packed with 11 illegal immigrants. Local law enforcement officials were forced to release the illegals after being notified that there were not enough Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents available to check on the group's immigration status, even though they admitted that they were illegal. 
   Law enforcement officials, not the illegal aliens, were handcuffed that night on I-40. Our hands were tied by red tape and bureaucracy and underfunding. 
   The 287(g) program is working efficiently in my home county of Gaston, and our sheriff there, Sheriff Cloninger, is doing a fantastic job of cross-training deputies to also enforce our immigration laws of this land and gives them the authority, the legal authority, to investigate, detain and arrest illegal aliens on civil and criminal grounds. It paves the way for local law enforcement to be a part of our homeland security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, a major contributor to America's illegal immigration problem is the inability of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service to process legal immigration applications in a timely manner. USCIS uses horribly antiquated systems for processing applications. So antiquated, in fact, they are still tracking immigration applications using paper and sending them around the country with the U.S. Postal Service. 
   Every customer of a major bank in this country can track his or her accounts, payments, and transactions on line in real time. But the Federal Government is still using stone age technology, or paper age, rather, when it comes to the basic functioning of granting citizenship. 
   Take, for instance, a constituent of mine, Mete Adan. Mete Adan actually was born in Turkey. He spent 16 years trying to become a United States citizen the right way, the legal way. 
   My office has worked with him for a number of years in fact, helping him through this bureaucratic process and cutting through this outdated redtape. But due to the inefficiency of the current system, which processes over 7 million immigration applications per year using paper printouts, Mete's case has been a 2 1/2 -year debacle marked by mistakes, errors and blunders. 
   The amendment I am offering today would prevent this sort of horror from continuing to happen in the future. 
   A few years ago, USCIS embarked on a major technological overhaul for how it handles the millions of immigration applications it receives every year. The problem, though, is that they are not really putting this into place fast enough. That is why I am proposing that we take $30 million and apply it to carrying out the strategic information transformation through USCIS. 
   Their plan includes on-line accounts that Federal agencies and applicants themselves can use to track their immigration status as it moves through the initial application process, to background checks, to adjudication and to final approval. It is a very commonsense way for us to track immigration applications. 
   Beyond that, what we have to understand is USCIS estimates that it handles 7 million immigration applications using paper today. We should use Information Age technology to make sure that we have a fair process for those seeking to come to our country, and thereby reducing illegal immigration in the process. 
   But the bulk of those 7 million applications, applications for citizenship and non-immigration residency, require up to 11 different forms apiece. That means the USCIS has to handle tens of millions of forms annually just to keep track of the people currently in the system. That is why there are just reported 15,000 pending cases from the 1986 amnesty plan passed by Congress and enacted into law. That is right, 21 years later there are still more than 15,000 unresolved cases. 
   If we want people to immigrate to the United States legally and come to our country without sneaking across our border or breaking our laws or coming under the cover of darkness, then we must remove the barriers of illegal immigration. 
   The $30 million I am proposing to devote to the USCIS strategic transformation will significantly aid that process. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McHENRY. I certainly appreciate it. I thank my friend and colleague for yielding. I agree with you. USCIS should be fee-based and continue to be fee-based. However, in discussions with them, I realize we have a severe problem and they're not going to actually put in place this plan until 2013. And so the time frame I don't think is fast enough, and I think that is very deserving for us to appropriate funds so we can actually have a more efficient process. 
   No matter where you are on the immigration debate, whether you want amnesty or border security, this actually is a pretty sensible thing from both sides.

And so I would like to start that process, give them the money to begin earlier on moving to the information age.

   And the American people should be proud because finally conservatives are returning to their roots and talking about restraining government spending.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to offer this amendment under this semi-open rule. 
   My amendment is simple and straightforward; and I know that is always a misnomer in this place. But it is simple and straightforward. It holds pension funds accountable to their member shareholders for their proxy votes. 
   Really, the intent I believe the bill's sponsors had is for transparency, so shareholders can actually have their voices heard, and they are transparent in their corporate voting structure. 
   This amendment requires a shareholder who is casting a nonbinding advisory vote to disclose to their beneficiaries whether such vote was cast to approve or disapprove the compensation. 
   As we well know, pension funds hold stocks for others. I think it is important that the managers of those pension funds disclose to the actual owners of those retirement funds, those pension funds, how their managers cast their votes. And if the purpose of the Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act is to attain a greater level of accountability to shareholders, then my amendment simply must be adopted in order to fulfill that. 
   Union leadership or pension fund leadership should have to inform their shareholders how they cast votes on their behalf. I think that is a matter of openness and transparency. 
   As Members of Congress, this issue should hit close to home. Do you believe your constituents back home, the people you represent, should know how you vote? Well, that is exactly what we are offering here today, what I am offering in this amendment. It is a very commonsense thing about disclosure to those that it actually affects. Voting against my amendment sends a clear message to your constituents that you value secrecy over transparency. 
   Why should only the mutual fund industry have to inform their shareholders how they cast their votes? So what we are doing is applying what is already done for mutual funds. Mutual funds are required to disclose to the owners of that mutual fund how the leadership, the management, casts proxy votes; and in this instance, it would be operational. They would have to disclose to their owners how they cast a vote. 
   Well, let's apply that to the pension fund. Let's apply that to union pension funds, let's apply that to State-managed pension funds. I think it is a reasonable thing. 
   What I find disturbing, though, is in some ways you are allowing activist shareholders to participate in this vote without actually having to disclose to those that own the pension funds, to those who actually own the stocks in this case, how they vote. I think it is a matter of disclosure, and it is what is necessary and fair. 
   Political groups like big labor and huge pension funds will have the power to ransom business leaders with their votes. But what we are trying to do is hold them accountable for their actions and activities, and ensure that those people who own those stocks and have a financial interest in the pension fund have an idea of what their management is doing. 
   Look, if we don't do this, it will create a situation where critical business decisions are being made by those least prepared to make them. In the name of fairness, transparency and accountability, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. 
   Now I don't want to misstate what the chairman said when I offered this during committee and what some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said, but in many respects, they like the intent of this, and I know that the chairman is trying to keep this, his original bill, free and clear of any amendments. I understand that. I certainly understand that. But I think this is a proper addition to ensure that shareholders truly understand what those who are controlling their votes actually are doing. I think it is a necessary and proper thing to do. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to especially listen to the explanation of this motion to recommit, because some of them voted for a similar motion to recommit just weeks ago on this House floor. 
   This motion to recommit is very simple. It says that Federal funding cannot under this provision of this bill go to anyone who has been found guilty of a felony or has pleaded no contest. If you vote against this motion to recommit, you are saying to your constituents back home that you don't care if these Federal funds go to convicted murderers, rapists, or kidnappers for that matter.     
   Mr. Speaker, the new Speaker of the House pledged to have the most ethical Congress in our Nation's history. If you vote for this motion to recommit, you are sending a message that you are willing to reward good behavior by supporting ethical oversight of taxpayer funds. 
   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. The RECOVER Act is another massive Democrat spending spree. That is why I am opposed to it. The Congressional Budget Office states that the Democrats' bill will cost the Federal taxpayers $562 million over the next 6 years. It makes government bigger while creating new programs, positions and offices. It expands the role of government in people's lives. 
   But I think we owe our taxpayers the common courtesy of saying these funds should not go to felons. And while I and many of my colleagues in the House are at odds with the Democrats' ideology of big government is good government, we all can agree that kidnappers should not receive Federal funds under this bill here today. 
   And in this motion to recommit, we fix this error in the Democrats' drawing up of this bill; this omission that the Democrats have permitted to be in this bill here today before us. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this motion to recommit and reassure your constituents you actually care where their taxpayer dollars are going. 
   And for those Democrats who voted for a similar motion to recommit on the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act of 2007 just a few weeks ago, for those on the other side of the aisle, the 55 Democrats who voted for the motion to recommit on the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act of 2007, they will recognize the language of this motion to recommit. It is very similar. It says, felons cannot receive these Federal funds. Felons, such as murderers, rapists, kidnappers, those are the type of people who would not be eligible for funds under this act, and I encourage those same 55 Democrats to cross the aisle and work in a bipartisan way to fix a Democrat mistake. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague and friend from Arizona for offering this amendment. It gives me an opportunity to explain the importance of this project and this funding to the Members of this body. 
   I am actually very much in favor of transparency through the appropriations process. I have spoken a number of times here on the House floor about that. I think it is important that Members can judge for themselves the funds that we are spending as the Federal Government. It is a very serious business we are in of spending taxpayer dollars, and I don't take that lightly. 
   I am thankful for the opportunity to talk about the Mitchell County Development Foundation and the problems and challenges that Mitchell County is going through, but their hope and the solution they are putting forward. 
   Mitchell County, as the amendment sponsor mentions, is a very hard-hit county. If you look at this graph of manufacturing jobs in North Carolina, we have been hard hit over the last 20 years in the loss of manufacturing jobs due to Federal trade agreements, to a large degree. We are going through a transition period of manufacturing jobs in North Carolina. 
   Furthermore, in Mitchell County, which was a manufacturing county, you can look at this listing of the job losses they have had over the last 10 years. In the last 5 years, Mitchell County has lost 2,500 jobs. Now, that may not seem like much to big city folks, but to a small, rural Appalachian county with a workforce of 7,500 people, it is devastating. It is absolutely devastating. 
   When you are in a rural community, you have to figure out ways to innovate, to actually keep your people making a living. What Mitchell County has done through their development foundation is come up with a way to do that, to take these craftsmen who worked in textiles and furniture, to actually help them create a small business. And through this project, 51 small businesses have been created, two-thirds in my district. 
   But this is a small, rural county, and they are trying to do the best they can through an innovative process. This small amount of Federal money will help them in a number of ways, such as access other grants and bring in more knowledge about this process and about what is happening in this county, to bring more funding and resources to bear for this county.     
   Mitchell County has the third highest unemployment rate in the State of North Carolina. It has a 38 percent dropout rate in their high schools. And what they're trying to do through this business incubator is create small businesses so that those unemployed can find employment. Beyond that, they are also trying to use the resources that they gain from selling their products to provide scholarships for these high school students, to encourage them to stay in school. This is a good project and is a worthy use of Federal taxpayer dollars and I'm proud to stand in the well of this House and to defend this and tell my colleagues that it's worthwhile for the taxpayers to spend this money. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I retain the balance of my time.

   Mr. McHENRY. I thank the chairman. 
   To close on this matter, Laura Bush, the First Lady, decides what the theme is for the White House Christmas, and she decided this last Christmas it would be the Year of the Perfect Christmas Tree, the Gloria Houston book that we're discussing here. Gloria Houston, who grew up in the mountains of western North Carolina, my district, who gave her book to this community for their business incubator, and it's unfortunate that there's so much discussion here on the House floor about this business incubator, but it does bring to light what is important for this community. 
   Laura Bush, the First Lady, said at the time: ``This is a very wonderful American story. They all worked together, the people in the town, to figure out a new industry for themselves.'' 
   I'm trying to assist in that and I think the taxpayers should assist in that. And I'll tell you why. Mitchell County has been broken by trade agreements made here by the Federal Government. And when the Federal Government breaks it, they should help fix it. And that's all we're trying to do. This small amount of taxpayer dollars can help enormously.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, when a dam breaks, the first action you must take is to stop the flow, to plug the hole. And the same rule applies to illegal immigration. 
   There are as many as 15 to 20 million illegal aliens in this country today, and we realize the dam is broken. To fix it, we have got to start with border security and enforcement first. 
   The SAVE Act, which helps fix the dam by hiring 8,000 more border guards and using military equipment for border security, is a good bill. By strengthening workplace enforcement, it dries up easy access to American jobs and stems the tide of illegal immigration. 
   Despite broad bipartisan support, and even a Democrat sponsor of this bill, the liberal leadership of this House won't bring this up for a vote because they prefer amnesty and government tax dollar giveaways, not real border security. 
   I ask them to stop playing political games with our immigration policy and with our national security and bring this bill up for a vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (SAFETEA-LU TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me this time. 
   The trial lawyers have an uncanny way of making their living. Although the title of this legislation is a technical corrections bill, one glaring technical correction that needs to be made is left out. 
   As the ranking member said earlier tonight, the original SAFETEA-LU bill amended the definition of a commercial motor vehicle to exclude vehicles 10,000 pounds and less. The Department of Transportation had never issued regulations of this type of vehicle, which is essentially a small van or something smaller. It seemed to clear up the books and just make sense when it was done at the time. All too often what seems to be a simple idea ends up having much more significant consequences. 
   What was considered a cleaning up of the books turned out to be a dramatic shift in labor law. The Fair Labor Standards Act exempts drivers of vehicles that can be regulated by the Secretary of Transportation. The definitional change of a commercial vehicle unwittingly brought a whole new class of employee under that act. 
   In writing the provision, neither Congress nor the administration intended to fundamentally alter our national labor policies, but that is exactly what happened. 
   What are the consequences? As I said, the trial lawyers have an uncanny ability to find sources to make money off of. Companies across the country that believed that their business model was and is perfectly legal because it had been may get a knock on the door from their friendly neighborhood trial lawyer informing them that they are now liable for overtime wages dating back to August 15, 2005, when SAFETEA-LU was signed into law. 
   Congress didn't know what they had done. The administration didn't know  they had done this. How can we expect a small delivery service or some satellite dish installer or plumber to know that their business model is no longer viable? 
   No one will argue that people aren't entitled to a fair and equitable, appropriate wage, but if we are going to significantly alter national labor law, we should have a full and open debate and we should do it intentionally, not by accident and not by trial lawyers. I think that is the one glaring omission from this act. If we would fix that, we would have a number of employers from around this country who would be safe from more trial lawyer, frivolous lawsuits. 
   Shouldn't we ensure that companies are held liable? Sure, but we should do it as a Congress in a knowing way, a way that is befitting of this body, not by accident. We should not make them pay for our Congress' mistakes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Texas (Mr. Sessions) yielding time to me. 
   As a member of the Budget Committee, we worked very hard to craft a budget that was reasonable in previous Congresses and in this Congress as well. And I want to congratulate the ranking member on the Budget Committee, Mr. Ryan from Wisconsin, on his hard work, and I also want to congratulate my colleague to the south, in South Carolina, for his leadership as chairman of the Budget Committee. But I respectfully disagree on this budget, and I will tell you why. The  Democrats are poised to pass a $217 billion tax increase on the American people. This is the second largest tax increase in American history. 
   A quick history lesson here. You might be wondering who holds the record for the largest tax increase. A Democrat Congress and President Bill Clinton, and they raised taxes by $241 billion in 1993, one year before the 1994 Republican revolution. 
   Back to the present day, though. The American people should know, when Democrats spend too much and future surpluses fail to materialize, a second tax hike triggers automatically. Therefore, the $217 billion tax hike could nearly double to $400 billion. In other words, the Democrats will eclipse Bill Clinton's record for the largest tax increase in American history. It is outrageous, and the American people need to know that. The Democrats said that they would raise taxes, and they actually are doing it, and as part of this $2.9 trillion Federal budget, again, the largest spending bill ever passed by Congress. So it is not just the largest tax increase, but it is the largest spending piece as well. It shows their priorities, that they actually want to take more from the American people. 
   Their tired old philosophy ignores the fact that tax receipts this month were $70 billion above the same month in 2006. Tax cuts have worked. In fact, this year government revenue is the highest it has ever been in the history of our country. Let me repeat that. The revenue to the Federal Government is the largest it has ever been in the history of our country. And, in fact, there is more government revenue coming in to our Federal Treasury this year than any time in the Earth's history for any government, period. 
   Yet, it is not enough for the Democrats. They want to spend more, they want to tax more, they want every American to pay more in taxes, and they are going to do it through this budget. 
   And that is why, Mr. Speaker, I think this tax and spend, tax and spend, tax and spend policy of the Democrat Party is the wrong thing for our economy, it is the wrong thing for our communities, it is the wrong thing for small business people who will be paying more taxes. It is wrong for the single mother who is trying to make ends meet, it is wrong for the American people and our economy. And that is why we should vote down this rule and vote down this budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Texas for yielding. I want to thank my colleague across the aisle for his informative discussion. I respect him immensely. I appreciate him laying out his arguments against my amendment.  
   What I would say is that we both have the same intent, affordable housing for as many Americans as possible. That should be the intent with this legislation, and I think it does, in terms of the reforms implemented for the government-sponsored enterprises that we are talking about today. The concern that I have is that, in essence, we are going to be taxing the middle class, and those that are on, let's say, lower middle class, which the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie and Freddie were provided to provide liquidity in the marketplace. 
   We are going to be taxing those mortgages to pass it on to people who, you said, don't have money. So it's a transfer from that middle-class group to some folks that are on the edges of society. 
   My concern with that is that rather than us designing programs to bring them into the mortgage marketplace, so that they can provide for themselves, that this simply will supplement additional government programs and further lock people into receiving government money, rather than receiving a help out. 
   So my concern is that we are going to be taxing those that can really afford to deal with additional taxes.

   I know many of you all believe in that on your side of the aisle, some, probably, on my side of the aisle. But my point is, I don't think we should tax them. With this 1.2 basis points on a portfolio is, in fact, a tax.

If you are taxing the profits on Fannie and Freddie as originally designed, you can make the contention that you are taxing the shareholders of Fannie and Freddie. 
   But, with this design of the current bill before us, if, in fact, you believe in affordable housing, and encouraging more people into the middle class and moving people up, then what we need to do is ensure that we are not decreasing the affordability.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I want to start by commending the ranking member, SPENCER BACHUS, and the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Frank, for the open dialogue that we've had in the Financial Services Committee and here on the floor. This amendment process I think has been a healthy one, and I appreciate the chairman engaging in this debate.  
   The amendment that I offer today builds on an amendment offered and passed in the committee during markup, which I participated in and which I voted for the amendments as well. It requires a GAO study to investigate the Affordable Housing Fund's effects on availability and affordability of credit for home buyers. That's what the amendment added to the bill. 
   Essentially the GAO study will tell if the costs of the funds are being passed on to home buyers. Some of us on this side of the aisle, many free market conservatives, believe that what is deemed the Affordable Housing Fund, the Housing Trust Fund, will be passed on straight to the mortgage consumers of America; in essence, a tax increase on those who have mortgages, especially middle income individuals. 
   My amendment takes what is in the bill and goes it one step further. If, as a result of the GAO's report, the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency determines that the Affordable Housing Fund is increasing mortgage costs for consumers, my amendment suspends the assessment of Freddie and Fannie. I think this is a healthy thing. 
   As the bill stands, Freddie and Fannie will allocate an amount equal to 1.2 basis points of their total portfolio to the fund for fiscal years 2007 through 2011. Over these 5 years, the fund will accumulate an estimated $3 billion for the purposes of these housing initiatives. But Fannie and Freddie are publicly traded companies, and as someone who analyzed the economics of this, I'm concerned that a 1.2 basis point assessment of the total portfolio will simply be a 1.2 percent tax increase on those that have mortgages. 
   And what I want to make sure is those costs are not going to be passed on to the consumer. What I'm concerned about is that it will be a mortgage tax increase, and that is the reason why I have concerns about the housing fund as it now stands. 
   So what my amendment does is alleviate those concerns, and if my amendment passes, I think it would be far easier to accept the housing fund as it now stands, and that is my big concern with the bill. 
   I want to commend the chairman for putting in much-needed reforms to Fannie and Freddie and the government-sponsored enterprises, and we want to make sure that middle income Americans, middle income home buyers will be able to have affordable access to mortgages. That's what Fannie and Freddie are there for. We want to make sure that this does not raise and increase the cost of home buying. 
   I would ask my colleagues to support my simple amendment that would alleviate some concerns that we, on this side of the aisle, a few on this side of the aisle, have with this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to vote for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to honor the life and memory of Adam Klutz, a Caldwell County Sheriff's Deputy. 
   On September 19, Deputy Klutz was responding to a 911 call. Arriving on the scene of a suspected domestic violence situation, Deputy Klutz was fatally shot. 
   We send our deepest sympathies to Adam's parents--William and Sheila--and to his entire family. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. 
   Adam Klutz was mature beyond his mere 25 years. Two weeks prior, two of Deputy Klutz' fellow officers were shot and wounded. Despite being a rookie officer, Deputy Klutz was tasked with delivering the news of the shooting to the wife of one of the wounded officers. Adam's professionalism and compassion in handling such a difficult situation was praised by the officer and his wife, earning Deputy Klutz a letter of commendation. 
   The letter reads, in part, ``For an officer only having a year and a half of experience, he acted like a seasoned veteran. It was a testament to his character. We should be proud to work alongside Deputy Klutz.'' 
   Five months earlier, Adam came to the aid of a fellow officer who had been injured in a vehicle chase. Hickory Police Officer Vic Camacho said, ``Adam was my guardian angel. The Lord was preparing him to be the best angel he could be, and anybody who knew him knew Adam was the best person he could be.'' 
   Adam Klutz's friends and colleagues remember him as a brave and honorable young man, defined by his service to the community and by his faith in Our Lord Jesus Christ. 
   Speaking at his funeral, Reverend John Bell of the Philadelphia Lutheran Church said of Adam, ``He lived in a way that touched so many lives. He lived in a way that made a difference. He lived with the understanding that his vocation was a calling and that, through his faithfulness, through his service, he would bring the power of God's kingdom a little closer to people. If you want to honor Adam, honor his commitment to service; honor the strength of his faith.'' 
   This evening, Madam Speaker, I ask that we do just that, that we honor the amazing life of a real patriot, of a real citizen, and that we honor the life and memory of Deputy Sheriff Adam Klutz of Caldwell County. 
   May God rest his soul.

Partial-birth abortion is unrivaled in its gruesome brutality. There is no question it has caused the vicious destruction of viable, living, breathing babies whose only crime is inconvenience. 
   The court's decision is a victory in the quest to restore the dignity of human life. No longer will the most vulnerable and innocent among us be subject to such cruelty as partial-birth abortion. 
   It is also a victory for the Constitution, Mr. Speaker, which liberal activist judges have demeaned for far too long. It is encouraging to see the court's decision move towards our Founders' vision, a vision rooted in the commitment to not only protect, but to also respect human life. 
   While this is a step forward, it is only one victory in the longer struggle to assure that the abolition of abortion altogether is achieved. Let us never forget our responsibility to hold the basic sanctity granted to us by our Maker.

Therefore, it is not operational over the violation that I am stating in section 101. Therefore, under the legislation here, it is not operational. Therefore, it is a very crafty way, and I have got to compliment the gentleman for putting together a very crafty piece of legislation to try to slip this by. But under these House rules, this is a clear violation of the anti-earmarking provision that is very important to the rules of debate, even when the minority is not able to offer any amendments, even when the minority has no other means of removing congressional earmarks.

   When unemployment nearly quadrupled in 5 years, my constituents there banded together to build a better future. They recognize that an educated workforce is the key to economic growth, so they developed a plan to ensure that all high school graduates in the county have the opportunity to go to the local community college for a 2-year degree. Western Piedmont Community College is that college where they are offering it. 
   Through the hard work of Arrick Gordon and the Burke Alliance for Youth, the Burke Education Endowment Program is nearly at that goal. This weekend, the Overmountain Jamboree and Barbecue Cookoff, which will combine two powerful forces, North Carolina barbecue and country music, will be held this weekend in Morganton, and that will raise the final sum needed to provide that much-needed education to the local youth. It shows the strength of the community, and it shows the strength of the people of North Carolina.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague for yielding time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to start by thanking the chairman, Mr. Frank, for engaging in, as he always does, a really great debate, and I agree with his idea here but I disagree with the principle that he's using to achieve it by expanding and creating a new government program. 
   The HOME program, the gentleman before me just spoke of, provides a very similar application of funds, $2 billion a year, to help with rental assistance and affordable housing. Rather than fixing this program and improving it, they are creating a whole other program. 
   And, as I said, I disagree with the principle on the size and scope of government and government's role, but Mr. Chairman, there's a common thread running through the agenda of this new Democrat majority, and that common thread is that there's a massive expansion of government. If government is not needed, they will add a little government intervention, and if there's already too much government intervention, they will just expand it even more. 
   The bill we're debating falls squarely into the second category. The bill, so  far as I can tell, is all about more government control of this process. Rather than using the marketplace to improve the affordability of homes, they're creating another government program which redistributes money, in fact, a tax on every mortgage in this country, and then redistribute it to those through a government program. It makes no sense to create another duplicative program. 
   As my colleague from Alabama said, there are already over 30 affordable housing programs within the government. Most of those programs do not, in fact, build houses, but they give rental assistance. They give assistance so people can buy their first home. They give assistance in a number of different categories, but the Federal Government doesn't build homes. We have to allow the private sector to do that, which is what I think is most important. 
   But what is especially true in light of the fact that this bill we're debating today creates a new program that is nearly identical to one already existing, the HOME program, which, as I said earlier, is a $2-billion-a-year program, let's fix that program. Let's look at market-based incentives to allow people to afford housing. Let's allow the marketplace to work rather than create another government program, and that's why we should vote against this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague from Washington State for yielding. 
   The question today is about the rule dealing with the Chesapeake Bay. Well, this is a piece of legislation that is not  controversial. The House can deal with this measure very quickly and move on. Instead, the Democrat leadership has chosen a very cumbersome process that locks out amendments, that locks out new ideas dealing with the Chesapeake Bay, and takes up a significant amount of time in the people's House. 
   What we should be spending our time on, however, in this House of Representatives is not a piece of noncontroversial legislation which will take up over 2 hours of our day. Instead, we should devote this time to bringing down the cost and the price of gasoline at the pumps. That is what the American people want. That is what my constituents in Western North Carolina are demanding, that we take action on high gas prices. 
   We have a need and necessity for oil in this country. It is not something that I sought, but this is a life I was born into. We have had our economy powered by oil for about the last 100 years. It is just a fact. I think there will be a day when we can move to some other type of power to move our automobiles and trucks and planes. I am hopeful for that day. That day will happen and I will be fighting for policies to bring it about. But until that time comes, we must have sources of American energy, and we must be energy independent in America. We can't be beholden to the Saudi royal family for our price at the pumps; but, unfortunately, we are. 
   And why is that? Well, it is because of a significant number of policies that this Congress has put in place, very cumbersome regulations that we need to streamline when we come to the issue of building new refineries. And let's face it, we need new refineries to get diesel and unleaded fuel to the pumps. That also equals jobs. Unfortunately, in this country we have to import refined products. That means we have outsourced jobs. That means we have also sent our wealth overseas to these Nations that are refining product. 
   But beyond refineries which we must build, we also have to increase domestic production, American energy sources. And we have got significant American energy resources. The known reserves that we have in this country of oil will power 60 million automobiles for 60 years. Now, that is not a long-term solution, but it is certainly good for the next 60 years while we are building alternatives and different types of power sources. 
   So we also need that American energy production, whether it is oil, natural gas, coal. We have more coal in this United States, enough power source out of that coal than Saudi Arabia has. Actually, we have three times the amount of coal in this country as Saudi Arabia has oil. So these are not perfect solutions, but they will work in the short term. 
   But why are we at this state? Why are we at this place where we are paying almost $4 at the pump?

   Mr. McHENRY. This is what I am talking about, and I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia asking. The reason we have high gas prices is because there is inaction by Democrat leadership. They don't want new refineries. They don't want American energy production. They want to simply conserve our way into energy independence. That is not possible. The American people know it is not possible, and I ask the Democrat leadership to yield to common sense and ask us to create more American energy so we can be energy independent.

   Mr. McHENRY. I appreciate the gentleman from Washington yielding me time so I can answer the gentleman's question. 
   I think this is a very interesting argument, alternatives. Well, so far in our power resources in the United States, 1 percent of our current power is produced by the types of things the gentleman is talking about. They are very expensive currently. The technology is very expensive. 
   So the gentleman is saying we can take that 1 percent, and let's say we can double it in the next 10 years, which is an ambitious proposal that some on your side have advocated and actually I am for. That takes us to 2 percent of American energy production. 
   What we need while we are doing that is actually reasonable solutions, and that means increasing supply.     
   The American people understand basic economics, unlike some on the other side of the aisle. They understand basic economics, that it is supply and demand that control price.

   Mr. McHENRY. Madam Speaker, American energy independence is important. Let's face it, we simply cannot conserve our way to energy independence. 
   Conservation is a sign of personal virtue, but it will not lead to American energy independence. The way we can move to energy independence is by increasing our supply and increasing our refining capacity, increasing our investments in renewable energy sources, increasing our focus on conservation. All those things can work. 
   Instead, this Democrat Congress is focused on naming months, naming weeks, naming days. In fact, we have had 125 resolutions recognizing various days, weeks and months, including Frank Sinatra Day. I love Frank, but he's not going to take us to American energy independence. National Train Day, National Plumbing Industry Week, but where is National Energy Independence Day?

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Madam Speaker, I am confident the only thing worse than having to pay taxes is figuring out how to fill out the forms to pay taxes. As Albert Einstein said: ``The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.'' He was right. It is 16,485 pages. Our income tax is an outrage, an outrage long in need of reform and simplification. 
   Last week Republicans introduced an alternative to this outrage. The Taxpayer Choice Act does what it says. It gives taxpayers a choice between all the headaches of the current tax system or a highly simplified alternative tax. It simplifies the process for taxpayers and gives them what they deserve, a transparent, efficient, simple and fair Tax Code and completely eliminates AMT tax and makes permanent the capital gains and dividends tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. 
   Madam Speaker, it is long time that we pass fundamental tax reform and give taxpayers the choice, the Taxpayer Choice Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (HONORING SENATOR JESSE HELMS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, this evening, I rise with a heavy heart to honor the life of former Senator Jesse Alexander Helms, Jr., of North Carolina. Senator Helms served from 1972 to 2002, 30 years in the United States Senate, tying the longest-serving Senator from North Carolina in that record. 
   Senator Helms was known to most Americans as a rock-rib conservative, both committed to a smaller, more efficient government that taxes less and spends less, and also a social conservative who would stand up to the common society of the day that was allowing for many permissive activities. 
   Senator Helms was much more than that, though. He was an ardent anti-communist, and supported freedom around the world against the tyranny of communism. Senator Helms has a very distinguished record in the United States Senate spanning three decades. 
   He was known as the strongest conservative in the United States Senate in his time, one of the best known American conservatives of his time. But what many people don't realize is that in 1976, just 4 years into his first term in the United States Senate, Senator Helms did a very bold thing, he endorsed Governor Ronald Reagan in his primary for President against Gerald Ford. Senator Helms was the only Senator to endorse Reagan in 1976. 
   Although then-Governor Reagan had not won any primaries coming into the North Carolina primary, Senator Helms put his full campaign organization behind Governor Reagan. And in an upset victory, Governor Reagan beat sitting President Gerald Ford in that Republican primary, the first primary that Reagan won in 1976. 
   Historians note that without winning the North Carolina primary, Ronald Reagan may not have had the opportunity to be President in 1980. He may not have had the ability to continue his campaign going into the convention in 1976. So for Americans who know Reagan, they should thank Senator Helms and his bold move in endorsing Governor Reagan. 
   Beyond that, in his final term in office, the world came to him. He didn't change his principles, he didn't change the things that he was focused on, but he took the opportunity to reform the U.N., working with Senator Joe Biden of Delaware. The Helms-Biden agreement called on the U.N. to reduce its budget and define its mission. It also forced a much-needed review of all U.N. policies. It was a large reform, and Senator Biden said at the time, ``Just as only Nixon could go to China, only Helms could fix the U.N.'' 
   Just after that in 2000, Helms was the first U.S. lawmaker to address the U.N. Security Council. That is an amazing tribute to his leadership. He was not simply ``Senator No,'' he was voted as the ``Nicest Lawmaker in Congress.'' 
   What people know about him was the personal touch he had with people. My  first political memory was in 1984 as a 9-year-old going to a Helms-Reagan rally. That is my first political memory. Beyond that when I was a high school student, I stopped into Jesse Helms' office and he took a few minutes to sit and talk with me, take a picture with me at his desk, and showed me around his office. And I realized once I became a lawmaker how very short time is here on Capitol Hill, and for him to give me that moment is a special memory that I will always cherish. 
   Our thoughts and prayers are with the Helms family, and his wife, Dot. 
   At this time I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hayes).

Bigger than the economies of China, bigger than the economy of Britain, bigger than the economy of Germany. Just the Federal budget is larger than all of those economies. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle, I want to ask them this question: Out of $2.9 trillion, can't you trim enough money to stop impending tax increases on the middle class and every American in this country, rather than proposing new tax increases? Unfortunately, the actions of this Congress say no, that the Democrat majority is intent on raising taxes in order to grow and expand this rather large and bloated Federal Government. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it's important the American people know what the Democrats in Congress are intending to do, and that is to raise taxes and grow government.

   Mr. McHENRY. Madam Speaker, tonight we had a bipartisan vote to suspend deposits in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It's a great bipartisan vote. I join with my Democrat colleagues in supporting this legislation. The reason why it works is because it decreases the amount of consumption of oil here in the United States, thereby bringing prices down because it's the control of supply and demand. 
   Well, likewise, I would ask my Democrat colleagues to join with me in increasing domestic production and refining capacity here in the United States, which is another way to bring prices down for our consumers. We can do this in a bipartisan way.

Rewind to 1993, the last time the Democrats had control of this House Chamber, and what did they do? They proposed the largest tax increase in American history. They're one-upping their own history. 
   It's amazing, Mr. Speaker. That means 115 million Americans will see taxes increased on average by $1,795. This isn't chump change. It's real money to the American people. 
   And why do Democrats feel they're entitled to this money? Because that's what they do. They're Democrats. They tax. They spend. It's not a new idea. They've been at it for 70 years. If it weren't so infuriating, it would just simply be so sad.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague. 
   Madam Speaker, today the House Democrats continue their abuse of power. They are pushing forward a measure to allow the territory Delegates, nonvoting Members of Congress traditionally, actually, not Members of Congress on a technical basis because they don't represent States, their constituents don't pay Federal income taxes, they are going to allow these individuals to cast votes and even preside when the Chamber meets. So let's have a quick Q&A on this; let's talk questions and answers here. 
   Why would the Democrats do this? Because 80 percent of the territory Delegates are, hold for an answer here, they are Democrats. They want to cushion their numbers. Why is this an abuse of power? Well, there is this little thing we Americans call the Constitution. It says, ``The House shall be comprised of Members chosen by the people of the several States,'' not territories, not mayors of cities allowed to vote on this House floor, not any individual, but ``comprised of Members chosen by the people of the several States,'' not non-State territories. But plainly the Democrats are cushioning their numbers and abusing their power. 
   The Democrats' power grab is a continuation of the abusive policies and actions they have taken since day one in this institution. Since day one they have shut down all debate. Since day one they have shut down the committee process. They held open a vote to change the outcome because they were losing on the vote. They ran through the Speaker's special interest project affectionately known as TunaGate, and all without fulfilling their pledge of working a 5-day week. In fact, in 3 weeks we only worked 40 hours in this House. That is a new Democrat majority, that is a continuation of the abuse of power. 
   What we have to do today is vote down this legislation that is, first, unconstitutional, and second, an abuse of power by the Democrat majority. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. I thank the ranking member for yielding time, and I appreciate his leadership and friendship on the committee. He has worked very hard on this issue, as has the whole committee. But we have come to different conclusions on this. 
   I think there are some admirable parts of this legislation. In particular, the addition that the ranking member was able to make in consultation with the chairman on licensing of mortgage brokers. I think that is helpful and positive and makes consumers more aware of people they are dealing with. 
   I also believe the Green-McHenry-Neugebauer amendment that we were able to put in place in the committee is very help to the marketplace. It gives borrowers more understanding of the financial product they are about to take part in, the financial transaction they are about to take part of in. I think informed consumers are better off than uninformed consumers. Financial literacy is key; and, therefore, the process of counseling which is within this bill is helpful. 
   But in the end, this is about homeownership. It is about the opportunity for families to get a home of their choosing. It is about families making a financial decision for themselves, not Washington, D.C. telling them what products they can and cannot get. Unfortunately, that is what this bill does. 
   This bill will limit homeownership and limit the opportunities that families have by limiting the mortgage choices in the private sector and in the marketplace. 
   Furthermore, it does nothing to fix the current crisis we are in. Let me repeat that: this bill will do nothing to fix the current mortgage crisis we are facing. In fact, rather, it will deepen the crisis we are facing by limiting people's opportunities to refinance or finance their home. 
   Let me give you a couple of examples. This bill I believe will encourage more litigation and have a chilling effect on the secondary markets. Therefore, less money will be available for people to get mortgages. 
   Second, it will limit the loan terms available. In fact, it limits the ability for people to finance the points and fees and closing costs of many mortgage products and bans prepayment penalties. 
   So, in essence, if somebody currently has a prepayment penalty in their mortgage that they have and they seek refinancing, they will be unable to finance that prepayment penalty that they currently have, thereby locking them into a cycle of debt and foreclosure. 
   I believe this bill is harmful to long-term homeownership in America that is at an all-time high. I think what we should be doing is encouraging homeownership in this country and making more opportunities available to get the credit that they need in order to get a home for their families. 
   So I oppose this bill on very simple grounds: that it will limit homeownership and limit the opportunities and options that Americans have. With that, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill and help homeownership in America.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, the amendment I offer today is really the crux of this debate that we are having here on the House floor on how to best take on the mortgage crisis that we are facing as a country. 
   This is a very substantive debate. I think it is a very legitimate debate for the House to have, about how we approach the mortgage marketplace and ensure that individuals, families, can still access credit so they can actually get a home for themselves and their children. 
   Now, the issue at hand is title III of the bill, the so-called North Carolina standard, put forward by my colleagues from North Carolina, Mr. Watt and Mr. Miller. What, in essence, they do is make all subprime loans HOEPA loans. These are really high-cost loans, so-called innovative loans. 
   What this does is make all subprime loans HOEPA loans, and, as the Comptroller of the Currency said in a recent hearing before the Financial Services Committee, ``It is fair to say that in the past HOEPA loans were viewed as so extreme that few institutions provided HOEPA loans because it was such a rigorous and, what is the word, a scarlet letter of sorts that people wouldn't make the loans. So when you look at our home loan registry, for example, you don't find many HOEPA loans anymore.'' 
   Well, there were 10 million mortgages let in 2006. Only 15,200 were HOEPA loans. A very small percentage. 
   In essence, what title III of this bill does is it, in essence, eliminates the subprime marketplace in America. What it does in North Carolina, it has curtailed refinancing and initial financing in the subprime marketplace. This is very harmful to individuals and families. 
   With that, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, let me quote Congressman Miller from our recent subprime markup in Financial Services. ``Yes, there are fewer loans being made in North Carolina,'' is the reference. ``That is also an intended consequence of reform. This is the heart of the bill.'' 
   The statistics for North Carolina, amongst subprime lenders there is a decline of 8.1 percent in the last 5 years. In comparison States, there was a growth of 1 percent of prime lending. In comparison States, loans by subprime lenders increased by 4.6 percent, and loans made in North Carolina decreased, subprime loans, by 8.1 percent. There is a significant disparity there. 
   Furthermore, in refinancing in subprime loans in North Carolina, there was a decline of 11.4 percent. In comparable States, there was an increase of 4 percent. 
   It shows that there are fewer loans being made and less availability of credit in North Carolina because of the so-called North Carolina standard.

   Mr. McHENRY. Two additional points on my amendment here. It strikes title III, which bans rolling closing costs, points and fees into the financing of subprime mortgages, as well as eliminating prepayment penalties. So if someone currently has a prepayment penalty and they want to get out of this high-cost mortgage they currently have, and they seek to refinance their way into a more affordable mortgage, they would be prevented from rolling that prepayment penalty into the next loan. 
   So my contention is title III of this bill eliminates people's options and opportunities to refinance their way out of foreclosure and default. 
   So I would encourage my colleagues to vote for my amendment to strike I think the most egregious title within this bill.

   Mr. McHENRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Let me tell you one story in North Carolina. Ben Ingle is a mortgage broker at NBI Mortgage in Shelby, North Carolina. Ben was able to secure a loan for a woman who was a victim of domestic violence and a victim of her ex-husband's bad credit. Her ex-husband ruined her credit. In this process, she got out of an abusive relationship and wanted to have a home for her son and herself, but she had a tough time because of her credit situation. 
   Well, Ben was able to work with her over an extended period of time. In fact, when it was all said and done, under this legislation before us today, Ben would have been only able to make $4.16 an hour for the work that he did for this lady to qualify her for a loan.     
   Now, she is very happy to be in a loan today and have a mortgage today and have a home for her son. But what this bill does is harm our communities and I think our mortgage brokers that are doing the right thing. 
   At the end of the day, mortgage originators are a part of our community. They are community leaders oftentimes, and what we are trying to do is battle unscrupulous actors and have good protections for homeownership in America. 
   Title III of this bill would prevent this young lady from having the option to get the lending she needed for a home. This is about homeownership. I urge Members to vote for my amendment and vote against the bill.

   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague from Texas for yielding the time. 
   We're debating Amtrak. Well, certainly Amtrak's important for a lot of folks in the Northeast, but I will tell you as far as my constituents in western North Carolina, we can't commute to our jobs using Amtrak. This is not a solution for American energy independence that is being offered here on the House floor. 
   What is outrageous is as gas prices go above $4, all they have is blame rather than action. My Democrat colleagues are simply passing blame rather than trying to act in a constructive way. And there is a way for us to act as a Congress to bring down gas prices. It is not by lawsuits, which is what the Democrat majority wants; it is not by more taxation on those driving cars, those using energy resources, those producing resources. 
   You know, there is a way that we can act. The American people understand it. This is a question of supply and demand. Seventy percent of the price of fuel comes from the price of crude oil. The American people understand this as gas is over $4 a gallon, as a barrel of oil is over $130 a barrel. And I will tell you, we must act. 
   In order to lower gas prices, this Congress must act to increase supply. We have to increase refining capacity, and we have to do this in a constructive, reasonable, proper way. One day we will end our dependence on foreign oil. We will end it and we will use our alternative sources of energy. We will use domestic production. We will use refining capacity here in the United States. But let's talk about some important statistics here. 
   Seven hundred days ago the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said, Democrats have a commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing gas prices. What is the plan? Where's the action? We've seen nothing. The Democrat Whip, Jim Clyburn, said, Democrats have a plan to help curb rising gas prices. What have we seen? Nothing. Steny Hoyer, the Democrat leader, said, Democrats believe that we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with high gas prices. Now, all of this was said in an election year. What have we seen in the last 2 years from this Democrat Congress? Nothing. 
   Now, I will tell you it is not perfect. Not all Republicans support opening up ANWR. Not all Republicans support oil shale. Not all Republicans support increasing refinery capacity, but roughly 91 percent of Republicans support those issues while 86 percent of House Democrats oppose those actions. 
   I think it's time that we come together for a commonsense solution to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Conservation is a sign of personal virtue but is not a means to energy independence. We must act together.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for yielding. 
   The Speaker and I are on opposite sides of most issues, so I take great pleasure in the rare instance that we can find some common ground. The rule on this bill is one of those rare occasions. In fact, Speaker Pelosi and I completely agree when it comes to her public statements on the need for an open debate on lobbying reform. ``We urge you to immediately bring to the floor, under an open rule that permits unrestricted amendments and debate on the wide-ranging reform provisions contained in the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2006.'' 
   Madam Speaker, those were your words on February 9 of last year, but, Madam Speaker, I'm hearing a different tune these days. Your words are different than your actions. Very different, I might say. 
   We should be debating this bill today under an open rule that you urged that permits unrestricted amendments and debates. Unfortunately we won't. 
   There were 48 amendments offered to the Rules Committee. Only five were allowed to be offered here on the floor today. I submitted one of those 43 amendments that the Democrat leadership didn't want to hear on, didn't want to have a debate on, and my amendment would require Members of Congress to make an accurate disclosure of their financial holdings, including their personal residence. We've seen in recent Washington scandals the results of this loophole that allows Members to hide ownership of properties. This is a bad thing, and we should close that loophole. 
   Unfortunately, the Democrat leadership didn't allow us to have this debate here today on that important amendment. They're allowing it to stay open. 
   Another quick point. The American people should realize that we're debating essentially a watered-down version, as my colleague from California said, of the lobbying bill that Republicans offered last Congress. Only eight Democrats voted for that tougher bill to reform rogue lobbying practices; 192 voted no. 
   Mr. Speaker, does the Democrat hypocrisy know no bounds? Does it? At the time, they said the bill didn't go far enough. We realize they're singing a different tune, a tone-deaf tune, Mr. Speaker, and I urge the defeat of this rule so we can have an open debate on lobbying reform.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague and appreciate her leadership. 
   Leave it to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to make an inefficient program even more inefficient. By imposing these arbitrary and uncredited green standards, it will drive up construction costs. And in the end, that means we will have fewer units put out in this housing program. And it also delays the spending of the $1.3 billion HOPE VI surplus that we currently have. 
   I think it is a better use of the money to allow the Secretary to establish standards that are appropriate for the region, appropriate for the product being put out, and this gives the flexibility to do that. 
   What I would say is that the Capito amendment still allows for green standards, high, strong, green standards, but it does not impose arbitrary standards. It allows for a collaborative effort for this to go forward, and it strikes the right balance, not a one-size-fits-all approach. 
   I urge adoption of her amendment.

   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, my point is that the actions of the Democrat majority on the House floor last night besmirches the character of this House, and it's because they support giving benefits to illegal aliens in this country, and it's about the issue of illegal immigration and whether or not illegals in this country can receive government benefits. They're willing to protect some of their freshmen vulnerable Democrats and make them toe the line. 
   But Mr. Speaker, when they lost the vote on the House floor, the Speaker came down and voted in this well in order to tie that vote, and when that wasn't good enough and when a vote switched and they lost, they lost that vote, they're willing to gavel it down in order to protect themselves from a tough vote demanding that illegals do not receive government benefits. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, was it a cover-up? Was it a sham? Absolutely. And some, some believe the actions were cheating the facts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, our Speaker loves to fly and it shows. Today, we are debating a key provision in this important bill before us, the first open rule of the 110th Congress. We are glad that the majority could get around to it in the second month we are here. 
   But today it is important that we discuss a revolution in biofuels, an idea that we can look at ways to relieve the burden of global warming.     
   We know the Democratic majority is very focused on researching this idea of global warming, the idea that fossil fuels are warming the Earth and that the burning of fossil fuels are warming the Earth. 
   It is ironic that the highest officer of this body seeks a large jet to fly across country that could seat 42 people, perhaps some of the Speaker's friends and allies and supporters, some here in this body, some, oh, perhaps downtown, large contributors, I am not sure, although that has been denied by the Speaker in the request for those people to fly along, this plane, that are contributors and campaign supporters. 
   But let us talk today about a few important provisions. After the Speaker made a promise to the American people that they would be the most ethical Congress ever and after including the ban on the use of corporate jets in her lobbying reform bill, Speaker Pelosi asked for carte blanche access to one of the most extravagant and luxurious airliners in the military arsenal. It seats 42 people and has an office. It has a bedroom. Plenty of her cronies could fly along. 
   But the Speaker decided she, her family, her friends, her staff, her Democratic friends from California deserved to fly in style. This is not a matter of security, Mr. Chairman. It is a matter of, well, whatever is convenient for the Speaker as an individual. 
   But this is a bullet point to a larger value for this Democrat majority. It is about the Democrats' abuse of power since they have taken office just a short month ago, and it began when this Speaker denied minority rights to Republicans and continued with Tunagate which the Speaker, throwing a sop to her home constituents headquartered in her district, allowed American Samoa to be exempt from the minimum wage bill. Now they are seeking a matter of personal convenience and luxury. 
   Well, I believe the Speaker deserves security, not luxury; security, not convenience. As the New York Post reported today, the conventional view is that emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, are a major factor in global warming, and the jet Pelosi is demanding produces more than 10,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per hour, far more than the commuter plane the previous Speaker used.  
   If the Speaker is so concerned about global warming, maybe the Speaker should consider the same mode of transportation her colleagues took to the retreat this past weekend. They took a train. 
   It is very important that this House debate this important provision that the Speaker's request from the American military, and I think it is important that we discuss in terms of our research that we are trying to put forward on new fuels, new forms of transportation, new modes of powering our economy, and in terms of the global warming debate that is a large issue the American people are concerned about. 
   Let us talk about this luxury airliner and let us see what my Democrat colleagues say about the Speaker using it.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (DELEGATE VOTING -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, this week House Democrats are pushing forward a measure allowing Delegates to cast votes even on the House floor, even in this chamber. 
   Now, what is happening here is a continuation of a policy that the Democrats have put in place since day one, and that is an abuse of power. This proposal this week means that Delegates from Guam, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and my favorite, American Samoa, will enjoy new voting privileges similar to Members of Congress who actually represent districts in the United States and who actually represent districts with tax-paying citizens of the United States. This is a clear abuse of power. 
   And beyond that, as we all know, there is this little thing called the Constitution, and the Constitution says very clearly, the House shall be comprised of Members chosen by the people of the several States, not territories, not any member who wishes to come to this House floor and vote, but those elected by the citizens of the United States from districts in the United States. 
   What the Democrats are trying to do here is cushion their numbers. There is a tight majority here in the House that the Democrats have, and they are trying to add to those numbers so that when they have tough votes on the House floor, they can look up and point to a better number for their side than for the Republican side. 
   Beyond that, 80 percent of the Delegates from these territories are Democrats. Let's think this thing through. I think it is starting to make sense now, Mr. Speaker. There is an abuse of power that is continuing in the third week of Congress that began even before its first day. And let me tell you what is so perplexing about this, is that while my constituents have to pay Federal income tax in order to have their representation in Congress, the Delegates from the territories represent constituents who never have to pay Federal income tax. While the Revolutionary War was fought over this idea of taxation without representation, what we have here today with this Delegate voting is representation without taxation. I think that would be great for my constituents in western North Carolina; I think it would be great for all of America if we don't have to pay Federal income tax and still have our power and our elected democracy, but that is not the case. 
   But let's rewind. Just 2 weeks ago, the new Speaker of the House pushed forward a new minimum wage bill, a minimum wage bill that covered all of America and all of the territories, save one, American Samoa. The largest employer in American Samoa is headquartered in no other district than the Speaker's home district in San Francisco. I think something smells fishy. That is what I said at the time. And I think this is another fishy favor to the Delegates from the territories. It is quite perplexing, Mr. Speaker, that in week three we have a continued abuse of power on this House floor. 
   But let's go back, let's rewind. What else have the Democrats done in their short time in power to abuse the power that the American people gave them?  Well, let's look at this: On opening day, we proposed the Pelosi minority bill of rights, the same bill of rights that the Democrats demanded 2 years ago. We proposed the same thing, and the Speaker summarily dismissed it. Look at the 9/11 Commission, they pledged to implement all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and they went back on that pledge. A 5-day workweek, that was a key pledge they made during the campaign, and after the campaign they said this House will work 5 days a week. We have yet to work a 5-day workweek. In fact, last Friday we voted on only one bill. 
   And also, in 3 weeks in Congress, we only worked 40 hours in those 3 weeks. Another abuse of power, Mr. Speaker. 
   And finally, when they talk about keeping votes open in order to change the outcome; they have already done that, which is another abuse of power. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Delegate voting is something fishy, and it is another fishy favor put forward by the new Speaker of the House and the new Democrat majority in order to pad their number and further abuse power. We should reject it, and the American people who pay taxes should be angry at this proposal.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (ENERGY SOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague for yielding, and Congresswoman Bachmann, thank you for your leadership here. This is your first term in Congress. To take such an active role on energy policy is very helpful, not just for Minnesotans but for the rest of the country as well. Thank you, and thank you for hosting this hour as well. 
   I think it's important that the American people understand what's happening in terms of energy policy. This challenge was not created overnight, nor will it be fixed overnight. But we have to take steps now to make sure we have an American energy independence day in the future. And what we can do now to decrease the price at the pumps is to increase supply. I think the American people understand the laws of supply and demand, but let's  talk about some of the basics of energy. 
   First of all, the American people, we consume about 20 million barrels per day; yet we only produce roughly 6 million barrels a day of oil. Now, what that means is we have to import the majority of our oil. Now, that's a dangerous position to be in. 
   Two of the largest countries we have to import oil from are Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. We know through Hugo Chavez in Venezuela that they're not allies. We also know through terrorist attacks around the world that the Saudi Arabians are not allies either, though they may say it. 
   Now, this puts us at great risk, not just in terms of our national security because we have to import the fuel from overseas, but it's also a matter of economic security, which we're facing right now. 
   And folks from Western North Carolina where I represent, they're hurting. The American people are hurting. We're in an economy fueled by oil. It means that every product delivered to market has to be on a truck, a plane, a train, some sort of oil-powered transportation. 
   Now, that's a risky position we have to be in. So what we have to do now are take positive steps to increase American energy production. How do we do that? Well, we have to streamline the process for licensing so that the oil companies can go out and actually explore areas within Federal control, for instance, off the Outer Continental Shelf. That's an area in the deep waters off the coasts of North Carolina, across the eastern seaboard, off the coast of Texas and the gulf coast region. It's also off the west coast as well. 
   We have large supplies of oil that have been taken off-line due to congressional action. These areas have been off-line for energy exploration and production. So that means that we can't get oil out of those areas; though, we know oil is there. 
   We also have areas like remote areas of Alaska, for instance, that are off-line for energy exploration and production. We also have a resource called oil shale in the Rocky Mountain West. We have three times the reserves of Saudi Arabia tied up in oil shale. We have oil here in the Rocky Mountain West that we just need to be able to tap, but Congress has made a law preventing us from doing so. 
   Now, you can see and the American people can understand and do the math here; yet it's congressional action that's preventing us from being independent when it comes to energy, especially oil. 
   We also have challenges with natural gas, but going through all this, we understand that we have to increase American production of oil. 
   In World War I, we produced 67 percent of the world's oil, during World War I. Less than 100 years ago, we produced two-thirds of the world's oil here in the United States. You know, we also invented drilling of oil. We invented the oil derrick here in the United States. We developed the technology, even the drill bit, and everything used to produce oil was originally an American invention, which brings me to the next phase here. 
   We have to use American ingenuity to go that next step beyond oil, to go that next step beyond natural gas. We can do that. The American people, we have brilliant minds here, brilliant minds. We have to unleash those brilliant minds on this challenge that we have in an oil-powered economy, and we have to break this monopoly that oil has on all that we do as Americans. 
   And the way we do that, I have a piece of legislation called the Independence Prize. It's a $1 billion prize for a private sector innovation for an American company to produce an American idea that makes us energy independent as Americans. How wonderful is that? We could unleash the private sector on a large public policy issue and thereby take that next step away from oil and natural gas to some future form of energy. 
   Now, until that day comes, when we have some new American idea to power our economy, we must make sure that we have energy exploration and refining here. We also have to make sure that we use coal. We also have to make sure we use nuclear power. We have to use the resources that God gave us here in the United States.     
   And if we do that, we can be energy independent. 
   But we have to have the will of the American people behind us. In the most recent poll, 73 percent support Outer Continental Shelf drilling and energy exploration. Now, that means the American people are behind more energy exploration. The American people also want wind and solar and biomass and all sorts of alternative energy sources to power our economy. And we should do all of those things. 
   Now, my strategy, and I think the conservative solution--and the American solution, better yet--is to do all of the above when it comes to energy. It's a massive problem. We have to have a massive answer to this by taking every answer possible and pursuing them all. 
   We're a great Nation, the strongest economy in the world, though we're facing enormous challenges right now brought on by high gas prices and some other challenges. But with the power that we have of the American people, by American ingenuity we can be energy independent. We can increase supply of oil in the meantime to bring down the price of gas at the pumps. 
   I'm so grateful that my colleague, Congresswoman Bachmann, is hosting this hour to ensure that the American people can hear directly what we're facing here in Congress. And it is the liberal Democrat-controlled Congress that refuses to bring up legislation that I've outlined and that Congresswoman Bachmann will be talking about this evening. 
   Now, it's the failure of action that has resulted in high gas prices. And it's high time Congress acted so we can actually become energy independent as Americans. 
   Thank you, Congresswoman Bachmann.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, the American people are hurting with the cost of gasoline at the pumps, the rising price at the pumps, a weak economy that we're facing nationally and pending tax increases, a housing crisis that's facing many Americans, the struggles we've had in western North Carolina with bad trade deals. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are hurting, and it is because of rising prices at the pumps. That is the most egregious and powerful punch that this Democrat Congress has laid before the people of America. 
   There are some in this House that have been advocating for increasing the supply, making sure that new oil refineries are online, new American production of oil and natural gas. Then we have those, mostly liberals in this House, mostly Democrats, that say, No. We don't want any new production. No. We will side with the extreme environmentalists, not with American people who are screaming. They will support the screaming environmentalists rather than the families that are screaming, screaming when they take their kids to school, screaming when they just go out for a Saturday afternoon. 
   I will tell you the American people need help when it comes to the price of fuel. And this Democrat Congress has abdicated its responsibility in this role. The American people will be furious when they find out that we have American resources that can be tapped into. And so many of us, my colleagues and many in this House, have been advocating more supply. And yet the Speaker of the House will say, No, we don't want new American supply. That won't do anything to the price of gasoline at the pumps. 
   Well, just this morning, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, testified before the Financial Services Committee. And in answering a question about the cost of price at the pumps, the question was posed to him, ``Would increasing supply cut the price of gas at the pumps?'' His response--here. I have blown it up large so that my Democrat colleagues can read it. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve said, ``A 1 percent increase in supply could lower prices by as much as 10 percent.'' A 1 percent increase in supply could lower prices by as much as 10 percent. This was the testimony, as of this morning, in front of the Financial Services Committee. 
   This is a very important thing for this Congress to understand, that if we allow for more exploration here that has been prevented by law, it can bring down prices. 
   Now, I'm not a newcomer to this. I have been advocating things from my first days here in Congress. I think we need to have an American energy policy that is multi-tiered. First, we need to have new refineries. We also, along with that, have to have new domestic exploration of oil. That can be done off the deep waters of our coast. It can be done in remote areas of Alaska, such as ANWR. It could be done in the Rocky Mountain West with oil shale production. These things can be done if Congress acts. And I think it's high time Congress acts with the price of gasoline over $4 a gallon in western North Carolina. 
   But that's not it. We can't just stop there. Certainly it will bring down prices, as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve said, if we increase that production. But we have to go a step further. We have to ask the American people to conserve energy. Conservation is not a means to American energy independence, though it is a sign of personal virtue. But it can help on the margins. And it can help family budgets across western North Carolina. 
   But beyond that, we have to heavily invest in alternative sources of energy. There will be a day when our economy is powered by alternative sources of energy. Whether it's an electric car or hydrogen-powered automobile, a natural gas-powered automobile, or even perhaps some nuclear-powered device, these things are possible and we have to heavily invest in that. But until that day comes, it is imperative that this Congress act and act now for American energy independence through domestic energy exploration. American oil, American natural gas, that creates American jobs and keeps wealth here in America. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time this Congress acts, and it's time that we take the proper steps to help the folks across America who are struggling with high gas prices.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague from Texas (Mr. Sessions) for yielding the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we are engaged in a very serious debate. It is a constitutional debate. Having served on the Government Reform and Oversight Committee, we actually passed this bill. I opposed it in committee on constitutional grounds. I offered amendments to actually fix what I feel are constitutional problems in this legislation, and there are constitutional ways to achieve what my colleague, the Delegate from the District of Columbia, seeks to do. 
   There are constitutional ways to do that. Just as in the 19th century, the part of the District of Columbia that was part of Virginia was ceded back to the State of Virginia; likewise, the part of the District of Columbia that was Maryland could be ceded back for representation purposes to the State of Maryland. So there are constitutional ways to achieve what the Delegate seeks to achieve. 
   But the Constitution clearly provides how Congressmen and Senators are allocated, and they are allocated to the States. The District of Columbia was provided for. The District of Columbia is a Federal city and it is not a State. 
   Presently, D.C. has a Delegate who votes in committee. Actually, under the new Democrat rules, they also vote here on this House floor. I believe that is unconstitutional as well. But what this bill does is allow the District of Columbia to keep that Delegate vote and supplement it with another vote. 
   Now, what I would submit is that the new Democrat majority is trying to pad their numbers on this House floor. That is why they gave Democrats who are nonvoting Members of this body the ability to vote on the House floor. That is also why, I submit, that this Democrat majority is submitting this bill for approval on this House floor, and keeping not only the Delegate vote, but adding another Democrat vote to this House floor. 
   I don't oppose it for personal reasons. I oppose this legislation for constitutional reasons, and I would submit to the Delegate from the District of Columbia that we all must make a judgment on the constitutionality of legislation that we see before us on the House floor, and in that way, we must be constitutional scholars and study it. 
   So, beyond that, let's think about what the Democrats are doing, Mr. Speaker. They are looking for a raw power grab. They not only want to add another seat in Democrat hands to this body, but they want to allow nonvoting delegates the ability to vote on this House floor. I think that is wrong and unconstitutional, and I think the American people need to understand what is happening here. It is a raw power grab by the new Democrat majority.     
   Now, I think there are a lot of valid reasons for us to look at ways to allow the people in the District of Columbia to vote for Congress and for Senate, and I think the way to do that is to cede that part of Maryland that is now the District of Columbia back to the State of Maryland for voting purposes. And if they truly seek to do what they seek to do today, they could propose a constitutional amendment which has previously been rejected. I urge us to vote down this rule.

   Mr. McHENRY. I thank my colleague from Wisconsin. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a landmark day in the House of Representatives; and records are being broken. In fact, they are being shattered here on the House floor. 
   Democrats are poised to pass a $392.5 billion tax increase to this Federal budget and a spending increase to match it. And, you guessed it, it sets the record for our Nation's history, the record of the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Now, they should be proud, because they have outdone themselves from their budget in 1993, which was then the largest tax increase in American history. One hundred and fifteen million taxpayers will see their taxes increase by $1,795; 48 million married couples will see their taxes increase by $2,899; 17 million elderly individuals will see their taxes increases by $2,270. This isn't chump change for the American people. It is real money. It is real money the Democrats believe the American people owe them. 
   And why do Democrats feel entitled to this money? Because it is what they do. It is what they do. They tax and they spend. They spend and they tax. It is what the Democrat Party here in Washington does. And why is that? Well, I think it is because they haven't had a new idea in 70 years with the advent of the New Deal. 
   But as a side note, for the American people listening today, Mr. Chairman, I think it is very interesting, very striking, the level of hypocrisy in this budget. Because it also does something very interesting with this budget today. It accepts the President's funding levels for the troops in Iraq through 2009. 
   Well, this is pretty interesting, because just last week the liberal majority voted to cut off funds in 2008, right before the general election, didn't they? I think this is a high level of hypocrisy out of this budget. And what they said last week is ``we are standing against the war in Iraq. Get our troops out in 2008.'' What they are saying with this budget here today is, ``we will fund it a little longer.'' It is a level of hypocrisy here in Washington, D.C., Mr. Chairman, that the American people need to know about. They say, forget about last week. 
   This Democrat party is the party of consistent inconsistencies. 
   Another glaring error is, in their first majority budget in 13 years, they don't tackle the entitlement programs. They don't tackle reforming entitlement programs to make sure Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security can last for generations. We need entitlement reform. 
   Republicans, when we were in the majority, we had $280 billion worth of entitlement savings and reform to preserve Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and all the entitlement programs. But the Democrats ignore the looming entitlement crisis. 
   I think what we have to go back to is this is the tax-and-spend party, and we must oppose them. I urge my colleagues to vote against this budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Madam Speaker, it's high time Congress acts on high gas prices. The American people are crying out for help and assistance; yet this Democrat Congress is doing nothing when it comes to energy independence for Americans. 
   Finding a comprehensive long-term solution is what the American people want so that we can be energy independent, or at least more energy independent than we are today. 
   Conserving is a sign of personal virtue, but we cannot conserve our way to American energy independence. The Democrat plan is only conservation and it's only tax increases. 
   On our side of the aisle, we are trying to reach out to the Democrats and say that we must have energy exploration here domestically. 
   When it comes to energy, America needs to rely on its own ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi royal family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. I rise today to agree with the resolution, but the real substance of the debate on the House floor today should be about gas prices. That is the substance of what we should be talking about as a people because I know my constituents are talking about it. They commute to work each day and pay and pay and pay high gas prices every day. And it is because this Congress hasn't acted. 
   Now, certainly the resolution calling for more math and science students, that's well and good, but what we should be talking about right now is how we're going to become energy independent as Americans, how we use American resources, whether it's natural gas, petroleum products, energy research, how are we going to invest in those things now. 
   This Congress, this Democrat leadership has failed to act, and I think that's irresponsible.     
   You know, one answer that they say is conservation. That's what some on the other side of the aisle say is the answer. And, you know, conservation is a sign of personal virtue, but we cannot conserve our way to energy independence, American energy independence. 
   So what do we do? Well, I believe we have to use our technology and our innovation here in the United States to become energy independent. We have vast resources, whether it's oil shale in the Rocky Mountain west, whether it's tar sands in our neighboring Canada, in order to harvest oil out of those areas. We must do it, though. The American people are paying close to $4 at the pumps, and that's unacceptable. And I think, beyond that, when it comes to energy, we need an American solution, an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation, not beholden to the Saudi royal family. 
   I call on this Congress to act, to streamline the regulation process so we can get new refineries online, to open up new areas of exploration. That's what we should be doing, not simply debating this resolution, but working on real, substantive issues the American people need and desire.  
   My constituents in western North Carolina demand action when it comes to lowering gas prices. And this Congress can do something about it, but we have to open up new areas of exploration, we have to increase refining capacity, and we have to invest in renewable energy sources that are clean, efficient, and American solutions that make us self-reliant.

   Mr. McHENRY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I appreciate the opportunity to respond to my colleague and his utter fabrication about the history. 
   Now, talk about rewriting history here; instead of complaining about the problem, we're offering solutions. And I'm proud that I'm part of the solution. And that solution is to hold the oil companies accountable. That's right, the gentleman is right about that. But I think we have to go a step further. We have to make sure that refineries can get online. The reason why they won't build new refineries is that regulation that this Congress supports, the trial lawyers as well, and the extreme environmental community that fund the left, and my colleagues on the left, they're all about shutting down new refinery capacity. 
   Beyond that, my colleague that just spoke is not for any exploration in this country whatsoever. And the American people know this, Mr. Speaker. The American people know that we need more supply of energy, and that will bring prices lower, not this rewriting of history that my colleague just issued.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (TUNAGATE -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, there is something fishy going on here. The Washington Times reported yesterday that ``the Democrats' minimum wage legislation exempts American Samoa, a Pacific island territory, that would be the only U.S. territory not subject to the Federal minimum wage.'' 
   The article goes on to say: ``The loophole pleases StarKist Tuna, one of the two packaging plants that employ over 5,000 Samoans, or nearly 75 percent of the island's workforce. 
   ``StarKist's parent company, Del Monte, is headquartered in San Francisco.'' 
   Now, after these press reports came out, the Democrats want to include American Samoa in this legislation, 2 days after it passed this House. Why? Because the American public found out about this special interest scheme. 
   This is a clear abuse of power for a hometown company. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, Madam Speaker, indeed, this is an abuse of power, and there is something definitely fishy going on here.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, national security should be the highest priority of the U.S. Congress. I talk to my constituents in western North Carolina a lot about the situation in Iraq. We understand the challenges. I think the American people understand the challenges of this war. But we also know the consequences of quitting are too dire and too dangerous. 
   We know that leaving an unstable Iraq endangers Israel, other Western democracies, as well as our own national interests and our constituents here in the United States. 
   The President put forward a plan that he and his generals believe will lead to a safe, secure, and stabilized Iraq. Let me repeat that: he put forward a plan, a plan of action and a plan for success. 
   The Democrats, in response, put forward a nonbinding resolution. Now, this is Washington-speak for legislation that does not have the force of law. Now, the disturbing thing is not that it is a nonbinding resolution; but the message that this legislative tool sends, it sends not only to our American people, not only to the troops in the field, but our allies around the world, and it also emboldens our enemies. 
   This resolution says that this time the Democrats are not prepared to offer a new direction, a plan or a solution for the challenges we face in Iraq. I offer this bit of wisdom to the Democrats: you must be the change you want to see. 
   If the Democrats are serious about developing a new plan, then the right thing to do is submit it. That is a true test of leadership, to submit solutions, solutions; and in order to effect change, you have to put forward ideas for that change. 
   I ask the American people to imagine what it would be like if their Representatives used this time to hammer out ideas and positive solutions. That is the American ingenuity that we should focus on as a Congress. This is the American way. 
   The Democrats say this debate is to send a message to the President. Well, I will tell you, I think he has heard you loud and clear. 
   But let me give you a message from the battlefield from a friend of mine in Iraq. He says the argument over what got us to this point is a diversion. The problem set is the present. The terrorists and would-be terrorists that have flowed into Iraq will not stand at the border and wave us good-bye and good luck. They understand our politics, our systems, and our weaknesses.     
   They believe that it is a war of endurance, and that we have shown historically and repeatedly that we don't have the national will for prolonged engagement. 
   Unfortunately the political grandstanding has endorsed their belief and ensures the terrorists' continued bloody engagement until November 2008. 
   The bottom line, we need reinforcements to set the conditions for success, and we need political support for the endurance to continue this fight. That is from my friend in the battlefield. 
   And I say to my colleagues, the American people need better than this. We need a plan of action for results and success in Iraq. 
   And I say, ``Madam Speaker, you have made your points. Now where is your plan?''

<DOCNO>Mr. McHENRY. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, today we are considering the most significant extension of the Federal Government into the financial markets in over a generation. With the dramatic impact that this piece of legislation will have on the housing markets, as well as the financial markets, I think we have to give it due consideration. 
   And in that vein, Mr. Speaker, I have got a number of questions. Will taxpayers be forced to subsidize shareholders, shareholder returns if the GSEs borrowed from either the Fed or from the Treasury lines of credit without a requirement that they first reduce their dividends? 
   Will the bill create the possibility of future shareholder suits against the GSEs, and will the Government be on the hook for any of the settlement costs and damages? 
   Will the bill create the potential of GSEs going into receivership, and how could this affect the United States Government's bond rating if we engage in this type of activity? 
   And finally, why are we giving home owners with negative equity, who take advantage of the FHA refinancing proposal within this legislation, they have to give up 50 percent of their appreciation in homes. But, at the same time, we don't have that same requirement for the financial institutions we are giving a massive amount of money to in Federal assistance. 
   But finally, there is a large section of this bill called the Housing Trust Fund; and does this Housing Trust Fund work against the goal of this bill, which is to prop up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? 
   The Housing Trust Fund would tax Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and take that money, put it into a slush fund for Congress to hand out for other housing ideas. And will this hurt, in the long term, the housing markets? 
   And for these questions, I think there are answers; and the answers are that it will harm our U.S. Government taxpayers now and in the future, and at the same time, not truly help the financial markets in a way substantive enough for us to do this. 
   So therefore, I am going to vote against this legislation. I urge my colleagues to do the same.
