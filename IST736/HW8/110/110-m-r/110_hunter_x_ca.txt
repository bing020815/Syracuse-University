<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (OUR MISSION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor to talk a little bit about national security and where the Nation's defense apparatus stands as of now. But I thought I also might comment on the comments that were made by two of my wonderful colleagues, Ms. Woolsey of California and Mr. Paul of Texas, who preceded me and commented about their position to the effect that we should bring our troops home immediately from Iraq. And implicit in their comments was the message that somehow Saddam Hussein's continued rule of Iraq would have been preferable to the American intervention. 
   I disagree with that theme, and let me tell you why. In listening to Ms. Woolsey talk about the wounded, the KIA, the suffering in that part of the world, and the burden that has been borne by American soldiers, I think it is also important to remember the Iraq that was represented by Saddam Hussein. 
   And while she has, obviously, the images that have compelled her to take her philosophical position, the image that I have, and I keep in my desk drawer, is the photograph of the hundreds of mothers whose bodies are strewn across the hillside in northern Iraq, holding their children, some of them newborn babies, some of them four, five, 6 years old, dead in mid-stride where they were hit by poison chemical, poison chemical that was delivered into those villages at the order of Saddam Hussein. 
   And I have taken, as a guy who sometimes watches the History Channel, to tuning in when I see the History Channel reviewing the exhuming of bodies in these mass graves and putting together this story, this mosaic of Iraq history under Saddam Hussein and the story of how hundreds of people, men, women and children, would be herded across fields and they would be executed and their bodies would be pushed into mass graves. And now we are uncovering those mass graves. 
   And just like the mass graves that we found in Europe, especially those that were filled by bodies that had been people who had been executed by the Nazis, there are more people now in those mass graves, we find, than what we had projected. 
   And as I watched the exhuming of some of those bodies on the History Channel, I noticed that the anthropologist who was doing the particular work noted that the mother, in some cases, who was executed would often have a .45 bullet hole in the back of her head, and her small baby that she was holding would also have a bullet hole in the back of his or her head. So the monstrosity that was Saddam Hussein, the mass execution, the killing of people with chemical weapons, is what the American troops displaced when we moved into Iraq. 
   Now, it is tough to stand up a free nation and stand up a military that is able to protect it, but that is the challenge that we are meeting right now. And we are following the same basic pattern that we have followed for 60 years. Whether you are talking about Japan or the Philippines or El Salvador in our own hemisphere, first you stand up a free government. Secondly, you stand up a military that is capable of protecting that free government, and third, the Americans, not coveting anything that that country has, the Americans leave. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I thought I also might speak just a little bit, as we turn over the control of Congress to the Democrat leadership, not only in the full House, but also the committee chairmanships, and my own committee chairmanship now has been relinquished to the gentleman from Missouri, Ike Skelton, my good friend and a wonderful person and a person with a real heart for the troops. I thought that I might just comment about where we stand right now. I think it is important for the American people to know where we stand and what this Congress that is going out has accomplished for national security. 
   First, what have we done for the troops? Well, over the last 8 years we have increased the pay for the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Marines, and the National Guard by right at 40 percent, a 40 percent pay increase. We have increased family separation pay, the amount of money that we deliver to our military families when they are separated when people are deployed overseas. We have increased that from $100 a month to about $250 a month. We have increased our combat pay. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know I have only got 5 minutes, so I will elaborate on some of the accomplishments that occurred during this last Congress in the next hour.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I want to let all of my colleagues know that, as most of them already do, that tomorrow is the United States Open, the great U.S. Open, the great tradition in golf competition. And it is going to be held at Torrey Pines in San Diego. 
   I thought this might be an appropriate time to pay tribute to those great golfers who have come to the San Diego area, and especially to talk about the dean of golf in San Diego, that great champion who won two U.S. opens, Billy Casper. We have had a number of great champions out of San Diego. 
   Madam Speaker, there is a line that connects Billy Casper and Phil Mickelson, who is one of the top contenders. He is going to be playing tomorrow. He is a great U.S. Open competitor who has been runner-up four times. He said the other day, I think it was on the Golf Channel, that he loves the U.S. Open. So far the U.S. Open hasn't loved him. But he follows a succession of great golfers out of San Diego. 
   We had ``Gene the Machine,'' Gene Littler, who won the U.S. Open in 1961; the great Mickey Wright, possibly the greatest woman golfer of all time, who won, I believe, four LPGA championships; Craig Stadler, who while he didn't win the U.S. Open, won the Masters; the great Paul Runyan, ``Little Poison,'' who at one point, even though he was outdriven about 100 yards on every drive by Sam Snead at the PGA Championships back in the thirties beat the Great Snead 8 and 7 by being so good around the greens; and of course the great Scott Simpson who won the U.S. Open in 1987. And that leads me to the guy who won the U.S. Open two times, really the dean of golf in San Diego, California, the great Billy Casper. 
   Madam Speaker, people don't understand how great Billy Casper was and is. He won 51 professional tournaments. During the heyday of the big three, that was Palmer, Player and Nicklaus, that period between 1964 and 1970 when those three golfers were winning a combined 35 victories, Billy Casper by himself was winning 23 victories, more than Palmer or Player combined and three more than Jack Nicklaus. In fact, I think it was the great Jack Nicklaus who said at one point that it should have been the big four. 
   Billy Casper is a guy who had the greatest Ryder Cup record in the history of American golfers and the best come-from-behind win in a U.S. Open championship in our history. And let me tell you just a little bit about that. It was 1966 at Olympic Golf Course in San Francisco. Billy Casper walked up to the tee on the last nine, the back nine of the last 18 holes of the last day of the U.S. Open. He walked up to the tee seven shots behind the great Arnold Palmer in his prime. And after he had finished that nine holes, he had shot a 32, he had tied Palmer who was only three over par on the back nine, and with a seven-shot lead, you ought to be able to win the U.S. Olympic with the 37 on the last nine. But he tied him, caught him by seven strokes in the last nine holes. And the next day, the great Billy Casper won the playoff against Arnold Palmer with a 69. That is the great Billy Casper, one of the great Americans of all time, one of the great athletes and golfers of all time, and our dean of golf in San Diego. 
   I want to recognize my friend, Danny Burton who, while he is very modest, is a great athlete. He was the high school champion in Indiana, a guy we have all looked up to and a guy who also has some memories of his own about some of these U.S. Open champions. 
   I would like to yield to my friend from Indiana.

   Mr. HUNTER. Let me ask my friend, Dan Burton, a lot of people have criticized Phil Mickelson because he is kind of a go-for-broke player. And they often say, as in some of the shots that he took in some of the closing holes in some of the majors, that Phil Mickelson didn't play the odds, that he didn't hit the safe shot. He went for the go-for-broke shot. And in some cases, it didn't work out. I kind of like that. Because that is really what we go to the golf course to see.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (LIMITING USE OF FUNDS TO ESTABLISH ANY MILITARY INSTALLATION OR BASE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady for her leadership and also thank the author of this measure and simply point out that we have already passed this measure, and we did pass it on our defense bill last year. 
   Very simply, no American troops are permanently stationed in countries around the world by virtue of the fact that we station them with the permission of the host country. The idea that we are going to insist or enforce, or unilaterally lodge American troops in Iraq is not something that is contemplated by anybody. 
   I just say to the gentlelady that we may have a time in the future, and we have dozens and dozens of countries around the world which on a regular basis give us permission to move our troops across their land area. We may have a time in the future, for example, 5 or 10 years from now, when we have to have an early warning for a missile strike from Iran to Israel. 
   I know that the gentlelady wouldn't object to American forces going in and establishing an early warning station so that we can save the lives of people living in Tel Aviv from a strike similar to the Scud strike that Saddam Hussein launched in the early 1990s at Israel. 
   We may have a time when we have to project American forces for a contingency around the world, and when you do that, regardless of what country you are talking about of the dozens of countries that host us on a regular basis, you go through a protocol. You contact the country. You receive their official permission going through their government, and that describes the parameters of the American presence that will be there, how long it will be there, what the usage will be, whether it is an airfield or a radar station. 
   But there could be a time, should Iran develop weapons of mass destruction or continue on this path to develop weapons of mass destruction and at some point attack a neighbor or prepare to attack a neighbor, and it could well be in the interest of the United States, for example, to have early warning capability should Iran want to make a strike on a country like Israel when that request will be made. And hopefully it would be responded to affirmatively by the free nation of Iraq. 
   I support this legislation, and I will vote for it again, as I voted for it six times. But I would hope that Members would understand and realize that we use dozens and dozens of assets around the world which are all done permissively by the host nations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, let me explain why this case is different from all the rest. This is an extraordinary case. It's a case which, even if you accept the drug dealer's word and all of his testimony as fact, finds results in not only the Members who have sponsored this amendment, Mr. Poe, Mr. Tancredo, myself, Mr. Rohrabacher, Mr. Culberson and many others, that list should be extended to about 1 million ordinary Americans who now know the basic facts of this case, having been laid out in hearings in the other body and soon to be laid out in hearings here, because these gentlemen have been given murder verdicts. They have been given time in excess of the average convicted murderer in the United States.     
   That's what makes this case so extraordinary, along with the facts that attend the way evidence was kept from the jury. 
   Let me just explain this extraordinary case, this case in which the so-called victim was moving close to $1 million of drugs across the border, was shot, was wounded, was brought back into the United States, given immunity to testify against these two Border Patrol agents. 
   Yet after he had been given immunity, and presumably had told the U.S. attorney that in exchange for that immunity he would not continue to move narcotics, he was connected with another massive case of moving almost another $1 million of drugs across the border. That information was never communicated to the court, even though the testimony of that drug dealer is the testimony that sent both these agents to the penitentiary for, essentially, murder sentences; that is, 11 and 12 years respectively. 
   Certainly the U.S. Government at that point had an obligation to go to the court and tell the court that, indeed, the credibility of their key witness had been doubly compromised by this second movement of narcotics. 
   Lastly, let me just say this: Pardons are given, commutations are given. This is, I think you could look at this as maybe another species of commutation. That is, if the Congress speaks loud and clear, and the President signs this bill, then that will be a commutation of the sentence of Agents Compean and Ramos. 
   In light of the commutations that have been given recently by the executive branch, I think we need to remember that people that live in small houses sometimes have a right to commutations of sentences, just like people who live in big houses. 
   In this case, these two Border Patrol men are now in isolation, having spent a long time in jail, Mr. Ramos having been beaten up. Their families, most of us have met their families. This is a matter of little children wanting to see their daddies come home who, in my estimation, have not broken any law anywhere as significant as that which would justify these massive sentences that they have been given, this 11 and 12 years in Federal penitentiary, respectively. 
   Let me add my voice to support of this amendment, which I, along with a number of other colleagues have cosponsored with our great friend from Texas (Mr. Poe). 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Poe the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution by the Democrat leadership sends a message to three parties: America's enemies, America's friends, and America's troops. And I think it is going to be received by friend and foe alike as the first sound of retreat in the world battle against extremists and terrorists. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are not stopping anything with this resolution. In fact, the Big Red One is already moving its first brigade toward Iraq; the 82nd Airborne, America's all-American division, is already in Iraq. In fact, the Second Brigade is already in their sector in Baghdad. As a matter of fact, in the Baghdad plan, which reinforcements are serving, all nine sectors now have American and Iraqi forces in place and operating. So you are not stopping anything; you are simply sending a message, and it is the wrong message. Because this Nation has been for the last 60 years involved in spreading freedom, and it is in America's interest to spread freedom. Nobody would say that it is in our interest or it is not in our interest, for example, to have a free Japan on that side of the Pacific, or to have a free El Salvador in our own hemisphere, or to have those nations which were behind the Iron Curtain, nations like Poland, now standing side by side with us in Iraq. It is in our interest to spread freedom. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have been here before. A lot of us have. I remember in the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan was standing up to the Russians in Europe and the USSR was ringing our allies in France and Germany with SS-20 missiles, and the President of the United States moved to offset those missiles with Pershing IIs and ground-launched cruise missiles, and you had from the left a call that this was going to start World War III. And you had pundits throughout this country, as a matter of fact somebody showed me an old headline the other day, ``Better Red Than Dead,'' which emanated from that debate and that action. 
   But we stood tough, we offset the Russians, we showed strength, and at some point the Russians picked up the phone and said, ``Can we talk?'' And when we talked, we talked about the disassembly of the Soviet Empire. 
   In our own hemisphere, when we went in and helped that fragile government in El Salvador and stood up a little shield around that government, we had people saying that is going to be the next Vietnam for the United States. Well, it wasn't a Vietnam for the United States, and Salvadorans are standing with Americans now in Iraq. In fact, I think we have got people who died of old age waiting anxiously for the next Vietnam. 
   Now we are in a different part of the world, and it is a tough mission, and moving freedom and spreading freedom in that part of the world is very, very difficult. And I would just say to my colleagues, my friends who have talked about the smooth road not taken, how we have made mistakes; if we just kept that Iraqi in place of Saddam Hussein's, somehow things would be better now. Saddam Hussein's army had 11,000 Sunni generals. Now, what are you going to do with an army with 11,000 Sunni generals whose mission is to stabilize a population which is in the majority Shiite?     
   A lot of people have said we should have had 200,000 to 300,000 troops in country. Now at the same time they would say we have got to put an Iraqi face on this occupation. How do you put an Iraqi face on the occupation with 200,000 or 300,000 Americans in country? 
   The facts are, there is no smooth road. This is a tough and difficult road. Our military planners have come up with a strategy. It involves nine sectors in Baghdad with Iraqi troops to the front and with backup American battalions behind them, mentoring them, giving them advice, and in many cases stiffening their spine.  
   Now, there is no guarantee of success. But this is a first time. I think we should check our history, and my friend, Mr. Skelton, I think you should check our history and see if this Congress has ever, after a military operation is already in place, is already moving forward, the Big Red One is already moving out. The all-American division, the 82nd Airborne, already has troops in place in combat, in the city, that we retroactively say, you know, we don't support this. The only message that can possibly send to the rest of the world is a fractured message. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just want to end with a comment, with a quotation from Douglas MacArthur in his farewell speech at West Point. I thought it was appropriate for these times. He talks about the American soldier, and he says this, ``Their story is known to all of you. It is the story of the American man at arms. My estimate of him was formed on the battlefields many, many years ago, and has never changed. I regarded him then, as I regard him now, as one of the world's noblest figures; not only as one of the finest military characters, but also as one of the most stainless. 
   ``His name and fame are the birthright of every American citizen. In his youth and strength, his love and loyalty, he gave all that mortality can give. He needs no eulogy from me, or from any other man. He has written his own history and written it in red on his enemy's breast.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, our soldiers are engaged in combat right now. The worst disservice that we can give to them is to retroactively blast and degrade the mission that they are currently undertaking. There is no good role, there is no good purpose that is served by this. 
   So I would ask all my colleagues, let us get behind not only our troops, let us get behind their mission. Let us vote ``no'' on this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, in my office I keep a photo of about a dozen Kurdish mothers whose bodies are strewn across the hillside in northern Iraq, holding their babies, killed in mid-stride where they were gassed to death by Saddam Hussein. As I listened to some folks in this debate talk about what they consider to be an immoral war, an illegal war, an occupation that is not consistent with morality, I harken back to that picture and the thousands of people that it represents, and I harken back also to the exhuming of mass graves with, again, mothers shot in the back of the head with a .45-caliber pistol by Saddam Hussein's executioners and with their little babies similarly with holes in the back of their skulls. 
   Mr. Speaker, this operation in Iraq is indeed a moral operation. It represents the goodness of the American people. 
   I am also reminded of something that lots of folks and the Vice President talked about, and that is the goodness that we have brought with the 3 million-plus babies who have been vaccinated, with the hundreds of schools and hospitals that have been built, and with all those expectant mothers that were given prenatal care by the Americans so that their children would be born in a healthy fashion. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I recall that in 1984 Ronald Reagan very eloquently asked the American people to support him in bringing freedom to the people of El Salvador. I remember his speech; and in his speech, he harkened back to another American who had appealed to us in bringing freedom to another part of the world, which was at that time endangered, and that was Greece in 1947. 
   The communists were very close to victory in Greece, and Harry Truman appealed to the American people in a joint session of Congress. He said the free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms. If we falter, we may endanger the peace of the world, and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this Nation. 
   Now, we have no guarantee of victory in Iraq. There is no battle plan that comes with a guarantee of victory, but I will tell one thing that is very clear: what is happening in Iraq and our efforts in Iraq are connected and are watched by every terrorist in the world, and that connection is established and travels as fast as the speed of electrons in this age of television and technology and high-paced, fast media and the Internet. They see what we are doing. 
   And that connection, Mr. Speaker, was made when the Beirut bombings occurred against the Marines in the Marine barracks in Beirut. In fact, I think Mr. Skelton was with me. We were over there very shortly before those bombings occurred. 
   They are connected and the terrorist world watched very closely when there was no response to that. They watched very closely when there was no response in the Khobar Towers, with respect to the Cole and extremely anemic response with respect to the bombings in the embassies in Africa. 
   Now we are undertaking an important and difficult mission; and, Mr. Speaker, I pointed out before that at least one brigade of the 82nd Airborne is already in place in Baghdad, now engaged in the operation, and we have a brigade of the Big Red One moving now toward the theater. I believe we have right at 4,000 members of the 82nd Airborne now in country in Iraq, and we have Iraqi soldiers and Americans engaged in the nine sectors of the city already undertaking this operation and this plan that has been developed by our warfighting commanders. 
   The idea that we are here, poised to retroactively condemn an operation that our soldiers are already carrying out, is, to my mind, remarkable. There is not going to be any force in effect with respect to this vote that will take place shortly that will do anything but send the wrong message to America's  allies, and I think you have seen comments by some of our allies over the last several weeks with respect to the message that we send out. We are interesting people are we not, Mr. Speaker. We send out messages with all the electronic gadgets in the world to convey the messages to the entire world, and then we say, you know, we really did not mean what you take our statements to mean and we really did not intend to give anybody the wrong message that we still support the troops. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, we have got a number of great members of the Armed Services Committee that I want to yield to, and I want to come back later and talk a little bit later about this war against terror and the centerpiece that is Iraq and the centerpiece of that which is as planned. 
   You know, I was thinking there was a statement once that in a little hut in Central America when we were standing up to the Communists and we were providing a shield for El Salvador, while that fragile democracy stood up, there was a hut in El Salvador which reportedly had the writing on it, Thank God for Ronald Reagan. I am wondering if some trooper in the 82nd Airborne, in the 2nd brigade of the 82nd Airborne may write on a wall in Baghdad, maybe on Friday when we take this vote, This is the day in which the American Congress condemned the mission that we are carrying out today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself just 30 seconds, and I would like to just make one note. That is, if we add the 21,500 troops that are already partly in Iraq, these reinforcements to the 138 who existed before the movement started, and we allow for the troops who are rotating home, we will have fewer; we will have 157,000 troops in Iraq, according to DOD. That is fewer than the number of troops that we had a year ago in December. That is the state of this so-called surge; fewer troops than we had last year.

   Mr. Speaker, my good friend from California, the gentlelady, made the remark, as I understand it, that the Iraq Study Group did not agree with the President's so-called surge. I just would point to the statement that the Iraq Study Group published in their report. They said we could, however, support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up the training and equipping mission if the U.S. commander in Iraq determines that such steps would be effective. 
   We also rejected the immediate withdrawal of our troops because we believe that so much is at stake. So the Iraq Study Group did state that they would support a surge to effect the stabilization of Baghdad, and it is in the nine sectors of Baghdad with Iraqi battalions to the front, American battalions backing them up, that this operation is taking right now. So it appears to me that the President is, in fact, following and is on common ground with this recommendation by the Iraq Study Group. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   The reason I am going through these members of the Wilson clan, Mr. Speaker, is because inspired by his wife Roxanne, all these young men are serving in the military, and if the Wilson family does not re-up, we are in trouble.

   With respect to the group of allies that the gentleman called our few remaining friends, I am reminded that there is a number of them like Poland and Moldavia and Herzegovina and Georgia and Bosnia and Azerbaijan and Armenia and Albania, lots of little countries that used to be behind the Iron Curtain or in the case of El Salvador, in what was called by the Democrat Party the unwinnable war in Central America in Salvador, those countries, which themselves were the beneficiaries of an American policy of expanding freedom are standing with our country in this operation in Iraq.

   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes to respond to my colleague, my good friend who just spoke, Mr. Israel. 
   Let me just make a couple of points. With respect to up-armored Humvees, when we entered this administration, the Humvee is a successor to the Jeep, it is a tactical vehicle, we had 1,200 up-armored Humvees. That was in the year 2000. Today, we have got 15,000 up-armored 114s, plus thousands of Humvees that have the so-called MAC kits which are also protective armor kits. 
   We had virtually no body armor in the year 2000. I don't believe we had a single set that was available for any line units in any American division in the world. Today, we have over 400,000 of those. 
   I just want to make a point, if there are American moms and dads, and we have had a few who have thought that their sons and daughters were going to Iraq without body armor, I have said, Call me personally at the office, and I have not had a single phone call in 2 years. So they have plenty of body armor. 
   And, lastly, I just want to make one other point with respect to what America has, because there has been an implication I think throughout the debate that we are stretched too thin, that others may attack us, may take advantage of the fact that we have deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since the year 2000, we have more than doubled the precision firepower of this country. That means the ability of this country, and Republicans and Democrats have supported the funding that has done this; but if any country in the world should think they are going to take advantage of an America that is, in their estimation, stretched too thin, the precision firepower, that means the ability to send a smart weapon on target to thread a goal post at many, many miles, has more than doubled since the year 2000. And so no country  that feels that there is that implication in our situation in Iraq and Afghanistan should bet their life on it, because they will lose. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to Mr. Cole, the outstanding gentleman from Fort Sill.

   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, let me just respond to my good friend from Rhode Island, he is a great friend of mine and a former colleague on the Armed Services Committee, the estimate that has been given, that has been bandied around, that we would need some 20,000 support troops to support the 21,500 troops that are involved in the President's plan, some of whom are already in theater, has been rebutted by DOD, which said it is not 1 for 1 support to line troops, it is about 1 in 10, which in the estimate that they gave us was about 2,000 to 2,300, not 20,000 support troops. 
   Using that number, even with the 21,500 troops that are involved in the Baghdad plan, adding them to the 138 that we have right now, still brings us to a number that is lower than the 160,000 that we had December a year ago. I know that number has not been absolutely resolved, but I would just tell my friend that I believe it is going to be much lower than the number that has been put out there. 
   To my good friend from California, who talked about the Kosovo vote and the resolution to disapprove it, my recollection is that vote was undertaken before troops were moved. In this case, the 82nd Airborne is not already over the line in Iraq, but they actually have a brigade deployed in this operation, and the Baghdad operation that is being undertaken right now has a combination of Iraqi troops and American troops in each of nine sectors. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he would like to take to Mr. Conaway from Texas, who is a gentleman that represents a great base at Fort Hood.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to take a couple of minutes to answer a couple of things that my friend said. 
   First Mr. Weiner said, ``We aren't done.'' Madam Speaker, that is one thing that I am worried about. He said that we want more choices, more bills, more language. Not this Member. I will settle for a ``no'' on this resolution. I haven't asked for more bills, more choices, or different language. 
   And the problem with this resolution, the gentleman said this is a very good resolution because it is very clear, very concise, and gives us clear choices. This resolution retroactively condemns an action that has already been taken. That is the movement of reinforcements into the theater. You already have the 82nd Airborne in the theater. That is part of the reinforcing force. They are already in there. You already have a brigade from the 82nd Airborne in one of the nine sectors right now, operating, boots on the ground as we talk. So you aren't prohibiting the President from sending reinforcements. 
   He said that American forces are being stretched thinner and thinner and thinner. 
   We have 2 1/2 million Americans in uniform. We have roughly 138,000 before the surge. Now a little more than 140,000 counting the ones that are already in country. When they are in country and the support troops are there and less the troops who will be rotating home at that point, you will have at the high point, we are told by DOD, about 157,000 troops. That is less than we had a year ago in country, I would say to the gentleman. So that is not a huge surge.     
   He stated that we are going to be drawn thinner, and I quote, ``thinner and thinner and thinner.'' 
   So you have about 160,000 troops, a little less than that, max. That is not 10 percent of the 2.5 million persons who are presently wearing the uniform of the United States. 
   Secondly I will say to my friend, I want to say to folks who listen to this debate, because this statement about us being drawn thin and therefore being susceptible to problems and being vulnerable is a message that has come up several times in this debate.  
   We have more than doubled the precision firepower of this country since the last administration, that is the Clinton administration. You have more than doubled the precision firepower. That means the ability, if people should give the United States a need to respond militarily, the ability to send precision systems that can explode right straight through goalposts at long distances and handle lots of stuff. 
   Now, the gentleman is very concerned about Iran. I share that concern. And I share the concern the gentleman has about the centrifuge activity and the proposed centrifuge activity that Iran has discussed and may at some point develop with the aid of the Russians and the Chinese. 
   I would just remind the gentleman that those precision systems, that doubling of the precision firepower that we now have, is probably the right medicine if we should have to keep the military option open and on the table with respect to Iran. So we will watch them as they try to walk down this road to developing a nuclear weapon.

   Mr. HUNTER. We have been up as high as 40 percent National Guard and Reserve, and that is a deliberate policy of the United States. When we went to war in Vietnam, the Guard and Reserve for practical purposes stayed home. And we said from here on out, when we go to war, we go to war with what is known as a total force. 
   So you have a Reserve element that goes to war. If you were over in Iraq, as the gentlelady has been there a number of times, you will see Reservists flying C-130s, doing a lot of support missions, and you have National Guard units on the ground.

   Mr. HUNTER. I will just tell the gentleman, in the MOSs that our folks sign up for, especially the aerial supportive MOSs, that is always out there, that they are going to have to go, because where the armed services go, where the active folks go, let me just finish my answer to the gentleman. He asked me a question. I am going to ask answer it. 
   If you are in a supportive service that involves things likes aerial refueling, C-130 work, which is the workhorse of the U.S. military, you understand when you go in, you are going to be making probably multiple tours. If you join the U.S. Marines right now, the recruiter tells you as you sign up, you can be guaranteed that you will go to Iraq. 
   I would say to the gentleman another thing: Knowing those things, we are meeting all of our enlistment goals in the Guard and Reserve. So the active duty people who are undertaking multiple tours are coming back and reenlisting. And knowing that, knowing that you are exposed to multiple tours, we have more people signing up for the Guard, for the Reserve. 
   And interestingly, I will tell the gentleman, the place where we have had problems with recruiting in the last year from the information I have seen is the Naval Reserve, which doesn't do tours in Iraq. But the combat arms have multiple tours.

   Mr. HUNTER. Reclaiming my time, I will just tell the gentleman this: There is a difference between people in specialties spending more time doing multiple tours, and I will say to him again, almost all Marines know that they are going to do multiple tours, either in country or on the so-called float, which is the deployment around the world, because they are the 9/11 force for this country. So that is something that people do. 
   That is a far cry from not having enough firepower to respond to an Iranian crisis. We still have tons of firepower to respond to an Iranian breakout or surprise, a technological surprise, with respect to development of nuclear systems. 
   Madam Speaker, if the gentlewoman from California has more speakers, I will enjoy listening to them, and I will reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I have got one speaker left here, Mr. Franks of Arizona, but let me just say one thing before he speaks. I appreciate the debate. I think we have had a good discussion this evening. 
   I wanted to say one thing about Charlie Norwood. He passed away. He was a Member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade. I was a member of that brigade. I had a very average tour, a very easy tour in Vietnam. I did nothing special. But Charlie Norwood was a real hero who won the Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars in Vietnam. 
   I thought to commemorate Charlie, I have got my copy of General Douglas MacArthur's farewell speech that I quoted earlier, and let me just quote a paragraph about duty, honor and country that Douglas MacArthur thought so represented the fighting man in this country.  
   He said these of words, duty, honor and country, ``They teach to be proud and unbending in honest failure, but humble and gentle in success; not to substitute words for action; not to seek the path of comfort, but to face the stress and spur of difficulty and challenge; to learn to stand up in the storm, but to have compassion on those who fall; to master yourself before you seek to master others; to have a heart that is clean, a goal that is high; to learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep; to reach into the future, yet never neglect the past; to be serious, yet never take yourself too seriously; to be modest so that you will remember the simplicity of true greatness; the open mind of true wisdom, the meekness of true strength.'' 
   I think that largely represented our great friend Charlie Norwood. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks).

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (AWARDING THE MEDAL OF HONOR TO SERGEANT RAFAEL PERALTA -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I think it's appropriate that I follow the remarks of my great friend SILVESTRE REYES, who was a great veteran of Vietnam and who was a wonderful leader, I think the best leader in the history of the Border Patrol, and who is a great Member of this body, but he is a gentleman who has been to Iraq many times and to Afghanistan many times. 
   Mr. Speaker, I take the well to comment on an event that occurred in San Diego, and that is regarding Sergeant Rafael Peralta, who was killed on November 14, 2004 in the now famous battle of Fallujah. He was killed, and absorbed the blast by an enemy grenade when, during house-to-house fighting, he was thrown into a small room while he and three other marines were working their way through this series of fire fights. 
   According to the eyewitnesses and to the citation that he received, he pulled that grenade to his body and absorbed the full concussion and the full explosive power of that grenade on his own body and, thereby, saved his fellow marines. 
   Now it has just been announced that he was awarded the Navy Cross, the second highest award for heroism, but not the Medal of Honor. 
   Mr. Speaker, the last person who did that same act, in fact, who was a marine and who did that incredible act of sacrifice in Anbar province, was Corporal Jason Dunham of Scio, New York. He was given the Medal of Honor--awarded it by President Bush in the White House--for falling on a grenade, for taking the shock and the deadly power of that grenade, thereby saving his colleagues. 
   That is the standard that we have traditionally placed and the metric that we have traditionally placed on this act of heroism of a soldier or of a marine who falls on a grenade or who pulls a grenade under him when it's in close proximity to his buddies, knowing full well that that grenade will most likely kill him but making that split-second decision to give his life for his colleagues and for his country. 
   Sergeant Rafael Peralta made that decision. 
   Mr. Speaker, it appears to me that he should have been awarded the same award that Jason Dunham and many before him have been awarded in Vietnam--the same theater that Mr. Reyes fought in--in Korea, in World War II. Where we have recognized that standard of a soldier or of a marine who falls on a grenade or who pulls it to him to save his colleagues, we have traditionally recognized that act of heroism, that act of sacrifice with the Medal of Honor. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I intend to ask the President--and I hope a number of other people join me to ask the President--to review this award and to award to Rafael Peralta, posthumously, the same award that we awarded just a few months ago to Corporal Jason Dunham.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I want to thank my great colleague for yielding to me. And let me just say, Mr. Speaker, that I am unalterably against this deal because I think it doesn't fix the basic defect that we have seen in every trade deal that we have made in recent years. That defect is, as most of my colleagues know and understand, that the competitors to American businesses get their value-added taxes rebated to them by their home governments and they in turn charge us what effectively is a tariff in the same amount as that value-added tax when our products go to their country, and we didn't change this in this Peru Free Trade Agreement. It's not really free trade, it's only free coming in one direction, and that's our direction. 
   Let me explain that very simply. If this podium costs $100 and it is made in Peru and it is going to be shipped to the United States, their value-added tax is 19 percent. That means that as they build this podium in Peru, as they add wood and metal and labor, they pay their government 19 percent value-added tax. That is how they pay their tax burden. We have a direct tax burden known as an income tax and a corporate tax. 
   When they take this particular podium down to the docks to be shipped to the United States, the Government of Peru will give them their money back. They will rebate their taxes to them. Effectively that company will be working tax-free. 
   Now, if you made the other podium in the United States and we shipped it to them under this deal, when that podium gets to Peru to be sold on their showroom floors, the American manufacturer will face a 19 percent fee or tariff. So the Government of Peru under this deal will be allowed to subsidize their guys to the tune of 19 percent and penalize our guys to the tune of 19 percent. 
   Let me just say this is an unfair deal. This is the reason why America has massive trade deficits even to countries that have higher labor rates than the United States. Until we fix that basic defect, all these trade deals are bad deals and they accrue to the detriment of the American worker and the American businessman. 
   Vote ``no'' on this. And I regret I will not be here tomorrow. I have to be away from the floor. I wish the vote could have been held tonight. This is a bad deal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I am offering this amendment on behalf of myself and the gentlelady from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur). 
   And Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment which goes directly to the security of this country, the homeland security of this country, and particularly the border security and the sovereignty of the Nation. 
   We have right now in Texas a project that is underway, a massive project to build a 12-lane highway heading north, presumably funded largely by private funds, which will head north toward Oklahoma. And the understanding that I have, looking at the statements which have been made by the Security and Prosperity Partnership, is that this is part of an overall plan to develop a corridor between Mexico and Canada transiting the United States.  
   Mr. Chairman, the reason for this amendment, which strikes the funds for the administration to spend money with discussion teams and working groups on this particular project, is because this is a project which cries out for congressional oversight, of which right now there is none. Now, as a representative of a border State, and having represented all the California-Mexican border at one time, my questions would be: What security matters are being discussed right now with these thousands of new trucks which will be transiting this 12-lane highway? What percent of the trucks will be checked? What transparency will be involved with respect to the driving records, and more importantly, the criminal records of the people behind the wheels of these trucks? What are the plans in place to put together a security apparatus to ensure that we have more than 1 percent or 2 percent of this vehicular trade checked? 
   Now, this is a working group which is proceeding, which claims that it has no plans to participate in what they call this private program to deliver this 12-lane highway straight across the middle of the United States connecting Mexico and Canada. Yet, in their own description of what they do, they claim that they undertake these working groups to facilitate multimodal corridors and alleviate bottlenecks at the border. 
   Alleviating bottlenecks at the border, Mr. Chairman, when you only are checking 1 to 2 percent of the cargo containers coming in right now, is a code word for less security, these so-called ``fast passes,'' these passes in which you go through the security apparatus in a matter of seconds rather than in a matter of hours. 
   So I think that it's time, before they facilitate this multimodal operation, for the administration to consult Congress. It's time for our oversight. 
   At this point, I would like to yield to the cosponsor of this amendment, the gentlelady from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I join the gentlelady from San Diego, my seat mate, Mrs. Davis, in this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Bible tells us, greater love hath no man than he who lays down his life for a friend. Close behind are those who have served America in war, been captured, been held for long periods of time incommunicado sometimes, from their own colleagues in the particular prison or internment camp, and certainly from their loved ones back in the United States. Those who have to endure in this case, as our POWs did in Vietnam, beatings, brutality, harsh interrogations; and yet those Americans have, in most cases, come out of that furnace of incarceration strengthened. 
   Indeed, as the gentlelady has mentioned, Pete Peterson, John McCain and our own Sam Johnson, who serves with us today, are examples of Americans who endured great difficulty and great hardship, and yet were strengthened and were inspired and had a certain energy that propelled them into this body, and in other cases into the other body, into the U.S. Senate, and they became national leaders. 
   Mr. Speaker, James Michener wrote in his book, The Bridges at Toko-Ri, when the subject of that book, the hero, the guy who had flown off to hit those bridges again and again didn't return because he'd been shot down, in the book, the commander of that aircraft carrier walks out on the deck after it's clear that this pilot's not going to return, and he reflects and asks himself the question, where does America get such men? People who will join the military, who will get into these high performance aircraft, in the case of a Navy pilot, fly off a carrier, which is a little postage stamp floating at sea, go through enemy air defenses and in a very dangerous situation, hit the target and then try to find that small floating postage stamp once again to recover. 
   And of course the counterparts to those Navy pilots are Air Force pilots and Marine pilots who fly off that tarmac, and, in the case of North Vietnam, encountered new technology, Russian-made surface-to-air missiles which were extremely deadly, and knowing that if they didn't get back out to the ocean, where they could at least, if their plane was hit, where they could at least parachute into the ocean, they had a high likelihood of being captured. And again and again and again they got into those aircraft and undertook those missions. 
   Sam Johnson was one of those guys and was shot down on his 25th mission. As the gentlelady said, he earned in his service to our Nation two Silver Stars, three Legions of Merit, the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star with the V device. But he earned something more than that, and that's the gratitude of every American, certainly every Member of this body, and in a way he's very symbolic of this incredible group of heroes known as the American POWs from Vietnam, because he's a lot like a lot of the others that I've met, Mr. Speaker, and I know you've met a lot of them too. Self-effacing, modest, great character, and continuing to serve this country. 
   So I think it's absolutely appropriate that on this 35th anniversary of Operation Homecoming that we honor everyone who served as an American prisoner of war, and especially honor the one who serves today in the House of Representatives, Mr. Sam Johnson. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I think this is a sad day for our country, because we put into place several years ago what we called a bridge fund. I call it the ammo, the armor, the equipment fund. That was a fund that we added to the Defense bill to carry our troops over during the winter months before that spring supplemental, before that extra funding came about in the springtime of the next year. 
   That is important for them, and that gave them a certain confidence level that they were going to be funded without having to take money out of the cash register for the next year, have to delay training exercises, have to delay the equipping of forces back here in the United States. 
   And you know something? We had a bill that was ready to go here. The Defense appropriations bill is something that clearly would sail through, the President would sign it, and there was no risk in this bill that would fund our operations and our warfighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The Democrat leadership now has injected risk, because you have hooked it up with a bill that the President said he is going to veto. That injects risk into this very, very difficult operation. 
   So what do we have with our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, our marines in Afghanistan and Iraq? We have got the uncertainties of war, the dangers of war. We have got the uncertainties that attend their families back here in the United States. And now the Democrat leadership has injected another uncertainty, an uncertainty that they will be funded fully in these difficult months.     
   So you took away this bridge fund, what I call the ammo, the armor, the equipment fund, and the answer you have given us is, well, if the President caves, then the troops will get the money. Holding our troops, our forces, hostage during a time of war is something that this body has never done. 
   I would hope that the Democrat leadership would make an about-face on this. I would hope you would adopt the great position of Democrat Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson, who said, ``In time of war, the best politics is no politics.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I thank my friend for yielding, and with that kind of introduction, I will just shut up and sit down. I thank him for that very kind introduction. 
   I just got back from Iraq with Congressmen Dan Boren and Ken Calvert and Randy Neugebauer. We were at Landstuhl Hospital in Germany, which is the first place where our wounded soldiers and marines are taken after they have been wounded on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. They are stabilized and treated there, and then they are flown back to Walter Reed and Bethesda. 
   We went over the new technologies that are being utilized right now and the new focus being put on our wounded soldiers. Let me tell you, that operation is first class. 
   One thing, and the gentleman talked about Walter Reed and I thought it might be appropriate to bring up an issue that all Members of this body can participate in and help in, and it is this: last year I started in San Diego in Balboa Hospital, which is where a lot of our wounded marines are, and in Walter Reed. We started these forums for getting jobs for our guys and ladies who have gone through their therapy, they are being separated from the service, they have been wounded and they are going to go back into the private sector. 
   So one thing that I thought we would do out in Balboa, and we did one of them here at Walter Reed, was to bring in people from industry and introduce them to our wounded soldiers and marines and try to help get them jobs. Hopefully, a young marine would stand up and say I am a generator mechanic from such and such a town in Vermont or Maine or California or Iowa, and we would be able to match them up with a company that might need such a talent in their company. 
   So we started doing that, and the first session I had was in the dayroom in Balboa Hospital in San Diego, and we actually had CEOs from major corporations in the dayroom and the marines all came in and told us what they did and introduced themselves, and we immediately had a number of people hired right there at that point in time. 
   Well, I got back, and the Armed Services staff told me you may be breaking the law. 
   I said, What are you talking about? 
   They said, We have talked to the ethics lawyers on the Hill and there may be a question if a Member of Congress tries to help somebody get a job with private industry. There is the implication that reciprocal treatment will be required at some point: you are getting a favor and you will give a favor back. 
   I said, What can we do? 
   They said, You need legislation that will end up with the Ethics Committee and House Administration Committee expressly permitting Members of Congress to help get jobs for our wounded soldiers and marines. 
   So last year, a month or two before we broke, we passed a resolution in the full House urging the Ethics Committee and the House Administration Committee to give us express permission to get jobs for our wounded folks. Every Member of the House can help us on this. I know that Vic Snyder who heads up the Personnel Subcommittee on the great Armed Services Committee and John McHugh are very much supportive of this. 
   Hopefully, we will get this recommendation up before the Ethics Committee and the House Administration Committee. At that point I can see this entire House of Representatives doing great work because you can take a young man or woman from a town in America who has had an injury and gone through rehab and is looking to go into the private sector. A lot are staying with the service, but the ones that aren't staying with the service, we could call up the Congressman from that particular district that young person is going back to and find out if there is a company that needs that generator mechanic or that young man or woman who is interested in law enforcement or some other profession.     
   So I think there is a lot of opportunities here and I look forward to working with you and with the great gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hayes) and all of our colleagues to try to put this together.

   Mr. HUNTER. Absolutely. The one thing that we have learned is that when people get concussions, there may be a lasting effect on those concussions, and we talked to several concussion specialists who now are focusing on Landstuhl and when the young people come back, especially when they have been attacked by IEDs, by weapons systems that have a blast effect, to have a new focus on the after effects of having concussions, and so that is something that is being done right now. 
   Typically, in the old days, it was done, of course, in sports medicine, for example, guys that were boxers or played football and took numerous hits, and the effect of numerous concussions was studied and was followed. 
   What we are focusing on here is, you have been in an IED attack or you have had a mortar attack that is close and that gives a concussive effect, it is important to monitor that individual for an extended period of time, not just figure, okay, he was knocked out or she was knocked out, but now they are fine. Monitor them for a period of time. So we have a new focus there in Landstuhl and that focus, it was important to Mr. Neugebauer especially, and DAN BOREN and Mr. Calvert, who were on the trip with me, were all very interested in making sure that the information that is derived from observation of a patient who newly comes in, comes in and is stabilized there, that then is sent to Walter Reed and to Bethesda so there can be follow-up work so that we can treat the entire patient, and maybe that patient has a fragment wound, making sure that you take care of that, but at the same time make sure that we monitor the effects of concussions, which can in some cases have a lasting effect. 
   So it is just one example of new focuses and new technologies that are being placed on our wounded soldiers, and the folks there do a great job. 
   To go to Walter Reed for a minute and this problem we have with the outpatient, the inpatient care is good at Walter Reed. In fact, I was with a wounded Marine and a wounded soldier and it was either the same day or day or two before the story in the Washington Post broke. We have great inpatient capability there. What we have got to have is we have got to have what I would call a family friendly system that is consumer friendly and consumer easy, so that that 22-year-old wife of a Marine corporal, who is undergoing therapy there at Walter Reed and doing rehab there, so that it is easy to walk through the bureaucracy. 
   So we build these bureaucracies. We inadvertently build them, like the one we built up that says now you cannot get a job for a wounded person or you are violating an ethics rule. We get sometimes so twisted and tied up in this multiplicity of rules that we end up losing sight of the real goals of what we are here for. 
   So I think we need to make this a consumer friendly system for a person who has got a lot of things on their mind and maybe has some kids back home and they are coming several hundred miles to get rehab treatment or therapy can easily and quickly walk through the system without having to go through a phonebook thick of regulations and sign a million dotted lines. 
   That is something we can do, one-stop shopping that is easy and simple. That is not bad to have throughout the Federal bureaucracy, but especially when you have military families that have a lot of problems and a lot of things on their mind, we need to have a customer friendly system. That is what we need to develop.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, as we move to vote on the ``bailout'' of weakened institutions in the U.S. and abroad, it is appropriate to address the emerging question: Where does the U.S. go from here? Most instructive is the fact that the nations which appear to be cash-rich in the financial crisis are those which have strong manufacturing based economies ..... China and Japan. China presently holds $502 billion of American debt followed by Japan which tops the list of American creditors with $592 billion in U.S. debt. Following the bailout and the sale of toxic assets to U.S. taxpayers, China and Japan will have additional cash, some of which can be loaned back to the U.S. to pay for the bailout. 
   A few years ago, an American manufacturer seeking a loan package from a major Wall Street firm recalled the threshold condition,  ``before we talk about your loan package, you must tell us when, not if, you are moving your production facility to China.'' This has been the reality for U.S. manufacturers for the past 10 years or so. The defacto tariff, of 17 percent in China's case and 15 percent in Japan's case dampens U.S. exports to those countries and the same tariff; know as the VAT tax subsidizes Japan's and China's industries when those nations rebate the tax to them upon export to the U.S. This built in trade advantage of the VAT tax is not limited to the ``big two'' but is employed by 130 other trading nations to disadvantage the U.S. manufacturers. 
   As a result, thousands of financial advisors last year told their clients that for tax and tariff reasons it made sense to move their production offshore, even when their operations in the U.S. were healthy. 
   The manufacturing bases of Japan and China are now generating the cash needed to purchase big pieces of the U.S. financial community. Mitsubishi UFJ has now acquired about 20 percent of Morgan Stanley for $8.4 billion, China Investment Corporation picked up 10 percent of the bank earlier this year for $5.5 billion. 
   The movement of U.S. manufacturing offshore damages the U.S. in two major ways. The cause of the present economic crisis, the devaluation of U.S. real estate, is contributed to by the growing inability of our citizens to meet substantial mortgage payments with their wages. Service sector jobs do not produce the take home pay that can carry the payment schedule of appreciated homes in the U.S. Manufacturing jobs have historically supported the heart of the 1500 to 2000 square foot home market but now they are scarce. For a long time the housing market itself has represented the last of the major manufacturing effort in the U.S. Homes are simply a composite of material and labor, called ``product'' by home builders. Every community which has experienced a strong home building surge understands the ripple effect of high wages from construction operations. Now this last major manufacturing initiative in the U.S. has ebbed and the toxic-debt left in the wake of over valued real estate packages is resulting in a new debt package, this time for taxpayers, which could reach $700 billion. 
   Now is the time for the U.S. to rebuild our manufacturing base. We should now:

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, as we study the various proposals that are being circulated right now on the economic crisis, I thought I might take a break for just a minute from that and talk about a bright spot in this country and a shining light in this country, and that is two of the individuals in my community, in San Diego, who provided a wonderful bright spot for hundreds and hundreds of young people. 
   The first person I would like to talk about is Rex Cole, who was the head golf pro and manager at a place called Carlton Oaks Golf Course, a public golf course in San Diego County, for many years. Rex Cole was known for the fact that every weekend for almost 40 years, and he is now at Cottonwood Golf Course in East County, he would give free lessons to any young person who wanted to come over and be taught the game of golf. 
   On those Saturdays and Sundays, you would swing by that practice area and you would see that great professional, Rex Cole, out there teaching young people, whether they were 5 years old or 10 or 15, or sometimes 90, teaching them the golf grip and the basic swing and helping them, and not charging a dime. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a time when we are looking to heroes for inspiration. As Ronald Reagan said, you don't  always have to look to great national leaders or military leaders. Heroes are in these communities all around us, and Rex Cole is one of those heroes. He and his wife Karen have seven children and 13 grandchildren, but, beyond that, they have many, many young people who in a very real way have benefited from Rex Cole's mentorship and from his teaching and from his being such a solid, wonderful member of our East County community. 
   The other person I would like to mention is the late Cato Cedillo, who was my District Administrator in San Diego, California, in that East County area. I will never forget Cato going out to schools, to grade schools, and teaching young people how to play golf, and going out to the football field and hitting a few shots out there, and then having each young person pledge to him that they would never take drugs, and then giving each one of them a couple of cut-down golf clubs that he had gotten from various professionals in the area, sometimes from Rex Cole, giving them a couple of cut-down golf clubs and letting them have those clubs and take home a bag of golf balls and start this wonderful game. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I thought it might be kind of nice to talk about two local heroes, two people who gave, and in Rex Cole's case, continue to give so much of their own time and their own substance to the young people in our community.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (UP-ARMORED HUMVEES AND THE PROTECTION OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I thought it might be appropriate at this time, when all of our focus is on the financial crises, to remember that we have just now passed the defense bill out of the House. It is awaiting passage in the Senate. At this time, we have Americans fighting in two theaters of action in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and their protection is paramount to the people of the United States, to this body and, of course, to the Armed Services Committee. 
   I thought it might be appropriate to talk about the precedent that has been established by the Armed Services Committee and by some great staff people on the Armed Services Committee who have helped to ensure that more Americans are protected earlier than they otherwise would have been in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   We just passed the House bill in very difficult circumstances under the great leadership of IKE SKELTON. His staff director, Erin Conaton, is doing a wonderful job, and the minority director, Bob Simmons, is also doing a wonderful job. With their guidance and with the team of staff members behind them and helping them, we managed to get a very complex bill through the House floor very quickly. 
   Back in 2004, we were seeing the roadside bombs increase in Iraq, and we started to see increased casualties WIA, wounded in action, and KIA, killed in action. We were seeing those increased figures flowing out of that combat theater as the insurgents placed more and more bombs along the roadside. 
   We moved very quickly on the Armed Services Committee to get as many armored vehicles, up-armored vehicles, known as up-armored Humvees, into that theater as possible. In 2004, we looked at the plan, the blueprint, to get the 7,000 up-armored vehicles over there very quickly so that soldiers and marines in places like Mosul and Tikrit and Fallujah could have up-armored vehicles. We thought that that schedule took too long and that we saw those 7,000 vehicles coming into country around the end of the year in 2004. 
   So our great staff director, Bob Simmons, who had been an industrialist, who had been a CEO of an aerospace company in San Diego and who had known how to move components and how to move people quickly to get a product finished, went to the Army and asked them why their schedule was as long as it was. They said, you know, we think the driving factor here is the steel. Our schedule for receiving the steel is such that it's not going to be until the end of the year when we get these up-armored Humvees, these protective vehicles, into theater. 
   So Bob Simmons said, ``Why?'' like any good CEO. They said it was the steel production. 
   So he went to the steel companies, and he asked them, ``Why can't you put on more shifts and get this steel produced earlier and get it out to the Army and get those Humvees over there?'' They said, ``You know, we don't think we can get another shift on here, and we don't think that the unions will help us here or will comply with adding another shift to the time schedule.'' 
   So Mr. Simmons said, ``Let me talk to the union leaders,'' and he sat down with the union leaders, and our great staff director talked to them about what was happening in Iraq. They said, ``You know, we have kids in Iraq, and we'll put on another shift, and we'll get that steel out.'' 
   As a result of this, we accelerated the steel to the Army and to the Humvee makers, and we got those Humvees up-armored with more steel between those roadside blasts and those marines and soldiers inside those vehicles. We got those 7,000 Humvees into theater 7 months ahead of time. 
   I want to just say, Mr. Speaker, that it's a blessing to have those honest brokers--those great staff members like Mr. Simmons--and like his great team. I'll just mention a couple of them who worked this issue. John Wason was one of our great team members. Jesse Tolleson is another one. Steve DeTeresa is another. 
   You know, Steve DeTeresa with his team, in working with Lawrence Livermore and in working with DARPA, actually moved the first heavily armored trucks into Iraq, some 130 trucks that were double-hulled, that had two layers of steel and that had a layer of an inch and a quarter of what we call E-glass on the inside of that steel. I've seen some of those trucks that were hit with massive IEDs, with massive roadside bombs, and I've read letters back from the people who drove those trucks, saying, ``Our lives were saved because of the steel on those trucks.'' To my knowledge, none of those 130 or so trucks that were directed to be built by the Armed Services Committee were ever penetrated by fragment from roadside bombs. 
   So thanks to Mr. Simmons and to his great team and to all of his wonderful staff folks on the Armed Services Committee.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding. 
   In a few minutes the President will address the Nation about his plans for Baghdad and the fact that he needs reinforcements, some of them to go to Anbar Province, some of them to work on a three-to-one basis with the Iraqi forces, three Iraqi battalions in each one of these sectors in Baghdad for each American battalion standing behind them. 
   The President has asked for reinforcements, and it would be outrageous if the Democrat leadership in this House denied this country reinforcements for a military operation in a shooting war which continues to this minute.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, we are in the middle of a war in which the battlefield situation changes on a daily  basis. The idea that the gentleman has given us a requirement for the administration to project until 2068, for 50, 60 years as to what is going to happen on the battlefield and what the casualties are going to be; and I believe he has laid out 23 considerations. 
   When you get out that far, Mr. Chairman, this becomes basically an editorial against the war, and I think there are other ways you can put that if you want to frame that particular position. But the idea that we are asking as we sit here and try to figure out what gas prices are going to be in 2 weeks, the idea that we are going to figure out how Iraq is going to be situated half a century from now, I think that is simply something that trivializes our debate on this very critical issue. 
   And let me tell you, 23 factors if we actually put this thing in law, the idea that we are supposed to have our people in uniform devoted to figuring out how to succeed in their mission, how to take care of our people, to have them out there trying to be seers of the future for half a century with respect to a war that is changing on a weekly basis is an enormous burden on people who wear the uniform. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I think we should all vote a resounding ``no'' on this, and let's do analyses that are relevant, that can be utilized. But the idea of sending our people down the pike for a 50-year look at the future I think is not going to be good for this committee and I think it is not going to be productive for the security of the United States. 
   I reserve the balance of my time

   Mr. HUNTER. Reserving the right to object, Madam Chairman, I will not object, except I want to talk to my friend about what he calls earmarks. 
   A couple of years ago when our guys started to get hurt with roadside bombs in Iraq, we realized that there were no jammers to jam those electronic signals that detonate the 155 rounds that were blowing up American Marines and soldiers, no portable jammers. That means while we had the big jammers we carry in the trucks to protect convoys, there were no jammers to protect that squad of Marines or soldiers working through a courtyard in Ramadi or Fallujah. 
   This committee put in $10 million for 10,000, jammers which we researched and developed, manufactured and deployed in the field in 70 days. Those were earmarks. 
   Now, if the gentleman's assertation is true, and the whole theme of his argument here is if the Pentagon doesn't request it, it's not needed, I disagree with it. This is what the Pentagon had for portable jammers for our troops: zero. 
   I can tell the gentleman about the system that we put in that has had a very salutary effect on the ability of the enemy to hurt our troops with mortars, also so-called earmarks. I can tell the gentleman about our surveillance programs that we added to, also so-called earmarks. I could tell the gentleman that I put in the defense budget a couple of years ago, along with my good friend Ike Skelton, an increase in U.S. Marine Corps, taking them up at that point to 180,000. Today nobody suggests that we should somehow discharge those Marines because we added them above and beyond the President's budget. In fact, the President now has come back and said, you know, you guys in the Armed Services Committee were right, and because of that, they put in a request this year for 7,000 more Army troops and 5,000 more Marines. 
   So I would just say to the gentleman it's our job, our responsibility under the Constitution, to build this defense budget. It's not the Pentagon's. In fact, the Constitution doesn't mention the Pentagon. 
   Now, what I do with the initiatives that I put in, I put them on the Internet. How's that for disclosure? I think at least a couple hundred people see that. Now, with respect to how many people see these, we put out the directive report language. Everybody sees that. But you mark up your subcommittees only a few days, sometimes as much as a week but rarely longer, before you go to full committee. And so the tables that have all of the numbers in them, and it's got hundreds and hundreds of entries, are available to any Member that wants to come by and ask for them. But we're not going to put those out to the press and cause a massive circus of contractors and media people swarming the committee when we're trying to get our job done. We have never done it like that. 
   But the disparaging way in which the gentleman talks about things that we put in, some of which are crucial to the survival of your constituents, the young men and women who joined the Marine Corps and the Army from your district, I think is misplaced. 
   The building of the defense budget is a very important thing. It's a thing that we do often in disagreement with the Pentagon. We have put in additional aircraft carriers when you had Presidents who didn't want to put them in because we thought they were important to the survival of this country, and we turned out to be right. We have increased end strength in the Army and Marine Corps. We have done most of the work on UAVs, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. That means you don't get pilots shot down. That means you're able to disperse many more platforms that can gather information.     
   The things that we put in the defense budget are generally done after a lot of thought, a lot of analysis and, generally speaking, they have been very good for our troops.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Let me take back my time and explain to the gentleman why it's important to have report language. You start programs and you also put policies in place. If you put those in the bill and those are locked into law and then you get a call from the administration and they say, You know, we looked at this thing and there's not enough long-lead materials to build this. You are strait-jacketed. The administration can't come back and say, We want to reprogram. At that point, you have to change the law. 
   If you have a policy, and here you have wars in two theaters, if you have a policy you have to change, you can't just call up and you can't work the policy out with the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Marine Corps. You now have to go back and change the law. If you have looked at the reprogramming requests that are made by the Pentagon, they are usually made with respect to some factor that has changed. You would have hundreds of changes that now require changes in the law, and in a very real way, having report language that gives flexibility to the administration, is for their benefit. 
   Now we can put all this stuff in the law if that is the requirement to do it. But it doesn't make sense, either for us or for the administration. That is why you have it, because you have changing situations and you have got to have the flexibility for people to call up and say, You know, we just developed another system that is better than that one. Let's not continue to fund that in a straitjacket. Let's go ahead and reprogram and go to the other one. Or maybe we have a priority. Maybe we need ammunition, maybe we need more ammunition. So we want you to take money from this program and put it into ammunition. You can't do that if everything is in statute.

   Mr. HUNTER. If you take the gentleman's argument to its ultimate conclusion, that means the portable jammers, the ones that only weigh a couple of pounds that we gave to our marines to save their lives so they can carry them, because you can't carry the 150-pounders on your back when you're on a patrol, they would not have gotten those because they weren't in the Pentagon's budget. 
   The point that I am making is that the Pentagon often misses things. They don't have always the best judgment in this world. I point to guys like the chairman of the Defense Appropriations in the full committee, Mr. Lewis, who, by many people, is considered one of the fathers of the Predator. The Predator aircraft has saved lives because it's allowed us to do recon and striking without having to have a pilot out there who may be shot down and have to be recovered. That was a program that required a lot of pushing against the will of the Pentagon. 
   So I disagree with the gentleman's argument that somehow anything the Pentagon disagrees with is illegitimate. We've had, in many cases, a better idea than the Pentagon, and the increases in the Army and Marine Corps are two of the great examples. This committee said you have to increase it, and we increased it. You call that an earmark. Today, the administration calls it the right thing to do.

   Mr. HUNTER. Taking back my time, I don't think we are going to be appropriating any melting shirts, or authorizing any melting shirts. We do serious stuff. 
   And when you have a defense bill which is over $500 billion and it has thousands and thousands of provisions in it, I would say that the number of changes we make actually is fairly minimal. 
   If you look at the massive amount of money that is spent on defense, the change that we make in scoping the defense bill, which is not only our prerogative, it's our mandate, it doesn't say: You shall accept and rubber-stamp what the Pentagon puts out there. And experience has shown us. And, thankfully, we have followed our mandate because we have put in systems that have saved lives, that the Pentagon didn't think about, and we have put in more systems that have made us more effective at fighting the Nation's war that the Pentagon didn't think about. 
   We have got members on the committee, I would say to my friend, who have taken five, six, seven, eight trips to Iraq and Afghanistan. They see things. They write down notes. We have our professional staff with us. We were out there looking at the Fourth Division and we saw some of their trucks whose armor consisted of two layers of plywood, with sandbags in between. That is why we went back and on an initiative we put together double-hulled trucks. To my knowledge, none of those double-hulled trucks has yet been penetrated by any enemy shrapnel from a roadside bomb. We do things in response to what we think the solders and sailors and airmen and marines need. 
   So I agree with the gentleman that we should all be accountable for what we put in a bill, whether it's a defense bill or something else, and you have got to stand up. If it's a bad one, you take the heat for it. But just saying anything that doesn't come out of the administration is, by definition, illegitimate, is absolutely not accurate. 
   I can just tell you this. If you end up with an administration that you don't agree with, like some Republicans who didn't agree with what President Carter did with defense spending in the last part of his term, when we put in, along with some pretty discerning Democrats, an extra aircraft carrier, and if you want to straitjacket this body, where a President that you don't agree with, who you feel is cutting defense spending to the bone, and maybe beyond the bone, where, as a rule, if he or she doesn't agree or doesn't put that out as a defense budget, you consider it your duty to not add a single cent, then I think we are putting ourselves in a position where we are disserving the people that we represent, because our job is to put together a defense budget.

   Mr. HUNTER. Taking my time back, I would just say to the gentleman, I put my initiatives, and I don't call them earmarks because I don't think they are illegitimate, I put them on the Internet. As I learned in my ill-fated national campaign, people aren't paying a lot of attention to my Internet site. But I had it there for millions of people to see. And I think that is the appropriate thing to do. 
   I just want to assure the gentleman of something so that he rests easy, to some degree. The people of this committee are really hardworking people. I think we have got one member who's been to Afghanistan and Iraq something like 13 times. I haven't been there that much, but I have been there a lot. They spend a ton of time working for the uniformed people of the United States. They make lots of notes and they do lots of analysis. 
   Let me tell you, the way you put together a defense budget is you have got somebody sitting in the Pentagon, and somebody comes over and sits next to him and says, You know, here's a system that the company I am working for would like to have in the defense budget. And they make a case for it. 
   None of this stuff is derived through a stainless process. We are all people. The only thing that really makes this government go is accountability, and people should be held accountable for the things that they put in the bill. The vast number of folks that put things in the defense bill put out press releases with respect to what they put in. They don't hide that. People put in provisions that have a value to the military. If you go down the line and analyze them, I think that you would concur with that. 
   So I want you to know this is a committee that really does its homework. It's got a great staff that works very hard, and we have done a lot of things that have saved soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines on the battlefield, who  would not have been saved if we just rubber-stamped the President's budget. I guess that is my point. 
   I thank the gentleman. 
   I withdraw my reservation.

   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Chairman, let me go over the adequate safeguards that are currently in place. The contract must specify the interrogation support. All support must be in accordance with applicable law and policy. They must be trained and certified, in-theater training. They must be closely supervised and monitored. They will not oversee, direct or monitor interrogations. They operate only in fixed facilities. They must submit a written interrogation plan. And, lastly, they are subject to prosecution. 
   Let me say to my friend from Virginia and the author of this amendment, because they are both friends and I know their hearts are in the right place, I have observed one interrogation, one of the first times I have seen an interrogation. It was an older lady reading a children's book to a detainee. 
   I said, ``You gotta be kidding me.'' I expected all the classic stuff like we see in the movies. And our escort said, ``Are you kidding?'' They said, ``This lady is one of the most effective people we have, and she does extremely well.'' I believe she was a contractor. She sure as heck wasn't a uniformed service person. 
   Now, my point is that there is a lot of psychology, that there is a lot of art to this, there is a lot of human relations. And if you have prohibitions against coercive behavior, and we have got rows of those in all of our manuals, if you have got somebody that you can contract with who can walk into a room and walk out maybe 2 days later, maybe 8 days later, maybe 6 months later with information that will save the lives of your troops and advance the mission, who cares if that is an elderly lady who happens to be a civilian and may not want to join the Army?

   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Chairman, I would just say to my colleagues that you do have to be certified, you do have to be trained, you have to be supervised, and you are subject to prosecution. So our special operators have laid down a pretty strict set of guidelines. And the last thing that I saw coming from the department was that this would severely hamper Special Operations' capability if it was passed. 
   Now, that may be because many of the things Mr. Thornberry talked about with respect to language, with respect to availability. I think we should respect what the warfighters say about this and get more information before we take a vote like this. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for debate has expired. 
   The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

   Mr. HUNTER. I am going to yield to Mr. Thornberry, but first let me just say this. I respect the gentleman who just made the statement who has been in Iraq. But my son was in Iraq, also, and on two missions, two tours, and Afghanistan. And one important fact that I think comes out when you talk to folks who have been there is the exigency of the battlefield. That is the  need to do things quickly, to be creative, to be able to move quickly to save the lives of your comrades and to carry out your mission. 
   Now, let's think about this. You have to videotape interrogations. What happens if you have got people coming in, moving in a pincer movement against a particular area, maybe some buildings, maybe you have got some machine gun fire, and you have been hitting IEDs, and you capture somebody and you have got people in movement. And you have to bring up then the video cameras to interrogate before you can have a successful interrogation. And what if you don't have video cameras? You are going to have people who are deterred from being able to do that because they are going to be worried that somehow they are going to be found in violation of the rules. 
   Now, we have got a letter here from the Under Secretary of Defense who says that the Defense Department very strongly opposes this requirement to video record all intelligence interrogations. They say: This requirement runs contrary to sound Defense Department policy, which relies upon careful selection and empowerment of the chain of command to execute the mission. Currently, commanders video record interrogations only after determining that the environment is conducive and the recordings will add value to the mission. 
   I might add that if you have interrogations, especially if you have got special operators who are out among the population and you lose one of the recordings, then you expose them to enormous risk. 
   So the idea of making this not discretionary and mandating it I think doesn't make a lot of sense.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman for his answer. But if you have a situation where you are doing intel interrogations close to the battlefield, which you are in many places, a matter of minutes or hours could make the difference between life and death. And if you don't have video equipment available, which you wouldn't have in many of those cases, you could still have what I would call a disastrous result. 
   I yield such time as he might consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).

   Mr. HUNTER. I want to yield very quickly to Dr. Gingrey. But first, we have that list, and any Member can go look at it but it is not made available to the public. And I think there is a safety issue here. I think there is a safety issue with respect to the families, the children, the wives of the folks that attend this particular institution.     
   And you know something else? 
   We applaud our military people regularly. We acknowledge that they're some of the most honorable of citizens. We trust them with the lives of our children and in battles in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   And yet it seems like the amendments that come up show quite a bit of distrust. We don't trust our interrogators, so now we're going to videotape them as if they were stealing candy at a 7-Eleven because we don't trust them. 
   And here we don't trust these great military folks that run WHINSEC who, I think, are going to have a salutary effect on the leaders that come from other countries that come to this school. 
   Americans are the best. Our military people are often the very best ambassadors for this country. And the idea that we continue to try to close down the best ambassadors, so that the people who will offer schools to them are people like Hugo Chavez, I think that doesn't make a lot of sense. 
   So as much as I respect my colleague who is offering this amendment, I would hope that my colleagues would vote against it. 
   I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey.

   Mr. HUNTER. I understand that. 
   The way it's drafted, it appears to me that it's a flat prohibition, and any organization with even one U.S. citizen might be precluded from using this business form, which I think is a far more anticompetitive approach than the gentleman might want. 
   My feeling is this, that if we approve this amendment, I would hope that the gentleman would work in conference to make sure that it's narrowed to this focus on making sure that these companies pay taxes and that it doesn't have some kind of exclusionary or unintended consequence. 
   Will the gentleman work with us in conference?

   Mr. HUNTER. I would yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Madam Chairman and my colleagues, we have general officers, flag officers who go over to Iraq, Afghanistan just as they have gone to every war theater we've fought in. They talk to their colleagues. Their colleagues give them the facts as they see the facts. They come back. They repeat those facts, the ones that they concur in, and they draw conclusions. 
   Now, they do that on dozens and dozens of talk shows and other media outlets throughout the United States. Some of them are for the operation and some of them are against the operation. 
   The idea, and this sounds like something we might want to adopt for our campaigns because I've found myself falling prey to this now and again, thinking what my opponent said was propaganda, what I said was the absolute truth. But how about the General McCaffreys who come back, having talked to their friends in theater, and they come back and give their set of facts and they say, therefore, we don't think things are going well, as opposed to the general who goes over and talks to friends in the theater, some of them the very same people, and they come back and say our conclusion is that things are going well. 
   The idea that we take this great resource, and I understand this is directed at general officers who go over to the theater, come back, appear in the American media, and give their take on where they think this war is going. I think that's a great asset for this country, and I say that, even though I've appeared many times opposite general officers and flag officers who have the opposite opinion from mine. But it's a great resource to have people that have that background and are able to look at the situation and come back and give their opinion freely. 
   The idea that the people who agree with the operation over there are giving propaganda, but the generals who have come back and said that we think there is a problem with this operation, and there are quite a few of them, that somehow their point is right on and they are precisely accurate and they are serving the public, that's nonsense. 
   You've got to let your general officers go over, make an evaluation, come back, give that evaluation, and we get to cross-examine them in committee, as we often do. We'll have people on both sides who have seen the same wars and the same operations and come to different conclusions. 
   The idea that we are going to label the people we don't agree with propagandists and the ones that agree with us are philosophers and statesmen is kind of a zany idea. 
   Let's let all of our general officers, let's look at them as a great resource, whether they agree with us or not. I've always said that, even about the folks that come back and have a totally opposite view from mine. I've always said this is a great resource to have retired military people with a long background, who go over, have these insights, make an evaluation and come back and give us that evaluation. 
   Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, we've had it on both sides on the Afghanistan and the Iraq operations. We've seen guys like General Zinni come back and give a viewpoint totally opposite the administration. Yet I listen to that gentleman. I greatly respect him. I think he's got a lot of wisdom. I disagree with him in some cases. 
   But the idea that we call the people who disagree with us propagandists and the other ones great seers and statesmen and philosophers doesn't make any sense.     
   Let's let everybody come back and exercise the right to free speech, and let's not have any of these inhibiting amendments. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Chairman, let me say this: I have always greatly respected the ability of our guys, this great resource that we have of flag officers--and nonflag officers, incidentally, NCOs and company grade officers--to go over to a warfighting theater and come back and bring you the news, whether it's good or bad. In fact, I've hosted forums in the Armed Services Committee when I brought in dissenting officers who would come back and tell us what they thought was wrong with the war because you've got to listen to it. If you're going to shape good policy, you've got to hear both sides to these things. 
   I would just say to my colleagues who say, well, these people were hosted; they came over and they were hosted. Listen, you have respected people like General Zinni and Barry McCaffrey and other respected leaders and generals, and they go over to a warfighting theater, you can bet that they are hosted by their colleagues that they grew up with in the military, fought alongside with, and that's absolutely appropriate. And you can bet that they were given transport and they got to look at the operations, they got to give their analysis. And you know something? That has value. I always want to see the guy that thinks that the operation isn't going well and listen to his remarks and his comments. 
   So the idea that we're going to label the guys who we don't agree with as having been ``propagandized'' and we're going to label the guys we agree with as being seers and prophets and truth tellers, that just doesn't work. 
   We've all been surprised. As you look at this array of general officers, often you'll say, I would have bet that that guy likes the operation. You talk to him and he says, ``no, I don't like it, I think we're there for the wrong reason, I don't think it's going to work.'' And the guy that you thought probably is not going to support it says, you know, I've seen this, this, this and this, and I agree with the operation. 
   You want to listen to all of them. And the idea that we're going to crunch down on them and also the idea that somehow Don Rumsfeld got these people in a room and told them what to say, if you believe that, you don't believe in the independence of these general officers. None of them are used to having people tell them what to say. They're independent. They're a source of information to us. They're a valuable resource. And we ought to respect all of them. We ought to urge them all to go to theater, come back with their remarks and their comments.

   Mr. HUNTER. If the gentleman will yield, and I'd hoped that Mr. Spratt would concur with this. It is important, I think, for the Members of this body, because the first thing we ask when we do intelligence briefings, we say, How far away is that Nation or those particular people from developing enough material or having enough of a program to build a weapon, a device, a nuclear weapon. So in commonsense language that is the question we ask. 
   So the gentleman has put the word milestones, as the gentleman from New York said, in this particular report. I would hope that we could define that as we go into conference in terms of material necessary to build a device, and to receive some specifics on that so that we don't have a vague question that the community may have a problem in determining precisely what we mean.

   Mr. HUNTER. I would simply say that this is an important amendment and one that I support strongly, and I think most of the members of the committee support strongly. 
   This is a joint effort. It's not just a DOD effort, when we discussed the two warfighting theaters and the standing up of a government that will be an ally of the United States and will have a modicum of democracy. It's important to have the other agencies that are so critical to this effort, to the coordination of this effort, that is, the Department of State and the USAID administrator, to be involved to ensure that we do have coordination and cooperation. 
   At this time, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to yield to Mr. Forbes, the gentleman from Virginia, 3 minutes.

And it's only appropriate that, because this is an effort that requires other agencies, besides DOD, that we have a mechanism to get them together, move them together in a true jointness.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank my great colleague for yielding to me. 
   My friends, this is the age of missiles. The people that we listen to so carefully in our hearings are the combatant commanders. Those are the guys who are in charge of running military operations in the case of an attack on the United States or a military operation or a contingency. 
   Our combatant commanders have reported to us that we are short missile defense. Specifically, they have said that we should nearly double the inventory of THAAD and Aegis Standard Missile Interceptors. And I quote from Admiral Keating. He said increased inventories are needed, and he goes through these short-range BMD systems that are so key to countering this emerging threat, like the one that is coming from North Korea, like the Shahab-3 being developed now by Iran, and by the increasing short-range and medium-range ballistic missile inventories around the world. 
   This is crucial to the survival of our troops in theater and to the survival of the United States in wars that are going to occur in the future, and in the least we should listen to the combatant commanders and plus these inventories up. That is what the gentleman from Arizona's amendment does, and I would recommend it to all Members. 
   Vote ``yes'' on Franks.

   Mr. HUNTER. I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   My colleagues, we are in a race against those who would build offensive missiles and in fact have built missiles. 
   I remember, I think it was 1987 when members of this committee, the Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to the leadership of Israel, and we said this--and I know this because I drafted that letter. We said, at some point in the future--and this was 1987, before the Gulf War. We said, you will be attacked at some point in the future by probably Russian-made missiles coming from a neighboring country. And even though you could defend against an aircraft attack, just as you did in the Bekaa Valley with your F-16s, you will not be able to stop a single incoming ballistic missile coming into Israel. 
   A few years later in the Gulf War, we saw just that. In fact, we saw ballistic missiles kill Americans. Some of them were shot down by deployed Patriots, but we saw missiles coming into Israel totally unprotected. We saw people being rushed to the hospital not from the effects of the missiles, but because they were so afraid that poison gas would be on the head of those missiles launched by Saddam Hussein, that many people went into the hospital with heart problems. 
   We are in a race, my friends, my colleagues, and we have seen the manifestations of that race on the other side. We have seen those TD-2s and those NoDong missiles and SCUD missiles launched by the North Koreans that fell into the Sea of Japan, the TD-2 having the ability now to reach some parts of the United States. We have seen the tests of the Iranian Shahab-3s. We have seen now the complicity of North Korea and Syria in developing nuclear weapons capability, which was stopped short by a strike that was made by our allies. We know that that throat through which the Iranian missiles might one day travel going into  Western Europe could be defended by the missile sites that we have now proposed to be established in Czechoslovakia and Poland. 
   We are in a race. Our combatant commanders tell us that we need to double the number of THAAD missiles and Aegis missiles. Incidentally, those sea-based missile system are testing out very, very well. We have had a series of successes. 
   The idea that we cut back on this one massive area of vulnerability, that we cut back on defenses against this massive area of vulnerability--and for my friends that said we want to use this money for quality of life for our troops, ladies and gentleman, I am the father of one of our marines who has been deployed, and let me tell you quality of life. It is when that family that is sitting there in Pendleton or in Savannah, Georgia, or at Fort Bragg or in Camp Lejeune knows that their family member, their servicemember is not going to be vulnerable to a short-range or ballistic missile attack. That gives you quality of life, because that gives you assurance that they are going to be able to survive that very, very real threat which is now being developed. 
   This is a misplaced amendment, and I would urge everyone to vote against it.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I started off by talking about that letter that the Armed Services Committee, Democrats and Republicans, sent to Israel in 1987 telling them that at some point in the future they would be attacked by ballistic missiles coming from a neighboring nation, probably Russian-made missiles, and that was a prophetic letter because in the Gulf War they were attacked. And I described some of the effects. Even though there wasn't poison gas on those missiles, they had an incredible effect, a traumatic effect on the citizens of Israel. 
   You know, we could have written a letter to ourselves and to our own leadership and the administration at that time and said, at some point ballistic missiles will be launched at the United States. 
   I don't take much comfort from Mr. Tierney's statement that he only wants to stop the funding of long-range missile defense systems, not short-range missile defense systems. We've had a series of successes with our long-range missile defense systems. We've had these collisions 148 miles above the surface of the Earth, the interceptor and the target missile both going about three times the speed of a .30-06 bullet. And because of the incredible dedication of our scientists and our engineers, we've been able to achieve some successes with these long-range missile defense systems. 
   The facts are, you have to defend against all types, against short-range, medium-range and long-range. And you have to try to get as many shots as you can at these missiles. If you can get them when they're taking off, if you can get them in the ascent phase, if you can get them in mid course, then you don't put as much pressure on that terminal missile defense system when they're coming in to American cities. 
   We are in a race, Mr. Chairman. And I would just remind my colleagues that the TD-2 missile, which was tested by the North Koreans, has the ability, according to some of our scientists, to reach parts of the United States of America. And our intelligence people tell us that Iran, it is estimated, will have, by 2015, the capability with ICBMs to reach parts of the United States of America. 
   Just in time is a concept for building products in our domestic economy. You get the steel just in time to build the car so that you don't have a big inventory of steel piling up. That saves you money. You're not paying interest on it. You get the tires just in time to put them on. 
   Just in time missile defenses is not a very good idea. We, in my estimation, we are behind the clock. And Mr. Tierney's amendment is a gutting amendment. We should vote ``no'' on this amendment.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman for bringing this amendment, and we lament the fact that our nuclear warheads are getting older, that we don't have a testing regime in place any longer and that that necessarily deteriorates the reliability factor. So the idea was let's build a reliable replacement warhead, and the fact that we haven't proceeded down that path is really a tragedy. 
   Now, I know the gentleman has $10 million in this amendment for this Reliable Replacement Warhead. He takes some money from the energy conservation program, which has many, many good aspects. I know that some Members are torn between these two important goals, one of developing energy  conservation on military bases, and the other developing this warhead. 
   I come down, Mr. Chairman, on the side of ensuring that this critical asset, which is a very, very important part of America's security apparatus, that is, a reliable strategic deterrent, I come down on that side. As a result of that, I support Mr. Pearce's amendment very strongly.

   Mr. HUNTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   First, Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate Mr. Boren who is a great member of the Armed Services Committee for bringing this amendment, and I think we recognize a real problem with section 526, which is really a section, and his amendment does take away some of the onus of section 526. 
   Section 526 really weds us to high-grade Middle Eastern oil. It says that if you come up with other types of fuel that are alternatives, but that might have a greenhouse gas footprint higher than this high-end Middle Eastern oil, and there are very few types of petroleum-based fuels which do that, you can't use it. 
   Mr. Boren has taken some of the onus off of that by saying that if it's not predominantly that type of oil, meaning you can use, for example, tar sands from Canada and other types, that section 526 does not apply. 
   Now, the problem is, I'm reading the last of the amendment, and one of the conditions is that the contracts under which this petroleum product would flow says the contract--and I'm quoting from the last of the amendment--the contract does not provide incentives for a refinery upgrade or expansion to allow a refinery to use or increase its use of fuel from a nonconventional petroleum source. 
   And I think we should be doing everything we can to expand refineries. I don't think we've built a refinery in decades, and we all sat in this Chamber and watched gas prices go through the roof here not too long ago when they had just a couple of refineries down for repair. 
   So I know Mr. Boren's heart's in the right place, and he's brought us at least halfway across the river here. I guess what I'd like to see is the double Boren amendment that takes us all the way and eliminates section 526. 
   I congratulate the gentleman. I know a lot of our Members are going to probably support this because it, in fact, does take us part way home. I wish we could go all the way, and I thank the gentleman for his amendment. 
   I reluctantly oppose it because I would like to see the full loaf here. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise to oppose this amendment because of my great respect for the gentlewoman. But this Status of Forces Agreement is something that we've done now in over 80-some countries. And it's not a guarantee of security. It's not a guarantee of defense. It is not and should not be considered as a treaty. It is simply for the protection of American soldiers and American civilian personnel. 
   It sets out, for example, if you are sued, if you're charged with a criminal action, there has to be an agreement between the countries as to how people are treated, that is, how American personnel are treated, and under the agreement that Iraq has made with the United States. 
   Now, Secretary Gates has testified to us in the Armed Services Committee, and he has been asked about the SOFA, and he has said there are no security guarantees in this SOFA. We're going to have the same team that has done SOFAs, these Status of Forces Agreements, in many other countries, moving in to do the same Status of Forces Agreement that will go over the same types of things. And, again, this does not rise to the level of a treaty because this is not going to be an agreement with respect to security guarantees for Iraq. It will contain no security commitment, and it will not obligate force structure or troop strength or assure any other security guarantees. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, this is not a treaty. And I appreciate the gentlewoman's statements and her intent, and there may be at some point an agreement between Iraq and the United States that will be a treaty with respect to security commitments. This doesn't do it. What this does is protect American personnel. We need it and we need to negotiate it. We need to get it done. It's not a treaty, and we should not make it subject to ratification by Congress. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, once again, these Status of Forces Agreements, which are pretty run of the mill, do not manifest security commitments by the United States to protect the countries that they are made with. They talk about the treatment and describe the treatment of Americans with respect to getting licenses, licensing their vehicles, how they're going to be treated in cases of civil or criminal actions. Basically how the American who is in that particular foreign country, and again we have got 80 of them that we have done, how they are going to be treated by that host country. 
   Now, they are not security commitments, and if you have something that does, in fact, commit the United States to a security agreement with another country, and in this case Iraq, I have no dispute with my colleagues, that at that point you have a treaty, and a treaty, because it manifests commitments, has to be ratified. 
   But I don't understand why we are saying that the Status of Forces Agreement, which is going to talk about how our troops are treated in the same way that we talk about how American military personnel who are in Germany or Japan or 80 other countries are treated, how that now becomes something special because it's Iraq and, in the case of Iraq alone, we have to have a ratification by Congress.     
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Once again, the gentlelady talked about a strategic framework agreement. That does manifest security commitments, and that does have to be ratified. But that is not the Status of Forces Agreement. The Status of Forces Agreement is simply about the treatment of American military personnel in that particular place. We are talking about two different things; one that has to be ratified and the other that doesn't. And I have heard no good argument as to why, of the 80 Status of Forces Agreements that we have around the world, why this one has to be ratified by Congress and none of the others have to be. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I would just say to my colleagues, including the gentleman from Washington who spoke I think somewhat disparagingly of the President, this is part of the duties of an administration anywhere where you have American troops. You lay down rules of how they are going to be treated with respect to civil actions, criminal actions, licensing of vehicles, payment of taxes, all the things that affect a person who is now physically residing in that foreign country, whether it's an American civilian or a military guy who's stationed there. It's a necessary thing. 
   The idea that we are going to elevate this thing, which has been a fairly ministerial thing, to a treaty on the basis that the people who are speaking don't like the President doesn't make any sense. You know, when the Secretary of Defense comes in, testifies to our committee that there will be no commitments manifest in this particular SOFA with respect to security, he testifies to us to that effect, the idea that we say we are not going to believe him, and certain members of the other side don't like the President so they come down to say anything he does now has to be ratified by Congress, I think that disparages the process, Mr. Chairman. 
   We have got a fairly run-of-the-mill ministerial thing that we need to do and, once again, I say to my colleagues, this protects American personnel. The same team that has negotiated this with presumably dozens of countries and gone over the same ministerial stuff with respect to how people are treated in that country, will be talking to the Iraqi leadership and making that same negotiation on those same points. 
   So the idea that we now elevate this to a treaty; if a treaty is coming with this strategic framework, that does have to be ratified by Congress, and should be ratified by Congress. But let's not mix the two up. Let's protect our personnel and then let's move to this ratification or this decision of what any security commitments might be. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Just one other point, and that is in the U.N. Security Council Resolution, under which our troops operate now, which provides for how they are treated in Iraq, expires in December. That is why we need to have a Status of Forces Agreement. If we don't have, and we now elevate this to a treaty, and Congress doesn't act on the treaty, they will lose their protection when the United Nations provision expires. 
   It doesn't make sense to put this onus on them, that somehow we are going to raise this thing to a treaty level and Congress, by golly, is going to have to now ratify it before we can decide how an E-5, a sergeant with a couple of stripes, living in Baghdad, how he is going to be treated with respect to the laws of that country. It doesn't make a lot of sense. 
   I think we ought to leave this thing alone. When we go to any treaties that actually manifest security commitments by the United States, certainly that has to be then ratified by Congress. This isn't one of them. It will be the 81st SOFA that we have had without requiring Congress to ratify it.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, first let me express my great respect for the gentleman who is offering this amendment. He does wonderful work on the committee and truly has a heart for those who have been impacted by the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   On that point, I would say I remember the time we were in Fallujah and a young Marine captain came up to us with some language he had written. In fact, his name was Kevin Coughlin. He thinks he has traded up. He moved on to the FBI from the committee staff. But we were so impressed with the language he had written to protect translators that we brought him back with us and made him part of the HASC staff. He did leave us a ``Dear John'' note after he left to go to work for the FBI, but a great young Marine captain. And he felt the same way we had, which is that our translators needed to be protected. 
   We have a program which protects them. Now, the question here is, are we going to mandate employment for them? That is the way I read this particular legislation. I don't think that is the right way to go. 
   I think that, first, a lot of these folks have got great initiative. They are happy to be in a free country. If we have a program to help make sure they know of all the job opportunities that are available and perhaps help them with language, make sure that they are connected with folks that are recruiting our people who need those language talents, I think that is great. 
   But I think the idea, at least the way I read this thing, that there is mandated employment, I think that is  going a step far. I think it is something we haven't done for other folks. In this case we have taken people and their families who helped the United States and we have relocated them in the greatest country in the world with the freedom to travel all these new roads that they have never been able to travel before. 
   But I think, for one thing, that the idea of guaranteed employment, if they have got a lot of spirit and a lot of initiative, that is the first way to kill spirit and initiative, is to give a guaranteed lifetime job to someone. I think we ought to take these folks who have this great energy, they have obviously displayed a loyalty to the United States, help them hook up with these thousands and tens of thousands of employers, including those in the government, but not have a program that guarantees employment. 
   So I thank the gentleman for the spirit of his amendment. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the remarks of both Mr. Israel and the ranking member. I am just looking at the language, and it says ``shall offer employment.'' So it clearly says, if I was going to read that as an agency head, I would say that means I must hire these folks. 
   Again, this committee worked to make sure that they got over here, that they were protected and that their families were protected, and I am glad we did that. I will offer my small offices. We have had jobs fairs at Bethesda and Walter Reed for our returning wounded warriors where we bring people from industry and we bring people from the agencies and we try to get them together with our wounded vets who are returning and help them to match up and get jobs. I would be happy to do the same thing with respect to these interpreters. And, indeed, interpreters have special skills. This should be something that can be done. 
   The only thing I would object to is the mandated job. We don't offer that to our veterans. I just think that is a step a little bit too far. But I would be happy to work with the gentleman in terms of helping them to access jobs. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Israel). 
   The amendment was agreed to. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Committee will rise informally.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my great friend from Washington for his kind remarks, and also thank the Rules Committee and the gentleman from California for his work on this bill too. 
   We have had a great opening session on the Armed Services bill. Our chairman, Mr. Skelton, who brought this bill up and brought it through the committee with a unanimous vote, I think is to be greatly commended. But let me register my objection to the Rules Committee's determination that one of the amendments that I had offered was not made in order, and that is the amendment that goes to the so-called tanker deal. 
   Let me just explain to my colleagues that this tanker deal involves hundreds of thousands of American jobs. The Air Force has determined that the European competitor has won the tanker contest. This buy could ultimately be in excess of some $30 billion, so there are enormous numbers of American jobs at stake. 
   As we went through the markup process, the Members on both sides indicated that they didn't want to try to pass something that would in some way prejudice the GAO protest which is being undertaken right now. But let me tell you as a guy who has looked at the industrial base and the fact that big pieces of our industrial base are moving offshore at a rapid rate, at some point that is going to affect our ability to defend this country. 
   This is a huge deal. It is a huge transfer of high-paying aerospace jobs, basically a massive economic stimulus package for Europe. Even with the 58 percent of the tanker work that is stated by the European company will be built in the United States, that still is 42 percent of the work that will not be built in the United States, and that is compared to the American company, which does about an 85-15 split. 
   Now Cap Weinberger talked about this formula that he used, that for every $1 billion you create of defense spending, you create 30,000 jobs. That means that the number of jobs at stake here, the difference between going with the European competitor or the American competitor, is well over 100,000 American high-paying aerospace jobs. 
   All my amendment said was this: It said that no matter who won, 85 percent of the work had to be done in the United States. That is important to keep our industrial base intact. For those folks that like the European competitor and the American company that was marrying up with it, that is Northrop Grumman, a great company that would be building the European aircraft, that would have been good for them, because they would then, instead of having 58 percent of the work done in the United States, they would have had, if my amendment had been offered and passed, that would have allowed them to get 85 percent of the work done in the United States.

   Mr. HUNTER. That would have meant jobs for the American workers, and it would have meant that we kept a lot of that talent pool, that industrial base capability, in the United States. This would have been a huge win for American workers and it would not have prejudiced the present GAO protest that is underway right now. 
   So I am disappointed that this amendment was not allowed, and I hope at some point down the line the Democrat leadership will allow us to put this amendment up, which will help American workers, help the industrial base, and help to secure the defense of the United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, we finished this defense bill today and we have got a couple of gentlemen who are retiring from public office. We have two gentlemen from the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Andrews and Mr. Udall, who are leaving the committee to run for the U.S. Senate, and I want to commend them and wish them the best. But we also have two gentlemen who are retiring from public office, and that is Mr. Jim Saxton and Mr. Terry Everett. I thought it would be proper at the end of this bill to talk about them because they are remarkable people. 
   Jimmy Saxton is a guy who probably has learned more about our Special Operations Forces and their needs than probably anybody else in Washington, D.C. He is the guy who is the chairman of the first Terrorism Subcommittee, which oversees Special Operations, whether it's our SEALs, our Rangers, our Special Forces, or others. He took it upon himself to learn everything that he possibly could so that he could go back to the committee and put together a defense bill that gave them what they needed. 
   Jimmy Saxton is a guy with a great heart. He is a lifelong friend of mine. We have been political allies and personal friends for many, many years. If you ask Jimmy Saxton for a favor, he just does it. He doesn't ponder it, he doesn't have to analyze it or calculate, he just does it. That is a wonderful quality to have in a good friend because you can get lots of them from them. 
   I have always made it a habit to exploit Jimmy Saxton for political favors because he is always there, ready to help. What a dear, wonderful friend Jimmy Saxton is. 
   Terry Everett, I have said this on several occasions, but this is a guy who is so critical to this country because he is a guy who shuns the limelight, shuns cameras, but works in closed rooms in classified session is in both the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee with that cross-pollenization of information and the right classifications and can see the right documents and the right information, that he is able to put together a coherent policy that will allow us to protect American interests in space, and by doing that, make sure we protect Americans who depend on space for our military eyes and our economic eyes. 
   Terry Everett is going to be hard to replace. In fact, I don't think you can replace him. He is also like Jim Saxton, a dear friend of mine. We have been political allies and personal friends, it seems forever, that great guy from Alabama. I went back to see his house one time that he built by himself, and when I walked into his woodworking shop, which is massive, and he has got more machinery than the average saw mill, I noticed there was some blood on the floor. It was dried blood. I said Terry, What is that? He said, Well, I almost cut my thumb off one time and I just left that blood there to remind myself to be safe. 
   Well, Terry Everett is one of those guys who's able to do all this great work for our country, working on space, working on missiles, working on missile defense, and also knowing the personalities, the people that populate the Pentagon and our intelligence agencies and Capitol Hill, and being able to weave all those people and all that technology together in a way that he has had such an impact on our national security. 
   So, like Jim Saxton, Terry Everett is going to be a man who is irreplaceable. Let me tell you, in my memory, both of these great Americans are irreplaceable for what they have done for their country and what their personal friendship has meant to me.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (ORDERLY AND RESPONSIBLE IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. I want to also thank everyone who works on this committee and has spent so much time over the years working to prepare our military forces to be able to handle contingencies and wars around the world. We appreciate that, and you have lots of great experience. 
   But let me tell you, this provision in this particular bill is terrible for the warfighters. Let me talk about a small piece of it. 
   You have what I call a 15-day wait, notify and hold provision. That means before any unit can go into Iraq, a 15-day period, waiting period, has to expire after you have notified the Armed Services Committees and the Defense appropriations committee that unit is ``ready for battle'' and meets a mission-capability standard. 
   Now, the problem with that is we have a war against terror in which teams, whether they are special operations teams, medivac teams, EOD teams, special fire support teams like C-130, A-6 gun ships are constantly moving across the boundaries between Iraq and the rest of the world. Some of our assets come off of carriers. Some of them come out of Incirlik, Turkey. Some from Kuwait and some of them come from other places. 
   This idea that before a special forces team can move across a line you must have a 15-day notify and wait period is totally unworkable. 
   I want to give to you what Admiral Fallon, head of the Central Command, said when we asked him what he thought about the notify and hold provision. He said, ``I would ask for consideration that we not limit the flexibility of our commanders in allowing them to use forces that might be necessary to meet a situation or a mission which they might be asked to undertake. And so I would opt to allow our commanders to have the flexibility of making that decision rather than have some dictated requirement in advance.'' 
   I would say to my good friend, Mr. Murtha, who has several times stated that the administration should listen to its generals: Every team that goes into that warfighting theater goes in because one of the battlefield commanders has requested their presence. 
   I can remember talking to my son when he was in the battle of Fallujah as an artillery officer and he was inside the city as a forward observer. And I asked him what the most important platforms we had out there were. He said the A6 C-130 gunship. I said, Where are they? He said, They come and they go. 
   Ladies and gentleman, we move firefighting teams, all types of special operations crews and teams, EOD teams, A6 C-130 gunships across those borders constantly, and to have a requirement where you are going to have to give a 15-day notification and wait before you can move that unit in is devastating to our warfighting capability. 
   I would ask for a ``no'' on this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (THREE AMERICAN HEROES -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow morning, at 7:24 a.m., the first rays of the morning sun will illuminate the markers, the crosses and Stars of David at Arlington Cemetery. And about a half hour later they will move across the oak ridges of the Blue Ridge Mountains and down to the slow waters of the Shenandoah River and across the Midwest of this country. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, they will arrive, about an hour later, that great American sunrise, at the small towns in Texas, the hometowns of Audie Murphy, who fought with such great heroism in World War II, Sergeant Roy Benevides, who was a hero of the Vietnam War, and the hometown of Corporal Jason Dunham, who was given, a few days ago, the Medal of Honor by the President of the United States for his extreme valor in Iraq.  
   Mr. Speaker, these three American heroes are tied by a common thread to each other and to the American people and to our national purpose, in that they all fought for the expansion of freedom. 
   Now, Audie Murphy fought in a war, World War II, which was a war that, once we had gotten into it and got past that first vote for a draft, which I think passed by one vote in this body, and realized that it was make or break time for the United States, that it was a war that would involve the full commitment of our entire country and all of our energies, a war in which there was unanimous support, that it was a war in which Audie Murphy fought with such great heroism. 
   The war in which Roy Benevides fought was a war that didn't support, or didn't involve that unanimous support by the American people, but, nonetheless, involved a noble cause, the cause of spreading freedom in Vietnam. 
   And the war that Corporal Jason Dunham gave his life in to protect his buddies in the 1st Marine Division, was a war, similarly, in which the United States has entered a long established blueprint for establishing freedom around the world, that is standing up a free government, standing up a military to protect that free government. And he was involved in the dangerous conflict in Anbar Province and gave his life for his colleagues in that struggle. So all three of these heroes were involved in the greatest American purpose, which is to spread freedom. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have an interest in spreading freedom, not just a humanitarian interest, but a national interest. After World War II, we stood up the free government in Japan, and we stood up a military apparatus that could protect it. And who would quarrel with the idea that we have an enormous interest in having Japan, a free nation, with considerable economic and military capability, on that end of the Pacific Ocean? 
   We also maintained free Germany, that is, West Germany, with the Berlin airlift, which was carried out with lots of American expenses and involvement and sacrifice. But we did that and, ultimately, that resulted in the reuniting of East and West Germany, and after the wall came down, the freeing of hundreds of millions of people as a result of America's triumph in the Cold War. And nobody would quarrel with the idea that having a free Germany in that strategic location was important to the United States. 
   In our own hemisphere, we maintained a shield around that fragile democracy in El Salvador as we stood up that free government and allowed them to have their first elections. And nobody would quarrel with the idea that El Salvador, which now is an ally of the United States in the operation in Iraq, is an important asset for the United States in our own hemisphere, an important ally, an important partner; and that that is much preferable to the Marxist state which was where it was headed when the United States intervened.     
   Having free nations around the world in strategic locations especially is important to America. I think we all agree with that now, we have got a chance, if we succeed in Iraq, and having a country that is a friend, not an enemy of the United States, a country that will not be a state sponsor of terrorism in the future for the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years, and a country which has a modicum of freedom for its people. 
   Now, you know in spreading freedom around the world, incidentally, there are lots of naysayers. There are a lot of people who criticize and have criticized the American efforts. 
   After all, we only saved half of the Korean peninsula and none of Vietnam for freedom. People can point to the cliffs of Normandy in France and point out that the country that hosts those American gravesides for the soldiers who gave their lives for the liberation of France, that country is less than enthusiastic in supporting the United States in our efforts to expand freedom around the world. 
   You could probably say the same thing about the Government of Germany, seeming to have forgotten the ordeal of the Berlin airlift that the Americans endured to maintain freedom in West Germany and ultimately bring freedom to all the German people. There can be lots of criticism about the American plan. But, you know, the American plan, the idea of freedom has worked. 
   I want to talk just a little bit about the Baghdad plan, the plan that the President and the joint chiefs and our war fighting leadership in Iraq have put together. Now, somebody along this great tradition of critics who like to imply that somehow the road that we didn't take was a smooth road, there is lots of criticism of this plan. 
   This plan is not guaranteed to work because a lot of it relies on a factor that the United States doesn't control, and that is willingness, the willingness of the Iraqi military to show up with all of its units, to stand and fight, to be willing to engage in battle, and to be willing to take the burden of security that presently is carried mainly by the Americans. 
   But let us talk about this Baghdad plan, because the Baghdad plan could be a pattern for the handoff of the security responsibilities from the United States to the Iraqi Government. 
   In each of the nine sectors in Baghdad that the plan envisions, there will be an Iraqi brigade. Now, usually an Iraqi brigade will consist of two or three maneuvered battalions. A battalion can be anything from 500 to 800 people, so it consists of two or three maneuvered battalions who will be out in front. They will have some embedded American advisors and people who can do things like call in medivacs and direct precision fire and do other things that we call combat enablers, so they will have American embedded teams helping them. 
   Beyond that, standing as a backup to these two or three Iraqi battalions will be an American battalion, helping to shore them up, helping to give them advice, standing behind them while the Iraqis move through the neighborhoods and through the communities in the areas that are violent in Baghdad. 
   Now, my recommendation has been that we take some of the 27 Iraqi battalions that have been trained and equipped that are in the quiet areas of Iraq, and nine of the 18 provinces are quiet areas. They are areas that involve less than one attack a day. That means that the 27 battalions that we have trained and equipped that are in those areas aren't undertaking substantial military operations right now. 
   We make sure that the Iraqi Ministry of Defense saddles up those battalions and moves them into the fight, rotates them into the battle, principally in the Baghdad area, but they could do the same thing in other areas in the Sunni triangle and even out in the al Anbar province. That does a couple of things. First, it helps get the job done. It moves trained and equipped fighting personnel into a theater of battle, and it provides people and equipment to make the necessary military operations to settle down Baghdad. 
   But the second thing it does is train up the Iraqi Army, because the best way to train any army is to put them in military operations. Let us put them in military operations. 
   Now my understanding that it is, in fact, from those nine quiet provinces we are going to have some three brigades that will involve six to nine battalions moving from the north and south, from quiet areas in Iraq, into Baghdad. We will be moving Iraqi battalions into Baghdad. Those have been committed by the Iraqi Government. 
   Now, there is no guarantees that all Iraqi forces are going to show up. They are going to have to prove that. In the past, they haven't always shown up. Although they have battalions that have performed very, very well in combat, they have got others that haven't performed well. 
   Now, we could take this pattern of having two or three Iraqi battalions with an American backup battalion, and we could use that to get combat experience and operational experience for every single Iraqi unit. Presently, there are 114 Iraqi battalions extant. That means that we have trained and equipped 114 battalions. 
   I am sure that they are at varying levels of end strength, that is, personnel, and probably varying levels of equipage. But you only need some basic equipment for this urban fighting. You need to have weapons, you need to have ammunition, you need to have communications gear, and you need to have transportation, and you need to have  soldiers who are willing, willing to obey the chain of command. You need to have leaders who are willing and able to lead, and you need to have a plan. 
   This Baghdad plan, this idea of dividing it into nine sectors, saddle up Iraqi units that heretofore have not been operating in Baghdad, moving them in, putting them out front, in front of the Americans, the Americans are backup, using that basic pattern to run through all of the 114 Iraqi battalions and give them combat experience is a good way for us to start this handoff in which we hand off the full security burden to the Iraqi forces. 
   Now, there is no guarantee that this can be done. There is no guarantee because one element of this plan is the commitment of Iraqi political leadership and the military leadership to carry out what they say they are going to do. 
   This plan can be a blueprint for the handoff of the security burden. I would hope that Members understand that the troops that we are sending to Iraq right now are, indeed, reenforcements. Some of them are already arriving. They are the reinforcements that are necessary to execute this plan. Some 4,000 of them are going to al Anbar province where the Marines have requested them, and the balance are going to the Baghdad operation and other operations, presumably in the Sunni Triangle. 
   This is a deployment of reinforcements, and the idea that this body or any other body would attempt to cut off American reinforcements to a military which is already engaged in combat is unacceptable. I think it is unprecedented. We have already made a vote to get into this operation. Right now we have got troops engaged in combat. 
   When reinforcements are required, and you have troops engaged in combat, it is incumbent upon us to make sure that our policy, and our policy is directed by the Commander in Chief, it is not directed by 435 Secretaries of State, that is all the Members of Congress becoming Secretaries of State in the House and another 100 in the other body, it is not directed by 535 self-appointed Secretaries of Defense. It is directed by the Commander in Chief who was elected by all the people to lead the militaries of this country. In consultation with our military leadership, he has done that. The troops are now moving. We need to get behind them. 
   That leads me to another issue, and that is I talked a little bit about that American sunrise and how it shines first on these stars of David and crosses at Arlington Cemetery, and then it moves across this country, takes about 3 hours to get to my hometown in San Diego and Fort Rosecrans Cemetery there on the edge of the Pacific Ocean.     
   Mr. Speaker, in the Midwest it flows over lots and lots of old factories and plants that used to represent what we called the ``arsenal of democracy.'' 
   When we got into World War II, our allies and our adversaries realized very quickly that America had an arsenal of democracy. We had a great industrial base. We had an industrial base in which our major auto makers were able to turn immediately to making tanks and personnel carriers and all the other equipment of war. 
   I know that in my own hometown in San Diego, we had an old facility you can still see if you drive down by the harbor that used to turn out a bomber aircraft every 60 minutes. That means they could have built the entire B-2 force in one day and had three hours left over. 
   Everywhere across this land, because we had a strong industrial base, which were able to transform that industrial base into a wartime footing, and it was with the support of that industrial base that the armies of the United States moved across Europe, that the Marine Corps and the armies moved across the Pacific, and that we brought this war to a conclusion that favored the United States of America. An arsenal of democracy is pretty important to democracies. 
   Today, if you want to look at a big part of the arsenal of democracy, you may have to go to some other countries. One country you may have to go to is China, because China is cheating on trade and China is acquiring hundreds of billions of American dollars, more than we are acquiring from them, and as the money piles up in China, they are using those billions of American trade dollars to buy military equipment. 
   That is why they are able to have some 17 submarines under production today while we have a fraction of that. That is why they are able to buy and build medium-range ballistic missiles. I predict at some point, Mr. Speaker, those ballistic missiles will have an anti-ship capability that will present a major threat to the American fleet. That is why they are able to start developing a new industrial base for the development of a modern tactical aircraft program. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we see this one-way street on trade beginning to move the arsenal of democracy offshore. I can tell you in the past year on the Armed Services Committee I have looked at certain critical components of the arsenal of democracy, and I note that we only have one carbon fiber manufacturer left in the United States, and we only have, according to our research, one rocket fuel manufacturer left in the United States. 
   As we look at more and more of the industries that are critical to national security, we realize that in many of them we only have one or two or three businesses or companies that are left that are capable of making particular components that are critical to America's military strength. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time to change and reverse this one-way street trade policy that we have acquiesced to and restore the arsenal of democracy. 
   It is kind of funny. When China enters a trade deal with the United States or competes against an American company, since we are all talking football at this time of the year, they start with 74 points on the scoreboard before the opening kickoff. 
   They give a 17 percent refund of their VAT tax, basically a 17 percent subsidy to this exporter who is sending out products to the United States. When our products arrive at China's shores, they give us a 17 percent penalty. That is now a 34 point spread. And then, just to make sure that we don't throw a Hail Mary and come from behind and win that particular competition on that particular product, they devalue their currency by 40 percent, and they increase the spread in points to 74 points. 
   That means that before the opening kickoff in this competition that we call world trade between the Chinese corporation and the American business and American workers, China has 74 points on the scoreboard. Then if we lose the competition, they say, what's the matter? Can't you play football? 
   China is cheating on trade, Mr. Speaker, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board made that clear in his preliminary speech which called this manipulation of currency an illegal subsidy. That word ``subsidy'' was subsequently removed from the speech before it was given to the Chinese leadership, but I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that that illegal subsidy and that 17 percent penalty that is given to American trade goods and the 17 percent subsidy that they give to their trade goods as they are moved for export to the United States, that 74 points on the scoreboard hurts American businesses, it hurts American workers and it erodes the arsenal of democracy. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are going to need the arsenal of democracy at some point in the future, and we need to have a trade policy and new trade laws that say this: We are not going to live with the 74-point disparity anymore, and you can do it the easy way or the hard way. We can all start with zero points on the scoreboard, or we will put the same taxes on your goods that you put on ours, and we will both start with 74 points on the scoreboard. But we are not going to start anymore with the score being America zero, China 74. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I hope this is a year in which we pass a bill that calls the currency manipulation and devaluation by the central government of China what it is, which is an illegal subsidy. 
   Let me move on to another issue, Mr. Speaker, because as that American sunrise that lit up the Arlington Cemetery at 7:24 a.m. this morning moves across the United States, about 2 hours after that, it reaches the Southwest border of America. It shines on what I call the thin green line. That is the few thousand American Border Patrol men and women who defend the borders of  the United States. They have got a 2,000-mile border to defend, Mr. Speaker, all the way from San Diego, California, to Brownsville, Texas, and we owe it to them to use the best of our technology and the best of our resources to make sure that that border is defendable. 
   Now, we asked one of our great think tanks, the Sandia Laboratory, in fact, that is one of the laboratories that is full of scientists who design our nuclear weapons, design the warheads, we asked them once to solve a problem for us. We said, what is a good way for us to stop drugs from coming across the border from the south? 
   They thought about it for a while and came back and gave us a report, and the report said we are going to show you something that is not too complicated. How about a fence? In fact, how about a triple fence, which will slow down the smugglers enough so that your Border Patrolmen can catch them, which gives you a fighting chance to halt people that would come across illegally? 
   Now, this fence, in fact we call it the Sandia Fence because the Sandia National Laboratory designed it, is pretty simple. It consists of a steel fence. It is right on the border. Then you have a Border Patrol road that is about 50-foot wide, and then you have about a 15-foot high fence with an overhang, and then another Border Patrol fence, and then another fence that is a shorter fence. Three fences. 
   We built that when Republicans took control of this body in 1994 in San Diego. I can remember, because I drafted that language that went into the immigration bill that provided for that fence. 
   Mr. Speaker, when we built that fence, and we said it had to be built, the Clinton administration did not want to build it, and President Clinton's own INS representatives fought the fence. But they had to build it, because it was the law. 
   They said, do we have to build all three layers of fence? We sat down with them and said, well, we will tell you what; we will keep the three layers in the law, but let's build the first two, and if we don't need the third layer, we won't make you build it. 
   Mr. Speaker, we haven't needed the third layer, because that fence, the 14-mile fence in the San Diego sector, once we built the first big piece of that, we knocked down the smuggling of people and narcotics by more than 90 percent. We eliminated the drive-through drug trucks, we eliminated the 10 murders a year that were occurring on the border by the border gangs, and we eliminated the border gangs, because the border gangs needed to be able to move back and forth, north and south. If they were pursued from the north, they would go south, if they were pursued from the south, they would go north. We took away their mobility by building that fence. 
   Mr. Speaker, that fence works. And the new law that President Bush signed a couple of months ago mandates the extension of that fence, the San Diego fence, 854 miles across the deserts of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I drafted that bill, that fence provision that was in the bill that was offered by Homeland Security, and the first big section that I put in was the section between Calexico, California, and Douglas, Arizona. That is about 392 miles. That is the number one smugglers' corridor, now that we have closed the San Diego-Tijuana corridor by fencing it. 
   That 392-mile section is a section through which massive amounts of people and narcotics are being smuggled. The Department of Homeland Security has a mandate. In fact, when we wrote that law, I put in the word ``shall.'' ``Shall'' means that this is not an option, it is not a goal, it is not something that would be nice to have if you could do it. It is a mandate to the Federal Government to build that fence. 
   There is available now appropriated and ready to go in the bank, so-to-speak, $1.2 billion. That may not build the entire 854 miles of fence, but it gives you an awfully good big piece of it. 
   Something we found out about the San Diego fence was after we had built even a third of the San Diego fence, because we channelized the smugglers, especially the drug trucks and they had fewer places to go, we were able to concentrate our border agents in those channelized openings that were still unfenced and we caught lots of them, and our interdiction rate went way up, even before we completed the fence. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, there is nothing so compelling in this country as an idea that the people support which has been passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President and represents a law that came right from the heartland of this great country and which needs to be executed. 
   The Department of Homeland Security has the obligation of executing this law, and I look forward to working with my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, over the next several months and making sure that this fence gets started. We can start it concurrently in separate sections. You can have one contractor build it from mile 1 to mile 5, the next guy go from mile 5 to mile 10 and so on. We can immediately see a reduction in the amount of people and narcotics that are smuggled across this border. 
   Let me tell you why we have to build this border fence, Mr. Speaker: Since 9/11, it has become clear that border security is no longer primarily an immigration issue. It is a national security issue. We have to know, very simply, who is coming into our country and what they are bringing with them. 
   You know something else? We have got 250,000 criminal aliens right now in our Federal penitentiaries and our State and local prisons and jails, a quarter of a million criminal aliens. They cost us as much as $50,000 apiece to incarcerate for a year. That means that each year we spend around $3 billion in cash money out of our Treasury to incarcerate the people that come across this unfenced section of the southern border of the United States. We would save enough money in one year on incarceration a loan to build the entire fence. Let's build it, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to address my good friend, Mr. Murtha, who pointed out that there was a shortage of Humvees back here, particularly up-armored Humvees. Well, let me show you how many Humvees we had at the end of the Clinton administration: up-armored Humvees, zero. 
   We didn't have any up-armored Humvees for the National Guard to train on, for the Army to train on, for the National Guard to deploy or for the Army to deploy. We had zero. Actually, we had 1,300 at the end of 2000, 1,300. We now have 18,400 up-armored Humvees. We have got roughly 15 times as many up-armored Humvees as we had at the end of the Clinton administration. 
   Now, let me remind my colleagues how much body armor we had at the end of the Clinton administration, body armor. If I hear another parent call up because they are listening to this debate and they are listening to information which is erroneous, I think it is important for us to remind them, there was nobody armored at the end of the Clinton administration, not one stitch of bulletproof armor at the end of the Clinton administration. Today there are just under 1 million sets of body armor for our troops. 
   Now, let's talk about what we didn't fund in this bill. We didn't fund the ambush protection vehicles to the full extent that the Army asked for. The Army asked for $4.75 billion worth of ambush protection vehicles. Those are vehicles with the V-shaped hulls so that land mines will be deflected and they have strong enough sides so that IEDs will be deflected. 
   Now, my colleagues, I will tell you why everybody, Democrats and Republicans, should vote against this particular supplemental, and it is because of one of the restrictions that is placed  on this. There is a 15-day notice and wait period in this bill that says that no unit can deploy until notice is given 15 days before that deployment. We have not done that since our birth as a Nation, saying you can't deploy reinforcements, you can't deploy an emergency unit. It could be a bomb-clearing unit; it could be an IED unit. It could be a medical unit. You can't deploy it for the men and women of the Armed Forces who are engaged in combat until 15 days have expired. We have gone over this with the lawyers and they say it is a 15-day notice and waiver. You can't do it. 
   Vote ``no'' on this very bad, very defective bill.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank my friend for the courtesy of yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me just say we took a 1999 101st Airborne battalion. We compared them today with the 100,000 pieces of new equipment that they have got. The 1999 Airborne Battalion today, if it was rated C-1 in 1999, would be rated unready today, not because they are not good warfighters or capable, but because there is brand-new equipment. If you don't have your flu shot, you are rated unready for combat.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a well-motivated bill. I want to commend my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for all the great work that they do, Democrat and Republican. Most of the time we're on common ground. In this case, I think that this bill does not accrue to the benefit of the troops. I think it hurts the troops.     
   I think that is a question every Member of the House has to ask themselves: Is this going to be good for the troops, or is it going to be bad for the troops? 
   I think it will be bad for the troops, for this reason: We are fighting a war in Iraq which requires innovation, flexibility and experience. This bill, which will put a straitjacket on our ability to deploy troops on the basis that their clock has not yet expired back in the United States before they go over, is going to have an incredibly detrimental affect on our ability to project a well-rounded, effective fighting team in the warfighting theater in Iraq. 
   Let me talk about that a little bit, Mr. Speaker. 
   You are going to have units which desperately require specialties. Some of the specialties, I would remind my friend, are IEDs, the ability to operate jammers, the ability perhaps to decontaminate if you come into contact with some of the chemical weapons stockpiles that were left by the old regime. Military effectiveness is built on dozens and dozens of specialities, all of which support the other. 
   The idea that you can't put this team together, that the Marines or the Army can't put their warfighting team together because they looked at the list of people who are most able to fill those roles, most able to move in and stand next to their fellow Marine, their fellow soldier, their fellow airman, the guy that is doing the mechanic work on that important helicopter that is going to be the transportation vehicle, the guy that is doing the repair work on that particular weapons system, those people are not going to be able to flow over into the theater because their clock hasn't moved appropriately on the one-to-one ratio. 
   Now, we consulted the U.S. Marines on this provision. We didn't consult political people in the White House. We didn't consult people who had an opinion on whether or not we should be in Iraq. We consulted the people who have the job of putting together these packages of personnel which are required in the warfighting theater and transporting them to the theater. 
   Of course, the Deputy Commandant of the Marine Corps for Plans and Operations is Lieutenant General Richard Natonski. Here is his statement he gave to the committee. He said, ``In order to support OIF requirements during Fiscal Year 2008 and comply with the minimum period between deployments proposed by provisions like H.R. 3159, a one-to-one ratio, the Marine Corps would have to adjust force generation plans. These plan adjustments would include extending unit deployments.'' 
   Somebody has to stay on the battlefield. The battlefield is not going to be empty. So if you are not going to allow new Marines to come in, the Marines that are there right now are going to have to stay there. 
   It is the same with the Army. These plan adjustments could include extending unit deployments, creating provisional units. That means you are going to have to put new units together because the old unit hasn't had its meter expire yet. And forcing units to execute missions as in-lieu-of forces, meaning that units that don't have that specialty are going to have to become units that have that specialty. That means ``quickie'' training and moving people immediately into the battlefield to fill a role that otherwise could be filled by people who have a deep specialty in that capability. 
   Mr. Speaker, he finishes with this statement that every Member of Congress should listen to very carefully. He said, each of these adjustments that will be required by Mrs. Tauscher's bill, among others, incurs higher risk than that associated with deploying the unit at a deployment-to-dwell time of seven to six. 
   I want to remind my colleagues, higher risk means higher risk of casualties. That is what happens when the guy that is supporting you on the battlefield doesn't have as much experience as you would like him to have, doesn't have that specialty, hasn't been there before, doesn't have that insight that is going to keep you alive. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a well-meaning bill. But if you ask this question, does it help the troops or hurt the troops, this bill hurts the troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to address my remarks to the gentleman, for a second, to the gentleman who just spoke. 
   My son is a marine who is doing his third tour. He is calm. He is determined. He loves his country, just like all of his fellow marines. The constant illustrating or projecting of our Armed Forces as somehow victims is something that finds absolutely no truth when you go out among our uniformed personnel. 
   The Marine Corps has never been more effective. They have never had higher morale. They have excellent reenlistment rates. Interestingly, there are high reenlistment rates among the  people that are in combat. They are not deployed to the point where they are depleted, and they are not desperate and their families are not desperate. 
   With those happy words, I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon), a member of the committee.

   The military is not broken. The Army is not broken. The Marine Corps is not broken. This continued depiction of our military people as victims who are totally desperate, as the last Member of Congress who spoke on the other side depicted them, that they are somehow desperate, their families are desperate, they are ineffective, they are broken, is totally in error. 
   We have never had better morale. We have never been more effective. The interesting thing is the people who are reenlisting are reenlisting from the combat units. That means that they think that their mission has value, and that means that they have high morale.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, let me make this point: we are in two warfighting theaters right now, Afghanistan and Iraq. We have troops deployed. 
   We are, by all accounts at this point, doing well in those warfighting theaters. Somebody stays in battle space. For the gentlelady who asked me, who do you stand with, the planner in the Pentagon, or the troops in the field, I would answer very firmly, I stand for the troops in the field. I stand for that marine corporal who needs to have that gunnery sergeant, who's been there before, who understands how you avoid that roadside bomb, who understands how you approach that village, who understands how you work that cannon, who understands how you interrogate people without risking your own troops. 
   That comes from experience, and the idea that we are going to deny these experienced, noncommissioned officers, these old hands whose experience can make the difference between life and death because their meter didn't expire when they were back home, and they only got 6 months' worth of dwell time in country, rather than 7, is the wrong reason to vote for this bill. 
   Please oppose this bill, readiness mandates, with a ``no.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, thank you. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their decorum during this debate and for their true interest and their motivation in support of our troops. 
   We all want to conclude this war. We all want to do everything that we can for military families. We simply have a difference of opinion as to whether or not mandating certain rest periods before a soldier or a marine can go back to battle is in the interest of the war fighting troops. 
   My answer is, it's not in the interest. It will not raise their morale. What it will do is it will deprive our war fighting troops. It will deprive that corporal, it will deprive that squad in Fallujah or Baghdad or up in Mosul. That experienced old hand, that NCO, who is in the military for a career, and who knows that particular area, and he knows how to avoid roadside bombs, and he knows how to interrogate insurgents, and he knows how to approach a certain canyon so that you don't expose yourself to fire. He won't be there if the gentlelady's motion passes, because he will only have spent 6 months instead of 7 months back at Camp Pendleton, and he won't be available to move to the field of battle. 
   Now, you know, this is a war of specialties, and I notice that one thing that the majority did, which I think was a good move, was that they excluded the special operations forces from this particular law. The reason they excluded them is because they are special operations forces who have to move back and forth in the theater and have to move out of the theater on a regular basis, sometimes going back and forth between Afghanistan and Iraq, because they have specialties which mean life or death to our war fighters in both of those theaters, and they can't be held back, chained back by this law. 
   I have got news for my colleagues. There are a lot of people in the regular forces whose presence also means life or death to the combatants in those forces. You have to have experience. 
   Even the line units are full of specialties. If you have a person who is an expert in roadside bombs, and he comes back after a 7-month tour, if he is a marine, or after a 1-year tour, if he is an Army soldier, he comes back and he gets the latest schooling on a jamming device that will keep that 152 round from blowing up, that roadside bomb, and destroying a Humvee and destroying American soldiers. 
   He has that capability. But he now cannot go back into theater because the Tauscher amendment has passed, and he can't be deployed. So he stays here with that particular insight, that particular capability, and probably the Marines or the Army will rush a team in. They will try to give them a fast learning period and rush them in, to be a poor substitute for this guy who really has the expertise of telling our people how to jam those signals that detonate those deadly roadside bombs. 
   Now, what if we need decontamination, we have got a decontamination team in the regular military. They can't go over unless they get a waiver from the President. 
   Well, it was argued that these waivers will be easy to get. But you know the Marines have told us that they can't plan for a waiver, because they can only follow along. The law will say you can't go. 
   I have got a picture that I have kept in the Armed Services Committee for a  long time, as the former chairman of the committee, and now ranking member, serving alongside my great friend, Mr. Skelton.     
   It is a picture of a 5-ton truck that was struck by a Humvee with a particular armor equipment and an armor package that this committee sent those soldiers. And there is a letter attached to it and it is a letter of thanks that says, ``Thanks to you on the Armed Services Committee for making sure that we got this armor.'' And this was after this 5-ton truck has been blown up. And it said, ``We owe our lives, the fact that all eight of us were able to escape, to you on the Armed Services Committee,'' but it also says, ``to our gunnery sergeant.'' That gunnery sergeant that had the capability, that had that certain expertise of being able to do what it took to make sure that all eight of his people survived. 
   Mrs. TAUSCHER has said, who do you stand with, the big Pentagon planners or the troops? 
   The worst thing you can do, Mrs. TAUSCHER, for my son who is on his third deployment, or anybody else's son, is to take away that gunnery sergeant or that senior NCO or that expert who can stand by their side and help them to survive in this very dangerous warfighting theater. 
   Please vote for this motion to recommit. This motion to recommit says that you cannot make this law certain unless you----

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (DUTY, HONOR AND COUNTRY -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I rise, Mr. Speaker, to talk about duty, honor, and country. 
   Many times, Members of this great body rise to talk about those who wear the uniform of the United States who have fallen in the Iraq or the Afghanistan theater and to recount their actions and to recount their mission and to praise their motive and their patriotism and their love of this great country. 
   I rise tonight, Mr. Speaker, to talk about an American who was killed on the 24th of this month, not wearing the uniform of the United States in the military service, even though he had served in the military for some 31 years, but who was killed in a deadly area in Iraq as an American contractor, an American who had worked as a contractor for the Department of Defense and then the Department of State, Steven Farley. 
   Steven Farley represented the very best of this country, and I have a picture here, Mr. Speaker, that I'd like to show the Members. This is him in his Navy uniform. Before he donned this Navy uniform and finished a career of 31 years in the U.S. military, he served in the U.S. Army in Vietnam. 
   He was a man of service, and when he left his wonderful wife, Donna, and his family to go to Iraq, he told them that he understood that this was a difficult and dangerous mission. He worked on a provincial reconstruction team, and I think he represented a forgotten segment of this great effort, this effort to bring the sunlight of freedom to Iraq. 
   He represented those people that don't wear the uniform in this operation but who wear contractor uniforms, who go out into very dangerous places in Iraq. And in this case, Steven Farley was with three colleagues, working the provincial reconstruction teams in Iraq. He was in Sadr City, that adjunct to Baghdad that has over 1 million people in an area of great fighting and great turmoil and great danger. And yet when he came home to see his loved ones, he told them he knew that he was in danger. He knew that it might, at some point, cost him his life, but he told them that he thought the cause was a worthwhile cause. 
   His service to America represented all those wonderful aspects of duty and honor and country and patriotism, even though he wasn't wearing the uniform of the Army or the Marine Corps or the Air Force or the Navy, because he was serving that same goal, that same ideal, that same flag, and all of us. 
   Mr. Speaker, he came home a few weeks before, bringing some of the members of the city council of Sadr City to the United States to let them see what freedom was like, what this great experiment in freedom called the United States of America was like, to inspire them, to give them a model they could go back and use in this  fledgling representative government that is now taking place in Iraq. 
   He wanted to show them the American example, and Mr. Speaker, his example and the example of his family and the example of his great community, a guy from Guthrie, Oklahoma, it was the finest example that anybody can watch if they indeed want to model their country, their community, their town after a winning democracy, the United States of America. 
   So here was a gentleman who served in a very, very crucial area for the United States, and most of the work that we do here in the House of Representatives, most of our work is air-conditioned. I'm so proud of the members of the Armed Services Committee, most of whom have taken multiple trips to see the troops and the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. And we now and again go out and put our boots on the ground in some tough places, but most of the time, we're in Washington, D.C., or with our constituent cities and our wonderful communities. These Americans, Americans like Steven Farley, are out there for years on end in very difficult conditions, carrying the American flag. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, a number of us on the Armed Services Committee are going to be visiting Iraq and Afghanistan in the coming months, especially the summer months, when we take the district work period break. I will tell you one thing I'm going to do. When I go to Baghdad this time, I'm going to spend more time with those contractors, people who haven't necessarily been given all of the credit that they should be given by this body, by the House of Representatives. People talk about the contractors as if they were somehow mercenaries. 
   Well, Steven Farley represented the very best of this very wonderful force of Americans who help to establish freedom around the world. May he rest in peace. God bless his family, and thank you, Steven Farley, for your service to the United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I thank my friend for yielding. And the gentleman from Iowa is indeed an expert on renewable energy, and I've spent a lot of time in his wonderful State examining that program, which is very robust right now. 
   I thought the gentleman might be interested, because this is a subject that's near and dear to your heart, in the recent progress on the border fence and the recent actions that have been undertaken by the administration. 
   The gentleman from Iowa and I have linked arms on a number of occasions to do several things: one, pass the border fence legislation that mandates the construction of a double fence across the southern border for about 854 miles. And as we know, that legislation was watered down some in December by the Senate, but it remains a mandate to do at least 700 miles of fence. And the administration just undertook the waiver of environmental regulations that would keep the fence from being built for many years. 
   In fact, I remember that when we tried to fence Smugglers Gulch, where a great deal of cocaine came into the United States between San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Mexico, we were delayed for 12 years by a series of lawsuits and regulations being invoked. I think the last regulatory delay revolved around whether or not a gnatcatcher would fly over a 12-foot-high fence, and after a year I think the experts concluded that indeed that gnatcatcher could clear the fence; so we could build it. 
   So the administration has invoked this waiver, and I want to commend Secretary Chertoff for undertaking that waiver because it's absolutely necessary if we're going to get the fence built. Otherwise, we will never get it built. And today the southwest border, and particularly Texas along with Arizona, are absolutely on fire with the smuggling of drugs and illegal aliens. And last year they moved about 22 metric tons of cocaine across the border, across the southwest border, and about 368 tons of marijuana. So it's still a trafficking corridor or a series of corridors which are flowing relatively unimpeded by this relatively small force of Border Patrolmen and Customs and DEA agents who attend the border. But getting that double-border fence up, and in some cases it's a single fence--I would like to see a double fence all the way across--but getting that fence up is going to have a great, very salutary effect on law enforcement in the United States. 
   And I'm reminded that when we built the double fence in San Diego, the crime rate by FBI statistics in the county of San Diego dropped by 56.3 percent. And I think if we indeed get the series of fences up across the southwest border, you're going to see fewer criminal aliens being incarcerated at the Federal, State, and local level. And right now there are 250,000 of them in incarceration. 
   So since the gentleman has been my partner in these endeavors, I knew he would want to hear the report. 
   A hearing was chaired by the Committee on Resources and two subcommittees in Brownsville, Texas, and I think we aired the issues very fully. And if you listened to all the testimony, a couple of things were clear: One, we need the fence because no one has an alternative; and, number two, if we don't get the waivers, we will never get the fence built. 
   So I thought the gentleman would be interested in that progress, and I just wanted to report that to him. 
   And I thank you for yielding.

   Mr. HUNTER. If the gentleman will yield. 
   What that really amounts to is that this industry of moving this poison across the international border to the United States is cocaine that poisons our young people. That is such a massive industry now on the southern border of the U.S. that the drug gangs are fighting each other for control of this lucrative industry. That is what it represents. That is another reason why we need to build that border fence. 
   Incidentally, we had 202,000 arrests in the area where the fence has now been constructed between San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Mexico. After we constructed it, we went down to 9,000 arrests. That is a reduction of more than 90 percent. And in the Yuma sector, where we have also now constructed double fencing, we went from 138,000 arrests to a little under 4,000. That is more than a 95 percent reduction. 
   So of all the things that we have tried with respect to controlling the border, we have discovered that one thing does work and that is a border fence. The President and Mr. Chertoff should be commended for invoking this waiver that we gave them so we can move ahead on this very, very important part of the people's business, and that is keeping their kids safe. 
   The last statistic that I would give the gentleman that I brought up in Brownsville was this. Last year, we intercepted 58,000 people coming across the border from Mexico who were not citizens of Mexico. They came from virtually every country in the world. More than 800 of them came from Communist China, 14 came from Iran, and 3 of them came from North Korea. That means that anybody in the world with a television set can understand very quickly that the way to get into the United States illegally is no longer through the airports, because they have been effectively blocked. It's to get to Mexico and cross the land border between Mexico and the U.S. Another reason to build the border fence.

   Mr. HUNTER. No. As long as you have a modicum of manning, that is if you leave a fence totally alone, obviously a person can come in, sit down for hours with welding gear and cut through anything, or bring in heavy construction equipment and cut through anything. As long as you have a modicum of manning. That is why you have the Border Patrol road in between the fences, so the smuggler has to come across the first fence, cross a high speed Border Patrol road, sit down with his welding gear and work on the second fence, or carry that 22-foot ladder. Then the question comes back to the person who makes that statement--incidentally, that statement was made by Governor Napolitano, who is the Governor of Arizona. 
   Now, let me see. She said, You show me a 20-foot fence, I'll show you a 21-foot ladder. She derided the fence. And in her district where we built the double fence at Yuma, we have brought down the arrest rate from 138,000 to 4,000. So apparently the smugglers haven't read her statement that they should have no problem with this fence. 
   But it does work and, incidentally, the other thing it does is it leverages the Border Patrol. Because we were able to pull Border Patrolmen off our fenced area and move them to other places on the southern border. You don't need as many Border Patrolmen when you have an impediment, that is when you have the fence in place. 
   So for those who say the question is, How many Border Patrol can we get? You free up a lot of Border Patrolmen by having the fence. Incidentally, you need to have that double fence because you trap the smugglers in between the two fences. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his great work on this important issue. We will continue to work together.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank my friend for yielding. He truly is the resident expert on ethanol production and it has been very interesting to listen to him. 
   Another aspect of providing enough energy, of course, and becoming energy independent, which really is a national security issue at this point, is that we have to use all of our sources. And it is important for this body and for the other body, for the U.S. Senate, to pass finally permission for us to drill in Alaska. 
   Right now we have got an abolition on drilling, a lot of impediments to moving forward and increasing the amount of petroleum product that is available to the American people. If we drill in Alaska, and, incidentally, the Alaskan pipeline has not hurt any wildlife species. You can see caribou rubbing their summer coats on the Alaskan pipeline. They are that worried about it. 
   If we drill in Alaska, we are going to find new oil. We will also be able to utilize the production that is available there. And every drop of oil that we produce in this continent is oil that we don't have to worry about coming through the Straits of Hormuz. That is that narrow channel of water where the Iranian gunboats came out and harassed an American naval ship here a couple of months ago, where we are constantly watching a short-fused situation with very unstable countries, monitoring that particular dangerous part of the world. 
   Having energy independence for this country is a very, very important part of national security, and we should open up Alaska so we can utilize in a very responsible way the petroleum resources that lie under that great State. 
   I thank the gentleman.

   Mr. HUNTER. Well, I would say to my friend, I think he has made an excellent point. The way you bring down the price on any commodity is to increase the supply. And we have got a number of leaders in this House who have undertaken, if you look at their legislative record, undertaken a major campaign to stop the supply, to strangle the supply, to diminish the supply of petroleum production. And every time we take wells out of production or we don't produce, where we know we have known reserves, then we are handing part of our future to people in another part of the world who don't have America's best interests at heart.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, this is a good Defense bill, and I want to compliment my great friend the gentleman from Missouri for his leadership in helping to put together this bill that passed the committee unanimously, came to the floor, and we can expect a big vote, I think, of support from the Members of this body. We are about to make this bill better. 
   In 1987 this committee, the Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to the leadership in Israel, and we told them that there were lots of things that they could defend against very effectively, that if tactical aircraft were sent into Israel in an attack they would shoot down all of them, and they have proven that, but that if ballistic missiles were launched for Tel Aviv, every single one of them would impact because they had no defenses. And we urged them to join with the United States in developing a system of missile defense. And upon our urging, they started what is known as the Arrow missile program. It has come a long way. It has been deployed. 
   And that prophetic letter that we sent them in 1987, of course, was followed by real missile attacks on Israel. They didn't quite have that system up at that time. We rushed PATRIOTs over. They now have the Arrow missile defense system up. But in the most recent attacks we have seen short-range missiles that also impacted in Israel. 
   This motion to recommit is $200 million that is dedicated to integrating our missile defense systems with those of Israel, using the great innovation of Americans along with their great innovative capabilities, to defend against this new era of terrorists with high technology. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield at this time such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), who has been a leader in putting this motion to recommit together.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it's important to interpret this debate. I have heard the Speaker talk about redeployment and say that there is a lot of discretion that is left to the administration. There is no discretion. The dates of so-called redeployment are defined. You either start going out July 1 or October 1. Redeployment means withdrawals. 
   If generals do not start redeploying, do not start withdrawing from the battleground, you can bet Democratic leadership will be here pulling them into hearings, asking them why they didn't saddle up their brigades, their battalions and their divisions and start to move them off the battlefield. So let's get this straight. This is about withdrawing from the battlefield. 
   Listening to this debate, and listening to the controversy and the statements by Democratic leadership that have preceded this vote today, there is a constant theme: Somehow American soldiers and marines are victims. They are victims of extended tours; they are victims, the last gentleman said, they claim, of not getting enough health care. They are people that have been victims in the war against terror. 
   Let me tell you, I have seen the timelines that are given, the 270 days for Marines, the 365 days. A number of them have gone through one, two, three and sometimes four tours. Our Americans, and that includes my son, who is deploying now for the third time, will not fail, they will not crack, they will not stretch. They will hold, and they will carry out this mission against terrorists. 
   We are right now in the second phase of a program we have used for 60 years to stand up free governments around the world. You stand up a free government. We have done that. 
   Secondly, you stand up a military capable of protecting that free government. That is a second stage. That is a stage we are in right now. 
   Thirdly, we leave, because America doesn't covet anything that another nation has. 
   We are in the second stage right now. It's tough, and it's difficult. This is a tough, difficult mission, but it is a mission that we can accomplish. 
   I am reminded, lastly, that the Speaker talked about stopping the war. That is how she described this bill. The Democratic leadership does not have the power to stop the war against terror. All they have the power to do is to leave the battlefield. That would be a disaster for the United States of America.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Georgia for letting me come in and offer something that I did not see offered by the Democrat side in this debate, which was the Army's position on this continuing resolution. 
   In fact, they posited this continuing resolution as motherhood, apple pie and everything that we need for a strong national defense, and they invoked the interest of American veterans. What they did not tell American veterans was that the Army sees this as a real problem and a real cut in benefits, and things that would help the active Army come in this defense realignment, this base realignment with divisions coming back to the United States, divisions like the big red one coming back to Ft. Riley, Kansas, and lots of others and lots of quality-of-life programs for the men and women of the armed services and for their families. 
   What we did not see coming from the Democrat side of the aisle was the fact that they reached over with one hand to give money to one group of servicemembers of veterans; they reached over and scooped money out of the cash register that would accrue to the benefit of another group, a very important people, and this is the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States. 
   So let me give you the Army's perspective as manifested in a letter from Lieutenant General David Melcher, United States Army, Military Deputy for Budget, Assistant Secretary of the Army, Financial Management and Comptroller. He says this: 
   ``You recently requested a quick summary of Base Realignment and Closure impacts to the Army as proposed in the Joint Resolution, H.J. Res. 20.'' That is the resolution that the Democrat side of the aisle just passed. ``The attached information accurately portrays these impacts. The following identifies key Army concerns: 
   One, ``Army will not begin with approximately $2 billion of our BRAC program, which is a key enabler to grow and position the Army; this leaves more than half of our fiscal year 2007 BRAC program unexecutable.'' 
   Number 2, ``Operational Impact on the Training, Mobilization and Deployment of Forces in support of the Global War on Terrorism.'' For some reason, the Democrat side of the aisle did not quite want to show that statement by the U.S. Army, that their bill that they passed, their continuing resolution, would, in fact, impact training, mobilization and deployment of forces in support of the global war on terrorism. 
   Number 3, ``Unravels the Army's synchronized stationing and BRAC plan, puts growth of the Army, stationing, and BRAC at risk.'' That means this: We are bringing back divisions from around the world. Places like Germany are now going to see movement in which American divisions are going to come back, and they are going to be repositioned in the United States. That means you got to go out and build barracks. You have got to go out and build single family housing. You have got to put a lot of construction in place. The Democrat majority reached out and took away part of that money. 
   Number 4, ``Delays transformation of Reserve Component, has operational consequences.'' We are involved in two shooting wars, and we have now done something that has operational consequences. 
   Number 5, ``Breaks the Nation's obligation to provide Soldiers and Families adequate quality of life, affects the All Volunteer Force,'' something we did not hear from the other side of the aisle. 
   Number 6, ``Delays capital investment and inhibits economic development, affects local jobs and growth across the U.S.'' Over 80,000 jobs affected by what they just did. 
   And lastly, ``Limits predictability and military construction acquisition efficiencies, results in higher construction costs.'' 
   So, as we see costs going through the roof, the contractors can say, yep, we were going to build that single family housing for those military families but you guys reached in, took a bunch of the money out; we had to give a stop work order to our crews, and now we are going to charge you, the American taxpayers, more money. 
   I have got another executive summary here that goes into more detail, and I thought it might just be good to give a few of the examples of this money that was cut by the Democrat majority, which they skipped over very quickly, and tell the American people a few details about these projects that they moved off the table with one push of the hand. 
   Training ranges, command and control, training barracks, 19 projects, $560 million, including training facilities at Fort Bliss, Texas; maneuver training at Fort Benning, Georgia; air defense artillery at Fort Sill; and battlefield trauma lab at Fort Sam Houston. In fact, I have been to the battlefield trauma lab. That is where we train our combat medics to save lives in the war fighting theaters in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   Cannot start communications/electronics, RD&E, center phase one at APG, that is Aberdeen Proving Ground, to close Fort Monmouth and support the global war on terrorism. 
   Cannot start on human resources command at Fort Knox, Kentucky; recruiting facilities at Redstone Arsenal; power projection platform at Ft. Riley or other operational projects at Shaw Air Force Base, Benning and Leavenworth. 
   Armed Forces reserve centers, 27 projects, $700 million in 16 States. 
   Examples of fiscal year 2007 BRAC quality of life requirements, eight projects, youth and child development centers, Benning, Riley, Bliss, Sam Houston; dental clinics, Bliss, Sam Houston; medical clinic, Ft. Riley, Kansas. That is where the big red one is returning from Europe. 
   All fiscal year 2007 BRAC projects and follow-on MILCON are synchronized with modular force build, operational rotations, BRAC and GDPR. 
   What that means is that we are now trying to produce some 42 combat brigades, and we are trying to modularize them so they have the same equipment, they have got the same training, so that they are interchangeable so you can move out with a combat fighting force and you can move a brigade in from another area and you can have that from another particular division and that brigade is interchangeable. It does not have equipment that is noninteroperable, and it means you can fight more effectively and more consistently.     
   That modularity has been hampered by these cuts. So these are the cuts that were made by the Democrat majority, pushed off the table, projects pushed off the table with one push of  the hand and with barely a mention on the Democrat side. 
   So I would just say, my friend from Georgia, glad you got that sign up there, Official Truth Squad. You know, I think sometimes it is important to know the entire story. That is a part of the real story about what we did today. 
   I thank the gentleman for letting me come down and talk a little bit about the Army's position and the Army's position against the cuts that were manifested in this continuing resolution. 
   I thank the gentleman.

   Mr. HUNTER. The other side tried to appeal to the hearts of American veterans. I am a veteran. But you know something else? I have a son who just did 4 years of active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps, trained at some of these bases that we are talking about, witnessed and was training sometimes in facilities that were somewhat deficient, that needed to be improved. 
   I will bet you, if you look in the family of every American veteran that the other side was playing to, in passing the CR and saying we are doing good things for you guys, for you old guys like me, they were not doing good things for our sons. Because our sons are on active duty right now. They need to have that quality of life for our military families. 
   I can remember being with my son as Lynne and I would follow them around the United States, as a lot of military moms and dads do, trying desperately to get a little time with our grandchildren, and we would be often in substandard housing. We would see the efforts that had been undertaken by DOD to upgrade housing and to upgrade facilities and to make life better for families. A lot of those programs are in those cuts that the Democrats side of the aisle just made. 
   So if you are playing to us old veterans, remember, there is another thing that is very near and dear to us old veterans, and that is our kids who are on active duty or recently on active duty. We are concerned about them. So don't take away from them to give to us on the basis that we will then appreciate it, and we will appreciate them, and we somehow will not look at the reductions that they made to the active force. The active force and its benefits are very, very important to every veteran.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding, and I just wanted to address a point that my friend from Massachusetts just made. 
   He said that we always need to have up-armored Humvees in any war that we enter into. We had at the end of the Clinton administration about 112, as I recall, up-armored Humvees, only for VIPs and for diplomats. We have today 15,000 up-armored 114s. This is the first war in our history since the beginning of this country in which we have had up-armored tactical vehicles. 
   With respect to the SAPI vests, that is, the bulletproof vests and body armor that our troops wear, we had at the end of the Clinton administration this many, zero pieces of body armor for our troops. We have today over 400,000 sets. That is enough sets for two sets for everybody who is in theater, and everybody has them. 
   I have said for the last several years if there is anybody who has a son or daughter who does not have body armor who is in theater, call me personally at my office. In the last 2 years, I have received zero calls. 
   So we have, we feel, the new equipment, not just up-armored Humvees but body armor, which incidentally is very heavy and, to some degree, does result in some degradation of mobility, but we have put in hundreds of new systems, weapons and equipment systems, since the year 2000 which have accrued to the benefit of our troops. 
   I just wanted to set the record straight. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. HUNTER. I am talking about the armor issue. The point that I made is the idea of coming to the floor and implying that somehow there was bad faith in this government for not having the new body armor that our troops presently have to the tune of 400,000 sets, that somehow that was a dereliction of duty is also a disservice, not only to the former Congresses, but also to the former administrations. Because the last administration in the year 2000 had zero sets of body armor. 
   Body armor is a new advent, it is a new system. We now have hundreds of new systems that we have injected into the warfighting theater. So the idea that we had a ragtag military moving across the berm into Iraq is also not accurate. 
   And I would hope that the gentleman would admonish his colleagues who come to the floor who imply that our people went across that berm unequipped is also not accurate. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. HUNTER. The gentleman and I are good enough friends, if the gentleman will allow me to make a one-sentence answer. 
   The answer is, not since 1776 until just a few years ago have American troops in Vietnam and Korea and World War II, in any war, had what is known as ballistic body armor. It is a brand-new thing. And we have got yet new systems that we are going to be putting into the field shortly. So they don't have the newest and they didn't have the newest. They now have 400,000 sets. But to imply that that lack of having them from 1776 to 2000 made them into some type of an unequipped force is also not fully true.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And let me say to my friend, and I listened to the gentlewoman's discussion. The gentlewoman is a very careful Member of Congress, and she looked at the words and she asked the question: Does this include, because it appeared that it refers, the equipage language refers to people who are presently there but does exclude,  and she is a very careful person and I have been in markups with her and committee meetings before. She is very careful about wording; words mean things. That it doesn't refer to people who are going to be deployed by the President in the future. And her worry, and I think it was a sincere concern, is that people who may be sent by the President in the future may end up seeing a cutoff of funds, of supplies, O&M dollars, as a result of this Congress. 
   So if the gentleman is assuring us that that is not going to happen, I think that is good news to the gentlewoman from New Mexico.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, thank you, and I wanted to take this couple of minutes to expand on my conversation with the majority leader. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been said a number of times that we went over the berm and went into Iraq without body armor. In fact, no American troops until just a couple of years ago, from the time that we were first a Nation and deployed military forces on our homeland or around the world, in all those years, in that entire history of the United States, we never had body armor. I never had body armor in Vietnam. Nobody ever saw it. We had no body armor in Korea. We had no body armor in World War II, except perhaps in very, very specialized operations where perhaps specialized custom-made body armor, that is, bulletproof armor would be manufactured for some special forces teams or special operations. 
   Now, I have in front of me a comparison. This comparison is between a soldier in 1999, at the end of the last administration and the equipment that he has, and a soldier today. Now, as you can see, this is a soldier in 1999. He has a number of accessories. In fact, he has an M-16; he has a flak jacket; he has gloves; he has load-carrying equipment; he has protective goggles. He does have a night vision device. He has also got a helmet and accessories that can be utilized when he is in combat. 
   Now, the soldier today has a lot more. That soldier has, for example, instead of an M-16, he has an M-4 carbine. He has now body armor, including an outer tactical vest body armor. He has enhanced small arms protective inserts, called SAPI plates. He has deltoid auxillary protection and side plates. He has knee pads. He has more sophisticated aiming equipment and night vision equipment than his counterpart of just a couple of years ago. 
   My point is that whenever new systems are introduced into the force, and the first thousand or so systems or several thousand systems go into the force and a battalion or even a brigade has those pieces of equipment, you can by definition say that everybody else that doesn't have them is now deficient in equipment. But, in fact, they are not deficient in equipment. This point was made by a leader in the 101st Airborne who pointed out that one of his battalions that they looked at, which was rated the top level of readiness, that is C-1 readiness, ready to go, ready to fight, in 1999. If you took all of the new equipment that troops have today and put that new equipment on as a requirement for that same battle-ready battalion in 1999, they would be rendered C-4, or unready for battle by definition because they don't have the new equipment. 
   So I think one thing we need to do, as we lean on the Army, the Marine Corps, and the other services to move equipment into the field quickly, let's not penalize them, and when they move the first several thousand sets into the field, let's not say, Congratulations, you've just rendered on paper the rest of your units unready because they don't have the new stuff you're moving in. That will have a chilling effect on  what is already a very cumbersome process and a very steep bureaucracy to get through in terms of moving equipment to the field. 
   I wanted to just make that point. 
   What I would like to do at this point is yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes).

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   My colleagues, the Republican motion to instruct outlines the consequences of a failed state in Iraq and supports a clean war funding bill without a date certain to withdraw American troops from Iraq. And I would remind my colleagues that the motion to instruct goes to the Senate provision which passed by a nearly unanimous vote of 94-3. 
   Let me explain what it does. The Republican motion to instruct puts the House of Representatives on record acknowledging the consequences of a vote for a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq and not fully funding our troops and their missions. It instructs House conferees to accept Senate provision 1536 which states that it is the sense of Congress that a failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for Islamic radicals, including al Qaeda and Hezbollah, who are determined to attack the United States and its allies. 
   The provision also notes that a failed state in Iraq could lead to a broader regional conflict involving Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria and Turkey, and would lead to massive humanitarian suffering, including widespread ethnic cleansing and countless refugees and internally displaced persons, many of whom will be tortured and killed for having assisted coalition forces. 
   Senate provision 1536 concludes by stating that the Congress should commit itself to a strategy that will not leave a failed state in Iraq and should not pass legislation that will undermine our military's ability to prevent a failed state in Iraq. 
   Now, going to the aspect of the authorization of additional appropriations for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, my colleagues, these are the funds that are essential in this ongoing war in two theaters, to keep the funds going, to keep the money going to operate our military forces so that we don't end up having to reach into the cash register and pull money out for ammunition, pull money out for training exercise, pull money out for important ongoing operations and activities here that are in fact assisting the war-fighting effort. 
   One example of those, of course, is the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, JIEDDO, which has a complicated name but very simply means developing capabilities against roadside bombs. That's a command that we set up to defeat IEDs in Iraq, and we are told now that it will run out of money within the next hundred days and may not have enough money to fund all urgent initiatives from Iraq and Afghanistan during that time.     
   I would remind my colleagues that the roadside bombs are being seen on a more widespread basis in Afghanistan now. There has been an understanding by the insurgents, by the Taliban, by al Qaeda in Afghanistan that those, in fact, are a deadly and effective system. And it makes no sense whatsoever for us to shortchange the accounts that are going toward the defeat of roadside bombs. 
   Another point that I would make is that we have been notified that the Pentagon will soon be required to lay off 100,000 civilian workers. Many of those workers are working on important projects that go to the heart of our ability to win in the war-fighting theaters. So this is a major, major mistake for this Congress, in the middle of an operation in two war-fighting theaters, to shortchange these accounts which will result in the military having to reach in the cash register, take money out of other accounts in the hope that at some point in the future next year we are going to be able to make up that money. So whatever your position on our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, whether you think we should be there or not be there, every Member of this body says time and again, ``We support the troops.'' 
   Madam Speaker, stripping this funding off, which is what we will do if we don't pass this motion to instruct, is very clearly a disservice to these 157,000 plus troops in Iraq and the 22,000 plus American troops fighting in Afghanistan right now. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the last speaker for his statement and for his wonderful contribution on the Armed Services Committee in terms of working the jammer issues, and lots of other Members who have worked these important force protection issues. I think that we have proven on the committee that the wisdom of the committee and lots of Members who have gotten personally involved in this force protection issue have matched and at some times exceeded the Pentagon's own projections and projects.     
   I am reminded also that we manufactured and fielded 10,000 portable jammers, so that troops who are on foot could also have jammers, which had not been planned by the Pentagon. So I think he makes a good point. Of course, having these funds that are available in these supplementals that we can direct to force protection is a key aspect of our responsibility. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Drake).

   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to respond to my good colleague from California. 
   First, I would say to my colleague, we are winning in Iraq. We are winning. We are going to leave Iraq in victory. 
   Maybe my friend heard a different briefing than the one that I heard when General Petraeus came back and laid out the most recent figures with respect to attacks, but that very dangerous part of Anbar province that we have both visited has seen a drop in attacks of 80 percent. In fact, we have seen a drop in attacks and a drop in American casualties and civilian casualties across Iraq. And we have also seen new capabilities in the 131 Iraqi battalions that we have built from scratch. 
   I would just say to my friend, I have seen all the old smooth-path books and reports and recommendations that said somehow there was a smooth path to victory in Iraq, and I have always said there is no smooth path. 
   To those who say we should have kept Saddam Hussein's army in place, I am reminded that Saddam Hussein's army had 11,000 Sunni generals, which would have been exactly the wrong formula for a military which is supposed to take on a role of stabilization and honest brokerage in Iraq. 
   The reports that we are now seeing from the battlefield are that the Iraqi forces, while some of them have had limited battlefield experience, some have had extensive battlefield experience, that military is maturing; that the military that broke and ran in the first battle of Fallujah, the Iraqi military, now stands and fights; that in fact that government is moving forward, and although it is moving forward in a stumbling, bumbling, sometimes inept fashion, that is the nature of new governments. That is also the nature of governments that solve their problems with ballots and not bullets, because it is not always easy to get the other guy to agree with you on a particular function.  
   With respect to oil distribution, there is an ad hoc oil distribution that is taking place right now, or de facto oil distribution. It is not a function of legislation. Right now the Kurds get, for example, 18 percent of the oil revenues. So there is an oil distribution. And I think if there wasn't an oil distribution, you would have more conflict. Instead of seeing a waning conflict between the various sectors in Iraq, you would see an increasing conflict. 
   So I would just say to my friends and to the gentlewoman and to everyone who cares about an American victory in Iraq, we will have victory in Iraq if we maintain our strength. And maintaining our strength includes continuing to fund this operation. 
   It is our committee, the Armed Services Committee, that came up initially with the so-called bridge fund appropriation, because we said it is only proper that the Armed Services Committee authorizes an appropriation that will go through the winter months of the year so that the services do not have to reach into the cash register and take money out of valuable training exercises, take money out of our military equipment accounts and take money out of our ammunition accounts. 
   So I think we have exactly what we need in this motion to recommit. It is a motion that says it is the commitment of the United States Congress that we don't have a failed state in Iraq, and it also emphasizes again that we have to have these supplemental funds to ensure that the war fighters in both of these theaters, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, are able to move forward. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey).

   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I would like to yield to a gentleman, in fact, the next two gentlemen have sons who have served in the Iraqi theater. The gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline) has a son who is a Blackhawk helicopter pilot who has served, I believe, in both theaters and has quite a bit of experience in some very difficult operations. The gentleman always has an excellent insight on this important operation. The gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline), I would like to give him 3 minutes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from California for her comments, and also the distinguished chairman, who is a great friend and a wonderful patriot and has done a great job of steering our committee through the authorization process. 
   Let me tell you why I think it is important to pass this motion to instruct. We built the bridge fund. The Armed Services Committee realized we have the winter months when you need funding for the troops before you get to the spring supplemental. So we came up initially several years ago with the idea of a $50 billion bridge fund to make sure that those soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines had what they needed in the war-fighting theater to be successful. 
   It is true we have this in our bill this time because we are the major architects of the bridge fund. We are the people who came up with it the first time, and the appropriators followed us. But this time they did not follow us. This time they conditioned the bridge fund with get-out-of-Iraq language, and that was a disservice to everyone who wears the uniform in the theater and to the mission. So it is important for the Members of this body to cast their votes in favor of that bridge fund, and perhaps that will show the right direction to the Appropriations Committee and to the Members of Congress who vote on the full appropriations, because we need to have that bridge fund not only authorized but appropriated. 
   Finally, we do need to have that very strong language committing ourselves to avoid a failed state in Iraq. And we are winning. 
   Now let me go back to my good colleague Mr. Skelton, who said we all support the troops and we have manifested that support in pay raises. And we have. We have manifested it in good medical care and a new Wounded Warrior bill to assist those in Walter Reed and Bethesda and in our medical facilities around the world. We have done that. And we have manifested that in getting them the right equipment to carry out their mission. 
   But there is something else we owe the troops. We owe them the right to have victory, and they are achieving victory. And we owe them the right to have a successful mission, because nothing will be more fulfilling to them than to be victorious. And that means we need to continue to move the resources into Iraq and Afghanistan so they can continue to be victorious, so that the 80 percent drop-off in the violence rate in Anbar province will continue, and so that the Iraqi Army will continue to stand up to the point where it can displace America's heavy combat forces, Marines and Army, and our guys can come home or go to other places in CENTCOM. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a very important motion to instruct because it gives a very clear message to those 157,000-plus troops in Iraq and those 22,000-plus troops in Afghanistan. It says the American Congress, we stand behind our troops and we stand behind their mission.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman. 
   I am going to speak a little bit during our section on this bill, but I just wanted to invite the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, to come back down to the floor and to talk a little bit about the statement that he just made to the effect that there hasn't been any oversight over the last several years. 
   I am reminded of our teams that left the Armed Services Committee, went out to the companies that were up-armoring Humvees, started to move that schedule to the left, that means getting those Humvees quicker to the troops; and when they were told that there was a steel shortage, moving to the steel mills, finding out what the problem was. When they were told it might be a problem with too many shifts or not enough shifts with union employees, meeting with union employees, getting those shifts put on line, getting that steel produced, getting it to the Humvee factories and moving it out to the field. 
   I am also reminded of the times when we moved ahead quickly with what the gentleman has criticized as sole-source contracts when our troops in the field didn't have any dismounted jammers. That means the ability to stop an electronic signal that fires off a roadside bomb that hurts our troops. This committee moved quickly to give the Secretary of Defense the ability to waive all acquisition and competition regulations so you could do one thing, get equipment that protects our troops to the battlefield quicker. And we did that in terms of the first dismounted jammer that we produced, something that a marine or a GI could carry on a patrol that would keep a bad guy from detonating a roadside bomb that could kill him or his squad. Using this new system instead of the old system, we were able to, R&D, build in the United States and move into the warfighting theater 10,000 jammers for our troops within 70 days. 
   Now, the system that the gentleman is wedded to and loves so much, the slow system, the system in which you have interminable appeals, in which you have competitions that take months and months, sometimes years, is now working on the next generation of portable jammer. It has been a year, and we don't have that jammer fielded yet for troops in a portable fashion. 
   So I would just say to the gentleman who has been criticizing the contractor corps, 389 American contractors have been killed in this war so far, in this war against terror. They are great people, probably some of them from the gentleman's district. And the idea that he is trying to offer to this body, which I think is smart enough to reject that idea, that somehow there was no oversight in the theater, and by making these fairly minor changes, and these are fairly minor changes, we marked them up, they are nips and tucks in the oversight system. Somehow the judgment of the thousands of people who oversee our contracts around the world will now go from bad to good. That is obviously in great error. In fact, the same people are in place administering contracts; the same people are risking their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan to  support our warfighters. And by and large, they are doing an excellent job. 
   And we are going to get into later, into the added restrictions that the majority has placed on people who are participating in contract decisions, participating in a broad category called ``administering'' and the vagueness that attaches to that that might make a person civilly liable if they walk into the wrong meeting at the wrong time and they are ultimately prosecuted or fined civilly for making that mistake. 
   You know, we have great members of our staffs in the Armed Services Committee and indeed in all the committees in the House of Representatives. We shouldn't put a more onerous burden on the people that work in the rest of government than we would put on our own staff. 
   And I would say to my colleagues, one thing you have got to have when you have penalties, whether they are civil or criminal, that attach to action, you better define the action and you better define it clearly enough that staff members know exactly what they are doing and know exactly where the line is so they don't cross that line. 
   And let me just finish by saying that the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who I consider to be a friend, has done a real disservice to the great men and women who serve in a contracting capacity for this country by implying that somehow they haven't been doing their job and somehow the committees of this Congress have not been doing their job in this war against terror. 
   I thank my friend from Virginia for yielding me a couple of minutes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have given a fair amount of consideration to this bill, H.R. 1362. I have a couple of observations to share with you. 
   First, I am very proud of the work that the Armed Services Committee has done with respect to this bill to craft what I consider to be a better bill. I want to thank the chairman, my good friend from Missouri, Mr. Ike Skelton, for making sure that we participated in this markup and holding the markup of H.R. 1362. 
   I had serious concerns about the original bill as reported out of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, including a number of provisions that, through amending title 10, U.S. Code, and other procurement regulations, would have had the effect of preventing the Department of Defense from serving warfighter needs in the most expeditious manner possible. That is an issue that I spoke to just a minute ago in my exchange with Mr. Waxman. 
   As my colleagues from the Armed Services Committee know, this committee has given a great deal of attention to matters pertaining to acquisition reform. This has been especially true during wartime as our committee has worked hard to ensure that the brave men and women serving our country receive what they need when they need it as they deploy to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other theaters of operation. 
   At the same time, we have been vigorous advocates for competition and cost control measures. I firmly believe that the Armed Services Committee is best suited to properly balance the need for improving accountability in defense contracting while at the same time ensuring that the Department of Defense can carry out its duties to the warfighter. I am pleased that the chairman agreed to hold an Armed Services Committee markup of this bill. In continuing its rich tradition of deliberation and robust oversight of matters within its jurisdiction, the committee produced a higher quality piece of legislation. 
   I supported Chairman Skelton's mark because I believe the mark remedied the most serious deficiencies of the base bill and was truly a bipartisan measure. The Armed Services Committee mark encouraged competition and cost controls while protecting procurement flexibilities important to the national interest. 
   Secondly, it provided Congress with additional tools for oversight and reinforced standards of integrity widely held by the dedicated men and women of the defense acquisition workforce. 
   But, unfortunately, we are not here today to vote for the Armed Services Committee mark. We are not even here to vote for the Committee on Oversight Government Reform mark, which leads me to my second set of observations. 
   We are here today to vote for a piece of legislation that was not voted out of any committee. Those who would say this bill received unanimous support in two committees would not be telling it as it is. The full truth is that the Speaker wanted to put a rush on this bill so she could say Congress did something about contract reform. It was introduced late one night, and in 24 hours it was being voted out of committee. In two more business days a markup was scheduled in the Committee on Armed Services. Late that night, additional text was added that changed the bill yet again, and I think in a potentially dangerous way. 
   But no member of Oversight and Government Reform or Armed Services got to vote on those changes. Instead, the language simply appeared out of nowhere and the rule for H.R. 1362 let the new bill move to the floor. 
   What would the new language do? It is hard to say because the text is subject to broad interpretation, which is precisely what concerns me. One thing can safely be said. It is ironic that the original bill would have required agencies to hire thousands of additional personnel, but at the same time this new language would presume those personnel are dishonest and would attempt to restrict their decisionmaking ability or their ability to seek further employment. 
   I am all for accountability and performance in Federal contracting. I am likewise for accountability and performance in the legislative branch. Frankly, I am disappointed in the final product of this bill, and I am referring to the parts that were put in after we marked up our portion of the bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me go right back to Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Waxman and their assertion that somehow we are leaving a period of no oversight, and they have brought now oversight to the warfighting process and accountability for the contracts that are let pursuant to this war against terror. That is absolutely not the truth. 
   As anybody knows when you are fighting a war, you need to move quickly. I use once again the example of the jammers that we got out the door under a new waiver strategy where you waive all acquisition regulations. You go in and build something that the troops need immediately on the battlefield. You don't give a 6-month appeal to the folks that lose the competition. You don't give small business set-asides because there is one thing you don't have, you don't have time. 
   When we have troops that are experiencing bombs on the battlefield that are detonated remotely, you have to move quickly to get the jammers that will jam that electronic device. When you have new explosives that are penetrating your Humvees, you have to get steel on the sides of those Humvees quickly.     
   When you are moving a military force down the road and you have to get fuel to that force, whether it is in movement or in base, you have to move quickly. You cannot have 6-month appeal periods. You cannot have buyers'  forums that take months to set up. You have to move quickly. 
   Now, when you have time, you want to absolutely have competition, and I can just tell my colleagues that that is always in my interest to have competition, get the best buy for the buck, and we have had a number of forums incidentally. We introduced the Challenge Program where any company that could come in and say, I could make a better tire for the Humvee than the incumbent, or I can make a better windshield or a better engine, that guy or lady has got the right to go in and challenge the incumbent company that has the present contract and show how they can do it cheaper or make something that has better warfighting capability. We introduced that legislation. That is called the Challenge Legislation. 
   But let us not mix that up with this idea that somehow you can have competition on every single aspect of the battlefield, and when you need a new jammer to stop roadside bombs, you go out and you start a month-long search, and then you have a 6-month competition, and then after the award you have a 6-month appeal, and by that time you are ready for the next war. You are not even relevant to the situation that is hurting your young men and women on the battlefield right now. 
   So there is some good substance in this bill, and I like it, but there is a lot of rhetoric. There is a lot of worthless, political rhetoric that preceded this bill, and I hope that the American people will not be snagged by that one. There are times that you have to move quickly. 
   I am reminded of one contractor that came back. One of the contractors who was not one of the 389 who has been killed in this war, and he showed me a picture of a crater, of a mortar crater. He said, That is where I was standing 5 minutes before that mortar landed. He said, I do not care how much you award this contract for, I am not going back to that dangerous AO. 
   Let me tell you, there are a lot of people who do go back time and time again. They are good Americans. They are honest Americans, and they are the same folks carrying out the contracting and administering the support of our Armed Forces who were there 6 months ago. The idea that somehow they have been crooked up to now, that now they are going to be straightened out by Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Waxman is absolutely outrageous. 
   So having said those gentle words, I look forward to the continued discussion. Mr. Waxman has taken the floor. I would be happy to yield to Mr. Waxman if he has got a rejoinder.

   Mr. HUNTER. Let me just take my time back. I am not making it personal. Mr. Waxman made a statement, I am talking. Mr. Waxman, I will let you respond to this. We are not making it personal. 
   What I am telling you is that there are exigencies in the battlefield, and you got this from your own leadership, gentlemen like Mr. Murtha who said you cannot have these long delays in awarding contracts and have this vigorous oversight period; you cannot have that hold up a battlefield situation. You do have to award sole-source contracts, and you have to award them to people who can move very quickly and get things done. That is my point. 
   The idea that we are supposed to stop that or that we have not exercised any oversight is simply not accurate. There is no personal animosity toward you as a fine Member of this body, but those statements are not accurate, and I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Waxman, the two provisions that were put in after the markup, the one that talks about a person who participates in a meeting as a senior staff, that means if a person walks in a room and if they are involved in a discussion, they could be subjected to massive civil penalties at a later time if there is a contract awarded. 
   I would simply say that I think in areas where you have civil penalties you have to have great clarity, and I have not seen a definition of ``senior staff'' or ``senior participants'' in DOD, and I think that that is a real problem. I think it is a problem of vagueness and one that could keep people from entering the civil service in this role and in this capacity.

   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me just say about the major points of this bill, which we marked up, that we are in agreement with it. Contrary to Mr. Waxman, we did look at them before we came to the floor. 
   We agree with the no more than 1 year for sole source, that is good; the plan to minimize use of sole source, that is good; maximize fixed-price procurement, that is good; quarterly report to Congress, good; codify the right to review unredacted copies of reports, that is good. 
   What I think you need to be very careful about, because if you are going to penalize people, if you are going to give them $50,000 civil penalties, you need to have it clearly laid out for those people who may be professional members of our staffs, who may be good people who come in from the outside and go to work in DOD and wanting to serve this country, let's make sure that walking into a room and participating in a conversation about a contract doesn't then expose them to civil penalties later on. 
   So I am looking at title III, and I am looking at the word on line 17, it talks about participated personally and substantially at a senior personnel level. 
   Does that mean, and this relates, of course, to elimination of loopholes that allow former Federal officials to accept compensation from contractors or related entities? I think that is good. 
   But I think we need to make it very clear as to whether a staff member, like one of your staff members, Mr. Waxman, going to work for DOD, who walks in a room and is asked a question about a defense system and answers that question, participates in the conversation, whether he has then violated the law. 
   Now, if you turn, and I want you to take a look at that, that is line 18. Now, turn the next page, page 14, and go down to the bottom, and it talks about the administration of a contract, which could also be a violation of a law. 
   So if one of your former staff members or one of mine who goes to work for DOD should participate in the administration, let me just ask you, ask the gentleman from California, if it's a defense system, and your former staff member is assigned to go out to a range to see if that piece of equipment has arrived at the range and if it's being tested, is that involving itself in administration of the contract? Is that person, that former staff member of yours, now involved in administration such as to expose him to civil penalties? That is my question. I think we need to have that clarified.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I like this motion to recommit. You know, all of us have shown our support for the troops. Almost every Member in this body has shown support by traveling to the warfighting theaters. This is a chance to show support in another way, to show that we believe that the military is an outstanding profession, one which many of our young people who are in institutions of higher education may want to engage in. And this elevates, I think, the military profession by showing that we accord it respect by putting this requirement in this motion to recommit. 
   So I thank the gentleman for offering it. I think it is excellent. I would commend it to all the Members of this body. And I want to thank the chairman for his offering of the base bill, and for the ranking member, Mr. Davis, for their hard work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to yield myself 1 1/2 minutes to respond to the first assertion just made by my colleague, to the effect that we sent the troops in without what he called life-saving equipment. 
   When we finished the Clinton administration, virtually no one in any of the 10 Army divisions, which, incidentally, had been cut from 14 Army divisions when that administration went into power, none of the 10 divisions that were left, virtually none of them had any bulletproof vests, any of this body armor that we talk about that our troops have today. 
   When we went into the first operation, we had much more than the Clinton administration had. At that point we had a number of the inserts, of the so-called Small Arms Protective Inserts. We had the outer tactical vests that incorporate those inserts with all of our Marines, with all of the infantry units going in with the U.S. Army. And very quickly after that, we developed a plan in which we fielded body armor for not only the people on the front lines, the infantry, the artillery, the armor, but also everybody that is in theater. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely outrageous to tell the American people that the Americans were dangerously unequipped when we went into Iraq. We went in with better equipment than we have ever had in any wars that this country has ever fought. And today, we have fielded over 40,000 pieces of new equipment that we didn't have 4 years ago that makes our troops yet more efficient. 
   I would like to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Linder).

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, let me just take 2 minutes to respond to my colleague who has just made a number of points. 
   First, there are a number of live Democrats that I like to refer to. When somebody asks me whether or not Saddam Hussein was indeed a dangerous terrorist in and of himself, I like to take the words of all of the Democrat leadership of this country in the 1990s, when, in their words, there was no Bush administration to trick them, who made that point very, very forcefully. 
   Secondly, the invasion of Iraq and the taking of Baghdad in record time with very low casualties has been described by most military leaders as being a remarkably efficient and effective operation. In fact, while we had people saying that our troops would be bogged down, the same talk shows would be interrupted with a news flash that Tommy Franks had taken yet another stronghold of Saddam Hussein.     
   We took Baghdad with very low casualties, very, very quickly, in a very effective and efficient military operation. 
   Lastly, I don't think that the gentleman can say that there have been no ripples, no ripples whatsoever in the Middle East with respect to freedom and democracy and people wanting to be free as a result of the elections in Iraq. There clearly was action in Libya where they moved lots of parts of their nuclear weapons program which are now residing in the United States, I think as a result of American actions there. Clearly actions toward freedom, toward ejecting the Syrians from Lebanon and moving toward multiparty elections in Egypt. All imperfect to be sure but nonetheless reactions from our operation in Iraq. 
   Lastly, I would just say to my colleague let me just say to my colleague, there are no smooth roads. The smooth roads not taken, that have been held out by the armchair critics, like we should have kept Saddam Hussein's army in place, that was an army with 11,000 Sunni generals. What are you going to do with an army with 11,000 Sunni generals? Certainly not establish stability in a country in which you have a Shiite majority. 
   The idea that we needed to have 300,000 Americans in Iraq and yet at the same time put an Iraqi face, as a number of the critics have said, on the military apparatus. 
   So I think a number of the gentleman's points have been strongly disproven by the American operation in Iraq. We are in the second period right now of a three-phase operation: stand up a free government; stand up a military capable of protecting that free government; lastly, the Americans leave. Let's give the second phase a chance to work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to yield myself 15 seconds to make a response to that last point. 
   My last point wasn't that Lebanon is California or New York or Massachusetts. My last point was that the free elections in Iraq inspired the Lebanese to work to eject the Syrian influence, which I think the gentleman would agree was not a good influence in Lebanon. It inspired people to want to be free.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   This is, indeed, a sad time in our country. Five years ago we came to this floor united. We joined in sending our troops off in this war against terror. 
   You know, Madam Speaker, for the first number of strikes that were delivered by Muslim extremists in this war, the terrorists chose the battlefields. They chose a battlefield as a Marine barracks in Beirut. And Mr. Skelton and I were there, he shortly after the explosion that killed our Marines, I shortly before that explosion. They chose the Khobar Towers, they chose the embassies in Africa, they chose the USS Cole, and then they chose New  York, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania. We chose the next two battlefields, Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   Our Democrat colleagues say that Iraq was the wrong battlefield, and I have heard resonating through the floor over the last 4 days statements that they were tricked, hornswoggled, fooled about Saddam Hussein. 
   From my side of the argument as to whether or not Saddam Hussein was a dangerous terrorist, I will simply offer all the statements by every Democrat leader in America during the 1990s, when there was no Bush administration to, in the words of my Democrat colleagues, ``trick them.'' I will offer their statements about Saddam Hussein. 
   Madam Speaker, we have expanded in the last 60 years. We have been in the business of expanding freedom. We understood after World War II that if we didn't change the world, the world would change us. And that lesson was relearned after 9/11. 
   No one would argue that it is not in our interest to have a Japan on the other side of the Pacific, where we stood up a free government, where we have a free nation, or that it is not in our interest to have a free El Salvador in our own hemisphere, or that it is not in our interest to have those dozens of nations that were behind the Berlin Wall that are now free and working for freedom. Many of them are partners in Iraq. We understand that. 
   And now we are trying to expand freedom in a different part of the world, a very dangerous part of the world. And we are undertaking the same three-point strategy that we have had for 60 years: Number one, you stand up a free government; number two, you stand up a military capable of protecting that free government; and, number three, the Americans leave. 
   And we can build on this Baghdad plan, which is right now in the execution phase, this plan of having two or three Iraqi battalions out front, with an American backup battalion to mentor them, and we can rotate every one of the 129 Iraqi battalions through this type of a combat rotation, stand them up, give them battlefield experience, and then the Americans can leave. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, I have heard it said throughout this debate that there was somehow a smooth road not taken. And let me just say, that is not true. There are no smooth roads in the Middle East. There are no smooth roads to standing up new governments, especially in communities and states where people have been trained to live under dictatorships. 
   And for those who say if we had just kept Saddam Hussein's army in place, with it is 11,000 Sunni generals, everything would have been fine and we would have had a peaceful situation in Iraq right now, that is nonsense. And for those who said if we had had 200,000 or 300,000 troops, the Shiites and Sunnis would have forgotten their ancient rivalries, that is also nonsense. 
   What are the facts, the reality, our Democrat friends say we have to be realists here, is this is a tough, difficult road. We are on the second stage right now. Most importantly, Madam Speaker, our troops are in the field already on this plan that is now being retroactively disavowed by the Democratic leadership. 
   You know, it was in June, I think it was 2130 hours, June 6, 1944, when the first elements of the first aircraft of the Pathfinder companies went out in front of the 82nd Airborne over Normandy, and they shortly were followed by hundreds of airplanes with American paratroopers. The 82nd Airborne going into Normandy had the full support and prayers of everybody in the United States Congress. 
   Today, you have got an 82nd Airborne Second Brigade now operating under this plan in Baghdad already there in Baghdad. Now, is this going to be the day, I would ask my colleagues, when some trooper from the 82nd Airborne writes on the concrete wall next to his position in Baghdad, ``This is where I stood when the United States House of Representatives led by the Democrat leadership rejected my mission''? I hope that doesn't happen, Madam Speaker. 
   Vote ``no'' on this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, as legislators, we meet once again to address the wide range of important national security activities undertaken by the Departments of Defense and Energy. We all take our legislative responsibilities very seriously, and this is especially true during a time of war. 
   And it's always true of my good friend and colleague, Ike Skelton, the great gentleman from Missouri, our chairman. I want to thank Chairman Skelton for the excellent job that he's done in putting this bill together, and also thank all of our subcommittee chairmen and ranking members who have put together a composite that very strongly meets the needs of our men and women in uniform. 
   As a result of Mr. Skelton's efforts to put forward this bill, our committee reported out the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 last Wednesday. The vote was unanimous, 58-0. 
   I support this bill. It reflects our committee's continued strong support for the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces, and in many ways this bill is a very good bill. 
   It authorizes the President's request for $503.8 billion for the fiscal year 2008 base budget of the Department of Defense and national security programs of the Department of Energy. This amount provides for end-strength growth in both the Army and Marine Corps, continuing initiatives started several years ago by the Armed Services Committee. 
   In fiscal year 2008, the Army would be authorized 525,400, which is 3,000 more than authorized last year, and the Marine Corps would be authorized 189,000, 9,000 more than last year. The bill also includes $142 billion to cover fiscal year 2008 war costs, as requested by the President. 
   Some of the initiatives in this legislation continue or build upon successful programs or reinforce good legislation that the House has already passed. For example, this legislation has provisions that are essential to maintain a robust defense industrial base. Last year, the Defense authorization bill tried to strike a fair balance between requiring the use of domestic specialty metals for our weapons systems and offering a waiver process in case sufficient metals are not available. H.R. 1585 establishes a formal rulemaking process for waivers that apply to multiple contracts to facilitate transparency and the gathering of broad industry input. In this way, the market will be able to respond to supply shortages, fostering investment in domestic industries. 
   Other initiatives in this bill modify existing authorities or establish promising new programs and policies, such as adding $4.1 billion for the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, so-called MRAPs. Separately, H.R. 1585 levels the playing field between U.S. companies and foreign countries with which we have free trade agreements. It rectifies a critical flaw in the U.S. Code that effectively penalizes U.S. companies for complying with U.S. law, while allowing foreign manufacturers to provide noncompliant components and systems. 
   These and other sections go a considerable way in ensuring that our brave men and women in uniform have the best available tools to protect our national security interests, but this bill is not a perfect bill. We can and we should improve it. 
   This legislation cuts missile defense programs by almost $800 million. In 2006, there were about 100 foreign ballistic missile launches around the world, including from North Korea with short-range missiles and a longer-range TD-2 missile; and from Iran with its development and testing of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. I wonder whether in the face of this growing threat we should be slowing down the development and fielding of a robust, layered ballistic missile defense system that would prove critical to our Nation's defenses. 
   This bill recommends a reduction of more than $860 million for the Army's Future Combat Systems program. In the past, our committee made smaller cuts to drive behaviors that would lead to a successful system. With the magnitude of this cut, I worry about the long-term impact on the capability of the U.S. Army and wonder whether we should not restore some of this funding to ensure that the Army is as prepared as possible to meet future challenges. 
   And finally, this bill provides significant resources for shipbuilding. I am concerned, however, that we have not fully funded two of the three additional ships that the language purports to have added. The bill is approximately $145 million less than the amount the Navy needs to buy and take delivery of an additional dry cargo ship, which was number two on the Navy's unfunded priority list. Also, the bill provides $588 million for advanced procurement for an additional ship-set of reactive plant heavy components for a Virginia-class submarine in 2008, but it remains up to future Congresses to complete the funding and turn these components into an additional submarine before 2012.     
   As in years past, I believe that this legislation reflects many of the Armed Services Committee's priorities in supporting our Nation's dedicated and courageous servicemembers. 
   I want to thank again Chairman Skelton for putting together an excellent bill and helping us stay focused on delivering a bill that helps us protect, sustains and builds our forces. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve and pass H.R. 1585. 
   Mr. Chairman, at this point, I would like to yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price).

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I want to thank all Members who participated in the general debate, and all the great subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, and the chairman of the committee for putting together this great bill, and will now enter the amendment process. 
   There is just one point that I wanted to make in listening to my colleague finish up in talking about the mental health of America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. 
   One observation that I have made over the years in being around people that wear the uniform is that while a number of the stresses and the difficulties that have been spoken of are real, it is also real that the coolest, calmest, most balanced, most stable American citizens, I believe, are the folks that wear the uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan. And while it is true that enemy fire can hurt you and damage you mentally as well as physically, it is also true that that fire can make you stronger. 
   Having spent time with guys like Chuck Yeager, guys like the great Vic Taylor, many others who have been under fire and in various situations in real combat in the world's wars, it has always occurred to me that the people who have the greatest mental stability are people that come out of the combat zones. 
   So I want to make sure that this debate doesn't send the message that somehow Americans who wear the uniform are victims, and that the inevitable result of their wearing the uniform and serving in combat is that they are going to somehow be damaged mentally, because that is not the case. 
   And I would just conclude by reflecting on the fact that I take a number of folks who are wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan hunting, which the Hunter family likes to do, and I take them hunting with my grandchildren. And there are few people that I will trust my grandchildren with, but the people I will trust my grandchildren with out in the great outdoors, with loaded weapons, are members of the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps who have been to combat. Those people have the greatest sense of balance and sense of judgment. 
   And, again, in my mind, America's citizens who are the coolest and the calmest under fire and have the greatest sense of balance and judgment are people that wear the uniform and have been in combat. 
   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Chair, we've looked over the amendment. It's really an adjustment of a part of the base bill that we have that allows for this memorandum of understanding between these three primary entities, State, DOD and AID, to make sure that they have an understanding of authorization of the carrying of the weapons by contractors, the rules of engagement, coordinating movement of contractors, collecting information relating to offenses under UCMJ and also, additionally, what the gentlelady has offered in her amendment, the issuance of guidance on all equipment, including uniforms, body armor, weapons and the collection of information related to casualties suffered by contractors. 
   And our only concern, of course, is that we have enough time for this memorandum of understanding to be put together after the bill becomes law, which in some cases is late December, hopefully long before then. And so what we do need is to have the ability of the administration, if they don't have that together. And one thing we all agree on is you've got to do this right when they do it, when they issue this memorandum of understanding. So they need to have time to do it; that we do have a waiver or an extension of time that would be allowed. 
   And so I've talked this over with the gentlelady, who is the author of the amendment. She's amenable to extending the time period for this memorandum of understanding to be worked out, and the chairman has graciously agreed that he also supports that. 
   And so just in a simple informal colloquy, I'd just ask the chairman if it's his agreement that, in conference, we would work to extend the time wherein the memorandum of understanding could be worked out if, in fact, it can't be done within 90 days of the first of January 2008. Would the gentleman agree to effect that in conference?

   Mr. HUNTER. I just wanted to thank the gentlelady for, respectfully, for her addition to this amendment and her concern about the contractors. And you know, just reflect for a second, that our contractors who go over to the warfighting theaters in Iraq and Afghanistan undertake enormous danger, and a large number of them have been killed and wounded. And many of them, the ones that I have met, are largely American veterans who have, they go for two reasons; one is they do make good money. It's a job, it's a worthwhile job. They feel like they're supporting our country. They also have a great, the ones I've talked to, have a great deal of concern for the troops. They have a feeling of partnership with the people that wear the uniform of the United States, and they are a great asset to this country. And I think it's appropriate that we follow, we carefully watch how they're treated and how they're protected. I think that's absolutely appropriate. 
   I thank the chairman for embedding this base provision in the base bill, and  members on the Republican and Democrat side who've worked to put this together, and I thank the gentlelady for her thoughtful addition.

   We recognized and have embedded in law the remedies for a service person who may be overseas and may lose his house or may have a judgment taken against him, a civil law liability judgment, and we have tried to protect him from that. And the idea of having a child taken from you while you are serving overseas can only have a demoralizing effect on members of the armed services. 
   So this protection is very much needed, and I thank the gentleman from Ohio. We have total support on this side for his amendment.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I have enormous respect for my great friend from New Jersey, who has shared and fought on common ground with this Member for many years on items of interest and national defense that we shared support of. 
   In this case, I must oppose this amendment strongly for this reason. The nation that he's talking about, Iran, borders obviously one of our important warfighting theaters, that is, Iraq. We have seen evidence, it has been reported by our warfighting commanders that Iran has participated in moving instruments of death; that is, extremely effective IEDs that have been used against American troops and will prospectively be used against American troops, into Iraq from Iran. 
   The idea that we are saying that in this piece of the budget we cannot plan for interdiction of those items, of those weapons that are moving across the border, that we can't plan, for example, for Special Forces operations that we might need to implement or to move into action, to preempt this movement of deadly devices across the border, that we can't plan to extract hostages if they should be taken by Iranian militia or Iranian members of the armed forces is just not practical and it's not reasonable. 
   You have an Iranian military and intelligence body which has decided to become involved in the war in Iraq. They have moved across the border, and they have moved effective weapons across the border that are being used against American troops. I think it is not wise for us to advertise to our adversaries and to the world that we are establishing a policy that we will not even use money to contemplate or to plan for a reaction against us. I think we have to let them know that we have license, as Americans, to take any actions that might be necessary to protect American troops. 
   I would object very strongly to this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would just respond to my friend from New Jersey in this way: It says that you can't plan for a major contingency. I am looking at scenarios, and if you have a scenario where you have convoys of IED material being moved from Iran into Iraq and you want to send a team over and make a strike and close a canyon or close a mountain pass or hit that convoy with a major strike, I think many people would classify that as a major action, a major contingency.     
   So I think that we blurred the line here in that we may have to take what I would consider and many Members here would consider to be major contingencies. The problem is, you have to take those things very quickly. 
   This war against terror is an era when time is truly of the essence, when hours are important, when minutes are important, when days are important. The idea we have to come back, if you have got to close a pass to keep IEDs that are killing Americans in Iraq from going across that line, we have to come back and get permission from Congress to do that, I think that is not a good advertisement or a good statement of impunity to communicate to the other side, where they think they now have an insulation between an immediate reaction by American Armed Forces. 
   That is the essence of our resistance to this amendment, and I think it is still very solid.

   Mr. Chairman, let me just say to my friend, I just reviewed it the other day, and I don't need to look at any statements by George W. Bush about whether or not we should have gone into Iraq, because the most damning statements about Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction, the most conclusive statements that indeed he must have them and that he must be brought to justice quickly, were not made by George W. Bush. They were made by people with the last name of Clinton, of Gore, of Kerry. I reviewed all of the videotapes of their speeches in which they absolutely laid out a case against Saddam Hussein. 
   So I hope we don't replow the ground of who shot John here in terms of statements with respect to the state of Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction. 
   I think we need to get back to the substance of this debate, and that is, are we foreclosing an immediate response if it is necessary.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to explain again why I think it is impractical to put this dividing line between this funding. 
   If there has to be a strike, if there has to be preemption because IED material is moving across the border that could injure our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, our marines, probably the reactive force is going to be led by one of the combatant commanders who is in the Iraqi theater and who is being funded by money under OEF or OIF. It is probably not going to come. And the idea you can't have uniformed personnel expending his time and his staff's time planning what it is going to take to defend his soldiers, sailors, airmen or marines from interference from the Iranian side of the border, is, in my estimation, not practical. 
   Those are the forces that are going to be responding, and I think we have to let them put together that contingency plan.

   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. We have been at war with the radical Islamic jihadists ever since they supported and fomented that storming of our embassy in 1979. They held Americans hostage and they held them for 444 days, and every President since President Carter has renewed the national emergency with respect to Iran, most recently on March 8 of this year. 
   If you look at the War Powers Act, Mr. Chairman, it states that a national emergency does justify the President utilizing his constitutional powers as Commander in Chief. My reading of this amendment is that this proposal, this amendment, changes the War Powers Act and extracts that power from the President of the United States. We have had Democrat and Republican Presidents renewing that finding and that national emergency status with respect to Iran. 
   Just to say further, Mr. Chairman, we all know, and I just talked about this, we know that Iran through its proxies helped and aided in the attack against Americans at Khobar Towers, which killed 19 Americans and injured 372 other Americans and other people who were in that area. We know that the Iranian-backed insurgents are killing American troops with IEDs, and some of that IED expertise and the materials themselves are being transferred from Iran. We know that they are assisting in attacks against Americans in Afghanistan. 
   A couple of weeks ago the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Pace, said, ``We have intercepted weapons in Afghanistan headed for the Taliban that were made in Iran. The arms included mortars and C-4 plastic explosives.''     
   So, Mr. Chairman, every Member of this body should be strongly opposed to this particular amendment.

   I would just offer to my colleague who just spoke and my other colleagues that there are the strongest statements for invasion of Iraq that took place before President Bush came into office, and those were the now famous speeches that were made by three Senators by the name of Kerry, Clinton, and Gore. 
   Mr. Chairman, the War Powers Act clearly calls for the ability of the Commander in Chief to introduce American military force where an emergency with respect to a nation has been declared. That emergency with respect to Iran has been declared by every American President since President Carter in 1979. This is not extra-constitutional. The law as it presently exists is consistent with the Constitution. This would infringe. In fact, this would roll back the War Powers Act. Every Member should vote against this amendment.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, we are in strong opposition to this amendment. In fact, the Armed Services Committee under the very able chairmanship of the gentleman from Missouri has finished a number of oversight hearings. The subcommittees that are involved in the Armed Services Committee and in Defense Appropriations Subcommittee have undertaken extensive hearings and analysis of every weapons system that we have. And, of course, you have many weapons systems that were built 20-30 years ago that were highly relevant, like the C-130s that Members fly on, that are the backbone of the transportation system, the intratheater transportation system in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Bradley fighting vehicles, M-1 tanks. There is no weapon system that comes out of a production line with the word ``Cold War'' on it, so the relevance and the importance and the use of weapons has been carefully and closely analyzed by the important committees, the oversight committees, and we are aided in that by the Quadrennial Defense Review that is done by the administration where they make their case for what they think that we need, and the President makes that proposition which is manifested in his budget. And after hearings, the members of this committee and the full body, this House of Representatives, respond with our cut on what we think we should do with respect to arming and maintaining and equipping our military forces. 
   So I would just strongly oppose the gentlelady's amendment, and say I have great respect for the gentlelady.

We work in my office with a number of groups, one of them called Rescue Task Force, which has built medical centers around the world and brought in food and medicine in many very difficult situations. 
   I'd like to offer to work with the gentleman with this nongovernmental organization, Rescue Task Force, and others to bring in food and medicine to that particular location. Let's see if we can't maybe help lead out by getting some NGOs to start using this particular airfield. And I'll be happy to join the gentleman; I know Mr. Saxton will be happy to join in this, Mr. Wolf and others. 
   Let's get a letter, maybe a meeting with the State Department, with the administration, see if we can't get this review of this airfield immediately and start getting some supplies into it, and maybe we can lead the world, the humanitarian world, as Americans, as we do so often, in moving supplies into the airfield that you have identified. 
   So I support this very, very strongly. And I didn't know if Mr. Saxton wanted to involve himself in this discussion, but I know he wants to help here, too. If the gentleman would take me up on that offer, and if he's got a nongovernmental organization in mind, let's move out on this one. It looks like an excellent, excellent opportunity for cooperating and helping. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

   Let me offer we have these great nongovernmental organizations, we have a lot of people who have been displaced and abused in Darfur. They desperately need food and medicine. I will commit to the gentleman that we will try to work with these NGOs that we know of and let's try to work together in a partnership and try to get a plane load of supplies into that airfield or another one by the first of July. That's a little more than a month from now. 
   Let's work together. We will start working today to try to get this done. Let's prod the good old State Department and DOD to get out there and survey that airfield.

   Mr. HUNTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That's exactly what I wanted to do. 
   I just wanted to get on the record that I support this amendment very strongly, the idea of saving energy. I would hope that the gentleman would agree that, wherever possible, the energy-saving devices, these light bulbs, should be made in the United States.  They are paid for with Department of Defense funds. The average American worker spends over $1,000 a year out of his or her paycheck to support the defense function of government, and it is appropriate that American workers be allowed to make the new, innovative, energy-saving devices that we are using at bases throughout the country. 
   I yield to the gentleman to ask him if he wouldn't agree with me that, wherever it is practical, that American-made bulbs should be used in this replacement program. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. HUNTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I want to thank the gentleman for his amendment. I think it is absolutely appropriate. We support it. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is the provision that we put into the law last year when we saw that American fallen service personnel were being transported in what we thought was a less than dignified manner and escorted in a less than dignified manner to their final resting places. 
   Of course, I went to the Department of Defense initially and had them involved in discussions with the committee with respect to effecting informally a policy that would have dedicated aircraft and would have a dedicated honor guard and military escort that would complete the transport of fallen American service personnel from Dover to their final resting places. We couldn't work something out, so we ended up putting that in law, and having the full support of the other body, that, indeed, is the practice. 
   I have been around the country now to various places where American heroes have come home, and there has been an outpouring of gratitude from a number of communities and families that in fact the system is working well now with dedicated military aircraft, with the appropriate honor guard escorting the fallen American heroes, and the families now feel much better about the process.     
   Now, I would hope that, in practice, the U.S. military is not, as a rule, taking people to a home of record when in fact their final resting place may be hundreds of miles away, but I understand that the gentleman has two cases where that, in fact, would have taken place if they hadn't made contact with the DOD and the DOD hadn't sorted that out. 
   And so I think this is absolutely appropriate to put into statute what, essentially, they've been doing, as I understand, as a matter of practice in carrying out the mandate that we gave them last year with the new law that came from this committee. 
   So I support the gentleman. I thank him for offering this amendment, and we certainly support it on this side. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, let me just make this clear. This is a net cut in missile defense. This is not a matter of taking money from something that we don't need and moving it to something we urgently need. This is a net cut of $764 million. 
   Now, my great friend from North Carolina (Mr. Spratt) made the point we spent well over $100 billion on missile defense since Ronald Reagan reminded us that we live in the age of missiles. On the other hand, the strike on 9/11 probably cost us, in terms of economic destruction, $500 billion plus. 
   We can't afford not to have robust missile defense. That means you take down incoming missiles at all phases, in boost phase, in midcourse, and, lastly, in terminal phase. We need robust missile defense. We need to defend this country. We need to restore this money, and the Franks amendment is right on target.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentlelady for yielding and I appreciate her courtesy. And let me just say why I think you may want to consider supporting this amendment. 
   We had a discussion and we had some confusion a couple years ago with respect to missile defense, the systems that we were placing in Fort Greely, Alaska. The question was whether money that was R&D money could be used for construction, basically for pouring concrete, and we had a tremendous tug-of-war over that. So there is some ambiguity here. 
   We have got 14 missiles that could be used to intercept a couple of rogue incoming missiles even out of the test bed. So we could use these test missiles to protect our country in extreme circumstances. 
   I don't think it is a bad thing to clearly lay that out and clarify it in light of the fact that we did have confusion over the color of money in the missile defense programs between R&D and MILCON. 
   So would the gentlelady consider that in supporting the gentleman's amendment?

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I support his amendment. 
   As many of us on the Armed Services Committee have traveled to Iraq a number of times, and we utilize right now bases throughout Iraq, like the Balad Air Base, which was previously a fighter air base for Saddam Hussein's tactical aircraft, we use those bases, it makes absolute sense that we shouldn't somehow put Iraq in a different category than every other ally of the world which allows us to have a basing in their country. So designating that we may have temporary basing in Iraq is absolutely normal relations with Iraq, something that we have with dozens and dozens of other nations; and that will allow us in times of exigency to be able to use runways for resupply, for tactical air operations, for other  operations that extend important American foreign policy in that region of the world. 
   And so I think the gentleman has a very commonsense amendment, and I would support it.

   Mr. HUNTER. My colleagues, I have a lot of respect for my friend from Virginia, but this amendment is a bad amendment. It's an amendment which goes to the very core of the Guantanamo facility, the purpose of the Guantanamo facility, the nature of the people who are imprisoned in the Guantanamo facility, and the ongoing war against terrorism. 
   Now, I'm reading my friend's amendment, and it directs DOD to undertake a plan for the transfer of each individual presently imprisoned at Guantanamo. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, the people who are imprisoned in Guantanamo are largely terrorists. They include people like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who has admitted in court that he planned the attack on 9/11 that destroyed thousands of American lives. 
   It includes people like Abu Zubaydah, who helped smuggle now deceased al Qaeda leader al-Zarqawi and some 70 Arab fighters out of Kandahar, Afghanistan into Iran, who also tried to organize a terrorist attack in Israel, who was recruited by Osama Bin Laden. 
   It includes Ahmed Galeni, who worked for al Qaeda's chief of external operations and forged or altered passports for many al Qaeda members, who knew and met many of the operatives involved in the attacks, including Fahid Masala, who was asked to help the group purchase TNT for trucks and gas cylinders that would later be used to construct a car bomb, requests which he fulfilled. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, these are people who understand how to kill large numbers of people. The last thing you want to do is to take people from an extremely secure facility that has been designed to ensure that they don't escape, that they're not able to spread their understanding of car bombs and other destructive devices to other terrorists or prisoners. 
   Now, the gentleman's initial amendment that was filed on this went a bit further. It talked about moving the detainees to places in the United States. And if you think it through, that's where we would probably have to transfer them. If it orders DOD to put together a transfer plan, the logical recipients of that transfer plan will be bases and facilities in the United States. 
   Now, that means that unless you isolate these terrorists, these people that know how to make car bombs, you're going to put them in facilities in the U.S. with American criminals, and they are presumably going to teach these people how to make things like car bombs and other destructive devices. In this case, you have to keep them isolated. 
   And I would say to my colleague, you know, we have had, under the tribunals that we have put together to determine whether people are just farmers in the field or whether they really were terrorist combatants, we've released a number of people who have gone back to Afghanistan and gone back to their home countries. A few of them have actually shown up on battlefields around the world fighting us again, which shows that our standard for releasing them has in some cases been too liberal, not too conservative.     
   But the idea of taking people who know how to kill large numbers of people with destructive devices and moving them, spreading them around to other institutions where they may give that knowledge to other people, other criminals who have hurt Americans, who might be inclined to hurt more Americans, is not a good idea. We need to keep them isolated. 
   And I would say to my colleague I have been down to Guantanamo. I am sure he has also. We feed those people well. They have a better medical system than most HMO systems in America. Not one person has been murdered in Guantanamo. And none of us can say about our State prisons nobody has ever been murdered in our State prison. Every single Member of this body has State prisons in their districts or their State in which more murders have taken place than in Guantanamo. Nobody is making a suggestion that we close our State prisons because they have a bad reputation nationally or internationally. 
   So I would respectfully urge a very strong ``no'' vote on this amendment. I think it is a bad amendment. I respect the author, but I think it takes us in the wrong direction. 
   Let's keep these people collected. Let's keep them isolated. Let's keep the rest of the world safe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this resolution. Let me just speak to the point that is made by the resolution that talks about the need to disclose in open session facts which would deal with corruption, and I am quoting, ``including allegations that investigations were thwarted, stifled for political reasons, and that that classification should be rescinded.'' 
   I have looked at Mr. Butler's testimony to the committee. I have read it. I have got it in front of me. He talks a great deal, acknowledging that there is corruption in the Iraqi Government, as there is in practically every government in the Middle East, to some degree. He talks about that. 
   Mr. Speaker, he also said that he would be happy to talk about details concerning any political moves to avert investigations into corruption. He would be happy to talk about those details in a classified session. So he gave that opportunity, as I understand it, to the committee, and the committee didn't take him up on it. 
   I would just say, Mr. Speaker, that sources and methods are important. If there was a secret conversation that went on in the Iraqi Government and that secret conversation was listened to by somebody who then relayed that to the U.S. Government, or U.S. officials, laying that out for the public without going into classified session would not be good for American intelligence operations. This committee could have gone into classified session and had all the details that they needed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this particular resolution.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, what I have in front of me is the actual testimony of Mr. Butler, who says this: ``The Department of State has devoted considerable effort and resources helping courageous Iraqis establish mechanisms and procedures to investigate and prosecute corruption.'' He says, ``It's fair to say we probably do not have a program in the ministerial capacity development area that does not seek to build an environment in which corruption is less prevalent.'' He goes on to talk about what has been done. So he does engage you on this issue of corruption. 
   I think you could have gone to a classified session, as was invited by Mr. Butler, you could have gone to a classified session, he invited you to do that, and he would give you the details on that particular conversation. Incidentally, the particular conversation that you're talking about is the one that is manifested in your resolution. It's not this statement that you have just given me. It's the one that is in your resolution. You could have had him do that in private.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my great colleague for yielding me some time and just follow my colleagues to again commend all of those who helped to take on this incredible challenge and to defeat this fire. Even though it destroyed lots of sagebrush land and lots of back country and homes and buildings and took some lives, we had a well-coordinated effort. 
   Let me just point out also that I know Mr. Issa talked about the United States Marines and the United States Navy especially in the San Diego region working hand in hand with State and local firefighting officials and volunteers and the crews and especially in the area of the air war against the fire undertaking this challenge and doing very, very well. 
   At the other level, at the level of bringing in assets from out of the State, I think we should also commend General Steven Blum, who is head of the National Guard for this country. And even before he received the request from the State of California, even though the request had been initiated by Governor Schwarzenegger, it goes through a number of bureaus and agencies before it actually gets to the unit that is going to send the particular firefighting aircraft to the location where it is going to engage the fire. 
   Before he received the request from the State of California, General Steven Blum deployed aircraft and put out the deployment order for aircraft from Colorado, Wyoming and North Carolina. These are the so-called MAFFS units, C-130 units that have the ability to put down about 3,000 gallons of fire retardant per aircraft. They can pave an area a quarter of a mile wide. They do an extremely effective job of fighting fires. 
   General Blum ordered those aircraft deployed to California before he had the order to deploy them. Before he had the request, he said, I am going to send them out as a training mission, and by the time they get there, the paperwork will catch up with them. 
   So I think we all owe him a debt, and all those wonderful crews that came in from Wyoming, North Carolina and Colorado, as well as all the other crews in various other dimensions of the firefighting who arrived from out of State.  
   So, Mr. Speaker, this was a wonderful team effort, I think perhaps a model for the country. We have a few rough edges to work on for the next one, a few reforms to make, and we are going to do that. But we had a wonderful, wonderful taking up of this enormous challenge. Our challenge now is to rebuild; and, similarly, we will all work together as a team to do that. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. HUNTER. To my great friend, I don't deserve this honor that he has recommended here of naming the bill. I'm just an ordinary American, but I get to serve with lots of extraordinary Americans, and the gentleman from Missouri is one of those extraordinary Americans. He talked about the jointness that he's trying to bring over from his great work on the Goldwater-Nichols bill, of bringing our services together to act jointly, and extend that to the other agencies which are so crucial in this operation in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to bring them in also in a way that they act as a member of the team led, most of the time, by the Department of Defense, but nonetheless, one that requires cohesion and jointness and a culture of working together as a team. 
   I want to commend the gentleman for the fact that he has been the corporate historian, if you will, for the House of Representatives and for the Armed Services Committee, who often brings us back in debate or in hearings to events that transpired in conflicts 100 years ago sometimes, or World War II or Korea or Vietnam, and reminds us that we shouldn't have to learn the lesson a second time. So I want to give my great thanks to this great American, Ike Skelton, and to all of the members of the great Armed Services Committee and the chairmen and ranking members of the subcommittees who put together such a great bill. A couple of them are sitting here next to me. I know Jim Saxton is leaving. He was the first chairman of the Special Operations Subcommittee, the Terrorism Subcommittee, and traveled the world and the country and every base where we had SOCOM people stationed, talking to the teams, talking, whether they were Green Berets or Rangers or SEALs or other operators, trying to understand what they needed from Congress in order to be effective. He worked to get them that equipment, and now, as the ranking member of Air, Land, he continues that mission. 
   And, of course, Terry Everett, that guy who doesn't make long speeches but spends a lot of time in classified sessions working and understanding on the issues surrounding space, and how those issues relate to national security. Probably nobody else in the country knows as much as he does on those issues. 
   And, of course, we've got a couple of members, as the chairman said, moving on to other offices, Rob Andrews and Mark Udall, and we wish them the very best. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is an excellent defense bill, and I concur with the gentleman from Missouri that we should have a unanimous vote in the House of Representatives, just as we had under his leadership in the Armed Services Committee. 
   It does a couple of things that are important for us. It works toward the warfighting theaters, which are very important, Iraq, Afghanistan and other places in the world where the global war on terror is taking place. But, at the same time, and in those, in that category, we put in extra money for MRAPs for these armored vehicles, for protection for our troops, for jammers, for all the things, for new surveillance capability, new anti-mortar capability, all the things that would go to force protection, and also make our troops more effective in those theaters. 
   But beyond that, we pay a lot of attention and put a great deal of focus on modernizing the military and looking over the horizon to challenges that may go far beyond the current theaters. 
   We continue to fund the F-22, which the reports now coming back from the operators are to the effect that the F-22 is doing extremely well, a high performance fighter aircraft with lots of capability, lots of legs, lots of firepower, but especially lots of sensor capability, which we're finding to be extremely valuable. 
   The V-22, which is this platform that the Marines wanted for years because it goes roughly twice as fast as the CH-46s that it's replacing, are working extremely well in theater. The Marines are getting from point A to point B in half the time. They're able to carry out their mission more efficiently and effectively. They like that particular platform. And across the board, we are replacing and modernizing our military equipment. 
   Now there are some things that we need to do in this bill, and I would hope we could do on the floor. We did cut some $300 million out of missile defense. Mr. Chairman, we live in an era of missiles. This is an era in which we will see, in the coming years, the Iranians continuing to improve on the Shahab missile classes, which already can reach parts of Europe, at some point will be able to reach all of Europe, and will be followed by missile classes that, at some point, will be able to reach the United States. 
   We also have seen North Korea throw a pod of missiles into the North China Sea, and the Sea of Japan; some of which have capability, if they put more sections on those missiles, ultimately, to reach American allies and the United States itself. So we're entering the middle of what I would call the era of missiles. And having defense against missiles is a key part of the American defense system. 
   We've had these wonderful successes where we've shot down missiles that are traveling, where the interceptor and the missile it shoots down 148 miles above the surface of the Earth are traveling roughly three times the speed of a 30-06 bullet, and we've had collisions in mid flight. We saw a great demonstration when we took down the rogue satellite that had to be destroyed to avoid possible collateral damage. We took that down with a sea-based missile system that worked very well. 
   We clearly are moving along in the right direction in trying to put up defenses as the offensive systems become more sophisticated. But I think we need to continue to move down that path. 
   We did cut money out of the European-based missile systems and other systems, and I would hope that we could restore some of the missile defense money in this particular bill. I know Mr. Franks will be offering that. 
   Similarly, the FCS program, I think, is an area we need to restore dollars. Mr. Chairman, we have a number of en bloc amendments and amendments that will be offered by members that I think will, in fact, make this bill even a little bit better than it is. 
   I want to finish by thanking the chairman for putting together a great bill in the Armed Services Committee, for moving it down the road very quickly, and getting it to the House floor. 
   This is the bill that provides our troops with the tools that they need to get the job done. And that's why it's important, that's why this committee acts in such a bipartisan fashion, and we follow the bipartisan model of the gentleman from Missouri, Ike Skelton. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

He's a guy that's pretty easy to elbow out of the way at a press conference because he usually isn't there. But he has served countless hours in the service of this country, understanding some pretty complex things about space and national security, and he is the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Terry Everett, and the country needs more people like this gentleman.

But I am reminded that the chairman has been the guardian of professional military education and his work has been to try to make sure that our officers have a context in which they can place the activities in this very real war that many of them are engaged in in our history and to see situations that have gone before and to gain insights from that history, and I want to applaud the chairman for that.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, we have, I believe, no more speakers left, so at this time let me just say that our ranking members and our chairmen have covered the waterfront of what this bill does. They've taken it from personnel, the pay raise that the chairman started off talking about, the 3.9 percent pay raise, the end strength increases in the Army and Marine Corps, the quality of life increases that we've delivered to our people in uniform, to the equipment side, to the force protection that we are sending additional to Afghanistan and to Iraq, MRAPs, extra armor capability, extra technical capability to be able to defend our forces and help them accomplish the mission, to the modernization side, the platforms that we are building with the modernization part of this budget, to the readiness part of this budget, which is so critical to ongoing operations, and to some of the technical aspects of the budget that I think the Strategic Subcommittee spoke to so effectively, including the programs that involve space, involve missile defense. And so, Mr. Chairman, I think we've described the bill fairly effectively. 
   And I think also we've described the people. At least I want to make sure we understand how wonderful the people are who put this bill together, not only the ranking members and the chairmen of the subcommittee and our great chairman of the full committee, Ike Skelton, the man from Missouri, but also the wonderful staff that we have that's worked long hours to put together what is a very large bill, in many cases, very technical, and yet they did it with great precision, and we owe them a debt of gratitude. 
   Let me just say in my closing seconds here, Mr. Chairman, that I talked about the horizon that I think we face in terms of military challenges. I think that part of that horizon must require a focus on China. The fact that China is now outbuilding the U.S. in submarines by more than 3-1, with their acquisitions from the Russians, it's much more. They're acquiring great technical capability, and they are building an industrial base that, in many areas, such as building warships, could outstrip the United States very quickly in production. 
   And just as our great chairman mentioned, that it takes more than just a military to win wars and to carry out foreign policy, it's going to take some changes in policy to maintain the United States as a premier military force in the world. Some of those changes are going to require changes in our tax law, in our tariff law that will allow our industrial base to stay in the United States, that will stop these companies that are key to national security who are being advised right now by their financial advisors to move their production offshore, changes in our law that will cause them to stay in the United States, because the environment, the business environment in the United States and the tax environment will be such that they will not be induced to move offshore. 
   Also, with respect to the hemorrhage of technical information which is going on with the acquisition of American companies on a very selected basis by companies and by nations that are targeting American military technology. This committee has moved toward stopping that hemorrhage by adopting several important provisions with respect to security, site security at companies that do classified information. But there's much more work to be done there, and I know that the committee is moving in that direction and undertaking a great strides in that direction. But that's a direction that's going to require the participation of the entire body, Mr. Chairman, in fact, the entire government. So we have a big challenge ahead of us. 
   Again, I want to thank the chairman for putting together a bill that passed unanimously out of the Armed Services Committee, and should pass unanimously off the House floor. So once again, a job well done to the gentleman from Missouri. 
   I would yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Missouri is advised that he has 1 minute remaining.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman. And I do want to say there is a gentleman here who's got more knowledge than I have on this defense bill, and he just spoke. I want to give my thanks to Chairman Skelton for doing a great job of putting together an excellent bill which passed unanimously out of the Armed Services Committee. 
   He followed very strongly what I call the two tracks that we're on. The first track is to provide for the warfighters in the theaters that are currently in progress in Afghanistan and Iraq and around the world, where we're fighting the global war against terror. We do so very well in this bill in terms of putting in lots of extra money for MRAPs, for force protection, for defense against mortars, against roadside bombs, and all the other things that are important aspects and dimensions of force protection. 
   Then we also provide for what I call over the horizon. That means that we've provided, with the very able chairmen of the subcommittees and the ranking members, for continued equipment buys in critical areas and put in extra money for submarines, which we will have low numbers in the next 5 to 10 years, but are a very important part of American leverage in foreign policy and a very important component of warfighting. Putting in extra money for C-17s, for that airlift that is so critical, for giving a good solid buy on F-22s this year and Joint Strike Fighter. 
   Also the report that I've received back from the Marines is that the first V-22s are now in theater in Iraq and that they're working very well. The Marines like that doubling of speeds that they now have over the CH-46 helicopters. That's accruing to their benefit in lots and lots of operations. 
   The chairman and the chairmen of the subcommittees and the ranking members I think have done a great job of filling out both tracks of both the near term and the long term in this bill. 
   I thank Mr. Skelton for his kind words. Let me tell you, one of the real blessings in serving in this body is to be able to serve with a great partner, whether you're the chairman or the ranking member. The chairman has done a wonderful job in putting this bill together. The man from Missouri is an outstanding leader in national security, and I applaud him for his great career. 
   I know we also have two members retiring, Mr. Saxton, who for many years chaired the Special Operations Subcommittee, very important subcommittee, is now ranking on Air Land. And Mr. Everett, who is ranking on Strategic. JIM SAXTON, I have watched him go around the world visiting with our special operators, ensuring that they had what they needed.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his great service on the Armed Services Committee. You can trade up anytime you want to and come back off that old Rules Committee and come back to Armed Services. 
   But Mr. Saxton has done yeomen's work in providing for special operations, for operations that aren't given ticker-tape parades in which a number of people know about and are briefed on, but which are crucial to our Nation's security. Those men and women who serve in those very important positions in special operations can be thankful they had JIM SAXTON over these years to be supportive of them. And he is still supportive of them in his job as ranking member to Mr. Abercrombie on Air Land. 
   Similarly, Mr. Everett has an insight and understanding of matters relating to space and missile defense that I think are matched by very few people in this country. And TERRY EVERETT is the master of the closed briefing. He makes very few speeches. TERRY EVERETT is not a guy you look to for long speeches, he's a guy you look to for hard work, for thoughtful analysis, and for doing the right thing when it comes to making sure that as we move into the next 5 to 10 years, we have what it takes in missile defense and in space to ensure America's security. 
   I want to applaud those retiring members of the committee and once again thank my chairman and all the members of the Armed Services Committee who make this such a great bipartisan committee. 
   I think we need to support this rule and move this great package down the road.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, today it became apparent that the employees of the State Department of the United States, or at least a large number of them, are resisting being assigned to Baghdad. They say it's too dangerous, and they have asked for a town hall meeting to explain their recalcitrance. 
   You know, when we go to Walter Reed and we go to Bethesda Hospital and we meet with our wounded warriors, our marines, our Army personnel, our naval personnel, our Air Force personnel, most of them say this to us: They say that they would like to return to fight side by side with their buddies, with their companions, in those warfighting theaters in Iraq and Afghanistan. They want to serve this Nation. 
   So I have recommended to the President today that we do this: That we fire those recalcitrant State Department personnel who say it's too dangerous for them to go back to Baghdad; they want another assignment. Let's let them leave the service, and let's go down to Walter Reed and Bethesda Hospital and let's recruit that wonderful team of American warriors who have been wounded in the service of their country and who have patriotism and devotion to duty and have a high enthusiasm for public service, and let's hire them into a bright new career in a new State Department.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in great reluctance to support final passage of the FY2008 Omnibus Appropriations Act. I am voting in favor of this legislation because it rightfully supplies our men and women on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq with the resources they need to continue their mission, while also supporting the Global War on Terror. These brave men and women deserve our support and I will never waiver from this responsibility. 
   However, despite my vote in favor of this legislation, I remain adamantly opposed to the underlying Omnibus legislation that effectively guts the Secure Fence Act passed during the 109th Congress. Securing the border of the United States is one of the most important responsibilities of the federal government. The Republican-led Congress last year did the right thing by passing the Secure Fence Act that mandated the construction of 854-mile double layered border fence along our Southwest border. Unfortunately, one of the few acts actually accomplished by this first session of the 110th Congress will be to remove that mandate and ensure that our southern border remains one of our weakest links in the effort to secure our homeland. Frankly, this is unacceptable. 
   I will be working with my colleagues during the second session of this Congress to address this travesty, however, I will not hold back the needed resources from our brave men and women in uniform because of this irresponsible move by this Congress. Therefore, I reluctantly support this Omnibus package.

   Let me just say that I have examined and analyzed a number of battlefield situations and that this bill does not take care of a problem that we have with respect to accessing communications in time to take action in a meaningful way. Whether the insurgents are making a strike, moving people, moving equipment, moving hostages, those first few hours are what you might analogize as the golden hours, the time when you can make a difference. And right now we have a substantial delay on the battlefield that could have been fixed with this bill. It is not fixed with this bill, and I am deeply disappointed because of that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I'm ready to give him more time with that wonderful introduction, one that I don't deserve. But I thank the gentleman. 
   I asked Mr. King to let me take a little time from his time tonight to talk about a couple of wonderful individuals. The first person I would like to mention is, of course, a lady who has been a wonderful representative from my office for many years in Imperial County, which was a big part of my congressional district for many years, and that's Carole Starr. And Carole Starr, when I got my congressional district moved out to Imperial County from San Diego County and went literally all the way from the Pacific Ocean to the Colorado River to Arizona, taking in the entire Mexican-California border, I found that I had a brand new constituency. It's a lot like the gentleman's from Iowa. 
   I had a large farming constituency, a community in Imperial County with people of great character and people with lots of issues that were vastly different than the issues of folks who live in San Diego, but also people with a wonderful sense of patriotism. In that big valley, Imperial Valley, we had the Naval Air Facility where the Blue Angels train in the wintertime, and where we now have one of the best training grounds of any location in the United States. We're adjacent to the big Chocolate Mountain Gunnery Range, and an airplane or a group coming from any part of the United States to train can get up there and train 365 days a year in that good desert air. 
   We also have that wonderful farming constituency, probably the most productive land in the world, acre-for-acre, under irrigation from the Colorado River. It's a place where we have lots of people with great character. And communities like Brawley and El Centro and Calexico and Imperial and lots of other wonderful communities in Imperial County. 
   Running that entire county for our office was a wonderful lady named Carole Starr. I lost the Valley a few years ago, Imperial Valley, in redistricting, but Carole Starr was such a fantastic person, and today is quite ill, she's under the weather right now and is home resting in Imperial County with a very difficult ailment. But I just thought it would be important to take the floor and talk about Carole for a minute because she was such a big part of our operation in Imperial County and such a wonderful leader in that county.     
   You know, I had a pretty full office in San Diego County and usually seven or eight folks there in the office. Carole Starr ran the Imperial County office all by herself, and whether you were a person of means in Imperial County, or if you just hitchhiked in and just came in off of the freeway off-ramp, you could walk into our congressional office in Imperial Valley Airport in Imperial and knock on that door, and Carole Starr would greet with you with a smile and say, ``How can I be of service to you?'' 
   And Carole weathered all these very difficult issues that we had, from the carnal bunt disease that took down our green crop one year, to the myriad problems with the Colorado River, the desalinization plant there at Yuma, the ongoing water struggles that always engulfed California politics, and of course, all of the day-to-day work that you find in any congressional office where you have folks that need to get that Social Security check or make sure that they get that particular veterans' service or have some help with the IRS.  
   Anybody could walk in Carole Starr's door, and they would be greeted with great professionalism, a warm smile, and a ``How can I help you'' attitude, and I always called Carole Starr the ``Star of the Valley.'' 
   And you know, over the years, Mr. Speaker, when I would visit Imperial Valley with my family, and especially my two boys, Duncan and Sam, Sam started out when we got Imperial County. Really, he had just been born. He was a brand new baby, and over the years, he grew, and one of the things that we did many times when we were in Imperial Valley was we would always match up Carole, who stood about five three, with Sam. And Carole always wanted to see how fast he was growing and try to estimate when he would surpass her height. 
   I know one time, back when DICK CHENEY came to Imperial County to work with me on some of the desert issues, and Carole Starr would always do a back-to-back with my son Sam to see how much he had grown over the last month or so. And on that occasion--and that was about, oh, I don't know, about 1992 or 1994--in fact, my son Sam Hunter at that point surpassed Carole Starr in height, and of course, he's been growing ever since. He's now about six two. 
   But Carole Starr was just a warm, wonderful person who had a trademark of directness and honesty and good will. And today, she lies quite stricken by a very severe ailment, and I just hope that God will hold her in the palm of his hand and take care of her and give comfort to her family because Carole Starr represented the very best of our outreach to our community. 
   And I know every Member of this body has several dimensions to their service. One dimension is what we do here on the House floor and what we do with respect to legislation and bills and the administration, whether it's Democrat or Republican. But the other dimension is how we relate to our constituents in our district, and just like the gentleman from Iowa, we all have about 700,000 folks in our district. And some of them have real pressing problems, and in some cases, we are the last resort for those constituents who have been to Federal agencies and have been turned down or stiff-armed or have no other options, and they come to us. 
   And sometimes we're able to help them, but we're only able to help them when we have great, wonderful people serving us in our district offices, and Carole Starr, who ran the entire Imperial County--and I called her the ``Star of the Desert'' because she truly was one of those people with a great, great heart and great professionalism. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'd also like to mention a couple of other individuals who are very important to me, and I know we've got lots of people retiring this year. We've got a lot of folks that have served here for many years. I just want to mention a couple of people, JIMMY SAXTON and TERRY EVERETt, two great personal friends and two great servants of this country on the House Armed Services Committee are, in fact, retiring. 
   You know, JIMMY SAXTON came in, I believe it was in 1982 when he came into office, and I remember he replaced Ed Forsythe. In fact, when he went in to get the obligatory picture taken with then-President Ronald Reagan when he was a candidate for Congress, Ed Forsythe had passed away. And he was that well-known Congressman who had a butch haircut, and he wore a bow tie and was quite well-known on Capitol Hill. 
   And when JIMMY SAXTON walked up to Ronald Reagan and said I'm running for Ed Forsythe's seat, Ronald Reagan, not having read the Washington Post all that much, said ``Go get him,'' and of course, JIMMY SAXTON said, ``I can't do that, he's a decedent, and I'm running for the open seat.'' 
   But JIMMY SAXTON started a career in which he represented his Third District in New Jersey so ably, and he worked on environmental matters. He worked on local issues, and he protected those important military bases and gave them their best shot at surviving base closure, which he did very effectively, I might add, and he helped to bring the New Jersey back to New Jersey, that great battleship. 
   But I think JIMMY'S most important work was done in the Armed Services Committee, in that committee and on the House floor. He chaired that very important Subcommittee on Terrorism. He traveled around the world. Every time you found two Green Berets or Navy SEALs or Army Rangers, JIMMY SAXTON was there talking to them, learning what they needed, learning about operations, and then making a difference when we marked up the Defense bill. 
   And JIMMY SAXTON will be sorely missed. He's now the ranking member on the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee that makes important decisions. To Chairman Abercrombie, he's the ranking member, and he of course is still the JIMMY SAXTON of great diligence who puts in lots of hours, working these important issues. 
   And I'm going to miss JIMMY SAXTON. He's one of those great public servants who gives so much more to this country than he gets, and he likes it that way. 
   And he's got a little bit of a back ailment right now. I think that's because he was probably the only guy in the history of New Jersey athletics who was about a 5-foot-9 shot-putter, held the State shot put record as a high schooler, weighing a whopping 160 pounds. And maybe JIMMY SAXTON started out at six two or six three, but right now he's got a little bit of an ailing back because of that great prowess that he had with the shot put.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from California for giving me some time. 
   You know, in Iraq it is tough, it is difficult, it is dusty and it is dangerous; but we are following the same pattern that we followed for the last 60 years in bringing freedom to other parts of the world. It is not a smooth road. 
   First, you stand up a free government. We have done that. It is an inept  government. It bumbles along, as most new governments do. But it is a free government, and it represents the people. 
   The second thing that you do is stand up a military capable of protecting that free government. 
   Thirdly, the Americans leave, because we don't covet anything that another country has. 
   We are right now in the second phase of standing up a military capable of protecting this government. My good friend who just spoke talked about the difficulty of standing up the Iraqi military. I know a couple of years ago in the first battle of Fallujah when we rushed green Iraqi troops to that battle and we thought they were going to help the United States Marines, the next day they were gone. They didn't show up for roll call. But this time when you go out there and you are in Fallujah and Ramadi, the Iraqi military is standing and fighting. 
   We sat there about a month ago with the Sunni leaders of the national police in Ramadi and Fallujah, and they sat there side-by-side with the Shiite leaders of the Iraqi Army and talked about how they are working together, this time to push back against al Qaeda, whose rough edge has made enemies in the Anbar province. 
   Now, we got 129 battalions in the Iraqi Army, and, personally, I think that the standup of the Iraqi Army and the reliability of the Iraqi Army is the key to America's success in Iraq and our successful turnover of the security burden. 
   We have got to make sure that every one of those 129 Iraqi battalions moves into an operation where they do two or three months in a military operation where they have to work out, exercise their logistic chain, their chain of command, the commander has got to coordinate with the guy on the right and the guy on the left. At that time they can rotate into the battlefield and displace American heavy combat forces. That is the right way to leave Iraq. Not this way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I want to thank my friend, Mr. Lewis, for giving me a chance to talk about this supplemental bill, this very bad bill, once again. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have carefully reviewed the language on page 72 of this bill with our counsel as to the exact legal effect of this bill. This bill says that an American unit cannot be introduced into Iraq until a 15-day waiting period has expired. Now, what does that mean? That means if you have hostages being held in a place in Iraq and you want to move a Delta force team across the line, you can't do that for 15 days under the law, should this become law. It says if you have a fleeting target, like the Zarqawi strike that we made a couple of months ago, and time is of the essence and you want to take an F-16 out of Incirlik, Turkey and make a strike, you can't do it without waiting for 15 days after notifying the House Armed Services Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and presumably the Appropriations Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we have an extreme situation in Iraq where Americans have to be rescued or reinforced, I don't want them to come back and notify me  or notify the committee. I want them to do what they have to do and carry out their mission. 
   This is a very defective bill, and this 15-day waiting requirement in this war against terror where time is of the essence, where American military teams move across country boundaries every day without certifying anything to anybody, this is a real disservice to the forces that work not only in Iraq, but should this be applied to other parts of the world in a future time would be a real disservice to everybody who fights in the war against terror.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I can't match the eloquent statements about TOM that have been made by my colleagues; but I thought I might share just a few thoughts that came to my mind, not only today, but every day that I saw TOM LANTOS.  
   First, he was a guy of extreme competence. And if you wanted to get to the heart of a matter quickly, and you wanted to probe a situation in foreign affairs quickly, or a matter of national policy, and you had a national leader, international leader in front of you, and TOM LANTOS was asking questions, he did a great cross-examination. And he brought the facts out very quickly. But, you know, lots of people can do that. 
   There were some special qualities that TOM LANTOS had that reflected and illuminated his life and always impressed me every time I saw him. One was his great dignity. He walked in dignity. And it wasn't a pride; it wasn't an egotistical thing. It was a respect for his fellow man that emanated from him and seemed to illuminate the room when he walked in, and when he took his place, and when he asked questions, and when he worked on these important issues of the day.  
   He was a man of great principle. And, Madam Speaker, I think that it must surprise many folks who watch this, watch the leadership in this Nation, and look at this Capitol, look at this body, in this city, where so much talent is focused on powerful national interests, that we have leaders like TOM LANTOS, perhaps the finest leaders, the ones with the greatest talents, who focus those talents not on powerful interests or the protection of those interests, but, in fact, on the interests of those who have no station, who have no money, and in many cases have no hope. 
   And I think that's a great trademark of this Nation and certain special leaders, like TOM LANTOS, that gives us, gives this country respect from those around the world, not just people who live in places of power or who occupy places of power in foreign governments, but all those around the world who look at this American forum here, this forum of leadership and governance in Washington, DC, and who saw people like TOM LANTOS, perhaps tough to figure out in many ways, but when it got right down to it, they understood that in this country, the dignity, the value of human beings is still very central to this wonderful country that we call America. 
   So it's with a lot of sadness that I see TOM LANTOS, a guy who came in the same year I came in, in 1980, along with Mr. Dreier, leave us. And I just hope that we all look at that model now and again when we have tough and difficult times, because the last great quality that TOM LANTOS had was conciliation. And you could have fierce fights on issues, and yet he had that wonderful quality of being able to reconcile with his adversaries and find common ground in the next great issue that was before you.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I want to thank my colleague for yielding me some time and for the good work that she has done on this bill, as well as my good friend from New York. 
   Unfortunately, I oppose this bill for this reason: We passed out what I think was a pretty good bill out of the House. That bill had in it several critical national security elements. One of those elements was that any member of this committee, of the CFIUS committee, including, for example, the Secretary of Defense, or a leader in another agency, could, by a single vote, trigger an investigation if they thought there was a national security problem. 
   Remember, this bill grew out of the Dubai Ports problem. When we were faced with this takeover of our port operations in a number of key ports by a foreign-owned company, we realized that that company could access information about vulnerable aspects of those particular ports that could, at some point, be utilized in a terrorist activity. 
   So we understood, and that was a good illustration of how critical this CFIUS process is, especially with this array of foreign investments taking place in this country. So we understood that we needed to reform CFIUS. In those days, during the Dubai Ports problem, before that, you had an arrangement that was largely put together by Presidential directive, and the President, by his directive, gave any member of the CFIUS committee, including SecDef, the ability to raise their hand and basically say, I want an investigation. 
   Now, we ensured that, as we put this thing together in statute, that we maintained that right. I am turning to the House-passed provision that we passed, that I supported. It talked about an investigation being triggered by a roll call vote, and I am quoting, a roll call vote pursuant to paragraph 3(a) in connection with a review under paragraph 1 of any covered transaction results in at least one vote by a committee member against approving the transaction, meaning that the Secretary of Defense could get up and say, I think there is a problem here, and he could trigger that transaction. 
   Unfortunately, the product that came back from the Senate didn't have that provision. It had this provision; it said that an investigation would be triggered if ``the lead agency recommends and the committee concurs that an investigation be undertaken.'' They have clearly watered down the ability of one person, for example, the Secretary of Defense, to say, to trigger an investigation upon his demand. 
   I think that's a fatal flaw, because that takes us back to a weaker position than what we have had under the current practice, which involves an investigation being undertaken if a single member of the committee objects under the present Presidential directive. We are actually going back to a lower standard for triggering an investigation than we had before the Dubai ports problem. 
   So I think, unfortunately, we have taken a product from the Senate which is fatally flawed in that respect. I would strongly support this provision coming back, this exact same law, coming back with that fix. But I don't know any way we can fix it, or even with a colloquy or in any other way, assign a new congressional intent that will clearly reflect that the words that have been changed aren't, in fact, controlling at this point, but that there is a congressional intent that controls. 
   Unfortunately, I have to object to the passage of this bill, and I will not support the passage of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (THANKING AMERICANS IN UNIFORM WHO SERVED IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to do something that I think has been a long time coming. On March 19 of 2003, the United States made the initial strikes in Iraq with two F-117 aircraft carrying 2,000-pound bombs that initiated the action in which Americans took Iraq, overthrew the dictator, Saddam Hussein, ultimately established a free government, and built from scratch a security apparatus and a military in Iraq capable of protecting that free government. And today, Mr. Speaker, I thought it would be appropriate for this Congress to thank the more than 1 million Americans in uniform who have served in Iraq, in the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Coast Guard and in our intelligence services and our security services, to thank those more than 1 million Americans, men and women, for doing something that Americans often applaud; that's winning. We have won in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was March 19 when we initiated that operation with those first Tomahawk missiles that were launched on leadership positions in Baghdad, and those first two F-117 stealth aircraft that moved out and dropped 2,000-pound bombs on important sites. And after that, just 48 hours later, on March 20, 2003, two prongs of coalition forces moved across the berm in Kuwait, after American intelligence agents and American Special Operation Forces had laid the groundwork, and they moved out and they started to move toward Baghdad. 
   Mr. Speaker, the launch of the operations and the ground forces and, incidentally, those ground forces were led by Army Lieutenant General David McKiernan. He was the commanding general of the Combined Forces Land Component Command. They crossed the line of departure from the Kuwaiti desert into Southern Iraq, and they had to go about 600 kilometers to get to Baghdad. We covered that distance in record time. And I don't know how many people in Congress or in the American populace remember it, but you had many commentators, many armchair commentators stating that the United States forces would be bogged down, that Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld had not sent enough forces, and that we would see this operation grind to a halt and we would take heavy casualties. They were wrong, and Tommy Franks' forces, in fact, you would have talk shows in which the commentator or the guest would be talking about American forces bogging down, and his statement would be interrupted by a news flash that Tommy Franks' forces had taken yet another one of Saddam Hussein's strongholds. 
   So we drove on to Baghdad. And on March 21, in fact, Iraq's 51st Army Division, which was estimated to be about 8,000 personnel, surrendered and deserted at Iraq's southern border. 
   The main ground effort was led by U.S. Army Fifth Corps under Lieutenant General William Wallace. Fifth Corps moved along a western route up to Baghdad, and the First Marine Expeditionary Force, 1MEF, under General James Conway, now the Commandant of the Marine Corps, moved along the more urban route closer to the border with Iran, on the east side. They took the far southern port of Umm Kasar. The main Marine force encountered some resistance as they pushed north, in particular, An Nasariya. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can remember talking with a young Marine who had some injuries and was at Bethesda hospital shortly after that operation, and he talked about how much he loved those Marine tanks when he was pinned down by fire coming from several buildings at An Nasariya, and these big Marine tanks came whipping in, laid some heavy fire on the Feyadeen who were laying down these torrents of RPG fire; that's rocket propelled grenades. And they rushed out, that is the Feyadeen did, after being hit with several tank volleys, and surrendered to the Marines at that choke point. 
   In the west, the Army faced a longer distance but a less populated terrain. And Fifth Corps began combat operations with two divisions under its command, the Third ID under Major General Blunt, and the 101st Airborne Division, the 101st under Major General David Petraeus. 
   The Third ID led the western charge to Baghdad. They moved speedily through the south. They reached Saddam International Airport on April 4 of 2003. At that point the division launched the first of what it called ``thunder runs.'' And a ``thunder run'' was a fast armored strike going right into the heart of Baghdad. And according to the Brigade Commander in Charge, General David Perkins, the Americans wanted to ``create as much confusion as they could inside the city.'' And the second purpose was to make sure that no one in that city, whether it was a member of the Iraqi population or an Iraqi leader, had any doubt that the city had fallen and the Americans were in charge. 
   The 101st followed the Third ID up the western route into Southern Iraq,  clearing resistance in southern cities, and that allowed the Third ID to move up very quickly. Soldiers from the 101st faced intense fighting in Hillah, Najaf and Karbala. And just after mid-April a division arrived and set up its headquarters in Mosul in northern Iraq. 
   In the north, on March 26, 2003, the 173rd Airborne jumped into Iraq. They had to parachute into Northern Iraq because the Turkish government decided not to allow the Fourth Infantry Division to move across Turkey into that anchor position in the north. So the 173rd, deploying out of Italy, flying in C-17s, jumped at about 1:30 in the morning; came into some hip-deep mud, but they anchored Northern Iraq, and they linked up with the peshmerga and Kurdish fighters who were moving then into the Kirkuk area and moved down and secured and anchored that northern portion of Iraq. 
   The UK First Armored Division, our great friends in the coalition, the United Kingdom, the Brits, were operating under the Marine force, took the important port city of Basra by April 6 of 2003. 
   On April 9, 2003, just some 21 days after we had gone over the line from Kuwait into Iraq, the statue of Saddam Hussein fell in Baghdad. This was just 21 days after we initiated that operation. 
   Mr. Speaker, we had, at that point, taken less than 150 KIA, precious American lives, but we had destroyed more than 20 enemy divisions in an unprecedented move through the center of Iraq. 
   And for that, Mr. Speaker, I know that over the last year or so the pundits have been filling their pages, and some politicians have been filling their quote lines with critical statements about Don Rumsfeld. But Don Rumsfeld's operation, in ignoring the critics who wanted him to build slowly and to bring in more divisions before he moved on Baghdad, was absolutely right, and the critics who said he would bog down were absolutely wrong because he moved with precision, like a hot knife through butter, straight into Baghdad and took down the Iraqi divisions before they could really establish a strong position against the Americans. 
   And I might add that General Myers, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs at that time, was an able assistant in helping to carry out Secretary Rumsfeld's policy. 
   The First Armored Division also began arriving in Iraq in April 2003.     
   Saddam Hussein was captured outside his hometown of Tikrit by 4ID units on December 13, 2003. 
   In April 2004, the young Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and his militia, which we refer to as the Mahdi Army staged uprisings in cities and towns throughout the Shiia populated southern Iraq, just as a volatile Sunni populated City of Fallujah in Anbar province simmered in the wake of the murders of four Blackwater contractors. 
   For all the great men and women of the United States Marines, the chapter entitled ``Fallujah'' will forever be a part of the history of the U.S. Marines, which testifies to their tenacity, to their greatness on the field of battle, to their compassion for their fellow marines, to their ability to handle tough, difficult situations, for their tenacity, and for their courage. 
   Now, we went into Fallujah right after the four contractors were hung from the bridge and burned. After we were partway through the city, because of political considerations, which was a real mistake on the part of the American governance and Iraq, the marines were pulled back out of the city even though they'd taken KIA. At that point, they were moving swiftly through that city and were taking out the terrorists. 
   Well, after that, Fallujah became a hotbed for terrorists and a base for operations throughout al Anbar province. So, in November, the marines went back again, and they went into a determined enemy who was waiting for them, who was set in place, but it's a credit to the great men and women who wear the uniform of the United States Marine Corps, from where the sun now stands to the end of our history. The chapter of ``Fallujah'' is a testament to their capability and to their courage. 
   I want every single marine in the United States and every family of a marine and every neighbor and every friend of a marine and every citizen who loves that globe and anchor to be proud of what they did in Fallujah. 
   In Fallujah, they went into a determined enemy. The operation included some 540 air strikes, 14,000 artillery and mortar shells fired, 2,500 tank main gun rounds fired, and at the end of that operation, over 70 marines had been KIA--that is killed in action--and over 609 had been wounded. Incidentally, army units participated in that, and a few other coalition units participated in that, but of the 39,000 buildings in Fallujah, 18,000 had been damaged or had been taken down by the force and fury of this marine operation. Now, at the same time, military operations in the town of Tal Afar in 2005 marked an early, multifaceted and successful application of what we call counterinsurgency approaches. 
   In Washington, Tal Afar gave birth to a new Iraq policy lexicon in Iraq, though not immediately to the expanded use of counterinsurgency practices. Tal Afar is located in Ninewah Province, along the route from the provincial capital of Mosul to Syria. Its population is about 290,000. It includes Sunni Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen, and Yezidis. 
   From April 2003 until early 2004, the 101st Airborne Division had responsibility for Ninewah and for Iraq's three northern, largely Kurdish populated provinces. Because the north was relatively quiet, due in part to the effectiveness of the pesh merga, the 101st was able to concentrate primarily on Ninewah, a relatively high troops-to-population ratio. 
   In early 2005 when the 101st redeployed, the responsibility for the area passed to a much smaller striker brigade. That brigade, in turn, was periodically asked to provide forces for operations elsewhere in Iraq. So the coalition force footprint in Ninewah was substantially reduced. Tal Afar was a convenient trade route location, and a mixed population perfect for fomenting sectarian strife became a base of operations for former regime elements and Sunni extremists, including suicide bombers. 
   In May 2005, the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, now commanded by Colonel H.R. McMaster, arrived in Tal Afar. Colonel McMaster was familiar with OIF issues from his previous service as director of General Abizaid's Commander's Action Group at CENTCOM. 
   In early 2005, the ACR began their deployment preparations at home in Fort Carson, Colorado, studying counterinsurgency approaches. Later in Iraq, Colonel McMaster described the regiment's mission in the classical counterinsurgency lexicon of population security. The whole purpose of the operation is to secure the population so that we can lift the enemy's campaign of intimidation and coercion over the population and allow economic and political development to proceed here and to return to normal life. 
   Now, for every single American who participated in the Iraq operation--and I don't care if you were stocking shelves in Kuwait or fixing strikers as a mechanic or working in Balad in logistics or making thunder runs in Baghdad early in the war or going house to house in Fallujah--you participated in a very important operation. 
   Let me tell you why it's very clear that we've won in Iraq. We've deposed Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein was the guy who sent Chemical Ali to put poisoned gas on the Kurdish population in northern Iraq. He is the first leader since Hitler who had put poisoned gas on his own people. If you ever have any questions about the morality of what we did in intervening in Iraq, push aside this argument about weapons of mass destruction and pick up the picture of Kurdish mothers holding their babies where they were killed in mid stride, laying on those hillsides in northern Iraq by the thousands, where that poisoned gas struck them and killed them immediately or go to the History Channel, and watch the mass excavations where you will see mothers with their children, where they were executed by Saddam Hussein's army and bulldozed into open trenches and where, if you will look closely, as the scientists and the excavators who have the stomach to do it did for these reviews and analyses, you will see bullet  holes in the backs of the heads of the mothers and, in many cases, bullet holes in the backs of their babies' heads where they, too, were executed before mother and baby were pushed with a bulldozer into open trenches. 
   That's the regime that you, every single American who wore the uniform of the United States, put out of business when you did your job in Iraq--you, the more than 1 million Americans who left your families, who in many cases did multiple tours, who were separated from your loved ones, who in many cases undertook some very, very difficult, very dangerous missions, who suffered some very hot weather and, in some cases, some very cold weather, who suffered lots of inconveniences but who did it for a purpose, which was a good and idealistic and moral purpose, and you won. Let me tell you how we know that you've won. 
   We now have an Iraqi Government which was elected by the people, and it's not a perfect government, and it has got lots of strife and lots of crosscurrents of politics and lots of people who resent other people on the other side of their aisle, but it's a government where people settle most of their problems with ballots, not bullets. It has got a modicum of democracy and representative government. Only the Americans, only the people who wear the uniform of the United States could have brought that to Iraq. 
   Throughout Iraq, there are schools and there are medical facilities that you built, that you Americans in uniform built. There are millions of babies who were inoculated because of the Americans, and there are hundreds of thousands of expectant mothers who were given prenatal care because of the Americans. There are people who have avoided disease because of the Americans, and there are people who have enough to eat now because of the Americans. 
   Now, it's true that they have a fragile infrastructure. They've always had a fragile infrastructure, and it's true that Iraq hasn't developed all of its natural resources. On the other hand, neither has Mexico and neither have lots of countries throughout the world, but on the backs of the American men and women who wear the uniform of our country, they had free elections, and they now have a government, and that government is holding. The voices in Congress and the voices of the pundits who talked about an all-out civil war don't talk about that anymore, and they never say they were wrong or sorry. They just move on to a different subject. There is no civil war, and we now have a government which is settling in and a people who are settling into the idea of having fierce fights but of having those fights with words and by settling things with ballots and not bullets. 
   Now, one thing that we did that has to be credited very strongly to President Bush--and for all of those who don't like President Bush, he has one characteristic which Winston Churchill admired above all others, persistence, because at a time when many people were saying you have to give up and leave Iraq, he said, ``I'm not going to give up.'' He joined with Mr. Maliki in sending in more American troops and more coalition troops and more Iraqi troops into Baghdad in what is known as a surge. 
   If you want to talk about the surge, very simply, the surge was this: Instead of Americans going in and clearing an area and coming back out and having the terrorists flow back into that area, the surge involved going in, clearing the area, sometimes with Iraqi forces in the lead, sometimes with Americans, but clearing that area and then holding the area, building the area, restoring the confidence of the population, securing the area, making the area a little bit more terrorist resistant and not giving up those games. 
   That's what this President did, and he should be commended for it. Of course, history, as we go down through the years--and as the Iraqi Government continues to hold and as it is a friend, not an enemy of the United States as it was before and as it has a modicum of democracy and as it will not be a state sponsor of terrorism as it had been in the past and as its neighbors are--will be appreciative of what those more than 1 million Americans did who wore the uniform. You won. You fulfilled this mission. We've got a government in place that's holding. We've got a military that's holding. It has got about 160 battalions, and we built that military from scratch. 
   Now, many of the pundits and many of the politicians said we should have taken Saddam Hussein's army and kept it in place. That wouldn't have worked. It wouldn't have worked because Saddam Hussein's army had 11,000 Sunni generals. That's a recipe for disaster. Especially in a country in which the Shiite population is in the majority, the idea that you're going to have an army with 11,000 Sunni generals--literally squads of generals, each one a futile lord in his own right with his own arms cache--and the idea that they would be honest brokers is ridiculous. That's why we had to build that army from scratch. 
   Now, we've got a few weaknesses in the army. We've had a few weaknesses in the Field Grade Officer Corps. This is an army that traditionally did not have a large noncommissioned officer segment, and we've had to build that segment from scratch, but we're being successful. 
   One of the marks of success was when Mr. Maliki, the President of Iraq, moved into Basra on his own initiative. Now, we were used to calling the shots in Iraq. Yet, in Basra, Mr. Maliki decided to move ahead on his own. He moved into Basra. He initially took quite a few casualties. We had situations in which we had Iraqi battalions which didn't show up for the fight the next day, some of the green battalions. In the end, with Americans backing them up and with this fledgling government working against the extremists in Basra, the coalition and the Iraqi forces prevailed. That is the mark of a government which is maturing, one which takes its own initiatives. 
   Now, Mr. Maliki had initially a force of some very small numbers of battalions that were ready. Then he got to the point where he had over 100 battalions and then 130, and he has got, roughly, 160 battalions right now.     
   Now, I recommended to the President and to our military leadership that the way you build a military is through military operations; that means saddling up your battalion, moving them into the fight, rotating them into the fight, exposing their weaknesses--whether it's logistics or your leadership levels or your ability to direct fire power--and fixing those problems. You build a strong military force through military operations. 
   And in fact, they did this in many cases, and they rotated their forces--when we did the surge in Baghdad, the Iraqi forces rotated battalions in and out of that particular area of operations where they made lots of contact with the enemy where they had to exercise their logistics chain, where they had to exercise their chain of command, where they had to be soldiers. And so the Iraqi Army has matured. 
   Now, it's nowhere near the capability of the American forces. Nobody in the world is near the capability of the American forces. It needs lots of enablers. 
   On the other hand, the Iraqi Army today can do what it has to do. It can go to an area in Iraq where the extremists, were al Qaeda are in control, maybe where extremist Shiite militias are in control, and it can push them out and it can fracture them, and it can defeat them on the battlefield. 
   They don't have to handle a column of armored divisions. All they have to do is be able to hold on to their own sovereignty in their own country, and the Iraqi military can do that. And they can protect their government, and they can now largely protect their infrastructure. That's important. 
   So for all of the Americans who participated in the Iraq operation, whether you were there when we first went over the line in March of 2003, whether you just got back, or whether you have friends that are there right now kind of wrapping up the operation--and that's what we're going to do over the next couple of years. We're going to mop up, and we're going to pack up, and we're going to leave. But we have taken out the tyrant Saddam Hussein. We have defeated al Qaeda. 
   In fact, when the leader of the Senate was saying that we had lost in Iraq--and he was absolutely wrong. You had senior Marines in Anbar province sending messages back saying, ``We are  crushing al Qaeda in al Anbar.'' So we won. You won. Everybody that wears the uniform of the United States, whether you carried a base plate for mortars, drove a truck in those difficult convoy runs, were a nurse in one of the many medical clinics and facilities we had, if you were a medic in some of the difficult battles, maybe you were a support troop, maybe you flew aircraft or a crew in aircraft, whether it was a C-130 or a tactical fighter, what you did was of enormous value to the United States of America. 
   You know, I'm reminded of great stories that have emanated from Iraq. I'm reminded of the battle of Fallujah when General John Kelley was the assistant division commander, and at the same time his son, Robert, was a private first class in a rifle squad fighting door-to-door at close range. And when it was over, Robert was the only one in his platoon who had not been wounded. 
   I'm reminded of Jason Fry, Captain Jason Fry who, going up through the Nassiriyah choke-point was hit by an RPG that took off his right arm; and when the medics were working on him and one of them asked, ``Are you right handed or left handed,'' he said, ``I'm left handed now. You tell my men I'm okay.'' That was the spirit of the American service personnel who served in Iraq. 
   And remember when they went into Iraq, we had intelligence to the effect that they would use poison gas against our troops because we'd seen them use poison gas against their own people killing thousands of them. And yet the American service personnel persevered and moved ahead into that storm of unknown quality. 
   And because of them, we have won in Iraq. Yes, we have won in Iraq. And don't let any left-wing journalist come up and tell you that we haven't won. It's true that there's no surrender on the Battleship Missouri. There's not going to be one in this war against terror. But if you look at the military missions that we have--and it's also true we haven't turned Iraq into Iowa. That was never the mission. And if somebody says the other guys won, you tell them to produce Saddam Hussein. 
   But what we have done, we've taken out the dictator and his forces, we've installed an elected government, and we've now installed a security apparatus, including an army built from scratch by the Americans capable of protecting that government. Nobody is guaranteed freedom and perpetuity, including this country. 
   But the American military mission in Iraq has been accomplished. You brought us victory. You, the more than 1 million Americans who served in uniform in that theater. And for that, Mr. Speaker, I think the American people owe a huge ``thank you'' to those great men and women, to their families who endured those separations, for all of the difficult burdens that they've carried ever since March of 2003 when we took that first unit across the line into that country known as Iraq. 
   Thank you to everyone who wears the uniform in that operation. Thank you for winning. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I am reminded that in World War II and at Willow Run, Michigan, I believe, Ford Motor Company made a bomber every 60 minutes for this country. Chrysler made tens of thousands of tanks. General Motors developed engines for practically every type of war machine that we utilized. 
   I would ask my colleagues to look at the need for this vote, after we have the vote and in the ensuing months, to move into the real requirement that is before the American people, and that is this: Right now, we have a non-level playing field around the world. We agreed to a GAT agreement many years ago after World War II in which we agreed to allow other nations to subsidize their auto industries by rebating their taxes, their VAT taxes, and by charging that same tax to American cars coming into their countries. 
   That means that a $10,000 car coming out of Japan receives a rebate from the Government of Japan to that car company for $1,500 if they'll do one thing--sell the car in America. When the American car comes to Japan, it receives a tax of $1,500 at the border for the American car to be sold. That's why, of the 132 trading nations moving beyond the auto industry, the United States has a deficit, a trade deficit, with practically every country in the world, including those with higher labor rates than the United States. So, as we apportion these jobs--this burden--for industry and for labor, there is also a job for government.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I want to add my voice to the eloquent voice of the chairman, Mr. Skelton. I want to thank him, and thank also Dr. SNYDER and JOHN MCHUGH, the chairman and ranking member of Personnel, for their hard work on this bill. And for all the other Members who worked on this, I know Mr. Filner and Mr. Buyer were also architects of this bill. But especially our chairman, who has a heart  for the military and perhaps is the most adept custodian of the history of military personnel matters in the Armed Services Committee; a guy with a great eye and ear for history and for the sense of tradition that kind of brings us together on the Armed Services Committee to find common ground on important issues to the folks that wear the uniform. This is one of those issues, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, young people right now are serving this country in far away places like Ramadi and Fallujah and Mosul and Kabul, and many other places around the world where the war against terror brings them face to face with danger every day. Some of those, the great members of the U.S. military, give their last full measure of devotion. Some of them are wounded and come back through Landstuhl and then to Bethesda and Walter Reed. 
   And, Mr. Chairman, I am reminded of Ronald Reagan's speech in 1981, when he stood on the west steps of the Capitol and he gestured out to the west and he said, There's the Washington Monument, dedicated to the Father of our Country, and beyond that, the Lincoln Memorial, dedicated to the man who saved the Union. But beyond those monuments are thousands of monuments with crosses and Stars of David, dedicated to Americans who gave that full measure of devotion to the same degree that the Founding Fathers did, and that's Arlington Cemetery. 
   And he mentioned that under one of those markers lies a man named Martin Trepto, who was killed in World War I. He had gone to fight with the Rainbow Division in France, and after a few months or a few weeks in country, he was killed. When his friends found his body, they found that he kept a diary, and he had written these words, and I am paraphrasing: I must fight this war as if the success or failure of America depends on me alone. 
   I can tell you, Mr. Chairman, in going out to the warfighting theaters, that standard is the same standard that is carried by the young men and women of America's Armed Forces. And because of that, it is all the more compelling that we do everything possible to make sure that they have good care when they come home, and when they are wounded and when their families similarly are wounded by their wounds; and to make sure that we have a government which is friendly to them. 
   A lot of this problem at Walter Reed and Bethesda and the rest of our medical care apparatus is this; we need to have a system that is friendly, friendly to that 22-year-old marine wife who drives a couple hundred miles, maybe leaves the kids with the mother-in-law while she goes with her husband to undertake therapy at one of our hospitals. To be able to get in and get out without having to get bogged down in a mass of bureaucracy. It is toward those ends that we dedicated this bill. 
   And again, I think the chairman has done a great job, as have Mr. McHugh and Mr. Snyder. And let me tell you a couple of the highlights here. 
   I like the idea that you have got a limitation on 17 cases per case manager. That means that each case manager is going to have a lot of time to spend with each case, with each individual. And you also have the family advocate who will help with housing and transportation and all those things. That is almost as important as the case manager, because that helps a family to be with their loved one while they are undertaking their treatment. 
   I also like this handoff between the VA and DoD. We now have a physical meeting where you don't have the bureaucracy finally telling us after 3, 4 or 5 months that the records have been lost, that they have been misplaced or that there are some missing. And lastly, when we do the evaluation, to have experts who will assist the servicemember in making sure that his or her file is complete when they go for disability. That means if you've got that frag wound in your left leg, you make sure that you've got a record of that in that disability packet when you go before the board. 
   Now, there are lots of other good language in this bill and good provisions in this bill that will accrue to the benefit of the servicemember and their family, but I think those are especially important. 
   Lastly, I think the hotline is important, Mr. Chairman, where people can call in and let the system know that it's messed up and that it's not serving them well. And I know that the wonderful men and women who serve our U.S. military will respond to that and will make things right. 
   Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for letting me speak for a couple of minutes about this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

So having that professional to help prepare it is very, very important; and I thank the gentleman for his great service and work on putting this thing together.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (HONORING FORMER REPRESENTATIVE BILL DICKINSON OF ALABAMA -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to rise and talk a little bit about a great former member who just passed away, Bill Dickinson of Alabama. 
   Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues, when I came in in 1981 and campaigned with Ronald Reagan in that great year in which we brought back a policy of peace through strength to the United States Government with respect to foreign policy, I was lucky enough to be placed on the Armed Services Committee and Bill Dickinson was the new ranking Republican member. 
   In those days, we had 1,000 petty officers a month leaving the U.S. Navy because they couldn't afford to take care of their families on the pay they were making; we had 50 percent of our aircraft or more which were not combat mission capable; we had what was called a hollow Army, that is, an Army within which skilled people were leaving at an enormous rate. And, under Ronald Reagan's leadership and Bill Dickinson's hard work as the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, along with lots of right-thinking Republicans and Democrats, we reversed that trend. We rebuilt national security. 
   I will always remember Bill working the budgets that Ronald Reagan brought in his early years, that 12.6 percent pay raise that we brought in early to start moving military families up to scale, the new equipment budgets that we brought in. The decision that we were going to stand up to the Soviet Union, and those decisions that the President made like the one that he made to move ground launch cruise missiles and Pershing 2s into Europe as the Russians were then ringing our allies with SS-20 missiles, and the fact that that helped to bring them to the table, helped to bring them to the point where they picked up the phone and said, ``We want to talk.'' 
   I can remember Bill Dickinson standing tall and supporting the President very strongly when, in Central America, we saw the FMLN in El Salvador, the Communist group that was taking arms and materiel from the Soviet Union and trying to establish a Communist beachhead in El Salvador.     
   I remember the United States moving in to provide a shield around that fragile new government that was standing up, a democratically elected government. I remember Bill Dickinson, as a ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, spearheading support in Congress for that very important initiative. 
   Time after time, Bill Dickinson moved to the fore to make sure that we rebuilt America's forces, that we operated under a policy of peace through strength. And he was, indeed, Ronald Reagan's strongest ally with respect to national security in the House of Representatives. 
   Bill was a wonderful guy, a great guy with a sense of humor, a guy who was elected in a district in Alabama that until 1964 had not been Republican for 100 years. But he kept that district with a good sense of humor, a good sense of touch with the people, being approachable, and having a very strong, conservative peace-through-strength philosophy that resonated not only with his constituents but with the American people. 
   To Barbara and the children, we express our greatest condolences. We have lost a great former representative, and I have lost a great friend.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   First, I want to express my great respect for my colleague, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, a partner on many, many legislative endeavors and a gentleman who really has the welfare of the troops of the United States in his heart when he speaks and when he legislates. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, let me say this about this piece of legislation which has been brought by the Democrat leadership before this House. This is an attempt once again to stampede a retreat from Iraq, and it is a gratuitous attempt to do this. There is no reason, only 3 1/2 weeks after the surge of troops has been put in place, to now race for the borders, to demand that the President start to wind up this operation and start to leave, especially when General Petraeus will be making recommendations to us on September 15. There is no reason to do this. And I am reminded of when the surge was first announced and I was on the floor in a discussion with a good colleague from the Democrat side, the day after the surge had been announced when only a few people were even in country from this increase in forces, and she said, There has been a car bombing and that proves the surge doesn't work. And she was ready to immediately start a retreat from the country, and I take it a number of folks on that side of the aisle were willing to do that. 
   There is no reason to do this. We have an interim report which has just come out. The interim report says that in the 18 areas of interest in which progress has to be registered, there has been progress on eight of them, there has been unsatisfactory progress on eight of them, and on two of them it is too early to really make an evaluation. Well, that is the interim report. And on September 15 we will get a further report. 
   And as I look at the important things, the things that to me are important in this report, one thing that is very important is the fact that when we needed to get the three additional brigades and that additional troop strength into Baghdad from the Iraqi Army, we got them there. Even though they didn't show up early on 1 1/2 years ago, this time they showed up. Mr. Maliki was good on his commitment. They got there. So things that were important to me with respect to this report are being accomplished. 
   But the facts are we are only 27 days into this surge. And the Democrat resolution really spells out no plan whatsoever. It asks the President to come up with yet another plan, which is highly interesting since he has a plan and since General Petraeus has stated that he will recommend adjustments on September 15. So if there are adjustments to make to the plan, they should come after General Petraeus appears before us and gives us his recommended adjustments. 
   So what are we doing here? Well, what we are really doing is counting votes. This is basically an attempt by the Democrat leadership to get a hard vote count, see if any more people have slipped, if there are any more votes on their side of the aisle so that they will be able to tee this thing up and have another vote, hopefully, from their perspective, to forward their goal, which is to start a retreat from Iraq as soon as possible. 
   There is not a single recommendation in the resolution that is offered by my good friend. There is no recommendation for a new strategy. There is simply a series of questions asked of the administration, and those questions can all best be answered when General Petraeus comes before us. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, there are two messages that I see coming from Iraq; and we all see in this very complex, very difficult mission lots of messages. A message I saw the other day came from a senior Marine leader. Do you know what it said? It said, ``We are crushing the enemy in Anbar.'' And then a few minutes later, I saw a message from the Democrat leadership that said, ``We have to get out now.'' I have seen the Democrat leadership many times say, We are going to end this war. Mr. Speaker, they don't have the ability to end this war. No American has the ability to end this war. What they do have if they gain enough power is only the ability to leave this battlefield. 
   Let's not stampede for the border, Mr. Speaker. This is not a time to make a precipitous decision to start ordering the President on a policy that is going to be reported on on September 15. Let's keep our stability. Let's make sure that we don't pass this gratuitous piece of legislation, Mr. Speaker, which really is nothing more than a vote count for the Democrat leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself 4 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote against this bill. I have great respect for my friend, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. We work on many bills together, many pieces of legislation, and 99 percent of the time we find common cause in supporting the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States. 
   This bill is not one of them. I think that this bill, Mr. Speaker, is a call to retreat by the Democratic leadership of the House, which can only hurt this country. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I have been here before. I have listened to my colleagues on the Democrat side declare that the operation that we were undertaking in El Salvador to provide a little shield around that fragile government back in the 1980s was going to be ``America's next Vietnam.'' Yet we persevered. We kept that shield in place. We stood up a democratic government. Today, the free government of El Salvador supplies troops who stand side by side with Americans in Iraq. 
   I was here when Ronald Reagan stood up against the Soviet Union when they were putting SS-20 missiles around our allies, Germany and France, in Europe. Many people on the other side of the aisle said he was going in the wrong direction. He was going to start World War III. We were going to have a nuclear war because of the fact that the President was standing up to the Soviet Union. Yes, he did that, moving Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles to offset the Soviet missiles. At one point, they picked up the telephone and said, Can we talk? Ultimately we brought down the Berlin Wall. We freed, with American perseverance, hundreds of millions of people. 
   Now, we all agree that if Iraq works, it is to the benefit of the United States. When I say that ``if Iraq works,'' I mean if we have a nation which has a modicum of freedom for its people, a nation which will not be a state sponsor of terrorism, a nation which will be a friend to the United States, then we win. That is in our interest. That is what we are trying to build in Iraq. 
   We all agree that it is rough and tough and difficult. Mr. Speaker, it is dangerous. We all know that. That is why I had the last three speakers being fathers of Americans who have served in Iraq in the Marine Corps and in the United States Army. So we know it is difficult. 
   But, you know, every time I hear good news coming out, every time I hear that, I saw the message from one of our senior Marine commanders who said, We are crushing al Qaeda in Anbar province, then I pick up a statement by one of the Democrat leaders saying, We have lost. We have lost the war. I put this piece of legislation in that same category. 
   Twenty-seven days, less than 4 weeks after we put the surge in full force, we are already being called to leave. Now, we were just criticized, the President was criticized, for saying, This is the starting line. Well, I think we should criticize the Democrats for saying, This is the finish line. I have heard so many Democrat leaders say, We are going to stop the war. That has been said over and over. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no Democrat leader here or anywhere who can stop the war. The only thing we can do is leave this battlefield. We can't stop this war any more than the people of Great Britain stopped the war when they just had this incident last week in Scotland. We can't stop this war any more than the victims in the Kobar Towers stopped the war. We can't stop this war any more than the marines in  the Beirut barrack had the power to stop the war. We can't stop this war any more than the sailors of the USS Cole had any ability to stop the war. This war has been forced on us. The only way we should end it, the only way we can end it, is to win. 
   Now we have the surge going on. It has been going on for 27 days. The leader in whom we all vest great confidence, General Petraeus, is to speak to us about the policies, about the tactics, about the strategies, and he will suggest adjustments on September 15. The idea that only 4 weeks after we have fully funded and we have fully deployed this surge we are somehow going to sound the retreat is a real disservice to this mission. 
   Mr. Speaker, what I would ask of all of our Members, Democrat and Republican, is vote against this call to retreat. If we stop fighting the terrorists, we will start losing this war against the terrorists. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I just want to say to my colleague who just spoke that I saw also two young men in Walter Reed a couple of days ago, and I would recommend that he talk with them also if he thinks that everybody that is over there supports this resolution. 
   I would also say to my friend that if you think that the message that is going to go across thousands of Web sites and communications the day after this vote is taken on terrorist Web sites is, our message is that democracy is alive and well in the United States, I am willing to take a bet on that. I do not think you will see that. I think you will see something else. 
   You will see the message that they think that this resolution, if it is passed, is the first note of retreat in the war against terror by the United States. That is what you will see and I will be happy to take a bet on that one. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I heard just a couple of hours ago, as many of us have, that the Democratic leadership of the House intends to use management policies in the Department of Defense over the next year or so to keep either troops or supplies from moving to the battlefield. 
   Now, using management policies that will prohibit people from moving in the Marines or the United States Army if they haven't spent enough time back in CONUS before they go, I can say this to you, that is a very, very dangerous policy. 
   Our ability to project power around the world and to deter people who wish us ill is the ability to move men and equipment very quickly around the world. And any type of an inhibition of that capability is going to be extremely dangerous to the United States. And I will fight with every fiber of my being any attempt by this Congress through management policies by the Democratic leadership, through management policies of DOD to keep either reinforcement or supplies from reaching our troops around the world. 
   I will simply say once more, I said when we started this debate yesterday, that this resolution will be looked at by America's friends, by America's enemies, and I think also by America's troops; and I think they will interpret it, no matter the good faith of people in this Chamber, they will interpret it as the first notes of retreat in the war against terror, just as they interpreted actions by the Spanish Government after the domestic strike in Spain and the terrorist hit in Spain and in other countries. 
   They will look at what we have done, and I will be happy to stand with any of my colleagues and analyze those messages as they come off the terrorist boards after this vote is taken. This resolution, if it passes tomorrow, and it probably will, will be taken as the first note of retreat in the war against terror. 
   Any attempt by the Democrat leadership to cut off supplies or reinforcement by management policies in DOD, personnel policies, will be interpreted as the second note of retreat in the war against terror, and I for one will oppose them very strongly

   Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes just to give some information that my great friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes), commented on. 
   I made a comment a few minutes ago that I had understood that the Democrat leadership or a member of that leadership had stated that they would use DOD management policies to cut off the sending of either reinforcements or supplies to the warfighting theater and that I would oppose that very strongly. 
   My friend Mr. Reyes expressed doubt that that had happened. He said he had not heard about it. 
   I just wanted to inform him I have the Reuters report here, and it quotes our colleague Mr. Murtha: ``A leading congressional opponent of the war in Iraq on Thursday said his plans for placing conditions on how President George W. Bush can spend $93.4 billion in new combat funds would effectively stop an American troop buildup.'' This is quoting Mr. Murtha. 
   Mr. Murtha says: ``They won't be able to continue. They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the equipment, they don't have the training, and they won't be able to do the work. There's no question in my mind.'' 
   That is the statement upon which I based my remarks a few minutes ago. It appears that statement has been made.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (HONORING CONGRESSMAN JIM SAXTON -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I thank the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey for yielding. Thanks for the privilege of being here. 
   We just finished talking about Terry Everett, one of the real giants in this House, and now, to talk about Jimmy Saxton. 
   You know, there are a lot of ways to describe Jimmy Saxton. Jimmy Saxton is the kind of guy you'd like to share a duck blind with because he's such a good guy, and he's just fun to be around, and he's got a great sense of humor. 
   He talks about the time--and I'll tell the story on myself--that we went deer hunting one day. We were going to go bowhunting for deer. I told Jimmy I'd pick him up at 5:00 in the morning, and I did pick him up at 5:00 in the morning in my old, beat-up suburban that we called the war wagon. 
   We were driving out toward this farm that I had permission for us to hunt on. We never got anything, but we had a lot of fun out there, watching the sun come up. We were driving out there, and I realized, you know, when you're deer hunting, you want to get into the  woods before daylight, while it's still dark. You want to get up, and you're blind, so you're waiting for the animals to move. 
   I realized we didn't have a flashlight, and so Jimmy said, ``Well, darn it. I don't have one either.'' So he said, ``I thought you were going to bring one.'' 
   I was supposed to bring it, so we stopped at the first convenience store, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth. None of them had it. Now, finally, at one store, just as we got next to the farm, Jimmy said, ``I'll bet that one's got it.'' Sure enough, it did. He went in, and he got the flashlight and the batteries. 
   He came out, and he said, ``Hunter, I've got the flashlight.'' He said, ``There's only one problem.'' 
   I said, ``What's that?'' 
   He said, ``The sun is coming up right now.'' 
   I said, ``I don't care. We're taking that flashlight into the woods. We paid for it. We're going to use it.'' 
   So Jimmy Saxton is just a fun guy. He's one of those guys who's kind of like Terry, who always had his eyes on the national interest. You know, this place, this city and this political system is full of interests, and that's legitimate. Most of the interests come from our own countrymen in our own districts and from people who have positions on things that they feel very strongly about. A lot of them are economic positions. A lot of them are social positions. Jimmy Saxton is the kind of guy who can always look through all of that and see what he called the American interest or what I call the American interest, which is always to do the right thing and to want to do the right thing. That's what makes this country go. 
   Now, Jimmy, as I said, is a hunter. He loves to hunt. I'll never forget the time he came out to Wyoming, and we went antelope hunting out there. Barbara Cubin, a great representative from Wyoming, had arranged for us to come out there to do some antelope hunting, and we did that. 
   After that was over, Jimmy went on a trail drive. Now, as a boy from New Jersey, he doesn't get to go on many trail drives, but he went on a trail drive. So I gave him his picture a couple of nights ago--and the gentleman from New Jersey was there, Mr. LoBiondo--and it's a picture of a bunch of cowboys on their horses, and it's entitled something like ``True Friends.'' I put on the inscription plate of that picture ``A friend for life, Jimmy Saxton; from Duncan, Lynn--'' she's my wife--``Duncan D.--'' he's my marine son who is now running for Congress--``and Sam.'' He's my youngest son. 
   That's the way you feel about Jimmy. You work with Jimmy professionally, but you feel about him that he's just a great, close friend. Like Terry Everett, he has helped me down my long career of running for and mostly losing leadership positions, every now and then winning one. 
   You know, in the end, as you've gone down this competitive trail once again, it's not all the results of these things, because we all win and lose every day whether you're winning issues or losing them or are winning elections or losing them, but it's the people you work with along the way and the people who are your friends. Jimmy Saxton is as true an American as those first Americans. 
   You know, I imagine those first Americans who fired those first shots in the Revolutionary War who said now we've done it. We've got the biggest, strongest country in the world coming at us--the British empire--but they decided to take them on for freedom. I can imagine that among those people were lots of people who had the character of Jimmy Saxton--that of pure principle, of doing what you think is right even though it's going to have adverse consequences and of enjoying this great, wonderful country that God gave us called the United States of America. 
   So I thank Mr. LoBiondo for ordering up this time.     
   Terry Everett sat next to Mr. Saxton for a long time on the Armed Services Committee. Terry and Jimmy sat side by side. I was hoping, leaving as the ranking member, that Jimmy would take that position. And now he is retiring. And then I was hoping that Terry would take that position, and now he is retiring. We are losing two great, great, bright lights, two stars in this very important leadership position because everyone who is on the Armed Services Committee is a leader of sorts. 
   I am kind of interested in what the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Everett) has to say about Mr. Saxton.

   Mr. HUNTER. Terry Everett said Jimmy Saxton always cared about the soldiers, and he did, very deeply. 
   Interestingly, I had a lot of conversations with him about weapons systems. Never in those conversations, and people look at this as a place where lobbyists come in, and they lobby for things and want you to support them because they give contributions or their things are made in your district, I never heard Jimmy Saxton say, even in total confidence, we need to go for this one because it is politically the thing to do or it is good for my campaign. He would always argue the merits and he was willing to be convinced the other way if there were enough facts on the table. 
   We all visit the military bases, and we know the major bases and we go to them. When we go into theater in Iraq or Afghanistan, you go to the big bases and you spend a lot of time with the line troops. I was a line troop in the 173rd and our conventional forces. 
   Jimmy, as chairman of the Terrorism Subcommittee, he oversaw special operations forces. And so he spent a lot of time going to little, out-of-the-way places and meeting with people who weren't highly visible all of the time, but people who work in small teams and work in dangerous and difficult places. 
   And kind of like the gentleman from Alabama who is one of the few people who served at the same time on the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee, and that is Mr. Everett, and understands the enormous character that is required of our intelligence people, Jimmy Saxton spent a lot of time with our Green Berets, with our Seals, with our Rangers and special operators, and he made sure that these people had the custom-made things that they need. That didn't always come in the regular procurement accounts. When you are undertaking these difficult missions, they need unusual equipment. Jimmy Saxton was very meticulous about making sure that they had the right stuff. 
   That is an important job, and I hope that those who come after Jimmy have the same attention to detail and the same concern for those guys who need extraordinary equipment. 
   He is going to be missed. 
   Mr. LoBiondo, I have watched as we would listen to a debate, and I will  come in and sit next to you, and we will both listen to Jim Saxton. He will share some of that great wisdom of his about issues, and it is always straight ahead. It is always the best advice he can give, and it is always in the best interests of our country. 
   Thanks for letting me come out. Since I presented JIM with his picture of, guess what from the west, horses, I am going to retrieve that back from his office and present it to him four or five more times. 
   Thank you for yielding to me.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   To my great friend, IKE SKELTON, and all my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, it is an undeserved honor, but I want to thank you for the wonderful job that you have all done in putting this bill together. 
   This bill would not be, with all of the exigencies that we have had, and all of the difficulties in the other body to get their bill up, this bill would not be before this body now if it wasn't for the leadership of IKE SKELTON. 
   There are a lot of military institutions in Missouri and around this country which teach members of the uniformed services leadership, but there is another institution which exhibits leadership every day, as chairman of this committee, and that's our chairman, IKE SKELTON.     
   IKE worked this thing through a difficult period of time, with the emergencies that are emanating right now in the Capitol and the major economic emergency which is distracting lots of folks who otherwise could be working on this bill. Time schedules have been extremely difficult, and IKE SKELTON, in his quiet way with his quiet leadership and his corporate understanding, he is the main body of history for the Armed Services Committee. He is the guy who remembers not only what happened in this committee 10 and 20 and 30 and 40 years ago, but also what happened in the wars that this Nation fought and what happened in that institution across the river known as the Pentagon. And being able to recall that history at important times in our deliberative processes is a great, great asset to this Nation. IKE, I want to congratulate you. This is your bill. It may have my name on it, but this is your bill. You brought this thing through to the House floor in the most difficult circumstances. Not only that, it is a wonderful bill. 
   The chairman has talked a lot about the details of the bill. This is an authorization of $531.4 billion. It does authorize a $68.6 billion bridge fund; a bridge fund, I might add, that was an initiative of the Armed Services Committee several years ago. 
   We looked at our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and said they are going to have to have the equipment and the resources during the later months in the calendar year before that spring supplemental arrives, and we came up with the bridge fund. The President followed our lead. The appropriators have followed our lead, and it has been an excellent vehicle allowing us to maintain in these warfighting theaters while we are waiting for the next funding vehicle. My congratulations to IKE for that. 
   We do have a good pay raise for the members of the armed services, a 3.9 percent pay raise. You know, this bill does several other things, and I will speak generally about them. It leverages American strengths. It leverages American strengths by continuing to keep the line warm, for example, on F-22 which is a key weapon system because it is a weapon system with the capability to penetrate air defenses that are here today and which may be here tomorrow. It leverages two great American innovations: stealth and precision weapons. 
   I would urge all of my colleagues as we go into this very difficult, very dangerous era for the United States, to continue to put pressure on and to produce American leverage. And stealth and precision technology are two of those items of technology, as is undersea technology. And we are moving toward an acceleration of the submarine program in this bill. That is very critical. 
   One disappointment I have is we are not doing enough in space. I would just say to my colleagues that the shooting down of a satellite by China this last year heralded a new era of military competition in space with China whether we like it or not. When you are in a military competition, there is only one alternative and that is to win. So I would urge this committee to continue in the years ahead to build a capability in space to make sure that we maintain all of the institutions and the apparatus that we need there to make sure that our military operates effectively here and that our economy operates effectively here. 
   Also in the area of missile defense, we are moving ahead to try to establish a missile defense capability in Europe that would handle through that throat of approach out of an Iranian missile launch that might take place 5 years or 10 years or 15 years from now, or perhaps even earlier. That is an important item because that brings the partnership, the NATO-plus partnership of the newly freed captive nations, but also the NATO membership, along with us in what is sometimes a difficult path, an expensive path, but nonetheless a necessary path to defend the world in this new era of missiles. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of excellent items in this bill. In the end they all go down to and reflect on and focus on the most important warfighting leverage that the United States have, and that is the men and women of this country who wear the uniform of the United States. 
   I just want to commend my colleagues for the wonderful job that they have done in making sure that the men and women of the United States have the right equipment and the right incentives and good pay and good quality of life for their families such that when I was in a recruiting office the other day, and no I wasn't signing up, but when I was in one of the old Army recruiting offices in good old San Diego, the one shortage that they had, the one specialty, military occupational specialty that they had which was not available because too many people had subscribed for it and too many people had signed up for it was infantry. 
   And I thought in these dangerous theaters of Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea that we have more people than we need signing up for the United States infantry is a reflection largely on this committee. 
   We have two Members who are retiring, the great Mr. Everett of Alabama and the great Mr. SAXTON of New Jersey. Mr. Udall is moving on to another race, and we wish him well in his endeavors. But those two gentlemen are retiring.

   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, let me just conclude by again reflecting on the great leadership of Ike Skelton that brought this bill to the floor under such difficult circumstances. It's a great bill. 
   And lastly, to just reinforce a point that's been made by a number of speakers, you know, this is a city which really, whether you have a military crisis or an economic crisis, needs honest brokers, and those are people that can look at interested parties and make a decision that is made for the right reasons and made on the merits. This committee could not function, this Congress couldn't function, if we didn't have incredible, professional staff who can look right through a dozen conflicting interests and see one interest that should dominate the scene, and that's the American interest, the right thing to do. 
   And our professional staff members have that capability, and they have great character, and they have a lot of character, and in many cases, they are characters. Erin Conaton and Bob Simmons are the former staff director and the staff director, and their team have done such a great job of bringing this bill together, and only people in whom you could vest enormous amounts of trust could accomplish what they've accomplished. 
   I just want to commend them for this incredible undertaking that's been the last couple of weeks. They are all so sleepy right now they really just want to finish this thing and get off the floor. But let's thank them for what they've done for this country. We appreciate you. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HUNTER. (RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE BUD CRAMER AND THE HONORABLE TERRY EVERETT ON THEIR RETIREMENT FROM CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. I thank my good friend for yielding. And to both these great sons of Alabama, I want to say, thank you for your wonderful work and your wonderful service to our country. 
   I was in Terry's house a couple of summers ago. And we walked out to his woodworking studio where he makes all of these great cabinetry, wood products and molding. In fact he built this beautiful house by himself almost single-handedly using all this machinery that he had in his woodworking place. And as we walked across the floor, I noticed a bunch of red stains. And I said, what is that, Terry? He said, that is when I cut part of my hand off. And I keep that blood to remind me so I won't do it again. And I immediately decided that I would not become a woodworker. It was too dangerous. 
   But I am reminded on that trip that Terry Everett was showing me how to make cabinets. And he can make cabinets. And if you go in that house, you can see he made beautiful ones. I said, Terry, our house burned down in California. We're going to have to rebuild it. He said, well, Hunter, if you come down here for a week or two, we will make some cabinets. 
   Terry, let me tell you, having now experienced the cost of California cabinets, I wish I had come down and worked with you and made those cabinets with you out of some of that good old cypress wood. That would have been great. 
   And Bud, I want to thank you incidentally for your great support of national defense. I have always been in this Congress kind of a Johnny One Note focused on defense issues since I got here. You always support a strong national defense. That has helped us to do all the things that Terry and I have worked on over the years to rebuild our defense in such a way that we're able to bring down the Soviet Union and that we were able to free hundreds of millions of people, we were able to bring freedom to the captive nations of Eastern Europe and to keep the United States a shining star in this very difficult, very dangerous world. And your  work to make sure that we kept this country strong is very, very much appreciated. 
   And I have always thought of you as one of those great voices who could reach across the aisle and come together in a bipartisan way to make this country strong and to do the right thing. And that is so important in this body. In fact the ability to reconcile our differences and find common ground may be the best characteristic of this body. 
   Now let me tell you about Terry. Terry and I have done a lot of political planning. And some people would call it conspiracy. But I just call it political planning. Terry Everett has either shown enormous loyalty to me or terrible judgment. He supported me in every campaign I have run in the House. And I have run for the leadership. I have lost some of them, and I have won some of them. And Terry would go out and make those vote counts and helped me. Sometimes he would sit and say, Hunter, I think you're going to be a little bit short here, but we're going to drive on. And we always drove on. And in the end, it's not whether you won all those contests. It's the great friends that you made while you were on the way, while you were competing.     
   If you think that loyalty and friendship are important components of the American character, then Terry Everett is just full of character. And also he is a character. And if you listen to him, you will see a great sense of humor, an ability to laugh at the world, even when the world has taken some dangerous turns, and go back to work in a quiet way and get things done. 
   I have also said that Terry, behind closed doors, is one of our members on the Armed Services Committee and on the Intelligence Committee, so he ties those two committees together; one committee that oversees this $600 billion-plus budget and this enormous fighting force of the Army and the Navy and the Marine Corps and the Air Force, and the other committee which oversees this very important arm called the Intelligence Branch, which gives us the information that we need to keep this country safe and secure. And many times those two entities, the defense community and the intelligence community, have to come together and work together, just like they are working together in Iraq and Afghanistan right now. 
   Let me tell you, a lot of the coordination that is taking place right now in Iraq and Afghanistan between people that are working in very difficult, inconvenient places and risking a lot, their effectiveness and their coordination to a large degree is a result of the work of the guy sitting right in front of me, Mr. Terry Everett. 
   So, Terry, you are a life-long friend, a great, great American, and I have got to tell you, working on the Armed Services Committee with you for so many years has been a real joy. It has been a great thing for this Nation to have you in the traces there pulling that plow, doing that hard work every day. You are going to be tough to replace. 
   Bud, I know you are going to be tough to replace too. You have done wonderful work. 
   Terry, you are one of two guys retiring from political life from the Armed Services Committee. Jimmy Saxton is the other one, and I gave him his parting gift from the Hunter family. I have got one for you. I am going to give it to you now, Terry. I am going to present it to you about five times this week so I can get a lot of mileage out of it. 
   I want to tell you just a little story about this picture. This picture was painted, this is a signed and numbered lithograph by Olaf Wieghorst, who at the time he passed away in San Diego, California, and he was a great friend, he was the highest-priced Western artist in the world. He was a grand old guy who had been part of the American cavalry in the early 1900s and became a great artist, without ever taking a lesson. 
   In fact, if you go rent the movie ``El Dorado'' with John Wayne and Robert Mitchum and James Caan, you will see that Olaf Wieghorst is the Swedish gunsmith in the movie. He was in that movie because John Wayne had a number of his pictures, as did Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater, and Wayne told him to come down to the movie set one time, and he did that, and they put him in this movie ``El Dorado.'' 
   So I want you to check out ``El Dorado,'' and you will see my old friend Olaf Wieghorst, who painted your picture. And I believe your picture is rolled on the screen during the credits as they sing the opening ballad in this great Western movie. So I want you to go down and look at that. 
   But one reason I am giving you this Olaf Wieghorst picture of the American West is this: The quintessential American Westerner is straight ahead, looked you right in the eye, his word was his bond, loyalty was his trademark, and that is Terry Everett.           
   So, Terry, I want you to look at this picture and remember that the Hunter Rancho has lots of rooms in it since we have rebuilt after the fire, and we look forward to you coming up and bringing some of your cabinet making tools. Maybe you can show Mrs. Hunter and I how to make a couple of extras. 
   But thank you for your great service to this country. That flag over this Capitol waves proudly and waves more securely because you served.           
   Thank you very much for your service. 
   And Bud Cramer, thank you, my great friend, for your service to our country also. 
   I am going to take this picture back, Terry, because I am going to present it to you about five more times.

   Mr. HUNTER. In your work on the Strategic Subcommittee on Armed Services, what a critical position at a critical time for this country. Because being able to renew our strategic capabilities, these systems age, being able to match what other people are doing in space now. I think when the Chinese knocked that satellite out of space, they initiated and heralded a new era of competition in space. Whether we like it or not we are in this fight, we are in this competition. And being able to maintain that capability that, as you so articulately stated, supports American military movements and operations and the economy of the United States, what a crucial responsibility, and you did a great job at it.  
   But always with that great--you know, you are an Alabama guy, and Alabama is a wonderful State, but you have all those great qualities that represent the best of the American West.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time. 
   And to all of my colleagues, as I wrap up this 28 years, having come in with Ronald Reagan in 1981, I would be remiss if I didn't talk a little bit about this great Virginian who came in in 1981, in August--I think it was about August 27, 1981, walked into my office and took a job as a front desk person, the person who's right there in the front of the battlefield, to be a member of our office staff. Her name was Vicki Middleton, and she was the daughter of a dairy farmer in northern Virginia. And she came in with a can-do attitude, did a wonderful job at the front desk. And then she moved to be a legislative correspondent, and then our senior legislative person, and then, ultimately, my chief of staff. 
   Mr. Speaker, the ability of this House to operate and this legislative body to operate is strongly reliant on these wonderful, great Americans, these professional staff members who can look through a sea of interests and crosscurrents of people with various stakes in the game and can clearly see the American interest, what's right for this country, and Vicki Middleton is one of those people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I came in in 1981. I got on the Armed Services Committee. We rebuilt national defense. We came in with a 12.6 percent pay raise for our troops. We came back from those days when 1,000 petty officers a month were leaving the Navy because they couldn't afford to take care of their families on the pay they were making. We rebuilt and replaced lots of those old planes that wouldn't fly, and we fixed those ships that wouldn't steam and we built lots more of them. And we stood up to the Soviet Union and we brought down the Berlin Wall. And we brought a new era of freedom to hundreds of millions of people in this world.  
   And behind those initial programs and those initiatives by President Ronald Reagan and later President George Herbert Walker Bush and then George W. Bush and the initiatives that we've undertaken with our armed services to bring freedom to others in the world and to protect our own security are those wonderful, great staff people who not only work on the Armed Services Committee, but also work in the Members' offices. And Vicki Middleton is first and foremost, in my mind, among those people. 
   She is, in my estimation--and I know a few Members will argue with me because they have superb people working for them--I have always called her the best chief of staff on Capitol Hill. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, as I leave this job after 28 years, I thought it might be nice to give something to Vicki Middleton to make sure that she understands how much we value her great leadership and her friendship. And so my wife Lynn and I had this painting, which is a signed and numbered lithograph by Olaf Wieghorst, whom you may have heard me talk about on a couple of occasions here on the House floor, who is considered the ``Dean of Western artists'' from my hometown of San Diego, whose paintings, at the end of his life, he was the highest price western painter in the world. And he was a guy who was highly independent, strongly accountable, looked you right in the eye, never had a lick of painting lessons in his life, but had a great eye for movement, for color, and for the people of the West. And he painted this beautiful picture of western horses. And this inscription reads, ``From Lynn and Duncan Hunter, for your 26 years of service to America, to Vicki Middleton, and for a lifetime of friendship, duty, honor and country.'' 
   I reflected today, Mr. Chairman, as I looked at all of our great staff members, that those terms, ``duty, honor and country,'' aren't reserved exclusively for the people who wear the uniform of the United States--although they certainly reflect those values of our uniformed personnel--but they also reflect the values of people like Vicki Middleton, who came from a small town in Virginia, came to Washington, D.C. with independence, with honesty, with integrity, and with a great deal of patriotism for her country, and dedicated 26 years to this institution and to the flag that waves over it. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, Lynn and I are presenting this picture--in fact, we've already presented it to Vicki once; I think we're going to present it to her about five more times before this session is over--but we're presenting this picture to her in recognition of her service to America.
