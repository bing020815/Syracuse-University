   Mr. CHABOT. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The Holocaust was filled with unconscionable inhumanity and horrors and revealed the tremendous cruelty some human beings are capable of imposing on others. But there were exceptions. Within the darkness of the Holocaust, the story of Irena Sendler, who repeatedly risked her own life to rescue thousands of Jewish children in Poland from being murdered by the Nazis serves as an inspirational example of human bravery and selflessness and compassion. 
   House Concurrent Resolution 361 commemorates Irena Sendler, who passed away in May of this year. The resolution, among other things, notes that the United States Congress mourns the loss of this heroine and remembers her for saving the lives of thousands of Jewish children and for her courageous dedication to justice and human rights. 
   I support this resolution, and I want to thank the gentleman for his inspirational words. I urge my colleagues to do so as well. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 1266 congratulates the countries of Albania and Croatia on their recent invitation to join the NATO Alliance. Both countries have struggled to implement significant democratic and economic reforms over the past two decades. The invitations for these countries to join NATO are recognition of the progress that they have both made in spite of such obstacles. 
   This resolution also recognizes the importance of continued expansion of the NATO Alliance to include other European countries that may meet NATO's membership standards. The expansion of the alliance and the finalization of Membership Action Plans with countries that have not yet been invited to join NATO is a necessary next step for countries like Georgia and Ukraine, for example, that have not yet been invited to join NATO. 
   As this resolution notes, NATO's continued enlargement will strengthen security in the Euro-Atlantic region.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would first like to also commend the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Terry) for his leadership and his offering this particular resolution, and I also rise to support this resolution, H. Res. 1279, which recognizes the Special Olympics on its 40th anniversary. 
   On July 20, 1968, as was mentioned, Eunice Kennedy Shriver organized the first Special Olympic Summer Games, which took place at Soldier Field in Chicago. Since then, the Special Olympics has become one of the most prominent and celebrated sporting programs in the entire world. The Special Olympics today serves more than 2 1/2 million people with intellectual disabilities. 
   These inspirational athletes work with more than 1 million volunteers and coaches worldwide, training year round for competition in both Summer and Winter Games. In more than 200 countries, the Special Olympics has shown that intellectual disabilities are no impediment to fun and healthy athletic competition. These athletes are supported by more than 18,000 dedicated volunteers. 
   In my own State, Special Olympics Ohio has approximately 200 local member organizations and over 18,000 athletes who are in training and competition. These organizations originate from county boards of MR/DD, public schools, developmental centers, parks and recreation departments, churches, and parent and community groups. 
   For the past 40 years, these games have empowered individuals with intellectual disabilities to become physically fit and have fun while engaging in sports training and competition. 
   As was indicated by the gentleman from California, and I think the quote again warrants stating, that like the gladiators of ancient Rome, Special Olympics athletes pledge, ``Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.'' 
   On this 40th anniversary, we congratulate these courageous athletes and wish the program many more years of continued success. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS AFRICAN UNION MISSION IN DARFUR (UNAMID) -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of this resolution, H. Res. 1351. I would like to also thank the distinguished gentleman from California, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for his support and his leadership on this, as well as the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) for his leadership and their hard work in making this resolution possible. I also want to thank Ranking Member ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN from Florida for her support. 
   Each day that passes without the full support of the international community for the U.N.'s peacekeeping mission in Darfur is another day that these innocent people, and now the peacekeepers assigned to protect them, have to live in fear. 
   Last year I had the opportunity to travel to Darfur with Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON-LEE of Texas and Congressman ADRIAN SMITH of Nebraska to witness firsthand the devastation of this region. The refugees with whom we met, mostly women and children in the refugee camps, described harrowing experiences of escape from the Janjaweed and the Sudanese Government. They're descriptions that I will never forget. Many of these women had been raped. Many of their husbands, brothers, sons, and fathers had been brutally murdered. 
   We met with them in refugee camps in Darfur just weeks following the unanimous decision by the United Nations Security Council to deploy 26,000 peacekeepers to the region. Yet progress in Darfur has been jeopardized, as H. Res. 1351 points out. Almost a year since Security Resolution 1769 passed, the mission lacks more than 16,000 troops and police officers as well as essential communications equipment and helicopters. That's one of the things that they need the most, all of which are critical to the mission's success. 
   The skeleton mission has been met with continued roadblocks from the Sudanese government which has thwarted it at every step, refusing to cooperate on the composition of the hybrid force, refusing to authorize night flights, refusing to issue visas for necessary staff, or to provide access to certain areas. 
   The lack of international support for the mission and the opposition that it faces in the region has and continues to compromise the ability of UNAMID peacekeepers to secure the region--not only leaving the Darfuri people vulnerable to continued attacks but now the peacekeepers assigned to protect them. 
   As the chairman indicated, back on July 8 of this year, this month, a couple of weeks ago, the world witnessed  the deadliest attacks yet on our peacekeeping mission which resulted in seven deaths and 22 wounded. On July 16, another peacekeeper from Nigeria was attacked and killed. These attacks come on the heels of pleas from the U.N. that shortages of resources could ``jeopardize its efforts to stabilize the region.'' U.N. member nations and the rest of the international community must not sit idly by and watch the mission in Darfur fail at the expense of the millions of innocent people who have already survived one genocide. 
   I think it is important to note that while the United States is often criticized for not doing enough, $4 billion or 72 percent--let me repeat that, 72 percent--of the cost of peacekeeping, development, reconstruction, and humanitarian efforts in Darfur have been paid for by the United States. So 72 percent is being funded by the American taxpayers. It is past time for our European allies, and especially the wealthy Arab countries, to assist in this effort.     
   If we're paying 72 percent, I think you have to consider that we're sending literally hundreds of billions of dollars now to the Middle East, the wealthy oil countries there. And most of the people that have suffered in the Darfur region are Muslims, and the Arab countries have done little or nothing, many of them, despite the fact that we have hundreds of millions of dollars going over there for their oil revenues. 
   And so, rather than building another expensive hotel or buying another yacht or some other luxury item, some of these dollars ought to be diverted to the poor people in Darfur, perhaps to buy some helicopters so that we can get the U.N. troops in to help these people that have, as I indicated, already survived one genocide and are essentially in the middle of another if the world doesn't act. 
   So, for those who criticize the United States for doing enough--and yes, we always should do more--remember, we're supporting 72 percent of the effort there. The rest of the world is providing the other 28 percent. And let's urge, to the extent that we're able, those wealthy Arab oil countries to foot a fair portion of the bill to help out in this effort. 
   And I urge my colleagues to support this critical mission by supporting H. Res. 1351. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to wrap up. I will be brief. 
   One of the previous resolutions that we had talked about China and the human rights abuses that have occurred, and they're just having the Olympics coming up. And the fact is, it hasn't been mentioned yet in this particular debate, but China has played a particularly unhelpful role, quite frankly, in Darfur and Sudan. They have been very much involved behind the scenes, particularly with respect to oil interests in Darfur and have made it possible for the government in Darfur to continue to flaunt world opinion, who basically has been indicating to the Sudanese Government you need to cooperate here. This is an embarrassment to the whole world, how people in Darfur are being treated. It makes you, the Sudanese Government, look bad; why don't you get with the program, reform, cooperate, and help these people. 
   Unfortunately, again, China who has considerable influence that it could act upon if it chose to do so, has, in some minor instances, been somewhat helpful but for the most part has failed to step up to the plate and actually put pressure on the Sudanese Government to do something finally about Darfur. 
   So I would strongly urge, once again, that China, in this particular instance, do the right thing, put pressure on the Sudanese Government to do something to relieve the terrible conditions that the people of Darfur have suffered under, whether it's genocide, whether it's literally starvation in some instances. China, do what's right and help the people of Darfur.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution which underscores Beijing's broken promise to the International Olympic Committee and the international community. When Beijing was awarded the 2008 Summer Olympics, China's leaders committed themselves to using this historic event as a catalyst to improve human rights for the citizens of the world's most populous nation. By all credible accounts, however, the human rights situation in China has not improved on the eve of the games. The Olympics has led China's draconian security forces to further crack down on dissidents and increase repression of minority groups. The glimmer of gold from Olympic medals in Beijing cannot conceal a tarnished record of Chinese official sponsorship of dictatorial regimes in Sudan, Burma and North Korea. The shine of silver cannot blind us to the fact that the Beijing regime continues its bloody suppression of minority groups, including the Tibetans. The brilliance of bronze cannot block out the repression of Falun Gong practitioners, Internet journalists, underground church believers and other political prisoners left to languish in the laogai forced labor camps and the vast prison system. 
   In a report issued just yesterday, Amnesty International affirmed that in the last year alone, thousands of dissidents, reformers and other independent voices were arrested as part of a campaign by Chinese authorities to ``clean up'' Beijing before the start of the Olympic games. According to the report, human rights activists have been targeted in other parts of the country as well, with many of those arrested and sentenced to manual labor without trial. Amnesty's report cites the case of one activist who was arrested earlier this month on charges of possessing state secrets, although it is believed that the arrest was prompted by his efforts to help the families of children killed in May's earthquake bring a legal case against local authorities. 
   Amnesty's deputy director in Asia said: ``By continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights, the Chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games 7 years ago. The Chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games.'' I agree with what he said. 
   When it comes to the pursuit of democratic values and human rights, we remain a world divided with a dream unfulfilled for many in China and elsewhere. I urge my colleagues to join in sending the Chinese leadership a strong message. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the Speaker's words relative to China. The Speaker has a very tough job, and with that job goes praise and criticism. I know many of us, including myself, have been critical of the Speaker for not allowing, for example, a vote on ANWR on the floor of this House and we certainly think that we ought to have that vote. 
   But I want to praise the Speaker on her speaking out when she was on a trip in India on a codel and she spoke out when the crackdown on Tibet was occurring, the scandalous, outrageous crackdown on Tibet was occurring. The Speaker spoke out, and I issued a press release and also a personal letter thanking her for speaking out on behalf of our country. I think it was the right thing for her to do, and I think it took a lot of courage for the Speaker of the House to actually speak out on behalf of Tibetans who are undergoing considerable civil rights, human rights abuses. 
   The fact is, there are still, according to a recent article, at least 1,000 Tibetans that are unaccounted for because of this crackdown by the PRC, by Communist China. This is a very serious issue, and I'm glad that we're taking up this resolution.

   In response to administration requests, this brief bill does a number of things. It extends for another year the State Department's authority to hire retired Foreign Service officers for difficult-to-staff posts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to address visa and passport processing backlogs. 
   It also extends authorities for Radio Free Asia, and for emergency broadcasting needs in the International Broadcasting Bureau and the Voice of America. It also makes clear that the State Department may pay the hotel expenses of its special agents on protective details in situations where agents are required to remain with their protectees overnight, even when that duty occurs in the agent's home locale. 
   Finally, it incorporates the text of H.R. 3658, the House-passed bill introduced by the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Fortu&#241;o) to allow U.S. Foreign Service officers to take their rest and recuperative travel in U.S. territories. I urge support for this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1008, which condemns the Iranian Government's continuing persecution of members of the Baha'i faith, calls on Iran's Parliament to reject a proposed Islamic penal code, and calls on the Iranian regime to immediately release 10 imprisoned Baha'is. 
   Mr. Speaker, Tehran's notoriously cruel regime, which denies religious freedoms to its citizens, has made a special example of the Iranian Baha'is. In addition to seizing Baha'i communal property, the Iranian Government prohibits the community from officially assembling, bans them from practicing or teaching their religion, excludes them from the national pension system and from public universities, prevents them from inheriting property, and jails them on account of their faith or on trumped-up charges of espionage. 
   Recently, Iranian Baha'is have also reported a string of arson attacks against their homes and vehicles. Disturbingly, this persecution continues to the grave. In 2007, two Baha'i cemeteries in Iran were destroyed or bulldozed, wiping away the memory of these innocent Iranians. 
   Mr. Speaker, oppression of Baha'is comes from the very top of the Iranian regime. The U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief has revealed that in 2005, the chairman of the command headquarters of Iran's Armed Forces wrote a letter stating that Iran's so-called ``supreme leader'' had ordered the headquarters to identify and monitor Iranian members of the Baha'i faith. 
   This was no idle request. In March and May of 2008, the Government of Iran arrested and imprisoned seven senior leaders of the Baha'i community in Iran. And today, those leaders, along with three other Baha'is, remain imprisoned without charge. 
   Now Iran's Parliament may aggravate repression of religious freedom by enacting a draft Islamic penal code that would punish so-called ``apostates,'' including all Baha'is and converts from Islam, with death. Iran's regime continues to demonstrate that it is ready and willing to execute innocent people. 
   Mr. Speaker, totalitarian regimes everywhere, hiding behind the false excuse of state sovereignty, are eager to combat any progress in human rights and freedoms and to expand their hegemony and repression as far as others allow them to do. Therefore, the United States must continue to make  clear, in both word and deed, that the spread of religious freedom and human rights worldwide is not merely an ideal, but an imperative. 
   I thank my distinguished colleague and friend from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) for introducing this resolution.

My concern is that this Congress has done little or nothing to prevent future crimes from occurring. With more than 700,000 offenders expected to be released back into our communities next year and the number of people who are entering their so-called high-crime years being at an all time high, conditions are ripe for a perfect storm of crime to hit our communities. 
   In my view, this Congress should act to, among other things, strengthen victims' rights; make restitution something that's real, not just words on paper; crack down on drug dealers who sell death on our streets, and truly protect witnesses so more people will be willing to come forward to testify against gang members who all too frequently virtually control many neighborhoods, especially urban areas and cities across this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the congressional district that has so many outstanding high schools. Not only do these schools excel in academics, but they are home to some of the most gifted scholar-athletes in the Nation. 
   Just this fall, Cincinnati witnessed two of our young women's high school volleyball teams, Mother of Mercy and Mount Notre Dame, meet for the second State championship in the last 2 years. 
   After spending much of the season at the top of the rankings, Mercy senior leadership kept them strong at the end. Seniors Missy Harpenau, Stephanie Vorherr, Michelle James, and Kelly O'Connor lead the charge during the final games. Though Mount Notre Dame's standout players, Rachel Adams and Abbie Rees, rallied teammates for wins in the first and third sets, the Cougars couldn't hold on for a repeat of their 2006 success in winning the State championship. 
   Mercy avenged last year's championship loss with a 15-11 victory in the last minutes to finish a great season for Mercy and Coach Denise Harvey, as well as Mercy's fourth volleyball State title in program history. 
   In the interest of full disclosure, Mother of Mercy is near and dear to my heart because my wife, Donna, and my daughter, Erica, and my sister, Carol, are all Mother of Mercy graduates. 
   A third Cincinnati area high school, the St. Ursula Academy Bulldogs, have become a mainstay in the State soccer tournament, advancing to their third finals in 7 years. Down 1-0 at the half, St. Ursula rallied with goals by Tori Huster and Alexandra Berry to beat Strongsville 2-1. St. Ursula finished with a remarkable 20-1-2 record and a third State championship, the other two coming back in 1991 and 1993. 
   And, finally, I have the honor of congratulating St. Xavier High School for its second Ohio High School Division I State Football Championship in the last 3 years. On its way to a perfect 15-0 record, St. Xavier had probably the toughest schedule in the entire Nation, beating State champions from Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and national powerhouse DeMatha from locally here in Maryland. St. X also had the distinction of being the number one ranked team in the State the entire year and number one in the Nation in some polls. 
   St. Xavier's victory gave the district that I have the honor to represent its fifth division I State football title in the last 6 years, five out of the last 6 years, including Elder High School, who won it twice. I have two nephews, Joe Del Prince, who graduated last year, scored a number of touchdowns on the team last year, and his brother, my nephew, Mike Del Prince, who scored a touchdown against St. X. Unfortunately, when he scored that touchdown, he was hit pretty hard; and I ended up seeing him in the hospital a couple days later. But he's doing well, and he'll be great as a senior next year. And my brother, Ron, also is an Elder grad, played first singles tennis there some years ago, was on student council, and that kind of gave me my interest in politics, seeing my brother Ron succeed in that respect. 
   But this also, this victory by St. X was their 38th State title in all sports, the most of any high school in the State. St. X was led by a senior class that compiled a record of 40 wins and two losses in their 4 years at the school, including Fred Craig, the Ohio defensive player of the Year, and Danny Milligan, the Ohio co-offensive player of the year, and running back Darius Ashley, who set a division I record by rushing for 271 yards and two touchdowns in the championship game. Just incredible. 
   Kudos to head coach Steve Specht and the entire coaching staff for their tremendous accomplishments. Congratulations, St. X. And, again, in the interest of full disclosure, our son, Randy, is a senior at St. X and one of their great band field commanders under the leadership of Anthony Palm. 
   All of these student athletes have learned invaluable lessons about commitment, teamwork and perseverance that will serve each of them well as they prepare for the future. Both on and off the field they have helped further the tradition of excellence at their schools for which all of Cincinnati can be proud. It is an honor for me to congratulate these young men and women on the floor of the United States House of Representatives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. One of the most cherished protections in our democracy is the ability to vote freely and anonymously and without fear of retribution. The bill before us today would take this right from American workers when deciding whether or not to bargain collectively and open the doors to fear and intimidation and coercion. 
   The underlying bill would hit small businesses particularly hard because they operate in smaller environments. Card checks could cause serious management problems in these smaller environments, because each employee could know how every other employee voted, the results of which could be seriously disruptive for the small business. 
   This bill would also mandate compulsory, binding arbitration between the employer and the employee, where all decisions would be made through a third party government official. In essence, this means that the fate of a small business owner, the one who has built a company through years of hard work, the one who may have placed every penny earned back into the business, and the one who employs families, friends and neighbors and who contributes to the local economy, in the hands of organized labor and bureaucrats in Washington. Is that fair? No.  
   I submitted an amendment to the Rules Committee that would have exempted small businesses and protected small business employees from this ill-conceived legislation. Unfortunately, the majority blocked consideration of it on the floor today. They seem intent on limiting debate on this bill, and with a bill this bad, that is understandable. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill sacrifices the right of American workers to freely determine their future on the altar of big labor, and it dares small businesses to survive after having the rug of independent elections pulled out from under them. 
   This is a bad bill, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. It is a very dangerous bill.

   This day also enables us to recognize and thank those victims assistance organizations, like Parents of Murdered Children, that happen to be headquartered in my district in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the National Center for Victims of Crime, that provide ongoing support to the surviving families. The strength, comfort, and compassion that these organizations provide to families and friends of murder victims is immeasurable and should not go unrecognized.

   This bill simply, as the chairwoman indicated, extends all the programs, including pilot programs, the authorities or provisions of the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act as they are presently constituted until July 31 of this year. The programs and authorities of the Small Business Administration expired on February 2. We would have preferred a longer extension, but the other body insisted on a shorter extension date of July 31. 
   Passage of this bill will hopefully give the Small Business Committees in both the House and the Senate the time necessary to work in a bipartisan manner on a more comprehensive SBA reauthorization bill. 
   Many of the programs of the SBA do not operate under a direct appropriation. This legislation will reaffirm their legality to operate, including the Advisory Committee on Veterans Business Affairs. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is quite simple. It contains the exact same language, with only the date changed, that passed the House last month by an overwhelming vote of 413-2. 
   Again, I look forward to working in a bipartisan manner with Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez and other committee members to produce a good, fiscally responsible SBA reauthorization bill that can eventually be signed into law by the President. I especially want to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for her graciousness in agreeing to bring up this bill in such a quick manner.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today, Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the request to suspend the rules and pass House Resolution 921, which agrees to the Senate amendment to H.R. 4253, the Military Reservist and Veterans Small Business Reauthorization Opportunity Act of 2007, subject to an amendment. 
   I would like to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for working in a cooperative and bipartisan manner to bring this resolution to the floor, which, again, incorporates a number of provisions of a bill authored by Mr. Buchanan from Florida, a freshman member of the Small Business Committee. 
   The provisions of this resolution are substantially similar to those contained in H.R. 4253 passed by the House in the last session. For the sake of brevity, interested parties can refer to the December 5, 2007 Congressional Record for that statement. 
   The resolution makes necessary technical changes to the Senate amendment. The House bill required the establishment of an interagency task force to improve business advice given to veteran-owned small businesses. This resolution restores the requirement that the interagency task force include the advice from veteran service organizations. It makes no sense to try and improve veterans services to veterans without actually consulting them. 
   Reservists have their own set of operational problems, especially if they own a business or are a key employee in a small business. These Reservists are making a sacrifice to the health of their business in order to protect the liberty and freedom of all Americans. The least we can do is provide the small businesses owned by or employing these Reservists sufficient access to advice and capital to enable their businesses to survive during their absence. The resolution before us today does just that. 
   In particular, the resolution ensures that small communities where a Reservist-owned business is a major source of employment will have access to economic injury disaster loan funds from the SBA to pay employees and meet other expenses while the owner is on active duty. Small communities that rely on one employer should not have to suffer because the owner of a business has elected the noble obligation to serve our country in uniform. 
   Finally, the resolution adopts a modified form of the reduction in costs for guaranteed loans made to veterans under SBA's 7(a) loan program. I commend the chairwoman for taking an approach that helps veterans obtain loans without unduly increasing costs to the American taxpayer or other borrowers under the 7(a) loan program. 
   No one can dispute the sacrifice that America's veterans have made and continue to make in defense of our country. While the repayment of that debt may never be fully compensated, we can never fully pay back those that have served this country so honorably in uniform, we can certainly provide them with the needed assistance to prosper in civilian life. Today's resolution will do that. I want to thank the chairwoman again for working to make this possible and thank Mr. Buchanan for his leadership on this issue. 
   I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I would now like to yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, a lead sponsor of the bill, Mr. Jason Altmire, as much time as he may consume.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is really very straightforward. It would add $15 million to the $15 million presently designated for jurisdictions experiencing a high rate of violent and drug trafficking crime involving firearms. My amendment would offset this increase by taking $15 million from a new offender reentry program that the underlying bill appears to authorize. 
   Mr. Chairman, there is no doubt that reentry programs play a critical role in the criminal justice system, ensuring that offenders who are released back into our communities receive the assistance they need to make them productive members of our communities. Indeed, millions of offenders are released back into our communities each year. More often than not, these individuals are released back into society without support, increasing the likelihood of recidivism, jeopardizing the safety of our communities, and ultimately increasing the cost to society. 
   In fiscal year 2006, more than $13 million in Federal funds were awarded to States to assist them with their reentry programs. During that same year, more than $146 million was allocated to the Federal Bureau of Prisons to help community corrections centers across the Nation get inmates who are close to being released the assistance they needed. 
   This Congress, the House is set to consider H.R. 1593, the Second Chance Act of 2007, of which I am an original cosponsor. This legislation would, among other things, reauthorize State and local adult and juvenile reentry programs at a level of $65 million for fiscal year 2008 and 2009. Yet, at the same time we cannot forget the needs of our communities. More must be done to give State and local law enforcement the resources they need to combat the violent crime and gang activity that continues to plague our cities, including my city, Cincinnati, particularly violent crimes committed with firearms. 
   According to the Bureau of Justice statistics, in 2005, 65 percent of all murders, 42 percent of all robberies, and 21 percent of all aggravated assaults that were reported to police were committed with firearms. 
   Moreover, the violent crime associated with gang activity continues to leave residents in our Nation's cities and towns feeling like prisoners in their own homes. In my own city, Cincinnati, crimes committed with firearms, local gang activity, and drug trafficking continue to threaten the well-being of law-abiding citizens. In fact, this past spring the Cincinnati City Council voted to obtain the help of renowned Professor David Kennedy to assist the city in fighting violent crime. 
   Making additional funds available in this jurisdiction and jurisdictions across the country will empower residents of cities and towns to take back their communities and make them a safer place to live and work and raise our families. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CHABOT. We happened to go to the same college, by the way. 
   As far as the committee report, it says that the committee directs that the remaining $15 million will be available to jurisdictions experiencing a high rate of violent and drug trafficking crime involving firearms. And we certainly support that. 
   What we are trying to do is increase that, because we think there should be additional funding because we do believe that gang activity and violence is plaguing a number of communities, including the one that I happen to represent, the city of Cincinnati. And when we looked into the bill, when we called the committee for further clarification about what the other $15 million went toward, we were told that this provision had been inserted in previous Congresses, but that they weren't really sure what, if any, reentry program that they were referring to. 
   So rather than just let the money sit, I propose to give it to those jurisdictions that are falling victim to violent crime and drug traffickers, particularly those that are committed with firearms. And I don't believe that the $15 million, as I said, that is currently in the bill is sufficient. And since this money was available and wasn't designated, to our knowledge, in any particular program, we thought that it would be appropriate to increase the funding so that we could help more cities better fight against gang activity and violence, and particularly when those are involved with firearms.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. I want to once again commend the gentleman for offering his leadership on offering this amendment this year. 
   Mr. Chairman, since 1982, the Forest Service has lost nearly $1 billion subsidizing private timber in the Tongass National Forest. That's a $40 million loss every year. If anyone wonders why our national debt is as large as it is, and it's currently about $8.8 trillion, yes, that's with a ``T,'' trillion, one needs to look knew further than taxpayer boondoggles like this one. They add up. 
   There are thousands of miles of roads in the Tongass. The Forest Service acknowledges that existing roads are ``sufficient to satisfy local demand for roaded recreation, substance, and community connectivity needs and demands in most districts.'' Yet year after year, the Forest Service spends millions of tax dollars building roads for private timber companies that, by the Agency's own admission, aren't really necessary. 
   To make matters worse, the Forest Service has a nationwide road and maintenance backlog of about $10 billion, tens of millions of which are in the Tongass. Incredibly, the Forest Service isn't maintaining existing roads, yet they want to build more, even though they admit that there are already enough. Does that make any sense? Of course not. 
   This is a simple, straightforward amendment. It would simply prohibit  the Forest Service from building logging roads for timber companies subsidized by the American taxpayer in the Tongass. It does not stop timber companies from building their own roads. 
   I know that there are some who want you to believe differently, but this amendment has nothing to do with the roadless rule or interfering with the Tongass land management plan. It is everything to do with good government. 
   Opponents of this amendment will argue that the massive losses in the Tongass are due to litigation. Taxpayer dollars are ending up in the pockets of trial lawyers. I am not usually accused of being a darling of the trial lawyers but they did a study to find out how much of the appeals and litigation cost was a factor. Only 2 percent of cost was because of litigation. 
   Opponents of this amendment have argued many things in the past. The fact is that there are now only 200 jobs, and every single job, as the gentleman from New Jersey mentioned, is costing the taxpayer $200,000 in subsidies for each one of these. It makes absolutely no sense. That's why groups like Citizens Against Government Waste, the National Taxpayers Union are strongly in favor of this amendment, because they know that it makes no sense anymore to have tax dollars going in the amounts that they have been going. We spent almost $1 billion now subsidizing the building of roads in the Tongass. 
   Again, I am not opposed to logging when it's done on the timber company's dime. But in this case, they are using the American taxpayer to subsidize these 200 jobs at the tune of $200,000 per job. That just makes no sense, and that's why I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I want to once again thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership on this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL PLUMBING INDUSTRY WEEK -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New York, the distinguished chairwoman of the Small Business Committee, Ms. Vel&#225;zquez, for bringing this bipartisan measure to the floor recognizing the plumbing industry and supporting the goals and ideals of National Plumbing Industry Week. 
   Like many of our small businesses today, plumbing contractors face difficult times and many difficult issues; a burdensome regulatory system, confiscatory taxation policy at virtually every level of government, rising energy prices, and often the unavailability of affordable health care for their employees and families. Congress can and must help these entrepreneurs, and we will continue to work with the chairwoman and my colleagues on the Small Business Committee to address these obstacles to the success of our Nation's small business plumbing contractors. 
   As Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez has pointed out, the Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors National Association is the oldest trade association in the American construction industry. I congratulate the association for its contributions over the years and encourage the industry to continue its good work, especially in training and mentoring our future industry leaders in that field. 
   I have no doubt that our friends and neighbors in the plumbing industry  will continue to make strides in the design and installation of energy efficient equipment that will carry us through the 21st century. 
   I again want to thank my colleague, Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez, for working in a bipartisan manner on this issue, as we do virtually on every issue in the Small Business Committee. I thank her for bringing this resolution to the floor today. I am happy to join her in supporting it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as Members of this Chamber know, our Nation's small businesses come in all types and a broad range of sizes. Each one makes an important contribution to our society and is an essential part of the great economic engine. In fact, there is no other nation on Earth where a person's dreams of service and innovation can be translated so effectively into the brand of success that yields both wealth and concrete benefits to communities. Entrepreneurs are the reason for this. They are the lifeblood of the U.S. economy. 
   Moving forward, we should remember that these hard-working business people, including those who are part of the plumbing trade, are the reason our Nation has thrived. So in recognizing the men and women of the plumbing industry today, we extend our salute to every small business person across America. 
   We thank plumbers for their invaluable effort and encourage the American spirit of service, progress and business excellence. That is the hallmark of our Nation's small firms, and it is one we should all be proud of. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 5819, the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Programs Reauthorization Act. 
   These two programs are highly successful Federal initiatives designed to encourage economic growth and innovation within the small business community by assisting with the funding that is critical at the startup and developmental stages of a small company. Not only do they spur growth in individual companies, the programs stress the importance of the Small Business Committee's and the entire Federal Government's commitment to expand and diversify research opportunities for small businesses. 
   Created in 1982, the SBIR program offers competition-based awards to stimulate technological innovation among small private sector businesses while providing government agencies with new, cost-effective, technical and scientific solutions to meet their diverse needs. This program is not only critical to the unique needs of each of the participating Federal agencies but also to our national economy. Small businesses renew the U.S. economy by introducing new products and lower cost methods of doing business, sometimes with substantial economic benefits. They play a key role in introducing technologies to the market, often responding quickly to new market opportunities. Some of our Nation's greatest technological innovations were originated by small business owners tinkering in their workshops, including two very famous Ohioans, the Wright brothers. 
   Our committee worked very hard to produce the legislation we have before us today. We held several hearings on  this topic over the last few months inviting the Small Business Administration, SBIR and STTR program managers from Federal agencies, various small businesses, and academics to discuss this program's successes and consider amendments that would improve it. I am happy to say that a great many of the ideas presented to the committee have found their way into this legislation. 
   For example, the bill requires agencies with an annual SBIR program of $50 million or more a year to create an SBIR advisory board to review the program quarterly and recommend improvements. We found throughout the course of our work that there is simply not enough hard evidence available to effectively measure the success or failure of the programs. Several of our witnesses touched on this subject, and the National Academy of Sciences mentioned it in its congressionally mandated study of the SBIR program. 
   The bill also states that agencies required to have an SBIR advisory board must complete an evaluation of the competitive SBIR proposals within specific time frames. This is important to ensure that potential awardees are reviewed promptly and effectively. Given the complexity and time-consuming nature of awarding an SBIR grant award application, it can be very difficult to plan your business' future without knowing its fate for months at a time. 
   The legislation also increases the size of maximum awards to allow grant winners greater ability to develop their new technologies and provides agencies even greater flexibility to administer the programs. The award levels have not been raised or adjusted for inflation in 16 years. Several of our witnesses commented that the levels, particularly for phase I, offer very little wiggle room. 
   Additionally, I believe this legislation finds an appropriate balance on the issues of venture capital companies' funding of SBIR participants. I would like to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves) for all of his hard work on this issue. Mr. Graves has been a champion on this matter for years and has consistently worked to find a solution that balances funding the best science with maintaining the integrity of the program's goals of helping small businesses. I understand Mr. Graves will be offering a perfecting amendment during this proceeding that effectively strikes this balance, and I would urge Members on both sides of this aisle to support the amendment. 
   I would also like to thank the gentlelady from New York and chairwoman of our committee, Ms. Vel&#225;zquez, and her staff for working in such a strong bipartisan manner with me and other members of our committee and with our staff on this legislation. But this is nothing new. The gentlelady has consistently sought my input and Republican members on the committee's input on various bills that we reported out of the committee and how they should be crafted. Although we may not always agree on every issue or there may be philosophical undertones, the spirit of working together in an effort to produce legislation that truly helps American small businesses always prevails, and I congratulate and commend the gentlelady for doing that. 
   Again, I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Obviously we are still waiting for Mr. Young to speak. If he gets here, he gets here; if he doesn't, he doesn't. 
   I would like to, first of all, again commend the gentlewoman from New York for her cooperation and once again putting together a bipartisan effort here. And we both agree that both of these programs should be continued and have great value; so I would encourage my colleagues to support it. 
   Without Mr. Young's being here and not having spoken to him ahead of time and knowing exactly what he wanted to talk about, I would guess what he wanted to talk about had to do with the fact that energy is a huge problem in this country and some of it is because we have handcuffed ourselves and we are far too reliant upon foreign sources of energy from the Middle East, from some of the most unstable parts of the world, from Nigeria, from Venezuela. And for that reason, we're seeing gas prices at all-time highs, approximately $3.50 per gallon, and it's hurting an awful lot of our constituents, my constituents in Cincinnati and other members of the driving public all over this country. And one of the principal reasons is we are too reliant upon foreign sources of energy. We also haven't built an oil refinery.

   Mr. CHABOT. Reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for interposing his points of view. 
   But as I was saying, Madam Chairman, I think one of the principal reasons we are seeing these high energy prices is because we are far too reliant upon foreign sources of energy. We have put off-limits an area which is in Mr. Young's State, in Alaska, ANWR. It's an area that not many people go to, although the photographs that you see of it make it look like it's nothing but flowers and animals and that it's a very lovely area, and I'm sure it is lovely in certain parts of the year. But the bottom line is by putting that 16 to 18 billion barrels of oil off-limits, we have to buy more oil from other countries, and that's one of the things that drives up the cost. 
   Another part of considerable oil reserves that we have put off-limits is in the Outer Continental Shelf. Now compared to 16 to 18 billion barrels of oil in ANWR, we have, we think, 83 to 86 billion barrels of oil and huge amounts of natural gas. And as long as we put those areas off-limits, it means we have to buy oil from somewhere else. It puts OPEC in a position where they can turn the spigot down somewhat or not increase it to take care of not only our needs but the needs of a growing environment in India and in China and those areas; so the price goes up as a result of that. 
   The other problem is we haven't built an oil refinery in this country since 1976. We make it virtually impossible for that to happen. We had over 300 oil refineries 30 years ago. We're down to 148, so fewer than half the number of oil refineries. That's another big problem. And I think those are the types of problems that Mr. Young would have in all likelihood spoken about. 
   Madam Chairman, I see that Mr. Young has entered, so I will at this point yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).

   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Chairman, the gentleman from Alaska comes here and laments about high energy prices. But when he had a chance to vote against price gouging, he voted ``no.'' When he had a chance to vote about long-term alternative energy and conservation, he voted ``no.'' So don't come to the floor and tell us the need to deal with the energy crisis in this Nation, because I can tell you that talk is fine. But when it comes to real solutions, you vote ``no.'' 
   So, Madam Chairman, let's go to the issue at hand. It's just really sad that the minority decided to make SBIR and STTR an innocent bystander on this debate. Let me say that there is no other nation on Earth where a person's dreams of service and innovation can be translated so effectively into a brand of success that yields both wealth and concrete benefits to society. That distinctly American tradition of entrepreneurship, of cutting edge and ideas and service to society, is what Small Business Week is all about. It is also the core of H.R. 5819. 
   I want to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall, Mr. Wu and Mr. Ehlers from the Science and Technology Committee, as well as my own ranking member, Mr. Chabot, for their work on this important legislation. I am particularly grateful for Mr. Chabot's input on this legislation, and I think that our collaboration has produced a better product for our Nation's small businesses. 
   I also want to recognize the staff members on both committees for their tireless work. A special thank you goes to Bill Maguire on Small Business Committee Democratic staff; Michael Day, and to Joe Hartz on Mr. Chabot's side of the aisle, and Kevin Fitzpatrick. I also would like to acknowledge Melissa Shannon from the Speaker's office. On the Science and Technology Committee I would like to recognize the Democratic staff, Mike Quear; from Mr. Wu's staff, Dennis Worden; and from Mr. Graves' personal office, Paul Sass. 
   Most of all, I would like to thank the men and women of America's small business. It is their efforts that continue to make our Nation great. They keep us moving forward, no matter what challenges arise, and they deserve our support and respect. 
   Once again, I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating Small Business Week by voting ``yes'' on this important legislation.

   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves). This is a good amendment that I feel strikes the appropriate balance on the issue of venture capital companies' funding of SBIR participants. 
   One of the guiding principles that we focused on as we worked on the legislation was the premise that we ought to be funding the best science. By allowing the amounts of venture capital investment in SBIR applicants that are prescribed by this amendment, we are not only ensuring that we are funding the best science, but also maintaining the program's goal of helping small businesses. 
   The gentleman from Missouri has been a leader on this issue for years, and I applaud his efforts on our committee and throughout the House to find a solution for this issue. And it is a balance here. You can make arguments on both sides, but I think what he has tried to do is to do something that is fair to small businesses and also have the best science.

   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill we are considering today. 
   This week marks a critical point in our Nation's history for a number of reasons, but none more important than redefining the appropriate role for government in our market system. 
   There is no doubt that we must stabilize our financial markets as quickly as possible. But, in my view, asking cash-strapped Americans to pay more than $700 billion to bail out an industry, some of whom were reckless, is just wrong and sets a dangerous precedent. 
   We need a targeted approach to respond to this crisis. One that provides those troubled institutions with the capital they need to start lending again. Yet, we also need standards in place to hold these institutions accountable to prevent this crisis from repeating itself in the future. 
   H.R. 1424 sets government on a new and dangerous course. Gone are the days of personal responsibility. Gone are the days where executives are held responsible for bad decisions. Gone are the days when the market determines success or failure. After today, taxpayers will be responsible for everyone's decision. 
   Equally disturbing, in my view, is the fact that this legislation makes no substantive reforms to prevent a repeat of what caused this financial meltdown in the first place. Last fall, the House passed, with my full support, H.R. 3915, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act. This would have been an important step towards bringing more restraint and oversight to the lending industry. Unfortunately the Senate took no action so it never became law. Are those important reforms in this bill? No.  
   We have a duty to the hardworking families who act responsibly on a daily basis to be prudent with their tax dollars. I remain unconvinced that the bill we are considering today fulfills this obligation. That's why I'll be voting no.

   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise as one of the founding members of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, and I also want to thank the gentlelady from Nevada, SHELLEY BERKLEY, for her leadership in that capacity as well, as well as our colleagues ROBERT WEXLER and DANA ROHRABACHER who are the other founding members. 
   I most recently traveled to Taiwan this last January, the week prior to the Legislative Yuan Elections, and I rise in support of House Resolution 278, a resolution recognizing Taiwan's fourth direct democratic presidential election to be conducted later this month. This resolution sends the right message at the right time. 
   As one of the very few democracies in Asia, Taiwan should be recognized for its courage and commitment to allow its citizens to choose its future. It is a democracy that maintains a multi-party political system, and one that recognizes and respects individual liberty and human rights. 
   Just across the Taiwan Strait is the People's Republic of China. It most certainly is not a democracy. It maintains an abysmal human rights record. It does not recognize the rule of law. It practices religious persecution. It warehouses political prisoners. It carries out a coercive abortion policy. And it has more than 800 missiles pointed directly at Taiwan. It is against this backdrop that Taiwan forges on with its elections. 
   I am disappointed that the stronger language contained in the introduced version of the bill, which referenced the acts of intimidation and pressure by China, were eliminated. It is better to speak the truth rather than to worry about offending China's sensitivities. Intimidation, pressure, and outright bullying will not go away by ignoring it or by being silent about it. 
   Notwithstanding this concern, I am supportive of the resolution, and I would urge its passage today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 951, a resolution condemning the ongoing Palestinian rocket attacks on the people of Israel. 
   When Israel withdrew from Gaza back in 2005, there was hope that this was an opportunity for peace. Sadly, this has not been the case. Instead, Hamas and other terrorist groups, with the support of Iran and Syria, have fired more than 4,000 rockets and mortar shells into Israel from Gaza, killing, maiming, and traumatizing innocent Israeli civilians. This unprovoked disregard for human life must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. 
   I support passage of this resolution, H. Res. 951, and urge my colleagues to do so as it supports the sovereign right of Israel to defend its territory and stop the rocket attacks on its citizens. It further calls on all nations, including Egypt, to take affirmative steps to stop the flow of rockets and other materials and equipment used by terrorists into Gaza and other Palestinian territories. Finally, it reaffirms the strong and unyielding friendship between the governments and the people of Israel and the United States.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT EXPANSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 3567, the Small Business Investment Expansion Act of 2007. Risk-taking and entrepreneurship have been part of the American fabric since this country's founding, whether it was emigres from France founding a munitions company in the early years that would later become DuPont or an immigrant peddler who would go on to create Lazarus stores in my district, Cincinnati, now Macy's, or two Dayton, Ohio bicycle mechanics who invented the airplane. The rise of America is replete with stories of entrepreneurs taking risks to change the economy and ultimately the world. 
   Recent history continues that trend. The most powerful computer software company in the world, Microsoft, was created by two college dropouts working out of a Seattle garage. Steven Jobs was tinkering in his garage when he developed the computer that would lead to the creation of the Apple. Fred Smith created Federal Express based on a paper written for an undergraduate class at Yale. All of these entrepreneurs succeeded because they had an idea and were able to raise the money they needed to perfect and market that idea. 
   Yet, America has changed. Investors, venture capitalists, hedge funds, and private equity firms use sophisticated global investment strategies to maximize their returns. The budding entrepreneur with a great idea today might get lost in the search by investors for a company with a significant business history and record of returns. To maintain America as the leader of innovative entrepreneurial firms, we must ensure economic and fiscal policy that provides capital to entrepreneurs. 
   There is little doubt that efforts of Congress, when Republicans controlled it, to adopt tax policies that spurred investment and growth provided significant incentives to invest in businesses. That is why I would very much like to see those tax policies ultimately made permanent, so we don't go back and raise taxes. But the Committee on Small Business has heard that the market does not provide adequate equity funding to the smallest of startup businesses, including those that will become the next Dell Computer, Nike, Outback Steakhouse or Callaway Golf Clubs. H.R. 3567 takes, in my view, a balanced approach to ensure that these new businesses have access to capital. It balances the need for limited Federal funding with fiscal restraint and protects the Federal taxpayers. 
   Now, during the markup of this bill, I did voice strong objections to title V as it was introduced. There are five titles in this particular piece of legislation. Since markup of the legislation, however, to the credit of the gentlewoman from New York, Nydia Velazquez, we worked together and we negotiated in good faith and reached a bipartisan agreement to address the concerns that we voiced. I believe that the compromise that we reached adequately addresses my concern. I want to again compliment the chairwoman for her leadership in that effort. It eliminates some of the more egregious decisions of the SBA concerning venture capital investment in small businesses while maintaining the integrity of the Federal procurement process for small business by preventing conglomerations of venture-owned firms to bid as small businesses. 
   Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would again like to thank the chairwoman for working in a bipartisan manner on this bill. I would also like to thank her staff, particularly Michael Day and Adam Minehardt, for their work on this important piece of legislation. I also want to thank Barry and Kevin Fitzpatrick for their help, as well, on this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Altmire). He is the chairman of the Small Business Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight and the leading sponsor of this bill.

   Without further ado, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I just would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff that worked on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I won't use the full 5 minutes. 
   I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As I have already explained when discussing the underlying bill, this amendment adopts a bright-line test for determining whether a business that receives funding from a venture capital company is considered affiliated with that firm and any other firms that the venture capital company may own. 
   The test is simple and sensible and I think easily applied. In my view, it strikes the correct balance between allowing needed venture capital funding for small businesses, while protecting against the possibility that venture capital firms will be able to create conglomerates that would have an unfair competitive advantage against independently owned and operated small businesses. As the chairwoman already mentioned, so I won't go into great detail, the venture capital company can't have more than 50 percent. 
   As a result, I believe that this amendment alleviates many of the concerns that the Small Business Administration has, although maybe not all, with title V. I ask that Members support the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, while not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition.

   As he mentioned, the Small Business Committee, I think, has been a model in many ways for the entire Congress in the way a committee can work together. We have philosophical disagreements at times. We work together, and we are not going to agree on everything, but, in general, we try to work things out for the benefit of the small business community. 
   There are Republicans, there are Democrats, there are independents that benefit from the small business community thriving in this country. I think we are trying to work altogether to make it a healthier situation. I wish all committees around here were able to do the same thing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I stand with my colleagues today to honor the memory of Paul Gillmor. He was really a great guy. He actually ran the first time in 1988 for this esteemed institution, for the Congress, the same year I first ran. He won and I didn't. But in 1994 I did get to join him here. 
   He was one of the guys that, as other Members have said, he was just an all around good guy. He really was. You liked to talk to him. For some reason, he used to call me Mr. Steve; I don't know why he did that. So I started calling him Mr. Paul, and that is the way we referred to each other. 
   Yesterday evening after we had our votes, we had all come back into town from the August recess and we were asking each other what did you do over the break, what happened. He was telling me how he had stayed pretty close to home. He had worked with his constituents, been with his family for some time, and he wanted to know what I had done. I said I had done some of those same things, and that I had also had an opportunity to go to Darfur where there is probably one of the greatest human tragedies that we have seen on Earth in a number of years, and he was very interested and wanted to know what we can do to help the people in Darfur. So we spent a period of time discussing that right outside those doors just last evening. I was just shocked when I learned that Paul had passed away suddenly so recently. 
   He was somebody that really I think made a difference in this institution. As has been mentioned, he loved his Buckeyes. He would talk about what they had done and how the game had been played and how he couldn't wait to go to the next game. And he loved our State of Ohio. He loved the people that he represented. And most especially, he loved his family. 
   We are all going to miss Paul Gillmor, and we wish the best to his wife, Karen, and his five children. God bless you, Paul.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (ADDITIONAL TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this particular legislation, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The bill is very simple, Madam Speaker. It extends the authorization of all programs authorized by the Small Business Act, the Small Business Investment Act, and any program operated by the Small Business Administration for which Congress has already appropriated funds. This extension will last until March 20, 2009.  
   The extension is necessary because authorization for various programs operated by the Small Business Administration ceases on May 23, 2008, so in just a couple of days. 
   Working in a bipartisan effort with Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez, as she always does, she's reached out many occasions to work in a bipartisan fashion in the committee. The committee has ordered 15 bills to be reported out of the committee, all of which have passed this body, the House of Representatives. 
   The most recent action taken by the House was the recent passage of legislation to extend the Small Business Innovation Research Program. With the passage of this bill, the House has finished all the necessary work to reauthorize all of the programs overseen by the Small Business Administration. 
   Even though the House finished its deliberations, we operate in a bicameral legislative system, of course, and time is needed for the legislative process to run its course and enable the two bodies to resolve any disagreements on the best way to move the Small Business Administration forward and helping America's entrepreneurs. That work simply cannot be completed by this Friday, and given the upcoming legislative work on appropriations matters, it remains unclear when the two bodies will be able to commence deliberations to iron out their differences. 
   As a result of the need for following regular order and ensuring due deliberation of important issues to the American economy, I would urge my colleagues to suspend the rules and pass S. 3029. 
   However, there are additional items that I believe this House should address when it comes to small business. We're looking at access to capital in the Small Business Administration, and that is one of the areas that small businesses all around the country struggle it, with, access to capital. 
   Taxes is another big issue, and that's why I believe that the tax cuts that we pass should be made permanent because many of the people who would benefit from those, that tax relief are small business owners, and they hire about 70 percent of the new workers in this country. So I believe we should make those tax cuts permanent. 
   Regulatory reform needs to happen. Small businesses continue to be overregulated, as many parts of our economy are. Health care is important. That's why we believe that Association Health Plans should pass. We ought to make sure that businesses are able to provide health care for their employees. 
   But there's one area that this Congress, I believe, has been woefully remiss in not addressing, and that's the area of energy, the fact that whether it's natural gas to heat our homes in the wintertime, or whether it's filling up one's gas tank at all-time record highs of almost $4 a gallon, it's absolutely unconscionable that Congress has not acted in a responsible manner and a bipartisan manner to actually do something to bring those gas prices down. Why are we seeing these gas prices at all time highs? 
   Well, we are far too reliant upon foreign sources of energy. Is there anything we can do about this? Absolutely. 
   I've been in Congress for 14 years, and I've voted 11 times to allow us to explore and drill and go after energy up in Alaska, in ANWR, where we believe we have up to 16 billion barrels of oil which is being kept off-limits. 
   So we're essentially handcuffing ourselves and saying, you can't go up there at all, even though most Alaskans are all for it. They believe that we should be able to go up there, as do most of their representatives, as do an awful lot of Members of this House. And we had the votes in previous Congresses to pass that here in the House. As I say, I voted for it 11 times. But we didn't have the votes over in the Senate. 
   But I just think it's absolutely outrageous that we've kept 16 billion barrels of oil off-limits. And that's only the start. We've also kept the entire Outer Continental Shelf off-limits. We think we have 86 billion barrels of oil there, and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas to heat our homes in the wintertime, which we've kept off-limits. 
   Now, we're not going to go after it, but Cuba has entered into an agreement with China to go after this oil out there that we ought to be getting. And so they're going to take advantage of it and we're not. And that's one of the main reasons that we see these high gas prices out there, because we have to buy the oil from somewhere, so we continue to buy it from some of the most unstable parts of the world, like the OPEC countries especially in the Middle East. 
   We're also buying oil from Venezuela. Hugo Chavez is down there, really a bitter enemy of the United States, yet we're forced to buy his oil. We buy oil from Mexico and Canada, Nigeria and other countries around the world as well. But we ought not to allow ourselves to be so dependent on foreign sources of energy. 
   We ought to go after those areas that we have control over, that we don't have to ask anybody's permission. But this Congress has kept that oil off-limits, and that's one of the main reasons we see prices as high as they are right now. 
   In addition, if we had the crude oil here, which we don't, but if we had it, we can't refine it quickly enough to be able to put it into our cars. Why? Because we don't have enough oil refineries in this country. 
   Back 30 years ago, which is the last time, more than 30 years, 32 years ago is the last time we built an oil refinery in this country. The regulations now make it virtually impossible to build an oil refinery. So we ought to change those regulations. We ought to make sure that we do it, you still build these refineries in an environmentally safe manner, just as we go after the oil in ANWR and the Outer Continental Shelf in an environmentally safe and friendly manner. But those are the types of things that we need to do. But because we take no action in those areas, we haven't built an oil refinery in this country in over 30 years. 
   We've put nuclear off-limits, no more nuclear power plants about 20 years ago. France can produce 75 percent of their electricity, completely, safely. But we can't do that in the United States? I don't think so. I think that's just a very bad policy that we enacted about 20 years ago, making it impossible to build nuclear power plants. We need to change that. 
   Finally, we need as well to make sure that we have sufficient dollars going into research so that we can go after the cutting edge types of energies that are going to power us in the future, solar, wind, biomass, hydrogen fuel cells that we may be able to power our cars by in the future. 
   But most of these things, for the most part, are in the future. Yes, we do have wind now. But we're talking about less than 1 percent of the power in this country. So we have to have energy going in; we have to have sufficient dollars going into those technologies of the future. 
   But the bottom line is that at this time oil is one of the principal ways that we power our automobiles and other important things in this country. And when we put that stuff off-limits and we continue to buy it from foreign sources, we're going to continue to see these high prices. And that's just wrong. 
   The American people are suffering right now. We should have taken this action a long time ago. But since we didn't, we need to do it immediately. And that's what really bugs me when I hear people talk about, well, even if we opened up ANWR now, we're not going to have that oil for years. Well, that's why we should have opened up ANWR a long time ago. But we can't go back and undo what was, we can't go back and do what we didn't do back then, but if we passed it now, a lot of the price at the gas pump is reflected in speculators, what they think oil is going to be like in the future. If we opened up ANWR, I think you'd see an immediate effect on the prices at the pump that we would pay. 
   People are sick and tired of the high prices we're paying. It's time that Congress act, and we ought to act sooner rather than later. 
   I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, if the ranking member is prepared to close.

   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to join with my fellow Buckeye, Congresswoman Schmidt. I think we should take this moment to commemorate the passing of Donald Clancy. 
   Mr. Speaker, Donald Clancy very honorably represented what was then the Second District, which is now essentially the First District that I represent. He actually lived in Jean Schmidt's district as well. 
   This was truly a great man. I will not repeat all the details that the gentlewoman said, but he grew up basically on the West Side of Cincinnati and went to a rival high school. He went to Elder, I went to LaSalle. We went to rival law schools, both in Cincinnati, and both served on City Council. 
   He was elected in 1960, but was defeated in 1976 by Tom Luken. Tom was obviously a Democrat. These were Tom's comments about Donald Clancy: ``He was a formidable opponent and well-regarded. People often asked what your relations really are with your opponents. I've never had a cross word with Don Clancy, because he was a good guy and a good friend. Clance served the district and the city very well. He was respected. I'd say he was loved by his constituents on the West side and throughout the city.'' 
   This was truly someone I believe who will be remembered. He served both on the Ways and Means Committee and he served on the Armed Services Committee. 
   His wife, Betty, his daughters, Patty and Kathy, and son, Dan, and three grand children I know are going to miss him, and we should keep them in our hearts and in our prayers. 
   His political legacy will be carried on I believe by his daughter Patty, who is in the State senate now. I would ask our colleagues, there are still some here that served with him, if you wouldn't mind dropping a note to the family, I am sure they would greatly appreciate it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for bringing this up.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank him and the folks on the other side of the aisle for their leadership in this area. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1700, the COPS Improvements Act of 2007. 
   The COPS grant program represents a true partnership between the Federal Government and State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to fight crime. This partnership has enabled more police officers to be hired and rehired and facilitated the use of the most advanced crime-fighting technology to ensure that officers are effectively deployed into our communities all across the country. 
   As a result of our joint efforts, the number of violent offenses reported in our country is down from the more than 1.8 million reported back in 1994 to 1.3 million reported in 2005. But we cannot become complacent. We must ensure that State, local, and tribal law enforcement officials have the resources they need to keep law enforcement on the streets. 
   H.R. 1700 accomplishes this by increasing the funds available for the COPS program from $1 billion to $1.15 billion and by creating a number of new grant programs that will assist communities, such as community policing, crime prevention programs, and programs to address illegal drug manufacturing. 
   Most importantly, the bill that we are considering today stays true to the COPS grant program's original purpose, that the Federal Government support State, local, and tribal law enforcement efforts, not supplant them, as the ranking member indicated. That would be the last thing that we should do. H.R. 1700, in its current form, requires that States, local, and tribal law enforcement demonstrate their commitment to the partnership by making a good-faith effort to match the funds provided by the Federal Government. Yet at the same time, the bill allows the Federal Government to play a primary role in those circumstances in which a grant recipient cannot meet their financial obligation for reasons beyond their control, thus ensuring that our communities remain safe and that crime does not prevail. 
   H.R. 1700 is an important and necessary tool for law enforcement, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1468, the Disadvantaged Business Disaster Eligibility Act. This legislation, as the chairwoman indicated, would simply extend for 18 months the period of time that 8(a) Small Business Development Program participants who enrolled in the program prior to August 29 of 2005 could stay in the program by 18 months if they had their businesses primarily located in the area devastated by Hurricane Katrina. 
   The 8(a) Small Business Development Program, administered by the Small Business Administration, provides a useful mechanism for aspiring entrepreneurs and existing small business owners who, for social or economic reasons, may not have the same opportunities other small business owners have had and face challenging barriers to their success. 
   Entrepreneurs who participate in the 8(a) program undergo an extensive 9-year process, where they obtain specialized business training, counseling, marketing assistance, and high-level executive development. They also receive additional help in the form of low-interest loans, access to government surplus office equipment, and bonding assistance. 
   The Small Business Development Program provides many of the tools needed for any small business to succeed. Most significantly, the program assists these entrepreneurs in obtaining Federal Government contracts as a base from which to grow their businesses. Given the devastation to the gulf coast region by Hurricane Katrina, access to Federal Government contracts constitutes an important component of the region's rebirth, and I think we all agree that we all want to see the rebirth in that area occur. 
   Tragically, as every American remembers, the late summer of 2005 proved to be one of the most catastrophic in American history. The 9.7 million Americans residing on the gulf coast of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi were victims of an unprecedented natural disaster, which, unfortunately, has become a nightmare that is etched in all our memories and a daily challenge for those who lived through it. 
   The storms of 2005 drowned 80 percent of New Orleans in seawater, killed in excess of 1,600 people, destroyed more than 200,000 gulf coast homes, and displaced more than 1 million of our fellow Americans. Starting a new business is challenging under normal circumstances. Only two-thirds of them make it through their first 2 years. And needless to say, the devastation along the gulf coast compounds this difficulty exponentially. 
   This legislation provides some additional time for those businesses facing the 9-year participation deadline provided for in the 8(a) program to get back on their feet. Nothing in the Small Business Act currently allows for an extension of participation as a result of extraordinary circumstances such as those created by Hurricane Katrina. 
   For business owners that may not have had access to their businesses or their customers for months, the rigidity of the Small Business Act seems unduly harsh. An additional 18 months of assistance to firms who face an uphill battle before the storms hit who are now hanging on by a thread after the storms have passed is truly the least that we can do. 
   Today I encourage my colleagues to support this necessary legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and to the underlying bill before us. Last August, Congress passed and the President signed into law a bill that provides our law enforcement and intelligence community with the tools needed to protect this country, to protect the United States. 
   The events of September 11, 2001, exposed gaps in our intelligence-gathering activities, particularly those occurring outside the United States. Since that tragic day, the administration has worked with Congress to ensure that every tool in our arsenal is available to those who are charged with keeping our country safe, including working with telecommunications companies and allowing officials to gather intelligence from potential foreign terrorists outside this country. 
   These two aspects of the PAA have been critical in protecting the United States from actual or potential terrorist attacks or sabotage. Oversight by the FISA Court and minimization procedures approved by the courts ensure that such activities do not go beyond their scope. 
   Last night, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation that would maintain these critical features enabling the intelligence and law enforcement communities to continue with its critical work. 
   I urge my colleagues to defeat this rule and immediately take up and pass the Senate bill so that law enforcement and the intelligence communities continue to have the necessary tools to keep the American people safe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support and strongly urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 289 which recognizes the 99th anniversary of the NAACP. For almost a century, the NAACP has fought to bring justice and racial equality to this Nation. It is appropriate that we review that history. 
   In 1917, the NAACP won a major legal victory in the Supreme Court which held that States could no longer restrict and officially segregate African Americans into particular residential districts. The same year, the NAACP fought for the right of black Americans to be commissioned as military officers during World War I. 
   In 1920, the NAACP held its annual conference in Atlanta, Georgia, which at the time was one of the most active areas for the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, the NAACP showed the world it would not be intimidated by racial violence. 
   In 1935, NAACP lawyers Charles Houston and Thurgood Marshall won a major legal battle to admit students to the University of Maryland. 
   During World War II, the NAACP led the effort that resulted in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's ordering a  nondiscrimination policy in war-related industries and Federal employment. 
   And in 1948, the NAACP convinced President Harry Truman to sign an executive order banning discrimination by the Federal Government. 
   In 1954, under the leadership of Special Counsel Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP won one of its greatest legal victories in Brown v. Board of Education. 
   In 1960 in Greensboro, North Carolina, members of the NAACP Youth Council launched a series of nonviolent sit-ins at segregated lunch counters. 
   The history of America's modern struggle to live up to our constitutional principles was written in large part by the NAACP. And it continues to champion the cause of social justice today for all Americans. 
   The NAACP has served as the voice of those who were muzzled by fear. It served as the voice of those who were handcuffed and jailed under segregationist policies. And it carried the weight for those whose backs were nearly broken in brutal beatings fueled by racial hatred. It did so peacefully and with dignity. And as a result, America is a better place. 
   I am pleased to join my colleagues on this concurrent resolution honoring the historic contributions made by the NAACP to the cause of civil rights in this Nation. And I would like to conclude by acknowledging and recognizing and honoring the leadership of a gentleman in my district, Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, who marched with Dr. Martin Luther King but who has been ill recently. He has been a leader in our community and really across the entire country in the civil rights movement, and we all keep him in our prayers and hope that he recovers quickly. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this sham, no-energy energy bill, and want to express my deep disappointment that once again, this House is missing an important opportunity to lower gas prices, and make our Nation more energy independent. 
   After reviewing this bill, it's clear that the majority never really intended to open the Outer Continental Shelf to energy exploration. Instead, this bill would permanently keep off-limits 88 percent of our offshore oil and natural gas reserves. 
   Let me tell you some of the other failings of this bill. It fails to open up more of the energy rich Gulf of Mexico. It fails to make building refineries any easier. It fails to promote nuclear energy. It fails to boost oil shale development, and it fails to open the billions of barrels of oil now off limits in ANWR. 
   What this bill will do is raise taxes that will surely be passed along to consumers in even higher prices at the pump. 
   Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, recently said it best. This bill is ``dead on arrival in the Senate.'' 
   The bottom line is, this bill is a publicity stunt, and the American people deserve better.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chairman, the section 8 program is a program I believe is in serious need of fundamental reforms, not more money. 
   Two weeks ago, the House debated H.R. 1851, the so-called Section 8 Voucher Reform Act. But rather than making the program more effective for the individuals who use it and more accountable to the taxpayers who fund it, the bill will create 100,000 more vouchers at a cost of $2.4 billion over the next 5 years. 
   I offered several amendments to strengthen the bill and bring about some much-needed responsibility to the program, to add, for example, work requirements and time limits and to stop the creation of new vouchers. Unfortunately, those amendments were voted down. And now 2 weeks later, we find ourselves considering a bill that would reward this flawed program by increasing its funding by hundreds of millions of dollars. 
   When we committed ourselves sometime ago to welfare reform, it was with the understanding that the program should no longer be a tax-funded handout but should instead offer people a way out of poverty, helping them obtain job and education skills they needed to become self-sufficient. Ending welfare cycle of dependencies have cut the welfare rolls in half, promoted individual responsibility, and saved billions of tax dollars in the process. Sadly, current housing programs closely resemble the failed welfare policies of the past. 
   Like the old welfare programs, the section 8 housing program discourages work and allows people to stay on the program indefinitely. It is also too often mismanaged by local governments or housing authorities. 
   I represent most of the city of Cincinnati, its western suburbs and few townships in Butler County, Ohio. Too many neighborhoods in my district have had to witness the crime, despair, and hopelessness that are inherent in a government program that asks virtually nothing of the recipients and that encourages dependency rather than responsibility and waste rather than work. 
   Whether it is the funding provided by the Federal Government or mismanagement of the program by local governments and agencies, section 8 has failed those who use it and those who pay for it: the American taxpayers. 
   It is also important to point out that the dependency that section 8 has created is so great that there are long waiting lists to get vouchers. Why? Because too many of those who gain access to the program don't leave. They don't really have an incentive to. The average stay is about 7 years. 
   Madam Chairman, this is a very modest, straightforward amendment. My amendment would simply reduce section 8 vouchers, the funding, by $330 million to bring it in line with the administration's budget request. This bill would spend $16.3 billion on vouchers, asking virtually nothing of its recipients. 
   On behalf of the American taxpayers, I don't think it is asking too much of this Congress to settle for a smaller increase to a program that spends far too much with too little accountability. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, I rise in opposition to this legislation as it is being offered to us today because it does not offer our Nation's small businesses the help that they need to pay for what amounts to a tax increase. Small businesses are the backbone of our Nation's economy. 
   Over the last decade, small businesses have annually created 60 to 80 percent of America's new jobs; 99 percent of all businesses in the U.S. have 500 employees or fewer, and that is what constitutes a small business by definition in this country, 99 percent. We are a Nation of small businesses. Yet, we are debating a bill today that fails to take into consideration the impact such legislation could have on the bottom line of those small businesses, the most prolific job creators in our economy. 
   Mr. Speaker, the simple fact of the matter is that this bill increases costs for mom-and-pop businesses, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates it to be $5 to $7 billion, without providing them the opportunity to grow their business and thus create more jobs. This bill does nothing to help small businesses lower their health care costs through association health plans. It does nothing to eliminate the egregious death tax that forces the sale of so many family businesses and small farms around the country, and it does not provide incentives for small business owners to invest in and grow their businesses and thus create the jobs or the futures for the teenagers and many other people who are coming up in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's small businesses deserve better, and this House should do better. So vote ``no'' on H.R. 2.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As ranking member of the House Small Business Committee, I rise to support this resolution recognizing the 150th anniversary year of the founding of Macy's, Inc. I'm pleased to be joined by my good friend and distinguished chairwoman of the Small Business Committee, Nydia Vel&#225;zquez of New York, in offering this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, American small business owners are the entrepreneurs who create the majority of American jobs, export American products, and generate America's economic growth. Small firms exhibit the best of American values: hard work, innovation, enthusiasm, and determination. 
   The story of Macy's is one of true entrepreneurship. Roland Hussey Macy started the small dry goods store in New York City in 1858 that would develop into one of the largest department store retailers in the world. It was Mr. Macy's perseverance, ingenuity, and determination that helped to spur that growth. 
   Many Cincinnatians remember the John Shillito Company--or Shillitos, as we called it--Cincinnati's first department store, which was founded in 1830. In 1929, Shillito's, F.&R. Lazarus in Columbus, Ohio, Brooklyn, New York-based Abraham & Straus and several other family-owned department stores formed a holding company called Federated Department Stores. In 1945, Federated moved its offices to Cincinnati, where Macy's primary headquarters operates today, and in 1994, Federated acquired Macy's. 
   Today Macy's operates over 810 stores in every major metropolitan area around the entire United States. 
   Small businesses are known for their ability to respond to the needs of the market. Macy's, which began as a small business, has always been innovative: it was the first American store with escalators, elaborate window displays, and an in-store Santa. Macy's also began what is now the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Macy's tenets that customers are paramount and that success comes from taking advantage of opportunity are principles that small firms still apply today. 
   I want to commend Macy's for its commitment to purchasing from small businesses, including women- and minority-owned enterprises, establishing supplier diversity initiatives, and encouraging its vendors to purchase from small firms. Macy's also has a strong history of corporate and foundation giving and encouraging employee community service. 
   Congratulations to Macy's on 150 years of growth, success, and philanthropy. 
   Finally, I want to again thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for working in a bipartisan way on this issue as she has done consistently throughout the last 2 years that she served as the chairwoman of the Small Business Committee. I appreciate her leadership. I think she's done an extraordinarily good job. It's been an honor to work with her over the last 2 years. 
   At this point, I would like to reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire if the gentleman has any other further speakers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 61, which observes and celebrates the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and invites all Americans to join in this commemoration. 
   Dr. King's pursuit of social change and making this country worthy of its heritage was evident in all of his work. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP. He became the leader of the Montgomery Improvement Association which, of course, was the organization responsible for one of the most important nonviolent demonstrations of modern times in the United States, the 382-day bus boycott. 
   In 1957, Dr. King was elected President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Between 1957 and 1968, Dr. King appeared wherever he saw injustice. The injustice he saw took him many miles, and the speeches that he made are still taught in schools. They were taught yesterday. They are taught all over the country. They are things which we really do need to listen to and learn from and still have many things to learn from the things that Dr. King said. 
   Dr. King led a massive protest in Birmingham, Alabama, that drew the attention of the world, sparking what he called a ``coalition of conscience.'' 
   Dr. King later directed a peaceful march here in Washington, DC, a march that a quarter of a million people attended, where he delivered his now famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech. 
   At the age of 35, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was the youngest man to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. When notified of his selection, he announced that he would turn over all of the prize money to further the civil rights movement. 
   On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking sanitation workers in that city, he was gunned down. 
   Dr. King's name is synonymous with the civil rights movement. His life was devoted to changing the conscience of this Nation. His experiences shaped his character, and through them, one of the greatest nonviolent leaders of our country has ever known was created. 
   Today, we honor the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King for his service and strength and devotion to the principle that all Americans are entitled to equal treatment under the law in this great Nation. We are a greater Nation because Dr. King lived. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, rather than spinning our wheels on this issue, there is a much more important issue that we should be dealing with today, and the very safety of our Nation is at issue. I'm disappointed that we have reached the point in this House that reasonable minds could not prevail on an issue that involves the very safety of the American people. 
   Last August Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Protect America Act. This critical legislation closed the gaps which had previously caused the intelligence community to miss more than two-thirds of all overseas terrorist communications, finally allowing the United States to stay one step ahead of the terrorists. 
   The Senate amendments to H.R. 3773 would enable law enforcement and the intelligence community to continue their counterterrorism efforts, including working with telecommunications companies and allowing officials to gather intelligence from potential foreign terrorists outside the United States. 
   At the same time, this bill is mindful of our Constitution and the protections it affords to U.S. citizens, whether they are inside or outside the United States. Furthermore, the authority provided by the bill would sunset in 6 years, allowing Congress to revisit any issues that might arise. 
   We cannot afford to let the terrorists, particularly those who are conspiring abroad, to have the upper hand. Our law enforcement and intelligence communities must have every resource available to do their jobs in keeping this Nation safe. I urge my colleagues to support the United States, not the terrorists, by passing the Senate amendments to H.R. 3773. 
   And I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time on the minority side and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   In recent years, it has become painfully clear that America is far too dependent on foreign oil. We import nearly two-thirds of the oil we consume. With gas prices in my district back in Cincinnati and throughout the country hovering around $3 a gallon, it is important for Congress to continue exploring ways that we can produce more energy domestically rather than relying on oil from the volatile Middle East or from Nigeria or Venezuela or other unstable areas in the world. In fact, according to the Government Accountability Office, Americans paid $38 billion more for gasoline in the first 6 months of last year than they paid during the first 6 months of the previous year. That is just unacceptable. 
   It is critical that we adopt a diversified and balanced energy strategy to become more self-sufficient. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, passed when the current minority was actually in the majority, took significant steps in that direction. 
   For example, we must increase our production of traditional fuel such as oil and natural gas, and strengthen conservation and efficiency efforts. 
   It is also important to provide incentives for the research and development of promising new technologies such as, for example, hydrogen fuel cells. 
   And, renewable energy, the vast majority of which is produced in our Nation's rural communities, is serving an important role in meeting America's energy needs. Biofuels have the potential to help wean Americans off foreign oil and to provide an economic boost for farmers and rural communities. 
   The potential should have fostered a serious and long overdue debate about reforming our Nation's agriculture policy which, in my view, with its subsidies and tariffs is in dire need of reform. Unfortunately, the farm bill that this new majority passed just this last week will cost $286 billion over the next 5 years, with billions in subsidies, price guarantees, and direct payments going to large agra businesses that already stand to benefit from increased market opportunities for renewable fuels. 
   This energy bill only exacerbates the problems which will be made worse by the farm bill that was passed last week. It authorizes the creation, for example, of government-backed venture capital firms to invest in renewable and biofuels enterprises under a new program at the SBA, the Small Business Administration. Nothing prohibits the existing small business investment companies, which are backed by the Federal Government's full faith and credit, from investing in companies that are involved in biofuels and renewable energy already. 
   To compound matters, this so-called energy bill before us today even authorizes the SBA to fund the development of business plans for these venture capital programs. There is nothing to demonstrate that a market failure exists in the development and construction of such facilities. As a result, I see no reason to provide further incentives through the creation of a totally new program at the Small Business Administration. We are just growing government. I would urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. 
   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the request to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 3866, the SBA Programs Act of 2007. 
   I would like to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for working in a cooperative and bipartisan manner to bring this bill to the House floor today. 
   The bill we are considering today is a highly technical bill, but one of the Small Business Committee's legislative obligations. 
   The financing programs in the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 rely on lending by the private sector. Lenders are protected by guarantees issued by the SBA, promising repayment if the small business borrower fails. Congress must impose limits on the authority of the SBA to issue such guarantees. H.R. 3866 establishes limits that will enable the program to operate even if there is unexpected demand. 
   Given the current credit crunch, it is certainly possible that the SBA will have a spike in demand. The limits adopted in this bill will ensure that, unlike in some prior years, the program will not be the subject of operational restrictions. 
   I want to point out that supporting these limits will have no budgetary impact. The SBA's guaranteed loan, certified development company, and debenture small business investment company programs also operate at zero subsidy. That means the programs require no appropriation, and losses are covered by fees charged to lenders and borrowers. Maintaining this zero subsidy still enables Congress to provide for significant expansion of the authorization in order to meet demand, while protecting taxpayers. 
   The microloan programs, which helps entrepreneurs in many low-income areas and is a valuable job creation tool for a modest investment by the government, also receives an increase in lending authority.     
   Given the value of the program, I believe that the modest increase more than pays for itself in providing jobs and developing the entrepreneurial culture that continues to maintain the economic viability of this Nation. 
   In addition, the committee must provide authorization levels for the Small Business Development Center program. The allocation of funds to various centers is based in part on a comparison of funds appropriated to funds authorized. Without an authorization level, the funding formula cannot work. It also is important to point out that the authorization level for the SBDCs is increased by around 3 1/2 percent. This increase takes into account inflation and the administration's request that the centers provide even more counseling. The other major entrepreneurial outreach program of the SBA, the Women's Business Center program, receives an increase of around 17 percent. Now, while this may at first seem like a lot, the authorization in this bill represents the first time in nearly 8 years that the Women's Business Center authorization levels have been set thus representing an adjustment in align with inflation. 
   Similarly, the PRIME program, which provides additional technical assistance to microloan borrowers, has not received an authorization level since 1999. The authorization of $20 million in this bill represents an increase of $625,000 per year, or just enough, again, to keep up with inflation. I want to point out that the SBA requested a budget increase to cover inflation including the rapid rise in the cost of energy. It is only fair to authorize a similar modest increase for SBA's entrepreneurial outreach in education programs. 
   Other authorizations in this bill also represent either level funding, such as the SCORE program and the drug-free workplace program or represent very modest increases from prior authorization levels such as the $400,000 increase in funding for BusinessLINC, a valuable program that helps small businesses find contracts to supply large businesses with goods and services. 
   Two programs received significant boosts in authorization levels, the Office of Veterans Affairs and the HUBZone programs. In time of war, it is important that we provide assistance to our veterans. That includes ensuring that they have the tools necessary to integrate into civilian life through entrepreneurship. On a percentage basis, the authorization increase for the program is significant, but the dollar value is a modest $2 million. Given the sacrifices our veterans have made, this represents only a modest down payment on the debt we owe to them, our veterans. 
   As for the HUBZone program, the increase arises from the efforts of the committee to ensure that only firms eligible for participation in the program receive Federal Government contracts. This requires additional onsite verification and thus represents the committee's view to the appropriators to significantly increase funding in that area. 
   Again, I would like to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez. Although there are significant philosophical differences between Members, I think the past year has demonstrated what can happen when this body tries to work through those differences without acrimony or questioning of the motives of the other side. Much can be accomplished for the American public, and that is what the people elected us to do. So I want to, again, commend the chairwoman for her willingness to work in a bipartisan manner not only in this bill but many bills that we have dealt with in the past. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, there is no question that today's economic environment is increasingly difficult for small firms to thrive in. We have seen record highs in gas prices, unmanageable health care costs and barriers in the way of accessing affordable capital. Now, more than ever, small businesses need assistance programs they can rely on that are well-equipped to meet their needs. With the Small Business Programs Act of 2007 that is exactly what we are giving entrepreneurs. 
   This legislation ensures that our Nations's 27 million entrepreneurs have access to the business development assistance that they need and deserve. These firms employ one half of our workforce, spur economic development and revitalize our communities. When their businesses are growing and flourishing, the benefits are felt across the country. 
   With the passage of H.R. 3866, we set program levels for SBA's entrepreneurial assistance initiatives, updating and modernizing them. The primary role of the SBA is to help entrepreneurs who have the drive but need assistance. It is clear that small firms play a crucial role in our economy. By ensuring that these businesses have current and sufficient assistance, we are investing in our communities, helping to create jobs, and benefiting the Nation as a whole. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ranking Member Chabot for  your collaboration for us to work together in a responsible way, to follow regular order, and I am very proud that every time that we have considered legislation, we have done so in a very inclusive, open way and we can show results.

It shows the things that can be done when we respect each other despite our differences. But we show the American public that we are willing to work together on their behalf. 
   I also would like to take an opportunity to thank the staff that worked on this legislation from the Small Business Committee majority staff, Tim Slattery and Michael Day, and from the minority staff, Barry Pineles, Kevin Fitzpatrick and Mike Smullen.

   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research and Enhancement Act of 2007. We all support advancing science to fight disease, particularly those diseases that may have already affected our loved ones or might affect them sometime in the future. 
   Like so many other areas within science and technology, discoveries in stem cell research are occurring every day. Just this week, news reports highlighted a significant breakthrough made by researchers from Wake Forest University in the use of amniotic stem cells to treat diseases and other conditions. This discovery, coupled with the advances made in the therapeutic use  of cord blood, bone marrow, and other stem cells, demonstrates that effective and ethical research are not mutually exclusive. 
   In fact, Congress came together last May to support ethical stem cell research. By an overwhelming majority, Congress passed the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005, which made cord blood units collected by cord blood banks available for stem cell transplantation or peer-reviewed research. Since its passage, cord blood banks from around the country have collected and stored approximately 150,000 new units of cord blood which will allow the pleuripotent stem cells within the cord blood to be used to treat one of a number of diseases and conditions such as heart disease, nerve damage, and certain cancers, as well as to be used for research. 
   These important advances illustrate that science can and should be advanced in an ethically minded manner. On Tuesday, the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) reintroduced H.R. 322, the alternative Pleuripotent Stem Cell Therapeutic Enhancement Act.     
   I urge my colleagues to support and invest taxpayer dollars in stem cell research that is comprehensive, ethical, and effective. The bill before us today falls short of these goals, and therefore I urge opposition.

   Today, Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1361, the RECOVER Act. While there are many important things that this bill does, there are two provisions in particular, I believe, that unfortunately undermine the good work that has been done by the chairwoman in drafting the legislation.

There are two amendments that we are going to offer subsequent to the general debate argument here, and if those amendments are adopted, I think they fix the bill sufficiently that we can support it because, as I indicated, I think there are many good things in this bill. But without those two provisions being passed, we unfortunately have to oppose it in its current form. 
   These two provisions, as I indicated, unfortunately make it impossible for me to support it as drafted, and the manager's amendment offered by the chairwoman, while making one of the provisions less problematic, does not assuage our underlying concerns about the two provisions that I just mentioned. 
   I think everyone can agree that all branches of government failed to respond adequately to the devastation that was Hurricane Katrina, and one of those agencies that did not measure up is the Small Business Administration unfortunately. This is not the conclusion of Democrats or Republicans, or Louisiana or Mississippi Members of Congress. It is a conclusion reached by the GAO, small business owners in the region and even the SBA itself. 
   While much of the focus on the response to Katrina has focused on the immediate aftermath and the failures of FEMA, the SBA plays a key role in the response to disasters by issuing loans to both homeowners and small businesses affected by the disaster. Thus, an inadequate response by the SBA undermines the recovery of communities devastated by natural disasters. It is vital that the SBA be prepared to handle future disasters, including some worst-case possible scenarios. 
   Administrator Preston understands this and has taken a number of steps to improve the SBA's readiness and made efforts to ensure that the inadequate response does not repeat itself. Through his efforts, he has reduced backlogs, streamlined loan processing,  improved customer service and identified points where the processing of disaster loans broke down. Administrator Preston also will ensure that the computer systems at the SBA will be improved; establish a reserve corps; utilize non-SBA staff to process loans; establish a new disaster manual that will be finalized by June 1 for the start of the current hurricane season; and continually revise responses to disasters based on the experience of previous disasters. 
   One may ask why a bill is necessary if Administrator Preston is making these changes. Well, as we have seen, other administrators may not have the same priorities and may reduce preparedness in the future to address other needs of the SBA. Therefore, incorporating many of these changes in statute will ensure that the administrator and SBA personnel will have the appropriate resources and congressional direction to ensure the SBA will have an adequate response to a disaster in the future. 
   Title I of the bill makes important changes in the SBA's management structure to ensure that the agency is prepared not only for predictable disasters but also the unpredictable ones. Title I requires the administrator to, A, develop a comprehensive disaster response plan; B, conduct an annual disaster simulation exercise; C, maintain a disaster reserve corps; D, create plans to obtain additional office space needed for major disasters; E, coordinate disaster assistance programs with FEMA; and create, from existing personnel, the position of an associate administrator for disaster assistance that has experience in both disaster planning and disaster response. These changes are all beneficial and will ensure that the SBA has the necessary tools and experience to respond to disasters. 
   These changes are supplemented by section 208, which provides enhanced lending authority to banks and other financial institutions that are preferred SBA lenders to process disaster loans in certain circumstances. Given the expertise of SBA preferred lenders, they should be able to supplement the SBA's capability to process disaster loans when necessary. 
   There are other important changes in title II that also are beneficial, and I commend the chairwoman, Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez, for including those in this legislation. By themselves, these provisions would have made an effective bipartisan bill that ensures the SBA has the current planning and future capacity to respond to a disaster, whether it is a local tornado or an incident of national significance such as Hurricane Katrina. 
   Unfortunately, the legislation has two critical provisions that, in my view, seriously undercut the otherwise excellent work of the committee in creating a structure that will ensure the SBA is prepared to respond irrespective of the scope of the disaster. The first provision would authorize, according to CBO estimates, $180 million in grants to small businesses that were denied SBA loans. The other provision would grant the administrator the authority to, in essence, create a grant program that replaces grant funds that must be applied against existing disaster loans issued by the SBA. In other words, it allows a double compensation, a person to be compensated for the same damage twice. Given my concern about these two provisions, I will be offering amendments at the appropriate time to strike these two provisions, two amendments that we will be offering. 
   If these two provisions are removed, I think the House would then be able to pass a sound bill on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis that dramatically improves the administrative structure by which the SBA responds to disasters in a fiscally responsible manner. 
   As I indicated before, if the two amendments are not passed, unfortunately I am going to have to oppose this particular piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.     
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Shuler).

   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, prior to yielding back all our time, if I could just make a comment or two. I will yield myself as much time as I may consume. I will be very brief. 
   I just want to reiterate that there are things within this bill which I think are very good efforts in resolving some of the difficulties that we saw in Katrina. 
   First of all, the SBA's response time for loans and other things was unacceptable, and it is absolutely critical that it be improved upon. And I think there are some things in this bill that do just that. For example, better coordination between the SBA and FEMA; the requirement of a plan ahead of time, a disaster plan ahead of time that everybody knows about so you are not looking for a plan or trying to put one together after the disaster has already hit; it makes sense to do that ahead of time. This calls for this. 
   It calls for a reserve corps of trained personnel, which I particularly like because you are talking about training people ahead of time, but not necessarily hiring them as new government employees that then one has to pay and pay compensation to over a long period of time. So I like the fact that we are talking about training a reserve corps ahead of time. 
   I think the idea of having simulation exercises called for ahead of time makes a lot of sense so that people are prepared. 
   As I indicated before, however, there are a couple of, in my view, fatal flaws to this particular piece of legislation, which we are going to address in a few moments here in a couple of amendments. And if they pass, then we would be very supportive of the whole act. If they don't, unfortunately, we would have to oppose the bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Chairman, we are now barely over a month away from hurricane season. Many small businesses have been struggling for a year and half to recover after the gulf coast storms of 2005. Following the hurricanes, delays in disaster loans, overwhelming amounts of paperwork and a lengthy application process left many small business owners frustrated and discouraged. In fact, entrepreneurs avoided what is supposed to be their primary source of assistance, the SBA. 
   Our Nation's 25 million small businesses need to know that the next time a disaster happens they will not be left with nothing, but will have efficient and reliable assistance. They need to know that what happened after the gulf coast hurricanes will not ever happen again. 
   The RECOVER Act of 2007 will require that the SBA have a disaster plan in place, provides assistance to the neediest of entrepreneurs and helps in the redevelopment of the community. H.R. 1361 will given entrepreneurs the relief and assistance they deserve after a disaster. 
   With 44 days left till hurricane season, we simply cannot afford not to act. 
   At this point, I want to take a moment to thank the staff who worked on this legislation. From Mr. Chabot's staff, Kevin Fitzpatrick, Mike Smullen and Barry Pinellis; from the majority staff, Michael Day, Adam Minehardt and Andy Jiminez and Tim Slattery.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This amendment is really rather simple. It just strikes section 211 of the bill as amended by the manager's amendment. Even though the manager's amendment addresses the direct cost provision of the original section as  determined by the CBO score, section 211 still is fraught with one major problem. And that is that it allows double compensation for the same injury or destruction or problem that the person had. 
   As I understand section 211 in the manager's amendment, here is how that provision operates: For example, a homeowner applies for a physical disaster loan from the SBA for, say, $100,000. The homeowner then receives a grant from the State for $50,000 for the same destruction. Under existing law, the homeowner would have to immediately pay back $50,000 of the SBA loan because the SBA loan only covers amounts not otherwise compensated for through some other financial resource. Typically, that is insurance, but it does not have to be. Section 211 does not change the requirement that the homeowner would have to pay down the $50,000 in the disaster loan. Instead, section 211 would then allow the homeowner to apply for a grant from the SBA to replace the same amount of money that they had just paid to the SBA to reduce their loan. 
   Now you are probably asking yourself why go through this convoluted process. Well, this is the only way for the majority to obtain a program that does not require direct spending, and therefore, it gets around the PAYGO problem. But even though this is an improvement over the bill as reported out of the committee because it has no direct spending and therefore is in compliance with PAYGO, it remains fundamentally flawed. 
   The disaster loan program is just that: the Federal Government's program designed to provide redress to those homeowners and small businesses injured in a disaster. And it is important to note that the vast majority of loan recipients, both businesses and homeowners, receive loans at heavily subsidized interest rates of 3 or 4 percent interest. It is not a grant program and was never designed to be a grant program. The interest rate subsidy, a 30-year term, and the SBA's authority to suspend payment on principal and interest constitute the compensation needed to rebuild many areas, from Chatsworth in California to Homestead in Florida. 
   Now, section 211 of H.R. 1361 has the recipient of a disaster loan obtaining a grant from a source other than the SBA, using that money to pay off all or a portion of the SBA disaster loan, and then apply to the SBA for a grant to replace the grant money that the recipient of the disaster loan just paid the SBA. And, again, I know this sounds very convoluted. In essence, there is a determination that double compensation is needed because the rather robust compensation already included in the Small Business Act and sufficient for other disasters is insufficient compensation. It is also important to note that, for victims of Hurricane Katrina, there are billions of other dollars that have been made available to assist these victims on an ad hoc basis, yet it is never enough. And this bill indicates that. 
   Now comes section 211 of H.R. 1361 in a clear effort to ensure that victims of Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita receive double compensation. This raises two distinct questions. First, why do victims of these three hurricanes get special treatment of double compensation, and why should not other disaster victims get double compensation? Yes, Katrina was a tragedy, but so were Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Charley and the attacks of September 11, for example. This seems incredibly arbitrary to select only those three disasters for something as unusual as double compensation. 
   Second and far more important is the concept, as I indicated, of double compensation. It has been a longstanding tradition of American jurisprudence that a party shall not receive double compensation for the same injury. That concept is codified in the disaster loan provisions of the Small Business Act by prohibiting the SBA from issuing a loan for amounts already compensated for by insurance or other means. Thus under current law, a disaster loan applicant cannot get an insurance claim for $100,000 for a $100,000 loss and also get an SBA disaster loan for the same amount of money. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask that Members support this amendment. It is fiscally responsible and continues to recognize that individuals should not be granted double compensation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is very straightforward. It strikes section 210 of the bill. Section 210 authorizes the administrator to issue grants of up to $100,000 to small businesses located in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, but only if the business was denied a disaster loan by the SBA. 
   This is really, in my view, the height of fiscal irresponsibility. The SBA's determination of whether to grant a disaster loan is based on its determination of reasonable assurance that you can repay your loan, which is a direct quote from the SBA's rules found in the Code of Federal Regulations. Thus, if the SBA has denied a business a disaster loan, it already has determined that it is unlikely, for whatever reason, to repay the loan. In other words, its capacity as a viable business is seriously called into question. 
   Section 210 provides that despite this determination, the Federal Government should create a grant program of up to $100,000 to help small businesses whose survivability was highly improbable to survive in the first place. 
   Again, the SBA has indicated that they don't think this business is viable, that it is going to survive, and then we are going to turn around and give them up to $100,000. It is just not fiscally responsible. 
   To fully fund all of those eligible, CBO estimates that the costs could be up to $180 million. I want to repeat that: $180 million we are talking about here. This seems again fiscally irresponsible, to fund grants when the SBA already has determined that the businesses are not likely to survive. 
   It also remains unclear whether the grants will be sufficient to satisfy the needs of small businesses. How many will be able to survive on a grant of $100,000 if they could not repay a disaster loan of that amount? CBO did not answer that question, but I suspect very few of these businesses will survive. 
   Although the provision is written to include all small businesses affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, there are limitations on which businesses can apply based on the amount of housing stock in a county or parish that is damaged. It is highly likely that only small businesses in Louisiana will qualify. Was this done to reduce costs? If so, why are only Louisiana businesses favored? Were not many small businesses throughout the region devastated by these hurricanes? It seems patently unfair to single out certain businesses for a very generous grant program. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask that Members support this amendment. To do otherwise, in my view, is just not a fiscally responsible stand to take. Again, every Member has to stand according to their own vote, and I am sure we will determine this based upon what they consider to be its merits. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.

   The ladies of Mount Notre Dame, once again, with their usual style, grace, and determination won the Ohio Division I basketball championship. This win puts them in the history books, as it makes them the first Ohio team ever to win three consecutive State titles. 
   With time running out and the game tied, freshman guard Kathryn Reynolds scored at the buzzer, clinching the championship for the Cougars 69-67. Coach Dante Harlan, top scorers Tia McBride, Ashley Fowler and the rest of the team are to be congratulated for their achievement. Well done, Cougars. 
   I also want to recognize the 32 students in the Winton Woods High School Varsity Ensemble who were selected to participate in the Choral Salute at the 2008 Olympic Games in China. For more than a year, these gifted students have been preparing in rehearsals and planning fund-raisers to pay for the trip to Shanghai and Beijing, China.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Mr. Speaker, we are on the floor today debating yet again another set of amendments to FISA, another set of amendments that limit the ability of law enforcement and intelligence communities to make this Nation safer, another set of amendments that have no chance of becoming law. What these amendments do confirm is that we are a litigious society, that some are willing to put lawsuits over safety. 
   Prior to the passage of the Protect America Act, our intelligence community told us that they missed more than two-thirds of all overseas terrorist communications because of gaps and inconsistencies in the law. In August, we closed those holes, giving law enforcement and the intelligence communities the tools and resources they need to stay one step ahead. 
   Disappointingly, 26 days have passed since those provisions expired. For 26 days now, our law enforcement and intelligence communities have had to revert back to the status quo. They have had to revert back to a status that allows terrorists to have the upper hand. And yet this Chamber continues to bring legislation that we know will not do the job, all the while, knowing that there is a solution, a bipartisan solution, to this predicament. 
   The bipartisan solution lies in the legislation passed by the Senate 30 days ago. These amendments continue and build on the authorizations provided by the Protect America Act, ensuring that surveillance continues on foreign targets outside the United States. Immunity is provided to our communication partners, FISA applications, and orders are processed in a more timely manner, and lengthening the periods of emergency authorization for electronic surveillance. 
   Yet this bill is mindful of our Constitution and the protections it affords to U.S. citizens, whether they are inside or outside the United States. Moreover, the authority provided by the bill sunsets in 6 years, allowing Congress to revisit if issues arise. 
   I urge my colleagues to not make the safety of the American people a partisan issue.  
   There are many things that we can disagree on, but the safety of this country should not be one of them. Let's not send the message that litigation is more important than patriotism, but that we are committed to standing as one in doing what is necessary and needed to keep this Nation safe.

   I rise today in support of H.R. 3206. This bill is very simple: it extends the authorization of all programs authorized by the Small Business Act, the Small Business Investment Act, and any program operated by the Small Business Administration for which Congress has already appropriated funds. This extension will last until December 15, 2007. This extension is necessary because authorization for various programs operated by the SBA ceases on July 31, 2007, tomorrow. 
   Working in a bipartisan manner with Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez and myself, the committee has ordered 12 bills to be reported out, of which nine have passed this body, the House of Representatives. 
   While the pace has been furious, more needs to be done in the examination of programs within the committee's jurisdiction. These include small business government contracting programs, investment programs for small businesses, and improving the management of the SBA. 
   This work cannot be done in a deliberative, thoughtful, and bipartisan manner by midnight tomorrow. Even if the committee and the House finish its deliberations on all aspects of the SBA and its programs, we operate, after all, in a bicameral legislative system. Time is needed for the legislative process in both bodies to function and, if necessary, for the two bodies to meet in a conference to iron out any disagreements concerning each body's deliberations about how best to ensure that the SBA and its myriad programs are best promoting the health of America's entrepreneurs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, it's very unfortunate that we have to come back year after year to urge that restrictions should be lifted for high-level visits by appointed and democratically elected leaders of Taiwan. 
   Our misguided Taiwan policy is nothing new. The so-called ``One China'' policy is a bipartisan mistake--begun in the Nixon-Kissinger era and exacerbated by President Carter's abrogation of our Mutual Defense Treaty in 1980. It continues to this day. 
   Just last week, dozens of Members of Congress welcomed Taiwan's Democrat Progressive Party's nominee for the Presidency, Mr. Frank Hsieh, to our Nation's Capitol. There was a little gallows humor at the gathering because, in fact, if Mr. Hsieh wins the election next year, he will no longer be able to come to visit with his friends in Washington, D.C. 
   Our insulting policy toward our democratic friend and ally should be cast aside to reflect the reality of our strong relationship with Taiwan. Taiwan is a vibrant democracy of some 23,000,000. It is our 8th largest trading partner and the world's 18th largest economy. The Taiwanese people enjoy a full range of freedoms not enjoyed on the other side of the Taiwan Strait--freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom to elect all of their leaders. 
   Taiwan is a model for young democracies and a great friend to the United States. We should recognize that friendship by abandoning our insulting policy on high level visits and welcoming our Taiwanese friends with open arms. It is the right thing to do. 
   I urge support of the resolution.

   I would urge my colleagues to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 4252, legislation to extend the authorization for programs under the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act, as well as any program operated by the Small Business Administration for which Congress has already appropriated funds. This extension will last until May 23, 2008. I want to thank the distinguished chairwoman of the Small Business Committee, Ms. Vel&#225;zquez, for working with me in her usual gracious manner. 
   With the current extension set to expire December 15, which isn't very far away, obviously, the extension is crucial to ensuring programs designed to help our small businesses are able to continue to operate. Working in a bipartisan effort with Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez, the committee has reported 14 bills, most of which have been overwhelmingly bipartisan, and all of which have passed the House of Representatives. 
   While we have worked at a rather furious pace in an effort to formally reauthorize SBA programs, the other legislative body has had difficulties coming to the same bipartisan consensus. So without passage of this temporary legislation today, we find ourselves at risk of shortchanging the government contracting and capital programs for small businesses and impeding the management of the SBA. 
   Even with deliberations completed in the House, we operate in a bicameral legislative system. Time is needed for the legislative process in both bodies to function and, if necessary, for the two bodies to meet in conference to iron out any disagreements and to ensure that the SBA and its programs are best promoting the health of America's entrepreneurs who, after all, employ an awful lot of people in this country. The work cannot be expected to be done in a deliberative, thoughtful, and bipartisan manner with the looming deadline of midnight December 15 hanging over our heads.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today, Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the request to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 4253, the Military Reservist and Veteran Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act of 2007. I would like to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for working in a cooperative and bipartisan manner to bring this bill, which incorporates provisions of a bill authored by Mr. Buchanan, who is a freshman member of the Small Business Committee and who has already shown tremendous initiative and leadership on that committee, to the House floor. 
   While we could never adequately repay the debt we owe to America's fighting men and women for their service and sacrifice, today's bill takes important steps to help our Nation's veterans make a smoother transition to civilian life. 
   While serving in the Armed Forces, service men and women learn and practice technical skills valued in today's civilian workforce, in addition to the leadership and decisionmaking skills that they learn on the battlefield. All  of these attributes are critical to success in the business world and are particularly important traits for successful small business owners. 
   Despite the success that veterans have shown in starting and operating small businesses, more must be done to assist our veterans in the startup and operation of their businesses. Outreach must improve to ensure that veterans wishing to start their own businesses will have the training and advice needed to transfer their skills to entrepreneurship without first working for someone else. 
   Title I of H.R. 4253 represents an excellent start in the efforts to expand and ensure that our veterans have the technical support they need to start their own businesses. 
   I want to especially thank the chairwoman for incorporating Mr. Buchanan's interest in expanding the number of Veterans Business Outreach Centers, which will play an increased role in providing assistance to veterans wishing to start small businesses. 
   The technical advice and assistance are not limited to veterans continuing their service in the Reserves. Title II of the bill recognizes Reservists who operate small businesses have their own unique set of operational problems associated with their call-up to duty. They may not know how long their call-up will last and they need assistance in ensuring they have a plan in place to operate their business while they are on active duty. This legislation builds on the existing network of entrepreneurial partners to deliver key technical and operational assistance to Reservists.     
   Another important element of the bill is the recognition of the changing nature of the military with a greater involvement of women. The legislation requires the administrator to expand assistance to women veterans and Reservists. Given the rapid expansion and success of women-owned businesses, it makes sense to ensure that the needs of women Reservists are met when they seek to start and operate small businesses. 
   Our fighting men and women are the best in the world. Let us help them become the best entrepreneurs in the world by enacting this legislation, H.R. 4253. 
   Again, I want to thank Mr. Buchanan for his leadership in this effort, and I also want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Altmire, who also has worked very hard in this area as well and is responsible for this bill being here today. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I would like to yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced over 600,000 new veterans thus far and have created a serious challenge for the Nation: how to facilitate our returning servicemembers' successful transition back home and into our economy. Given the ongoing nature of these conflicts, the shift in economic opportunities and the diverse needs of returning veterans, this is an unprecedented situation that will require a major and rapid response. 
   To promote veterans' abilities to be productive engines of the economy, I believe we must comprehensively modernize Federal programs designed to assist this key group through self-employment opportunities. H.R. 4253 achieves this objective by obtaining the Small Business Administration programs to ensure they are customized to meet the growing needs of this sector in a changing economy. 
   This Nation has a clear obligation to ensure that our returning servicemembers have the assistance they need to succeed at entrepreneurship. By complementing their individual strengths with appropriate Federal resources, we can help them realize their full potential, while also growing the economy. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the staff that worked on this bill. From the majority staff, Michael Day, Adam Minehardt and Andy Jimenez. From the minority staff, Barry Pineles and Kevin Fitzpatrick. I also want to recognize Max Goodman from Mr. Buchanan's staff and Cara Toman and Erik Komendant from Mr. Altmire's staff.

And I'm pleased to be the principal cosponsor of this bill with Mr. Lampson, particularly as it provides law enforcement with better information to fight the despicable act of child pornography. 
   We don't have to look any further than our homes and our communities to see that predators are threatening and victimizing our children with just a simple click. The Internet, while providing a world of opportunity to our children, has also contributed to a worldwide expansion of child pornography enabling predators to more easily abuse, exploit and prey on our most precious items, and that's our children. 
   H.R. 3791 builds on the investigative tools already in place under the leadership of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Through the CyberTipline, the center plays a critical role interfacing between Federal, State and foreign law enforcement and the public, providing valuable information in ongoing investigations. 
   H.R. 3791 recognizes that advances in technology have made electronic communication service providers the first line of defense against crimes against children, possessing the real-time information critical to child pornography investigations. By requiring electronic communication service providers to report this information to the CyberTipline as soon as reasonably possible and maintain this information for an investigation, this act, the SAFE Act, is giving Federal, State and foreign law enforcement and prosecutors a fighting chance to put these criminals away, no matter where they are located. 
   And one of the things that I found out in doing investigations into this particular area was the shocking fact that there are only 50 nations, including the United States, where child pornography is illegal. Fifty nations. There are 184 nations around the world where it's perfectly legal to have, possess, to convey child pornography. So that's something that I think we need to have some focus and some attention directed upon, how much of the world, and that stuff gets in here through the Internet. It may be in China, it may be in Pakistan, it may be somewhere else, but it can be on our computers in our living rooms with our children very quickly, so we need to do a much better job on that, too. 
   But I want to again thank Mr. Lampson for his leadership in this area, and I again want to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3791 today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, a few years ago, I had the honor of coming to the floor of this House to congratulate Cincinnati's Elder High School for winning the Ohio State Division 1 football championship 2 years in a row, quite an accomplishment. 
   Today, I want to recognize and commend Elder High school seniors Matt Brannon and Ben Combs and a group of about a dozen fellow Elder students for doing something every bit as worthy of recognition. These young men, on their own initiative, raised the necessary funds to ship care packages to Elder alumni who are serving our Nation in uniform overseas. In the words of Matt Brannon, ``I want to help people who are risking their lives for us.'' 
   Such patriotism should be an inspiration to us all, and Elder High School can be proud that they are educating and instilling in their students the highest values. 
   Thank you, Elder Panthers. Well done.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
   Mr. Speaker, I first want to express our appreciation to the brave men and women of our Armed Forces. I have met with our troops in Iraq and in Afghanistan and our wounded soldiers in Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Hospitals and the families of those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice defending our freedoms. We thank them for their unwavering commitment to our country and believe we owe it to them to have an open and honest debate regarding our next steps in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no question that the war in Iraq has been challenging. We are fighting a war against terrorists and radical Islamic militants who are determined to kill as many Americans as possible. They believe that killing American soldiers will drive us out of Iraq and out of the Middle East, allowing radical terrorists free rein and a base to expand their influence around the world. 
   These are the same radical Islamic militants who bombed the World Trade Center in 1993, the Khobar Towers in 1996, the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and the USS Cole in 2000. We surely can't forget the slaughter of 3,000 innocent American citizens on our soil. And just last year a couple arrested in Britain planned to use their 6-month-old baby as a human bomb to destroy a civilian airliner over the Atlantic Ocean.     
   We must recognize that we are dealing with irrational, radical, maniacal monsters who will not respond to diplomatic niceties. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all know that the vast majority of Americans do not support an immediate withdrawal from Iraq, just as they do not support a never-ending deployment of U.S. forces there. They want us, they expect us, to work together and with the President to find a way to win the war on terror while bringing our troops home as soon as possible. 
   We should be past the point of political posturing when it comes to Iraq. Yet this resolution is more of the same, once again placing politics over policy. Instead of encouraging substantive discussion on options in Iraq, the majority has once again shut us out of the process and refused to consider any alternative to their point of view. That is truly unfortunate because this nonbinding resolution does nothing to increase the accountability of the Iraqi government or provide for our troops or even propose a new course in Iraq. 
   We all agree that this administration has made mistakes in Iraq. Most harmful, I believe, has been the slow pace of training Iraq troops and security forces to take responsibility for their own country. Early lapses in this area are a principal reason why our troops remain in Iraq today. 
   But the administration has taken action to accelerate this training and better prepare Iraqi forces. So now it is time for the Iraqi government to demonstrate that it has the ability to confront the problems facing their country, both politically and militarily. That is why it is so important that we hold the Iraqi government accountable for what they say they are going to do and require them to take the lead in securing their Nation. The Iraqi government and the Iraqi people must recognize that they, not American troops, are responsible for the future of their country. 
   With that being said, we must continue to support our troops and commanders on the ground by giving them the resources they need to be successful. It would be a tragic mistake to cut off funding or limit support for our troops fighting against terrorists abroad. We also must be very careful about the message we send to our allies and our enemies and, most importantly, to our troops in the field who have performed with great courage. 
   The bipartisan Iraq Study Group has stated that it could support a shorter redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up the training and equipping mission, if the U.S. commander in Iraq determines that such steps would be effective, and that is a quote from the Iraq Study Group report. Well, General Petraeus says that it can be effective. 
   Clearly, the path forward must include military and political strategic benchmarks so that we are in a position to measure the progress and commitment of the Iraqi government, but we must also be willing to give our troops, who have sacrificed so much for our Nation, the opportunity and the resources to be successful and provide the short-term support needed to achieve increased stability in Iraq. 
   There are serious consequences to our national security if we fail in Iraq. Cutting off funding, limiting military options or pushing for immediate withdrawal will only make our future more dangerous. It is time to stop the politics, stop the games, stop the finger pointing, and do what is best for America. Let us put partisanship aside and discuss concrete plans on how we can defeat radical terrorists and protect our Nation from those who mean us great harm.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (SUPPORTING THE MISSION AND GOALS OF NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this important resolution and the 28th annual observance of National Crime Victims' Rights Week. This year's theme, ``Justice for Victims, Justice for All'' is appropriate. Too often, victims of crime are made to be victims a second time, first as a result of the crime, but second as a result of our criminal justice system, the very system designed to protect them. 
   In 2004, 20 years after Congress enacted the Victims of Crime Act, Congress enacted the Justice for All Act. This was a significant victory for crime victims, as it extended a number of enforceable rights to crime victims, including the right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding involving release, plea or sentencing, the right to file a motion to reopen a plea, or sentence in certain circumstances, and, most importantly, the right to be treated with dignity, fairness and respect. 
   Despite enactment, enforcement of these rights is just one of a number of important changes that needs to occur to ensure that our Nation's criminal justice system is just for both offenders and the victims of those crimes. 
   In a hearing held by the Crime Subcommittee 3 weeks ago, testimony was presented revealing that crime victims continue to bear the brunt of crimes. According to the Department of Justice, crime costs victims and their families more than $105 billion in lost earnings, public victim assistance and medical expenses. 
   For example, despite a victim's right to full and timely restitution, it remains one of the most underenforced victims' rights within our justice system. In fact, more than $50 billion in criminal debt, including restitution and fines, were uncollected in 2007. And the amount of outstanding criminal debt is only expected to increase, ballooning from $269 million to almost $13 billion. And in my own State of Ohio, more than $1.2 billion in criminal debt remained uncollected at the end of fiscal year 2007. 
   While I appreciate the majority's effort to recognize National Crime Victims' Rights Week, I believe that more than just lip service can be done to help victims. Many of us have introduced good legislation, such as H.R. 845, the Criminal Restitution Improvement Act of 2007, or H.R. 4110, restitution legislation introduced by Representative Shea-Porter that will do more to assist victims. 
   If we all agree that crime victims bear the brunt of crimes, then why not pass a bill such as H.R. 845, that makes restitution mandatory and strengthens collection efforts? 
   Enforcement of these rights is the type of legislation that crime victims and their families need and deserve to help rebuild their lives, not just the recognition that they exist on paper. 
   I appreciate the work that my colleagues, Mr. Costa and Mr. Poe, have done on the Victims' Rights Caucus and in introducing this resolution. National Crime Victims Week serves many purposes, including to remind us what victims have suffered and the need to include them in the criminal justice system, to thank those individuals and organizations who have selflessly dedicated themselves to assisting victims, and to urge us all to rededicate ourselves to advance the cause of the victims of crime. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the victims of crime and their families and those that help them rebuild their lives by supporting this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, House Democrats' fiscally irresponsible budget will impose on American workers and businesses a $683 billion tax hike, the largest in U.S. history. 
   With our economy slowing and many families losing their homes, the last thing Congress needs to do is to take more money from these hardworking Americans. Tax relief, not a tax increase, is the best stimulant to our economy. Socking 116 million Americans with an average tax hike of over $1,800 is an irresponsible fiscal strategy. 
   Working families would be hit especially hard by the Democrats' irresponsibility. A family of four with two children that currently earns $50,000 annually would have to pay an additional $2,155 in taxes under the Democrats' plan. That would amount to a 191 percent increase in their tax bill. 
   The last thing our economy needs right now is the largest tax increase in history. House Republicans are dedicated to protecting working families, investors, and small businesses from the irresponsible tax hike that is being foisted upon us.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1095, a resolution commemorating the 40th anniversary of the passage of the Fair Housing Act. 
   On April 4, 2008, just 11 days ago, this Nation joined together to pay tribute to the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and recognize his contributions to this Nation.     
   Thus, it's only fitting that we recognize one aspect of Dr. King's legacy, passage of the Fair Housing Act, which was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on April 11, 1968, just one week after Dr. King's tragic assassination. 
   The act, which prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin, sex, and later handicap and family status, was another tool to give meaning to the rights and protections afforded to all citizens by the Constitution. 
   Passage of the Fair Housing Act was a fitting memorial to Dr. King, as his name was closely associated with fair housing legislation since the 1966 ``open housing'' marches in Chicago. 
   At the same time, Senator Edward Brooke, the first African American ever to be elected to the Senate by popular vote, helped facilitate this Act's passage by describing his difficulties finding housing for his new family following his service in World War II. 
   The first official appointed to administer the act was former Governor George Romney. Secretary Romney assumed his position of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development after serving as Governor of Michigan, where he successfully campaigned for the ratification of a State constitutional amendment that prohibited discrimination in housing. 
   Since its enactment, the Fair Housing Act has prevented both countless instances of specific discrimination as well as broader patterns or practices of discrimination in housing programs. In addition, the act serves to punish those who attempt to disguise their discriminatory motives by giving false information to potential homebuyers, or by manipulating zoning codes. It prohibits sexual harassment in housing, and enables the disabled to more easily assimilate into our communities. 
   Madam Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't also commend and recognize the chairman of the Judiciary, Mr. Conyers, both for his remarks, and also working with myself in a bipartisan manner on the issue that he raised about those that find themselves at risk of having their homes foreclosed upon. And I agree with him that we ought to give the bankruptcy judges additional powers to modify those particular agreements so that they can have a better chance of retaining their homes. That certainly would move forward those that find themselves at risk  of losing their own homes. Again, I want to thank the chairman of the committee for working with us in a bipartisan manner on that issue. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution today, and in celebrating the 40th anniversary of passage of the Fair Housing Act. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CONGRESSIONAL BADGE OF BRAVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 4056, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Congressional Badge of Bravery Act of 2008. The men and women of American's Federal law enforcement agencies risk their lives every day protecting our communities, apprehending criminals and bringing them to justice. They are charged with the challenge of disrupting terrorist plots, combating violent gang activity, and stemming the flow of illegal drugs into this country. And they rise to this challenge every single day.     
   Over 100,000 law enforcement officers are employed by Federal agencies, including not only the FBI, DEA and ATF, but also the Secret Service, Forest Service, Park Police, Postal Inspectors and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. 
   Unbeknownst to many of us, approximately 150 of our Federal officers are injured in the line of duty each year in this country. However, of the more than 70 Federal agencies that employ law enforcement officers, only two, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, actually recognize agents injured in the line of duty. 
   H.R. 4056 establishes the Congressional Badge of Bravery to honor Federal law enforcement officers injured in the line of duty, the first formal congressional award honoring injured law enforcement officers throughout the entire Federal Government. 
   The Congressional Badge of Bravery will be awarded to those Federal law enforcement officers who demonstrate bravery in performance of their duties, faced personal risk to their safety, and were injured in the line of duty. 
   H.R. 4056 establishes a seven-member Badge of Bravery Board within the Department of Justice. The Board is charged with designing the badge, selecting recipients and coordinating the presentation of the award. 
   Federal law enforcement officers perform an invaluable service in protecting our Nation from terrorist attacks, apprehending violent criminals, including sexual predators who prey on our children, and ensuring the safety of thousands of visitors to America's parks and forests each year. This badge of bravery is the least we can do to recognize the dedication and sacrifice of those injured in the line of duty. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (SMALL BUSINESS LENDING IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, today, Madam Chairwoman and I rise to support H.R. 1332, the Small Business Lending Improvements Act of 2007. I want to especially thank the chairwoman and the gentlelady, Congresswoman Bean, for working in a cooperative and bipartisan manner to bring this bill before the House, and I want to commend them for again working with us on this. 
   The Small Business Lending Improvements Act amends the Small Business Act to make necessary improvements and technical changes to the primary lending program offered by the Small Business Administration, the SBA, the 7(a) guaranteed loan program. H.R. 1332 also amends title V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to make significant and necessary changes to the loan program, sometimes called the 504 loan program. 
   Before addressing the particulars of the legislation, it is important to note what H.R. 1332 does not do. The legislation does not modify the subsidy rate for the 7(a) guaranteed lending program. The subsidy rate for the program currently is zero. After this bill is enacted, the subsidy rate for the 7(a) lending program will be zero. In fact, if this bill attempted to modify the subsidy rate, it could not because it would require an appropriation. And of course, as an authorizing committee, we are unable to appropriate. So any argument that this bill will cost hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars over 10 years or so is just plain wrong. 
   At the correct time, I will oppose adding a subsidy for a program that works just fine without one. 
   And now, I turn my attention to what this bill does. The SBA charges a fee to borrowers which can be viewed as akin to paying points on a mortgage, which many people are familiar with doing. In addition, banks pay an ongoing fee each year on the amount of unpaid balance of the loan as guaranteed. Although some confusion exists about this point, I read the Small Business Act as authorizing the SBA to adjust the up front fee or points paid by borrowers in the same way that the SBA has the unquestioned authority to reduce fees to lenders. Despite the authority that the SBA has, the agency has not in recent memory reduced, except when dictated by Congress, the up front fees paid by borrowers. The SBA, on the other hand, has modified the annual fee paid by the lender. The SBA even testified at a committee hearing recently that it would be reducing the fees paid by lenders. 
   Section 101 does two very important things. First, it clarifies that the SBA has the authority to reduce or increase the fees paid by the borrower. This should resolve any confusion as to whether the SBA has the power to reduce the points or up front borrowing fee, as well as the annual fee paid by the lender. And as already noted, section 101 requires that these fees be calculated to arrive at a zero subsidy. That is so that the fees will cover the cost of the 7(a) loan program, without an appropriation, as I just mentioned. The section then goes on to restrict the administrator's discretion in only one regard; if an appropriation is made to support the 7(a) loan program, section 101 directs the administrator to first utilize the funds to reduce fees to borrowers and not lenders. 
   I support this change because the Small Business Act is, first and foremost, legislation designed to assist small businesses, not to assist small banks or any other banks. Therefore, the bill takes the logical step of directing that, should funds be made available, the administrator should reduce the fees to small businesses, not to banks. 
   Section 101 also requires that the administrator update quarterly the reduction in fees given available funding remaining. That makes sense, because if the SBA did not make that calculation, they would not know how much to reduce fees in an upcoming quarter, if at all. The need for this calculation simply recognizes that loan demand is not constant throughout the year and ensures that administrator properly allocates available funds. Once funds are exhausted, the legislation simply directs the administrator to operate the program at zero subsidy, the up front annual fees needed to cover the cost of the 7(a) loan program as if there was no appropriation. 
   Finally, to the extent that loan demand is not high, and there are sufficient funds available, the administrator may use any available extra funds to reduce the annual fee paid by banks. Although this is a possibility, the greater probability is that all funds will be utilized to reduce cost to small business owners. 
   There is more to H.R. 1332 than providing the administrator with a mechanism to reduce fees under the 7(a) loan program, if an appropriation is available. The guaranteed loan program is the largest of the SBA's financing programs, reaching the greatest number of businesses, yet there are businesses whose access to this program remains limited. 
   The SBA loan program is a fairly complex operation, and many banks, particularly community banks, do not have a sufficient loan volume to justify the expenses associated with a 7(a) loan program. This is particularly true for independent and community banks located in rural areas. 
   The bill requires the SBA to establish a low-document, or LowDoc, loan program for banks located in rural areas. To the extent that a rural community has no bank willing to participate in the program, there is nothing in the Small Business Act or the bill that prohibits a small business from using a rural lender not in the immediate vicinity. 
   Title I also makes the Community Express Loan Program permanent. I support this because I believe it can provide the same assistance to low income communities, including those in my district in Cincinnati, which would otherwise be provided under a more costly micro loan program. 
   In addition to providing greater assistance in rural communities and low income communities, the bill also reduces the cost of the 7(a) loans to veterans. In addition, the bill also provides for a reduction in fees to medical practitioners seeking to establish or expand practices in areas deficient of such practitioners. These are noble goals and deserve the support of all Members of the House. 
   Although title I is a significant achievement, I am particularly pleased  with title II of this bill. It modifies and strengthens the loan program operator pursuant to title V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. 
   Certified development companies, or CDCs, are vital to long-term economic and community development in many districts, including mine, around the country. CDCs operate to provide long-term, fixed rate financing for small business concerns who find their financing needs cannot be met due to the loan limits of the 7(a) loan program.     
   And unlike many 7(a) lenders, CDCs must be locally based so they have a keen understanding of the needs of the communities they serve. 
   The first thing that title II does is change the name of the program. While this may sound minor, it is actually important. Colloquially, the program is known as the ``504 loan'' program for section 504 of title V of the Small Business Investment Act. This section authorizes the administrator to sell the loans made by the CDCs in a secondary market. It is not at all descriptive of the program or the entities involved in the program. By accurately describing the program, it will provide greater recognition to CDCs and enable them to better promote their important mission. 
   Section 202 makes important technical changes to the definitions in the CDC program, including, most importantly, defining the term ``certified development company.'' As a corollary, title II eliminates the outdated term ``qualified State and local development company'' from the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. 
   In my estimation section 203 is the most important provision in the bill. It statutorily establishes the procedures by which the SBA designates entities as CDCs. The most important requirement of these statutory procedures is the mandate that the CDC have local board members familiar with the economic development needs of their communities. Even though the bill authorizes expansion only into neighboring States, the CDC must have representatives that understand the local economic development needs of the new State of operation. 
   Another very important aspect of the bill authorizes CDCs to perform their own liquidations. Data that I have seen shows that current loan liquidation returns are about 20 cents on the dollar. Think of that. Only 20 cents on the dollar liquidation rate. That is very inadequate. By having CDCs with their local expertise perform liquidations, the government should get a better return when a loan goes bad, and that should save the taxpayers money. 
   Title II also makes other changes that will benefit greater financial opportunities to small businesses under the CDC program. Together all these changes made will ensure a robust CDC program that will spur economic development. 
   For these reasons I ask my colleagues to support passage of this important bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to again thank the chairwoman for her leadership on this particular piece of legislation, which I think is very good for small businesses across the country. 
   Mr. Chairman, as was mentioned in the Rules Committee yesterday I believe by Mr. Dreier, it's preferable for small businesses to get their loans through the private sector if they're able to do so. And as one who believes in less government as opposed to more government, that would certainly be my preference. But there are some cases in which the private sector at this point just wouldn't cover those particular entities, some of the start-up small businesses, especially some in struggling areas, some disadvantaged areas as we have in some urban areas, and some rural areas as well. And so there is an appropriate place for 7(a) loans and the 504 loans. As I mentioned, the name of that particular program is going to be changed as a result of this bill. 
   I think these are vital improvements. A streamlining of the process will be helpful to small businesses all across the country. I think we have a responsibility to improve the climate for small businesses, especially when one considers that somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of the new jobs that are created in this country are created not by large corporations, but by small businesses. So I think this bill helps businesses who need it most. I think this is a good bill, and so I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, this week is Small Business Week, a time to honor entrepreneurs for the contributions they make to this country. Small businesses create three out of every four new jobs. They are the economic backbone, and our largest job creators. 
   However, it is not easy to be a small business owner. They struggle every day to provide health care for their employees, to comply with increasing regulatory burdens, and to access financing to keep their businesses up and running. 
   This week, rather than just talk about supporting our Nation's 26 million small businesses, we have an opportunity to do something, provide them with the support they deserve, and ensure it is not a struggle to access much needed capital. 
   H.R. 1332 will make loans more economical while providing long-term stability for small business owners. Ensuring loans are affordable and that relief from rising capital costs is available is critical for small firms to remain a driving force in today's economy. Let's put the money back into the hands of entrepreneurs where it belongs. 
   I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Chabot, for his work and his leadership in working with me on this legislation. I also want to thank the staff that worked on this bill; from the minority staff, Mike Smullen, Barry Pineles and Kevin Fitzpatrick; and from the majority staff, Michael Day, Adam Minehardt, Andy Jiminez and Tim Slattery, and Elizabeth Hart and Sam Hodas from Representative Bean's staff. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for the Small Business Lending Improvements Act of 2007.

   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I want to commend the gentleman from Texas for offering a very thoughtful amendment here. 
   Oftentimes when you have a bill as complicated as this one is, the point of the bill obviously is pretty straightforward: It is to streamline and improve the process, make it more accessible to small business people, because that is one of the main problems that we have, that small businessmen have, and small businesswomen as well, is access to capital. 
   One has to look at this sometimes what do you do to benefit rural communities, and sometimes it is more urban communities. I happen to represent an overall fairly urban community, the city of Cincinnati. But I know the gentleman has a much larger district in mind, one in which the challenges may be somewhat different. And I think it is very good that the gentleman took the time to go through this bill with such care to find a way that he can benefit the people in his community and at the same time make it a better bill. 
   So I again commend the gentleman for his thoughtful approach to this bill, thank him for offering this amendment, and we are in a position to accept it. And I again thank him for his hard work on this. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, we are prepared to accept the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3678, the Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendments Act. 
   The Internet has changed the way we communicate, learn, and do business--all for the better. Since the Internet tax moratorium was first adopted, tremendous investment, growth and innovation in the scope and use of the Internet has occurred. By preventing unnecessary taxation of the Internet, Congress has fostered growth in productivity, spurred innovation, and widened public access to information. 
   This expansion is impressive. However, there is still more that Congress can do to ensure equal Internet access among all Americans. Permanently prohibiting unnecessary taxes, such as an Internet access, is the best course of action for accomplishing this goal. 
   Mr. Speaker, the surest way to stifle achievement, progress, and growth is to involve the Government. I urge my colleagues to use H.R. 3678 and its four year extension to work together to permanently extend the moratorium in order to foster the innovation and the free market that have been the formula for economic growth and prosperity.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THAT BANGLADESH SHOULD DROP CHARGES AGAINST SALAH UDDIN SHOAIB CHOUDHURY -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding; and, Mr. Speaker, I want to especially thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) and Mrs. Nita Lowey for their hard work in bringing this thoughtful resolution to the House floor today. 
   I was in Bangladesh about 3 weeks ago where I had the opportunity to meet with the new caretaker government, that leadership, as well as the leaderships in the two main political parties that are vying for power and have held power the last several decades. In fact, I met with our ambassador and members in the business community. 
   But one of the highlights and I think the most significant thing that I had an opportunity to do was to meet with the gentleman, Shoaib Choudhury, who is a journalist, and we have heard much talk about his situation this morning. But I think the gravity of it is significant, and I think it is important that this House is taking this action today. 
   Mr. Choudhury is a journalist in Bangladesh, known for his viewpoints which are favorable to expanding dialogue between Muslims and Jews and Christians and for developing ties with Israel. As was indicated, he was actually arrested on his way to Israel at the airport, and he is also trying to have more equality relative to religion and especially his observance and opposition to Islamic extremism, which unfortunately is on the rise in Bangladesh and in a number of regions. 
   Just as Islamic extremism and fundamentalism have been a danger in other areas of the world, it is a real problem in Bangladesh, and he has had the courage to speak out on this important issue. 
   Unfortunately, in a place where journalists are not necessarily given broad freedom of speech as our media would have here in this country, Mr. Choudhury was arrested and charged with sedition and accused of espionage and unjustly incarcerated for 17 months during which he received less than adequate treatment for glaucoma and other conditions from which he suffers. He is now facing charges which could bring the death penalty under Bangladesh law. 
   Now, several government leaders indicated that they do not intend to pursue the death penalty in this particular case; but when one considers the actions for which Mr. Choudhury was charged, this is not a person that should be jailed in the first place. This is a person who should be honored, as he has been around the world. You have to admire his strength and his resilience. 
   I asked him how he was being treated and spoke with him about the prospects for his trial. His next trial appearance was supposed to be February 28. At the time of my visit, Mr. Choudhury was encouraged by recent government assurances that his charges might be dropped or that they did not intend to go forward with the death penalty; but as it turns out, a radical Islamist-affiliated judge recently signed an order forcing the trial and the court proceedings to proceed. He is being accused of a threat to the security of Bangladesh. So much for a fair trial and just treatment. 
   This is something that really should get the attention not only of this House but the world. 
   This bipartisan resolution on the floor today urges the Bangladeshi Government to drop all charges against Mr. Choudhury. The United States Congress should show Mr. Choudhury that he can count on our full support and that the success of fledgling democracies such as Bangladesh lies squarely on the very freedoms that Mr. Choudhury embodies. 
   I am glad to be a cosponsor of this important resolution. I thank the Speaker for recognizing this and urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3678, the Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendments Act, as amended by the Senate. 
   The Internet has changed the way we communicate, learn, and do business--all for the better. Since the Internet tax moratorium was first adopted, tremendous investment, growth and innovation in the scope and use of the Internet has occurred. By preventing unnecessary taxation of the Internet, Congress has fostered growth in productivity, spurred innovation, and widened public access to information. 
   This expansion is impressive. However, there is still more that Congress can do to ensure equal Internet access among all Americans. As I stated when the House passed its 4-year extension, permanently prohibiting unnecessary taxes, such as an Internet access, is the best course of action for accomplishing this goal. 
   The surest way to stifle achievement, progress, and growth is to involve the government. I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 3678's 7-year extension and use this time to work together to permanently extend the moratorium in order to foster the innovation and the free market that have been the formula for economic growth and prosperity.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3867, the Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act. I strongly support the provisions in the bill that help those Americans, veterans of our Armed Forces, who have provided the great sacrifices to defend our freedom and our way of life. However, there are other provisions that are sufficiently problematic that makes it impossible for me to support the overall bill. 
   In 1997, Congress established the Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or HUBZone program. The program is designed to assist areas of low income and high unemployment by providing incentives for government contractors to relocate in these areas and expand their operations. By making it easier for small businesses located in HUBZones to win Federal contracts, Congress expected more government contractors to relocate in these areas and provide an important component to their revitalization.  
   As anyone who has traveled through many urban and rural districts realizes, they have a large number of HUBZones. Unfortunately, H.R. 3867 could make it more difficult for HUBZone firms to win government contracts and thereby detract from the ability of this program to help revitalize urban and rural areas that need greater economic development. 
   Mr. Chairman, while I concur with the Chair of the committee that we need to ensure that only firms eligible for the HUBZone program participate, it is unnecessary to take punitive action against HUBZone firms as a result of a few bad actors. I am sure that if we scrutinize each of the procurement programs, we could find a few bad actors in each. That justifies taking appropriate legal action against the bad actors. It does not, in our view, necessitate punishing the firms that complied with the letter and spirit of the law. 
   It also is important to note that a number of the issues raised in this legislation are being addressed by the administrator of the SBA. I certainly understand the frustration that Members of Congress have when the executive branch does not implement legislation in a timely manner. Nevertheless, one aspect of this bill involves a program that has not been implemented for 7 years. While that normally would suggest further legislative action, the administrator, we believe, is doing everything possible at this point to issue rules, a process that can take time. In addition, the program is the subject of a lawsuit in which the plaintiffs have not sought any subsequent court action for nearly 2 years since the Federal Court ruled that the SBA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and failed to implement the program. 
   Mr. Chairman, I also would point out that the bill as reported out of committee, in our opinion, would only complicate the implementation of the procurement program. While I understand that the chairwoman will be offering an amendment to correct that problem, it does so by classifying 92 percent of the industries in the United States as historically underrepresented by women businesses and Federal procurement. While I concur that women are historically underrepresented in the Federal procurement arena, the amendment paints, we believe, with a broad, over-inclusive brush, and may include numerous industries in which businesses are not underrepresented by women entrepreneurs. 
   I also need to point out that the bill would classify individuals as economically disadvantaged if they have assets exclusive of their primary residence and their business up to $550,000. So over a half million dollars. According to research by our staff, roughly half the Members of Congress, half the Members of this body would qualify as economically disadvantaged under that standard. I find it very difficult to believe that the average American would consider a Member of Congress to be economically disadvantaged. 
   These are only some of our concerns about the bill that we have before us here today. While some of these concerns are technical in nature, my primary dispute with the bill is that it continues, unfortunately, to segment the small business government contracting arena. The result is that, in our opinion, rather than growing opportunities for all small businesses, it pits all of these deserving groups against one another. That, in our view, undermines their ability to speak as a united front in debates over Federal procurement policy that would promote all of their interests. 
   Despite my disagreement with the chairwoman, I do not doubt her sincere desire to improve the SBA contracting programs. The Chair and her staff, particularly Michael Day and Adam Minehardt, should be commended for their efforts in trying to find a solution that I, in good conscience, could have supported. However, the philosophical gap was simply too large to span. Therefore, I cannot support this legislation. I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to a member of the Small Business Committee, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak).

   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, we have already stated our concerns about the bill in particular, but I would again emphasize the fact that the chairwoman did reach out, and her staff did as well. But philosophically, this was a bridge too far. We want to thank them again for working in a cooperative manner. This is a committee that under the Chair's direction has worked very much with the minority, and we want to thank them and hope that we  can continue to work together on bills in the future. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, the improvements made under H.R. 3867 are commonsense changes that would modernize and increase program accountability. Coupled with the sweeping reform the House passed earlier this year to our procurement system, this bill will have an immediate impact on every facet of the small business community, including women, minorities and service-disabled veterans. 
   It is for these reasons H.R. 3867 has some of the most diverse support of any bill coming out of the committee this year, ranging from small business trade groups including NFIB, the International Franchise Association and the Associated General Contractors to minority advocates such as the Black, Hispanic and Women's Chambers of Commerce. It also has the support of veterans groups, including the American Legion, VFW and AMVETS, as well as Aerospace Industries Association and the National Defense Industrial Association. 
   With the passage of H.R. 3867, we increase opportunities for entrepreneurs to become valuable suppliers to the Federal Government, recognizing their contribution to the economy. 
   I just would like to take a moment to thank the staff that worked on this legislation: from the Small Business Committee majority staff, Adam Minehardt, LeAnn Delaney and Michael Day; from the minority staff, Barry Pinclis and Kevin Fitzpatrick; and Nate Webb from Ms. Fallin's staff. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3867, Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act.

   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I thank the gentleman for offering his amendment. He has been willing to, I think, stand up and make courageous stands on occasion. I think he is to be commended for that. 
   Relative to this particular amendment, as I stated in my opening statement, I have some concerns of the bill in general because of the segmenting of various groups and sometimes pitting one against another and being competitive with each other, and so I can't say that I honestly would be in favor of a number of additional groups again further segmenting this. 
   But this just calls for a study and doesn't implement any particular groups or propose any additional new groups. So, for that reason, I would not oppose the amendment, and I want to thank him for his thoughtful consideration of this.

   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Bartlett from Maryland was previously going to offer the motion to recommit. He's not here; so I am going to offer it in his place, and I will be very brief. 
   This motion to recommit is really very simple. It reinstates the requirement that requires the government to set aside for competition contracts for small businesses located in HUBZones. As already noted, there is no reason to punish HUBZone firms by eliminating a mandatory competition requirement.     
   This motion will ensure that HUBZone firms will be able to carry out their purpose to redevelop low-income areas. 
   I also would just like to reiterate something that I said earlier when we were dealing with the overall bill in general, and that is that I want to again compliment the gentlelady from New York, Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez, for reaching out to the minority, as she has in the past, in trying to work together. There were just philosophical differences which could not be overcome on this bill. But the committee has worked very well together in a bipartisan manner, and I want to thank her for that cooperation. 
   It is my intention to continue to work together on bills in the future because we have supported most of the bills that come out of the Small Business Committee, and I think that's good for small business in this country because that's something that we do have in common, and that is, that we believe to our core that future job growth in this country is dependent upon the vitality of small businesses. And small businesses in this country have a lot of things that they have to deal with: high health insurance rates for their employees, energy costs that have been going through the roof, a tax structure which is, at this point, unclear as to where it's going to be in the future. That's why many of us on this side of the aisle believe to our core that we need to make those tax cuts that were passed back in 2001 and in 2003 permanent. We ought to allow small businesses to know what their taxes are going to be like next year and the year after and the year after so that they can depend upon that tax structure to grow their business and to make investments so that they can create jobs. Because ultimately, that's what it's all about, to keep the economy thriving so that we can create more and more jobs for people in this country. And keeping taxes low is probably the best thing that we can do to allow the small business community in this country to grow and prosper. 
   So again, I want to thank the members of the committee, the staff, and the gentlewoman for her cooperation and reiterate that, although a good-faith effort was made, we do support this motion to recommit and we do oppose and would urge my colleagues to oppose the overall bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   It is our view that veterans would not be in any way adversely affected if this motion to commit were to pass because they are already covered by the sole source area in the bill. So we just have an honest disagreement on this. We believe there is no way that veterans would be adversely affected if this motion to recommit would be passed. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Let me just say to the gentleman that I don't know why you insist this section 101 to be stricken when you clearly know that this amendment was defeated in committee, not by Democrats, but Democrats and Republicans. It is opposed by every veteran organization in America. 
   Again, it will take Federal contracting away from disabled veterans. You know that we have failed these veterans before, and what we are doing is making sure that they have an opportunity to get a fair share of Federal contracts.

   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3218, the Criminal History Background Checks Pilot Extension Act of 2008, which extends the Child Safety Pilot Program for volunteer organizations for an additional 6 months. 
   Originally created in 2003 under the PROTECT Act, the Child Safety Pilot Program has proven to be an effective resource for groups such as the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the National Mentoring Partnership, and the National Council of Youth Sports. 
   Through the pilot program, any nonprofit organization that provides youth-focused care, as defined in the National Child Protection Act of 1993, may request criminal history background checks from the FBI on applicants for volunteer or employee positions that entail working with children. 
   Currently, over 10,000 background checks have been administered through the Child Safety Pilot Program. Of those checks, 7.5 percent of all workers screened had an arrest or conviction on their record. Crimes uncovered included rape, child sexual abuse, murder, and domestic battery. Over 25 percent of applicants with a criminal record committed crimes in States other than where they were applying to work. If it weren't for the Child Safety Pilot Program, employers may not have known that the applicants had criminal records. 
   Volunteer organizations across the country are working hard to provide safe learning and growing environments for our children. That means hiring professional and responsible employees. S. 3218 extends a program that has successfully helped these groups do just that. 
   I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to join the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff) in support of H.R. 5057, the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act. 
   Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney introduced this legislation to reauthorize the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Elimination Grant Program through fiscal year 2014 at $151 million per year. 
   DNA has become an invaluable tool in identifying and convicting criminal suspects. At the same time, the increased use of DNA evidence in criminal prosecutions has also increased DNA collection and processing requests. The result is a substantial backlog in processing DNA evidence across the country. 
   The Debbie Smith program provides grants to State and local governments to reduce the DNA backlog of samples collected and entered into the national DNA database. The program, originally authorized in 2000, expires at the end of fiscal year 2009. 
   Since 2000, DNA backlog grants have assisted State and local governments with the collection of 2.5 million DNA samples from convicted offenders and  arrestees for inclusion in the national DNA database. The backlog grants have also funded the testing of approximately 104,000 DNA cases between 2004 and 2007. 
   While the Debbie Smith Program has indeed been successful in reducing the backlog, there is still work to do. A 2003 Department of Justice report indicated a backlog of 48,000 DNA samples. The current backlog is expected to be just as high. 
   Mr. Speaker, every 2.7 minutes a person becomes a victim of sexual assault in this country. That's 22 Americans every hour, 528 every day, and over 3,600 every week who are the victims of rape or sexual assault. Debbie Smith was one of these victims, and it took 6 years before her assailant was identified through DNA evidence. 
   I also would like to commend Debbie Smith and her family for their courage and determination to help others who may become victims and also to prevent others from becoming victims in the future. It's very commendable for her and very brave of her and her family to step forward and go through what they have gone through. 
   There is another aspect of this bill that I would also like to highlight, and that is the expansion of the grant program to locate and identify missing persons and human remains. There are estimated to be more than 40,000 sets of unidentified human remains just, oftentimes, literally sitting on the shelves in medical examiner offices or in law enforcement offices or in coroner offices around the country. These cases have been put at the bottom of the list far too often, while most recent cases are investigated and solved using DNA technology. Yet, many of the 40,000 are also victims of heinous crimes. 
   For example in 1996, a woman who became a very good friend of myself and the staff people in my office, Debbie Culberson, her daughter Carrie died a gruesome death. While the murderer was convicted and will serve the rest of his life in jail, Carrie has never been found. Evidence has led investigators to the Ohio River, which divides the States of Ohio and Kentucky, but we don't know for sure. 
   Grants such as those made available by H.R. 5057 will ensure that law enforcement nationwide have the resources to make identifying these human remains a priority as well. 
   Congress has a responsibility to assist States with investigating, prosecuting, and severely punishing those who commit rapes and other sexual offenses and provide justice for victims. The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act protects victims by providing Federal funding to process the DNA evidence needed to take violent criminals off the streets. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5464, a bill that would authorize the A Child is Missing Program for the next 5 years. 
   I would like to thank the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Klein) for his work on this important bill. 
   The A Child is Missing Program is an unsung tool that our law enforcement and communities have been using since 1997 to locate missing children and also elderly that are missing due to Alzheimer's or other difficulties. 
   I would also like to recognize the founder of this program that was founded back in January 1997. I had the opportunity to meet with her in Cincinnati, the Greater Cincinnati area, Norwood, in particular, Sherry Friedlander, who is in the gallery today. And if she could stand, I would like to acknowledge her. 
   Statistics released by the Center for Missing and Exploited Children reveal that more than 2,000 children go missing each day in this country. Let me repeat that, 2,000 children go missing every day in this country.     
   We know that the first couple of hours a child is missing are critical to the successful recovery of that child. While the AMBER Alert is a critical tool, it takes hours to initiate. The A Child is Missing program fills that void, alerting and mobilizing the community almost immediately. The A Child is Missing program has been credited with over 300 safe-assisted recoveries and is supported by law enforcement organizations all over the country. In my own district, the First District of Ohio, local law enforcement agencies have directly benefited from  the program. In fact, just this past May, we highlighted the program's success in the city of Norwood, as I mentioned before, Norwood, Ohio. 
   H.R. 5464 will ensure that the program has the resources it needs over the next 5 years to continue serving communities like Norwood, Ohio, and communities all over the country. I urge my colleagues to support this critical program by passing H.R. 5464.

   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 381, a resolution recognizing the dedication and achievements of Thurgood Marshall on the 100th anniversary of his birth. 
   Justice Marshall's life was full of distinction and firsts, including successfully arguing to overturn the separate but equal doctrine before the U.S. Supreme Court and the seminal case of Brown v. Board of Education, serving as the Nation's first African American solicitor general and later serving as the first African American U.S. Supreme Court justice, a position that he held for 24 years. 
   Still, at an early age with the premise that all men are created equal, Justice Marshall dedicated his life to bringing meaning to the protections enshrined in our Constitution. His work transformed this Nation. First, at the NAACP and later in the public sector, Justice Thurgood Marshall put civil rights at the forefront of this Nation's conscience, ensuring that the Constitution and rule of law applied fairly to all citizens. 
   I commend the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, Congressman Payne, for ensuring that Thurgood Marshall's legacy lives on. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   I rise in support of S. 231, a bill to reauthorize the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program through fiscal year 2012. 
   This bill continues to fund the Department of Justice Byrne/JAG Grant Program at the fiscal year 2006 level. The House passed companion legislation, H.R. 3546, just a few weeks ago. 
   The Byrne/JAG Program provides assistance to State and local law enforcement officials. These grants support a wide range of law enforcement activities to prevent and control crime and improve the criminal justice system. Byrne/JAG grants may be used to help pay for personnel, overtime, or equipment. Funds are also used for statewide initiatives, technical assistance, and training. 
   In June the FBI released its 2007 Unified Crime Report detailing the statistics for violent crime nationwide. The rate for violent crimes, including robbery, sexual assault, and murder, decreased nationally. However, the report also showed that the rate of violent crime increased in some communities across the country. 
   Our Nation's law enforcement officials are dedicated to preventing crime and keeping our communities safe, and their efforts should be applauded. Congress plays an important role in supporting State and local law enforcement officials by continuing to reauthorize programs like this at appropriate levels. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO END ITS CRACKDOWN IN TIBET -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1077, a resolution you introduced calling on the government of the People's Republic of China to end its crackdown in Tibet and to enter into a substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama to find a negotiated solution that respects the language, culture, and religious identity of the Tibetan people. 
   Madam Speaker, freedom, dignity, and respect are universal rights that should know no boundaries. When these rights are nurtured and protected, peace, prosperity, and harmony flourish among people and nations. When these rights are restricted, repressed, and ignored, each of us has an obligation to speak out, otherwise the world suffers. 
   Tibet has a long history of language, culture, and religion. Since the late 1500s, the teachings of the Dalai Lama and Buddhism have played integral roles in Tibet and throughout the world. The fact that Tibetans have lived under repressive conditions since China's crackdown in 1958, which led to the deaths of more than 10,000 Tibetans and sent the 14th Dalai Lama into exile, is inexcusable. 
   The fact that China has failed to live up to its commitment to improve its human rights record is intolerable. The continued attempts by the Chinese Government to placate the international community with promises cannot go unchallenged any longer. If China wants to be recognized as a world leader, it should start acting like one. A good first step would be to allow for vigorous political debate rather than suppressing it. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution and thank the distinguished gentlewoman from California, Madam Speaker, for her work on this issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, this motion is really quite simple. It continues the will of Congress, a will dating as far back as 1968 to allow the Delta Queen to operate within the inland waters of the United States. It's an exemption that's been granted by Congress on a number of occasions, eight times to be exact, most recently in 1996. However, unless it is renewed this year, this national treasure will be forced ashore unnecessarily. And unfortunately, an important chapter in our Nation's history will close. 
   For those who may be unfamiliar with the Delta Queen, and this is her right here, and its significance to this Nation, let me give you a brief history of what the Delta Queen is and is not. The Delta Queen is a symbol of our Nation's past serving as the last overnight operational steam paddle wheeler. She represents where we started as a Nation and our trials and tribulations and our progress over the years. 
   The Delta Queen is a registered national historic landmark and is a member of the National Maritime Hall of Fame. She is part of the greatest generation, honorably serving our country during World War II, first as a Navy barracks and later transporting servicemen to and from the Navy shipyards docked in the San Francisco harbor. 
   The Delta Queen provides jobs to American families and is a critical source of revenue for local communities, opening up towns and communities located along the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi Rivers such as Ashland, Kentucky; Gallipolis, Ohio; and Clarksville, Indiana, to tourists and allowing mom-and-pop businesses to flourish. 
   Contrary to what some opponents to this motion would have you believe, the Delta Queen is not a safety risk. In fact, the Delta Queen is inspected by the United States Coast Guard more than six times a year and has operated since 1968 without significant incident. 
   Indeed, when Congress first created the inland water exemption from fire retardant regulation, it recognized that vessels such as the Delta Queen would never be more than a short distance from shore, circumstances much different than ocean liners and other vessels that traverse the oceans. 
   House Report 93-289 indicates that an inclusion of this was inadvertent. That's why Congress has granted this exception eight times since 1968. Eight times. Moreover, despite its exemption, the Delta Queen has, and continues to operate, in accordance with the safety notification requirements set forth in section 3503(b) of the United States Code and the Coast Guard. 
   In addition, the Delta Queen has gone above and beyond these requirements, installing state-of-the-art fire and smoke detection and sprinkler systems, as well as mandating fire training for its crew, all of which have been approved by the Coast Guard. Every single stateroom on there has sprinklers within it. In fact, just last month, the owners of the Delta Queen replaced the vessel's boiler at the request of the Coast Guard. And just last month, the Delta Queen was most recently inspected by the Coast Guard and was given a clean bill of health. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't understand why continuing the Delta Queen's current exemption for an additional 10 years has generated such opposition. In fact, last session, this body unanimously supported this exemption, passing it by a voice vote. Just last year we did this exact thing that I am asking to be done today. Unfortunately, it was stalled over in the Senate. 
   I can only conclude that the opposition that we're seeing is not really about the Delta Queen. It's really about a labor dispute. If this is true, why should the American people be victims, losing access to this national landmark? Why should American jobs be lost? Why should local businesses be literally ruined all because of a labor dispute? I hope that unions do not have that type of influence here in Washington or here in this Congress. 
   Let's put all of the politics aside and do the right thing here, and I urge my colleagues to stand up for the Delta Queen right here. 1926, no major incidence since that entire time. And there is no reason why we shouldn't save this historic ship here. Keep part of our history alive here by supporting this motion. This really ought to be bipartisan, and I urge you to support this motion to recommit.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (NO OIL PRODUCING AND EXPORTING CARTELS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2264, the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2007. 
   First, I would like to thank the distinguished gentleman from Michigan, Chairman Conyers, for his hard work and his leadership on this bill. We have worked together in previous Congresses to move this bill, and I am very pleased to see it moving on the floor here today. 
   I also want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller) for their leadership in supporting the passage of this legislation as well. 
   Since last week when we first considered this bill, gas prices have increased another 10 cents to a record level in this country of over $3.27 a gallon. Before heading to the airport to come back here from my district in Cincinnati, just yesterday, I filled up in my 1993 Buick and it was $3.19 in Cincinnati by the University of Cincinnati, $32. And my constituents back home in Cincinnati are very concerned, and rightly so, particularly as we enter the peak summer driving season, which begins this weekend. 
   I happen to have a tele-town hall meeting where hundreds and hundreds, probably thousands of people in my district were on the line and we were talking about a range of issues, this issue, high gas prices in my district. And as Chairman Conyers mentioned, the State of Michigan has the highest in the whole country. People are really concerned about this; this is really hitting hard and it is something that we need to deal with in this Congress. 
   I am very disappointed in the President that this message indicates, whether or not they know how to spell the word ``President,'' that they are going to veto this bill if it is passed. I think we ought to send it to the President and let the chips fall where they may. This is long overdue legislation. I urge its passage. 
   The other issue, by the way, which was of great interest to my constituents last night in the tele-town hall meeting was, not surprisingly, the immigration issue. We heard the Senate reached an agreement just recently on, in my view, an extremely flawed agreement which is going to be debated over there and then debated over here. Those are the two principal issues my people back in Cincinnati are concerned about. 
   These continued price hikes take their toll on consumers directly at the gas pump, as well as impacting their everyday lives and raising the cost of things like going to the grocery store or going to work or even planning a vacation. I mean, this is the time when people are deciding whether they are going to take the kids to King's Island up the road from my district in Cincinnati, or if they are going to go to Disney World down in Florida in Mr. Keller's area. But when you have gas prices at $3.20-plus per gallon, this is not only going to put a damper on vacation and disappointing our kids, but it is significantly going to weigh down this economy. 
   I think there is no question that if gas prices remain this high, it is going to have a significant impact on the economy. Jobs and other things are at risk. 
   Passing H.R. 2264 would be a positive first step to allaying concerns that the American public has expressed about these uncontrollable price surges. Over the last decade, it has become alarmingly clear that America is far too dependent on foreign oil to meet our energy needs. Disturbingly, we import, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, more than two-thirds of the oil we consume, much of it from OPEC, and much of it from some of the more unstable areas of the world--Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and of course we get some from Nigeria and Venezuela. As Mr. Keller mentioned, we have down there Mr. Chavez who seems to be following in the footsteps of Fidel Castro. Those are the types of countries that we are depending on for our oil, and that has to change. 
   At the same time the number of refineries operating in the United States has decreased from over 300, 324 to be exact back in 1981, to fewer than 150, 148 to be exact. So we have cut the number of refineries available in half over that period of time, and we haven't built another oil refinery since 1976, over 30 years ago now. 
   There is no doubt that we need to focus on both short-term and long-term  strategies to address these issues. We need increased domestic production and refining capabilities, and we need to put a stronger emphasis on alternative energy and conservation efforts.     
   But this strategy to make us less oil-dependent and to put us on more sound footing also has to include breaking up the cartels that play a primary role in manipulating, and I emphasize manipulating, the market. We talk about supply and demand and all that, but OPEC countries are manipulating the supply of oil in the world. 
   For decades, OPEC nations have conspired, and again I emphasize that, conspired to limit supplies and to drive up prices of imported crude oil, gouging American consumers, in violation of our Nation's antitrust laws. OPEC accounts for more than two-thirds of the global oil production and exports more than 65 percent of the oil traded internationally. Thus, it's abundantly clear that OPEC's influence in the market dominates. 
   H.R. 2264, as some of my colleagues have already mentioned, attempts to break up this cartel and subject these colluders and their anticompetitive practices to the antitrust scrutiny that they so richly deserve. Specifically, this bill would amend the Sherman Act to make it illegal for foreign countries to collude, to restrain output or fix prices of oil, gas or any petroleum product. In addition, this bill gives the Attorney General the authority to enforce the antitrust provisions against these nations. 
   Importantly, the bill also anticipates any protected nation defense or immunity that OPEC nations may proffer, specifically exempting them from the Foreign Sovereignty Immunities Act if they are engaged in price fixing, which they clearly are, or other anticompetitive activities with regard to pricing or production or distribution. 
   This bill is a necessary and appropriate response to deal with those who are not willing to deal fairly with the American consumer. I urge my colleagues to support competition and consumers by supporting H.R. 2264. 
   And I want to again thank Mr. Conyers for his leadership in this area. It's far overdue that we pass this act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 916, a resolution recognizing Catholic Schools Week and honoring the contributions that Catholic schools make to our Nation's country and to the youth of this Nation in particular. Having been a product of the Catholic school system in Cincinnati, Ohio, myself, having attended Holy Family School and then St. Catherine School and then LaSalle High School, and having had both of our children attend Our Lady of Lourdes School, my wife attended Mother of Mercy, as did our daughter in high school, my son is a senior at St. Xavier High School, and coincidentally they happened to win the State football championship in Ohio this year for the second time in the last 3 years, I  can say firsthand that Catholic school systems in our community and all over the country are providing significant leadership in the great education for our youth. 
   I also happened to be a school teacher at St. Joseph School in the west end in Cincinnati after I graduated from college. And Catholic schools provide a comprehensive and wide-ranging education to all of the students. Not only do Catholic schools promote the intellectual and physical cultivation of our most important asset, our country's youth, but they also lay the groundwork for a strong, moral upbringing resulting in well-rounded contributing members of our society. 
   The Cincinnati Archdiocese consists of 117 schools totaling over 47,000 students. I am proud to say that several of these schools are located in Ohio's First District, including two schools, Our Lady of the Visitation and St. James School in White Oak who recently received the 2007 Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award from the Department of Education. 
   I want to urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I want to thank those here today for their leadership in bringing this forward. 
   And I might note, Mr. Gingrey of Georgia mentioned the issue of life and the moral issues that are instilled in many of us from our Catholic upbringing. I happen to be the principal sponsor of the ban on partial birth abortion, and we had many, tens of thousands of people who came here yesterday to advocate on behalf of innocent, unborn children. And we had many come by our office yesterday, older high school students, St. Xavier High School students, St. Ursula, Mother of Mercy, Our Lady of Lourdes, many schools came by. And I want to thank them for doing that and their showing that the morals, the values that they are being taught in those schools really are sinking in. And I just want to thank those in the leadership position here for bringing forth this issue. And I think it is appropriate that we honor the Catholic school systems all across the country for the invaluable work that they do for our country.

   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 852, a resolution which establishes January 2008 as National Stalking Awareness Month. And I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) for his leadership on this issue. I also thank the ranking member, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) for his leadership, as well as the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott). 
   Last year, 2007 represented the first national effort to recognize January as National Stalking Awareness Month. I would encourage all of my colleagues to continue their support for this resolution since stalking is much more dangerous than many people believe it is. 
   Unlike the glamorized stalking scenes depicted in some Hollywood movies, in reality stalking is dangerous and considered a criminal act in all 50 States and in the District of Columbia and by the Federal Government. More than 1.4 million Americans are victims of stalkers in this country every year. Stalking victims are both men and women from all socioeconomic backgrounds, and they are often stalked by intimate partners. 
   Additional statistics released by the National Center for Victims of Crime are even more disturbing. These statistics reveal that 81 percent of female stalking victims are also physically assaulted. One out of every five stalking cases involves the use of a weapon, and one-third of stalkers are repeat offenders. They have done it before. 
   These statistics indicate that stalking is not as harmless as some would lead us to believe in the movies or on television shows. We must continue to bring attention to the dangers stalkers pose in our communities and the services and the resources available to respond and address this criminal activity. Passage of H. Res. 852 is an important step in accomplishing this goal. 
   I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) for their leadership on this issue. I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (SUPPORTING THE MISSION AND GOALS OF NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this important resolution. 
   The recognition of National Crime Victims' Rights Week continues the legacy of an individual who committed himself to elevating the status of crime victims in this country. Among the many contributions made during his Presidency, President Ronald Reagan's leadership and vision in advancing the cause of crime victims is immeasurable. Recognition of National Crime Victims' Week reflects just one of a number of accomplishments which also include national days of observance, creating the Office of Victims of Crime, and establishing the Task Force on Victims of Crime. 
   Too often, victims of crime are made to be victims a second time, this time as a result of our criminal justice system, the very system designed to protect them. In 2004, 20 years after Congress enacted the Victims of Crime Act which authorized the Victims Assistance Fund, Congress enacted the Justice for All Act. This was another important victory for crime victims, as it extended a number of enforceable rights to crime victims, including the right to reasonably be heard at any public proceeding involving release, or plea or sentencing, the right to file a motion to reopen a plea, or a sentence in certain circumstances, and most importantly, the right to be treated with dignity and fairness and respect. 
   However, the enactment of these rights is just one of a number of important changes that needs to occur to ensure that our Nation's criminal justice system is just for both offenders and for the victims of those crimes. 
   Continued recognition and support of National Crime Victims' Week serves many purposes, including to remind us of what victims have suffered, to thank those individuals and organizations who have selflessly dedicated themselves to assisting victims, and to urge us all to rededicate ourselves to continue President Reagan's vision and leadership in advancing the cause of victims of crime. 
   And I also want to note that for a number of years a number of us have worked very hard to pass a victims' right constitutional amendment. Now, we ought not to amend the Constitution unless it is absolutely necessary. And I think this is one incident in which it is necessary because the criminals, the defendants, their rights are contained within the Constitution itself. The right to a trial, for example. The right to have witnesses called on their behalf, the right not to have to self-incriminate all are within the Constitution. However, the victims, not a word in the Constitution. 
   There are laws that have been passed, such as the law which gives a victim the right to be heard at a sentencing hearing or have family members heard at a sentencing hearing, but those are statutes. Oftentimes what happens is they come into conflict, and a judge will have to make a decision because they may be in conflict with each other. 
   The defendant has his or her rights within the Constitution. They are up here. The victim, their rights down here are statutory. And when it comes to deciding which one is going to prevail, the Constitution will trump that statute every time. Therefore, the crime, the one who committed the crime, the defendant, the criminal, their rights are held higher than the victims. That is just not right. 
   That is why Henry Hyde, when he was a Member of Congress, had introduced this some years ago, and about 5 years ago I took that up, took up the mantle for Henry to continue to push this way, and we have made progress. We have made progress in the law; but thus far, it is still not within the Constitution and it ought to be. 
   I want to thank the gentlewoman and Mr. Scott also for pushing for this particular resolution this week. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to support all victims of crime all across the country.

Elm Avenue Primary School, Hilltop Primary School, Our Lady of Visitation, and St. James School in White Oak have recently been named 2007 Blue Ribbon Schools of Excellence. 
   Achieving test results in the top 10 percent of the State is truly an accomplishment. Some, like St. James, have received it in the past. On Monday, I presented them a flag that was flown in their honor over this very building, and the atmosphere was really electric. These kids were filled with enthusiasm and pride for the job they had done, and they are to be commended, as are their teachers, their administrators, the parents, but especially the students.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to H.R. 1908, the Patent Reform Act, that we are considering here now. While this bill has been improved since its introduction back in April, the scheduling of this bill for consideration today makes one question whether reform really is the majority's objective. 
   Why else would we push a bill through on a Friday afternoon under a structured rule that will only allow a few selected amendments even to be considered? In fact, since this bill was reported from the Judiciary Committee in July, several of us, as well as the stakeholders, have asked the leadership to slow this bill down to ensure that we have a true reform bill that is fair and equitable to all who use the patent system. 
   I believe the bill in its current form, and even if the manager's amendment is adopted, fails to strengthen the system Congress created to foster and protect innovation. In fact, more than 100 companies, unions, universities, coalitions and other organizations have voiced their concerns with this bill. 
   These entities, users of the patent system, believe that the changes proposed by this act and the amendments we are considering today will be harmful to their respective businesses, will be bad for the economy, and could threaten our status as the number one patent system in the world. If that is even possible, why would we rush to pass a bill that could jeopardize the very industries and employees that have made this Nation what it is today? 
   Innovation is the heart and soul of this country. What has made the U.S. the strongest patent system in the world is its ability to adapt to different business models and innovations, protecting those who invent, while at the same time encouraging public dissemination. 
   Of course, our patent system is not perfect. The Small Business Committee that I happen to be the ranking member of held a hearing on March 29th,  2007, examining how small businesses use the patent system and the impact that this patent reform would have on them. The most revealing aspect of the hearing was the consensus among members and panelists that Congress should be very careful in making significant change to the system. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of S. 863, the Emergency and Disaster Assistance Fraud Penalty Enhancement Act of 2007, and I want to thank and commend the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) for his leadership on this bill as well. 
   In January of this year, I introduced a companion bill, H.R. 846, that would create a new criminal offense and enhance current Federal penalties for fraud associated with major disasters and emergency benefits. 
   Madam Speaker, August 29, 2005 was a day that this country will never forget. The images of destroyed homes, neighborhoods, communities, displaced families and friends, and lives literally torn apart by Hurricane Katrina especially will not easily fade from our memories. 
   The devastation in the gulf coast region reminds us of a tragedy that we would expect to see in Third World countries, not in our country, and particularly not in regions known for their history and their character. 
   Since Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma devastated the gulf coast more than 2 years ago, Congress has provided more than $117 billion in relief to the region, including reconstruction efforts, medical services, human services, including funds for unemployment and housing assistance, crisis counseling, and various other needs of the victims. In addition, charities like the Red Cross and Salvation Army have contributed several billion dollars more to the effort, and many, many volunteers contributed their time.     
   To no one's surprise, almost immediately after FEMA and private charities began administering funds to victims, reports of fraud began to surface, such as noneligible persons filing false claims for benefits, and the creation of phony Katrina-related Web sites designed to exploit those who wished to make legitimate disaster relief contributions. 
   More elaborate and organized schemes have also come to light, including a group in Bakersfield, California, which conspired with employees of a Red Cross call center to defraud the charity by obtaining false claims information in order to collect assistance payments through Western Union. These scams don't just affect disaster victims, but the charities, donors and taxpayers who provide this assistance. 
   Federal law enforcement officials, including the Department of Justice, responded to the problem. In September 2005, the Hurricane Katrina Fraud Task Force was formed to mobilize the resources of the Federal Government, including Department of Justice, Homeland Security, Treasury, the FBI, FDC  and other Federal partners, as well as representatives of State and local law enforcement. 
   Since its formation in 2005, the task force has assisted 41 United States Attorneys to prosecute more than 768 people to date. In addition, the Task Force Joint Command Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, continues to receive more than 700 calls each month through its nationwide hotline and has screened and referred more than 14,000 leads to law enforcement agencies and field offices across the country. 
   Yet, despite these efforts, it is clear that current criminal penalties are insufficient to deter disaster fraud. For example, in the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Louisiana alone, 128 individuals have been charged with hurricane-related fraud.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today I rise in support of H.R. 7175, the Small Business Lending Improvements Act of 2008. I especially would like to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for working in a cooperative and bipartisan manner to bring this important bill to the House floor. Once again, she has done so. She has been working in such a manner for the last 2 years. I commend her for that. 
   All of us are aware of the recent turmoil in the financial markets. These problems also directly impact America's small businesses. Availability of credit is reduced thereby dampening the capacity of small businesses to create much-needed jobs. Yet it's not just the availability of credit that adversely impacts America's small business owners. These people are also ordinary men and women with the same concerns about the value of their homes, the safety of their investments, the spiking interest rates, and the outlook for the future of their children that every American has to be concerned about in these uncertain times. 
   The bill before us today will not remedy all of these problems, but it will make important improvements in the capacity of small businesses to obtain needed capital without further adding to the potential problems facing our financial sector. 
   Although the changes in the bill are modest, they include key components of H.R. 1336 that the House overwhelmingly passed back in 2007. These modifications will increase the availability of credit for small businesses and reduce unnecessary paperwork on lenders without undermining the scrutiny provided by the Small Business Administration of the lenders or borrowers. 
   Title I makes very modest changes to the operation of the SBA's core 7(a) lending program. Nevertheless, these changes will improve the liquidity in the small business lending market while making the loans available to more small businesses. It's important to note that nothing in title I changes the standards under which the SBA guarantees the issuance of loans or alters the fact that the program operates without any taxpayer subsidy. I want to reiterate that: Operates without any taxpayer subsidy. 
   I'm most proud of title II of H.R. 7175. It modifies and strengthens the loan program operated pursuant to title V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. Certified development companies, or CDCs, are vital to long-term economic and community development in my district and throughout the country. CDCs operate to provide long-term fixed-rate financing for small business concerns who find their financing needs cannot be met due to the loan limits of the 7-day loan program. And unlike many 7-day lenders, CDCs must be locally based so they have a key understanding of the needs of the communities they serve. 
   The first thing that title II does is change the name of the program. While this may sound minor, it will provide greater recognition to CDCs and enable them to better promote their important mission of local economic development. 
   Section 202 makes important technical changes to the definitions in the CDC program, including, most importantly, defining the term ``certified development company.'' As a corollary, title II eliminates the outdated term ``qualified state and local development company'' from the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. 
   In my estimation, section 203 is the most important provision in the bill. It statutorily establishes the procedures by which the SBA designates entities as CDCs. The most important requirements of the statutory procedures is the mandate that the CDC have local board members familiar with the economic development needs of the community. Even though the bill authorizes expansion only into neighboring states, the CDC must have representatives that understand the local economic development needs of the new state of operation. 
   Another very important aspect of the bill authorizes the CDCs to perform their own liquidations. Under the current process, the SBA performs liquidations and only receives about 20 cents on the dollar, a wholly inadequate return on guarantees issued by the Federal Government. 
   By having CDCs with their local expertise performing liquidations, the taxpayers will receive a better return on their guarantee, something essential given current conditions in the financial markets. 
   Title II also makes other changes providing greater financial opportunities for small businesses under the CDC program and enhance local economic development without placing any undue risk on the taxpayer. 
   Finally, title III of H.R. 7175 makes some technical changes to the operation of the small business investment company program. By making it easier to calculate investment limits, SBICs will be better able to manage their portfolios thereby increasing the overall value of their portfolios without placing the Federal taxpayer at any increased risk. 
   Together, all of these changes made will spur economic development, which is really one of the key things we need to do at this time. 
   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support passage of this. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank my House and Senate colleagues today for their ongoing leadership on this critical issue. Today is another significant step in our effort to protect our Nation's most precious asset--our children. Together with the PROTECT Act, which the House considered earlier, we are sending a message to predators that we will not let you get our children. 
   The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, that we passed two years ago and which increased national registration requirements and penalties on sex offenders, was a much needed response to the growing threats our Nation's children face each and every day. 
   However, the threat still exists and, in fact, continues to grow, particularly as technology advances. Social Web sites such as MySpace and Facebook give our kids new ways to interact. Yet, they also open doors for sexual predators to target them--making it essential that our laws keep up with technology. 
   The bills that we are considering today send the message that we will not tolerate this disturbing trend. The Keeping the Internet Devoid of Sexual Predators Act, or KIDS Act, of 2007, ensures that our laws and the resources needed to catch and keep these criminals off the street are as up-to-date as the technology that our kids are using. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'll be brief. Let me just start by saying that I appreciate both the chairman's and the ranking member's work on this critical issue. Drugs and cartels and the violence and terror that they bring not only undermine public safety but threaten our security as a Nation. We need to work cooperatively with those nations that are on the front lines of this drug war that we've been involved in for such a long time. 
   However, I want to mention one fact that I think is very important. Last summer, news reports highlighted the unwillingness of the Mexican Government to work with the U.S. to resolve a mile and a half boundary dispute near Columbus, New Mexico. Because  of a mapping error, the fence that we're building was constructed on Mexican land. Although the U.S. government promptly notified the Mexican Government of the error, the Mexican Government demands that the mistake be corrected at a cost of $3 million to the United States; this, despite the fact that the previously existing boundary had never been in dispute prior to notification by the U.S., and the fact that the U.S. has provided more than $270 million in aid to Mexico between 2004 and 2007, including more than $140 million for counter-narcotics and law enforcement. 
   Today, we are authorizing funding for an additional $1.6 billion over 3 years. Last July, I introduced House Resolution 545, which states that it is the sense of this Congress that if Mexico doesn't work together to resolve this boundary dispute, U.S. assistance to Mexico should be reduced in a corresponding amount; in other words, $3 million. If it is costing the taxpayers of this country $3 million to do this, which was previously an undisputed border area, it seems like it ought to come out of their money and not ours, since we were the ones that brought it to their attention to begin with.     
   Now, some people up here in Washington may think that $3 million isn't a lot of money. Well I can tell you it is a lot of money to the folks back in my district and districts all over this country, particularly when you figure that we are spending approximately $4 a gallon for gas nowadays. So it is a lot of money and ought to be taken seriously. 
   If the U.S. and Mexico are truly partners, and we claim to be, and they claim to be, we should be working together in all areas, including the construction of this fence. We ought to be working cooperatively in this matter. And it plays a key role in our international interdiction efforts, not to mention the border security. 
   So this $3 million, if we are going to have to go back and rebuild this because of this good faith error, I believe that ought to be taken out of the U.S. aid which is going in their direction, and not from the U.S. taxpayer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2992, the SBA Trade Programs Act of 2007. The committee worked in a cooperative and bipartisan basis to bring these changes in the SBA's operation of its programs to enhance small business participation in the global economy. H.R. 2992 represents the Small Business Committee's continued commitment to promotion of international trade by America's small businesses. 
   The Small Business Administration has a number of general entrepreneurial assistance programs that provide technical advice to small business owners. However, international trade is an area that is fraught with regulatory issues requiring specialized knowledge that may not be available from the SBA's entrepreneurial partners. 
   It is not surprising to find that the SBA created other programs to meet the needs of small business exporters that rely on personnel with specialized knowledge about the international trade regulatory regime. These programs, as well as the SBA efforts to coordinate with other agencies such as the Department of Commerce, have resulted in remarkable gains in exports. 
   There are about a quarter of a million small businesses that export. Revenue increased from $102.8 billion to $203 billion in 2004. There's no doubt that small businesses are playing a vital role in reducing America's trade deficit. Continuation of this success and even greater impetus on small business exporting will benefit the American economy. 
   H.R. 2992 requires the Small Business Administration to expand its trade  outreach initiatives and improve coordination of its trade promotion activities with those of other Federal agencies such as United States Trade Representative, the Department of Commerce, and the Export-Import Bank. 
   The bill will increase the capacity of America's small businesses to export. This will reduce our trade deficit and increase our national and economic security. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield to one of the bill's original cosponsors, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak), who is also the vice-Chair of the Small Business Committee, as much time as he may consume.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (MICROLOAN AMENDMENTS AND MODERNIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3020, the Microloan Amendments and Modernization Act. 
   The chairwoman and I have worked together on a cooperative basis to bring this technical but important piece of legislation to the floor. H.R. 3020 represents the first substantive change in the Microloan Program in more than 6 years. 
   According to Dr. Mohammad Yunus, the 2006 Nobel Laureate in Peace and founder of the Grameen Bank, ``microcredit views each person as a potential entrepreneur and turn on the tiny economic engines of a rejected portion of society.'' 
   Unlike Bangladesh or other countries that have emulated the Grameen Bank, microcredit in the United States is not aimed at a rejected portion of society, but rather at those individuals who do not have access to commercial financial institutions and the typical resources to manage those funds. Despite the different target audiences, microlending in the United States represents a variation of the concept developed by Dr. Yunus. 
   The Small Business Administration created a pilot program based on the success of the Grameen Bank, and Congress created a permanent authority for the program back in 1992. SBA does not provide microcredit directly to entrepreneurs; instead, the SBA provides below market-rate loans to nonprofit intermediaries. These institutions then make loans to entrepreneurs. 
   As with other SBA financing programs, the SBA does not provide all the funds for financing. Intermediaries must contribute 15 percent of the value of loans in non-Federal funds. But the key to the success of microlending is not the loans; rather, it is the education and counseling that the intermediaries provide to their borrowers. 
   With this knowledge, these entrepreneurs are able to manage their financial resources and ensure repayment of loans. This success is demonstrated by the very low number of defaults by borrowers and cost-effective means by which it produces nearly 10,000 jobs a year in areas, including parts of my district in Cincinnati, that need economic revitalization. 
   Despite its success, the Microloan Program needs to be revised in light of changes to the economy during the past 6 years and, in some cases, to update matters that have not been altered since the program's inception more than 15 years ago. 
   Microlenders exist, mainly because normal commercial lending institutions did not provide access to credit for those who are highly credit risky. One way to improve that is to have borrowers' histories passed along to credit bureaus. I think having the SBA work with the intermediaries to accomplish the delivery of credit histories will benefit borrowers. 
   H.R. 3020 also enables the intermediaries to determine the length of credit that will be made available to the borrowers. Given the expertise of the intermediaries, it makes abundant sense for the determinations on the length of loans to rest with the intermediaries and borrowers. 
   I want to emphasize that this change has no impact on the loan obligations of the intermediaries to the SBA. The change involves no risk to the Federal Treasury. 
   H.R. 3020 also raises the level of the average loan size in an intermediary's portfolio from $7,500 to $10,000. This level has not been changed since 1992, and an adjustment is appropriate to take account of inflation in the intervening 15 years. 
   The SBA rightly focuses on the number of small businesses that receive help from its entrepreneurial training partners. However, ensuring that only those individuals with the right aptitude start small businesses is as important as the provision of the technical assistance to businesses that have been in existence for years. 
   The Microloan Amendments and Modernization Act recognizes the importance of this training and increases the amount of pre-loan training that intermediaries may provide. H.R. 3020 also provides for an increase in the amount of technical assistance training that intermediaries can contract for from other sources. 
   As the committee heard in testimony from Professor Lisa Servon, this will enable intermediaries to focus on those services that they are best able to perform. Finally, the committee heard from two different witnesses that the cap on interest rates should be removed. 
   We also heard that a rise in interest rates will enable intermediaries to recoup more of their costs, thereby reducing the amount of funds that they must raise from other sources. I would ask that the chairwoman work with us as the bill moves through legislative process to ensure that intermediaries have maximum flexibility to operate their loan programs with the elimination of the interest rate cap. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for introducing this important piece of legislation, and I also want to thank the staff that worked on this legislation, from the minority staff, Barbara Pineles; from the majority staff, Ross Orban, Michael Day, Adam Minehardt and Andy Jimenez. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Microloan Program.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (HONEST LEADERSHIP AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   We have been waiting for 5 months now to see on the House floor a package of reforms that largely reflect those that were in the Republican reform bill that passed the House last Congress over a year ago. 
   Now that the majority has finally scheduled this reform legislation for consideration, the House has an opportunity to build on Republicans' previous reform efforts. This motion to recommit does just that. To strengthen the legislation, this motion to recommit would do the following: It would close the existing loophole that allows State and local government entities to give gifts and travel to Members and their staff that other entities can't give. 
   This motion to recommit also contains a provision that could be described as a reverse revolving door provision. It would prohibit a congressional employee who was a registered lobbyist prior to his or her congressional employment from knowingly making during the course of official business any communication or appearance before their former private employer on a matter relating specifically to that former private employer for a period of 1 year. 
   This motion to recommit would also require lobbyists to disclose which special projects they lobbied for. If a special interest lobbyist is having closed-door meetings with Members of Congress regarding programs that do not benefit all Americans but only benefit a small group of people in one part of the country, then this motion to recommit would require those projects be disclosed. 
   Finally, this motion to recommit includes H.R. 2317 in the form that passed the House earlier today. With the inclusion of the amendment adopted by the motion to recommit, H.R. 2317 now requires that bundled contributions to political action committees, often referred to as PACs, be disclosed. 
   Let me be clear: Mr. Emanuel said during the debate on this bill that this bill is the bill that will be conferenced with the Senate bill. Only by passing this motion to recommit can we guarantee that the vital fix we make to the bundling provisions in the previous motion to recommit will be conferenced with the Senate bill. This motion to recommit is the true test of Members' commitment to what they voted for earlier today. 
   So if you voted for the previous motion to recommit and you really want the fix included in the conference, you must support this motion to recommit as well. 
   The majority has brought to the floor a package that does not quite reach the standard set by House Republicans last Congress; but we all have this last opportunity today to show America that not only will we raise that standard to meet our efforts last Congress, but we will raise that standard even higher. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake).

   In 2000, Mr. Culbertson was instrumental in the establishment of Chapter 3620, and his dedication and patriotism were recognized earlier this year at the annual National Purple Heart Convention, where he was named the top Americanism Officer in the United States, an honor he truly deserves. 
   The sense of spirit, patriotism and generosity exhibited by the members of Chapter 3620 reflect the dedication, enthusiasm and commitment of their Americanism Officer, Tim Culbertson. It gives me great pleasure to recognize Tim for his accomplishments, and I congratulate him on receiving this national award, and I thank him for his contributions to all the veterans of the First District of Ohio.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR THE GREATER WASHINGTON SOAP BOX DERBY -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. 
   I think it is wonderful that we are talking about the Soap Box Derby. It is a good thing that it doesn't require any energy or any gasoline, because the gas prices in this country are higher than I think anybody would have expected in our lifetimes. It is about $4 a gallon now, and people are asking me in my district, what are we going to do about this? What can we do about it? 
   Well, we should have done something about this a long time ago. The principal reason we are seeing these high gas prices is because we are far too dependent on foreign sources of energy. Why is that? Well, I know that as this one Member from Ohio can tell you, I voted 11 times in the last 14 years to open ANWR in Alaska for exploration and drilling. We think we have somewhere between 10 and 16 billion barrels of oil there. Unfortunately, we have handcuffed ourselves and put that off limits. 
   We also have the Outer Continental Shelf, where we have upwards of 86 billion barrels of oil and huge amounts of natural gas. If we had access to that natural gas, we wouldn't see the high heating prices for heating one's home in the wintertime. 
   But this is essentially the policy that this new majority here in Congress has put into effect. In reality, over the last decade, decade-and-a-half, even though they were in the minority in the time, they were able to block it over in the other body, in the Senate. So we had the votes here in the House to do it, but they didn't have the votes over there. 
   When you put huge amounts of energy like that off limits, it means we have to get that oil somewhere, so that means, unfortunately, we have to import it from OPEC nations, for example, who literally just keep the spigot turned down so that there isn't enough supply out there. Then when you have economies in India and China expanding and growing, it is a supply and demand issue. So the price goes up and continues to go up, because we are far too dependent on buying that oil from somewhere else. About two-thirds of our oil we buy elsewhere. 
   I know when the new Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, took over here, a few months before the election she made the statement that the gas prices were outrageous. They made a big campaign issue about that. At that time they were $2.30 a gallon. She said that was outrageous, and they had a plan to do something about that. Well, the plan that we have seen from this new majority here in the House of Representatives has resulted in it going from $2.30 a gallon to about $4.00 a gallon in less than 2 years. 
   So the problem is this new majority that talks about an energy policy, and they actually passed an energy bill recently, it was a no-energy bill, because it didn't open up ANWR, it didn't open up the Outer Continental Shelf. It did nothing about making it possible for us to build oil refineries in this county. 
   We haven't built an oil refinery since 1976, over 30 years, making it virtually impossible to build an oil refinery. Therefore, even if we had enough crude in this country, we couldn't refine it quickly enough to be able to put it in our cars. 
   They have also been instrumental in pushing for these boutique fuels, where different States have different blends so the supply is very difficult to get around. That has driven the price up. 
   Also the liberals here in the House of Representatives over the years, and in this country, for that matter, their policy has been no new nuclear power plants. Now, France has 80 percent of their electricity produced by nuclear power plants. About 20 years ago, the liberals in this country were able to effectively shut down new nuclear power plants being built in this country. We have over 100 of them right now, but that means we haven't built any newer ones. China and India and other countries around the world are building them and relying more and more upon nuclear, but not the United States. 
   Many of us said what we are seeing now was where we were heading if we didn't change these policies. Unfortunately, this new majority here in the House of Representatives has gone just in the opposite direction from where they need to go. They have restricted us. They continue to restrict us from getting access to new energy which we have under our control in this country. They keep saying, let's just buy it from someplace else. Let's buy it from the OPEC countries. They will be nice to us. Well, they are not being nice to us. It is in their economic interests to continue to have this price continue to go up. 
   It is an absolute shame. It is a disgrace. It is unconscionable that this Congress consistently votes to make it harder and harder to be energy self-sufficient. That is where we need to go, not being more and more dependent upon foreign sources of energy. If we don't change it, the prices that we see right now, which are extremely high and are hurting an awful lot of people, will continue to go up. 
   Diesel is another problem. If you talk to any truckers right now, the price now is driving a lot of these people out of business. I was visiting with a fellow who is a farmer in my district last Friday who also has a side business. He had a truck. He pointed out it was behind one of his barns. He said, ``I just park it now.'' It costs $1,500 to fill up his tanks in that truck now. He just can't afford to do it.     
   And that is affecting every American, because everything that we buy, whether it is furniture, whether it is food goods, almost anything that we purchase in this country is transported at some point or another over truck. That means those prices are going to continue to go up again. So I challenge this majority to change their policies, to take a good look at what they have been doing and the direction that we are heading and reverse that and allow us to become less dependent on foreign sources of energy. Let's bring these gas prices down before it cripples this country and cripples our economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (SMALL BUSINESS FAIRNESS IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, tonight I rise in support of H.R. 1873, the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act. As an original cosponsor of this legislation, we worked closely with Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez and Representative Braley to draft a good, bipartisan bill that passed the Small Business Committee by voice vote and was cosponsored by nearly all the members of the committee. 
   Our legislation was intended to reform the contracting process, increase competition and provide a better value to the taxpayer. The legislation also takes steps to provide greater opportunities to small businesses and addresses problems with the Federal procurement database. 
   Promoting competition and increasing suppliers depends on the active participation of small businesses, the fastest growing segment of the American economy.     
   Without small business's participation, the government is forced to rely on fewer and fewer businesses to satisfy its need for goods and services. This concentration is bad for the government and worse for the tax-paying public. For that reason, utilization of small businesses to fulfill government contracts has been a long-standing policy, a policy that is neither Republican nor Democrat. 
   Unfortunately, the bill we are considering today, while making many important reforms, is watered down from the original version we introduced. 
   I commend Chairman Vel&#225;zquez and her staff for working tirelessly to try and protect the sound work done by the Committee on Small Business. 
   I also want to thank the Rules Committee, and especially Chairwoman Slaughter and Ranking Member Dreier, for allowing me to offer three important amendments, along with three of my Democratic colleagues, to restore significant provisions of the original bill. 
   One amendment that I proposed with Mr. Sestak, however, was not ruled in order. This amendment would have restored a provision of our original Small Business Committee bill related to contract bundling. Contract bundling is a procurement strategy that represents a potential obstacle to small business participation in the Federal marketplace. Contract bundling allows Federal procurement officials to manage the procurement process using fewer contracts. At times, contract bundling may be appropriate. At other times, it may reduce competition by combining multiple contracts for goods or services that could be provided separately into a single contract that small businesses are incapable of performing. 
   Nothing in our original bill as reported by the Committee on Small Business would have completely prevented the Federal Government from bundling contracts, nor is there anything in the bill that we are debating  today that prevents contracts from being bundled. Instead, we take the view that bundling can be beneficial if the government gets substantial, measurable benefits in terms of better prices or higher quality or critical delivery terms. 
   However, our original bill would have required that Federal contracting officers examine their contracting strategies to ensure that the government was receiving real benefits through bundled contracts and also consider the potential loss of competition from small businesses being excluded. Or as President Reagan might have put it, trust but verify. 
   The bill we are debating now reduces the amount of contracts subject to the trust but verify standard as compared to our original bill. It does, however, represent an increase from current law in the number of contracts that will be scrutinized. With that in mind and with the amendments made in order, including a separate amendment by Mr. Sestak, the bill moves us modestly in the right direction. 
   I would hope that as we proceed, and especially in conference, we continue to strengthen the trust but verify standards relative to bundled contracts. 
   While this may create more work for Federal contracting officers, it also ensures that the Federal procurement process protects competition in the long run while ensuring that the government benefits in the short run from necessary bundled contracts. 
   As we work through the legislative process with the Senate, it is important that a sensible mechanism exist for an independent arbiter to resolve disputes between the SBA and the agency issuing a bundled contract. It seems unfair that the SBA's only avenue of appeal is to the agency that is doing the procurement. Would anybody be surprised to learn that the administrator has never won an appeal on an agency head on a disputed bundled contract? Not once. 
   Nor should the legislation as it works its way to final passage substitute an appeals process by affected small businesses for that of the Small Business Administrator. Requiring a small business to challenge an agency's decision pits a David against a Goliath. But, unlike the biblical account, Goliath usually win these battles. 
   In addition to the provisions on bundling, the bill we are considering today increases the goals for prime Federal contracts to small businesses. But in my estimation and why I offered amendments is that the increase in the bill does not recognize the 10 percent growth in the number of small businesses since 1997, the last time the goals were raised. Nor does the modest increase from 23 to 25 percent recognize substantial technological changes and the capacity of small businesses to perform contracts overseas. Amendments we will be considering will raise those standards to appropriate levels and recognize the capacity of small businesses to perform work overseas. 
   In addition, I would ask the chairwoman that we work together to remove a provision included in the bill by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that treads on the sole jurisdiction of the Committee on Small Business. I believe that sets a bad precedent for future legislation in the House. 
   I also find that the provisions in title III of the bill are worthy of support. I congratulate the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as well as members of the Committee on Small Business on working to eradicate errors in critical Federal procurement databases. These changes, although seemingly arcane, will ensure that contracting officers award contracts intended to small businesses to actual small businesses. 
   While this bill is not as strong as the version adopted by the Small Business Committee, it nevertheless represents an improvement over existing law. I will continue to work to further strengthen this bill and to ensure that small businesses have their fair opportunity to participate in the Federal procurement process 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman), chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, such time as he may consume; and I want to take this opportunity to thank him for his work on this legislation.

   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she might consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Vel&#225;zquez), if she would like to speak at this time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, contract bundling has been a major issue for years, and it is increasing. When contracts are combined together into mega-contracts, small businesses are unable to compete. In fact, some contracts are so large that only a handful of companies would be able to perform them. This can create a virtual monopoly, which is problematic for taxpayers concerned with getting the best value for their money. 
   This amendment would save taxpayers money and benefit the economy. It will increase competition, providing the government with more options to purchase goods and services from. This will ultimately lower prices for Federal agencies. Unbundling contracts will create new opportunities for entrepreneurs, leading to new jobs and more local tax revenue. 
   The amendment closes a loophole in current law. This amendment adds new work and construction, which previously were not subject to bundling analyses. Current law only required contracts that have been previously performed to be reviewed for bundling. This amendment closes this gap and gives Federal agencies the tools it needs to save the taxpayers money. 
   The expanded bundling definition will not be overly burdensome. Contracts that are not suitable for small businesses will not require a bundling analysis. Bundled construction contracts under $65 million will not require an analysis. By creating more competition in the Federal marketplace, this amendment will save taxpayers money. 
   Expanding the definition of bundling will require more contracts to be reviewed, and possibly unbundled, than the current statute permits. This will create more opportunities for small firms, give the government more options and lower costs and increase quality for taxpayers. 
   I thank both the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his work on this issue and Mr. Chabot for all the work that he has done on the underlying bill and on this amendment.

   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I will be brief. 
   The amendment offered by Mr. Sestak will increase the protections against inappropriate contract bundling. It represents a compromise between the Small Business Committee's version and the Committee on Government Reform's version of H.R. 1873. I believe it represents an adequate resolution of the issue and pledge to work to make the protections in the Sestak amendment even stronger as we work through the legislative process.

   Mr. CHABOT. I want to thank the gentleman for his hard work on this particular amendment. I think it's a good amendment. I would urge its passage. 
   The amendment expands the pool of contracts included in the Federal governmentwide goal for participation of small business concerns and procurement contracts to include United States small business concern contracts performed overseas. Current law and regulations apply the small business concern Federal governmentwide goal only to contracts performed in the United States. 
   The bill as currently written would continue to apply the small business concern Federal governmentwide goal to contracts performed only in the United States. This methodology clearly does not address small business concerns involvement in today's global economy. When small business policy was first developed in the 1940 to 1950 timeframe, small business concern participation in the overseas markets was fairly limited. 
   In today's global economy, adding contracts where United States small business concerns perform overseas work is reasonable because the availability of the Internet and advances in technology allows contracting officers to acquire information on such activities. 
   Therefore, United States small business concerns global activity should be recognized and, thus, included as a part of the overall Federal governmentwide small business concern goal. 
   Again, I want to thank the chairwoman and I want to thank Mr. Shuler for their work on this particular amendment

   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I thank her for her leadership on this amendment and her hard work, as well as the chairwoman's. 
   This is a simple amendment. The amendment increases the Federal government-wide goal for participation of small business concerns in procurement contracts from 23 percent to 30 percent. The bill, as currently written, would increase the Federal government-wide goal from 23 percent to 25 percent, which is only a 2 percent increase, which is really pretty miserable when one considers it. It ought to be, I think, significantly more than that, especially when you consider that the Federal market for goods and services has doubled in the past 10 years, and the number of small businesses has increased by 10 percent during that period of time. 
   So to maintain the congressional standard in the Small Business Act that a fair share Federal government procurement contracts are awarded the small business concerns, this amendment increases the goal a modest 8 percent, which is, quite frankly, long overdue. 
   Finally, the goal increase recognizes small business concern's role in the economy. Small businesses employ more than 50 percent of all employees in the United States, and this would cause increased competition, resulting in a downward pressure on pricing, which ultimately benefits the taxpayer. Small businesses are the main contributors to major technological paradigm breakthroughs, as opposed to simply advancing the current knowledge in a specific technological field. 
   I think this is a very good amendment. I, again, want to thank the gentlelady for offering it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I would just note that I don't think we are doing those kids living in section 8 housing any favors by encouraging a life or a lifestyle of living in section 8 housing. I think we're doing them a great disservice. 
   And I want to thank the gentleman from California for his efforts to bring more accountability and responsibility to the section 8 program, a program that, let's face it, is in need of fundamental reform. 
   Madam Chair, this is a very straightforward and commonsense amendment, and again, I want to commend the gentleman for offering it. It would simply place a time limit, one that I believe is generous, on able-bodied individuals currently receiving housing assistance through the section 8 program.  
   Under current law, there are no time limits. Those on section 8 can remain on section 8 for as long as they qualify. 
   Is that fair to the taxpayers? No. Is it fair to the section 8 recipients who become trapped in a life of dependency or to their children? I don't think so. Is it fair that the current lack of time limits prevent those on the waiting list, who may have fallen on hard times and are genuinely looking for a temporary helping hand, from receiving help? I don't think so. 
   Madam Chair, I would submit that the current lack of time limits isn't fair to anyone. 
   We've seen the positive effects that time limits and work requirements can have on social programs. We need look no further back in history than the 1996 Temporary Assistance For Needy Families, or the welfare reform law, that reformed the old welfare system, a system that had trapped so many into a life of dependency and poverty. And the old welfare system bears a remarkable resemblance to the section 8 program. And I think that's just unacceptable. 
   We can do better in this country than section 8 housing and condemning both adults and children to the conditions that they have to live in, in my community in Cincinnati or communities all over the country. Section 8 housing is not the type of lifestyle that I think we want to condemn those people living in them or their children to.     
   And I don't think the taxpayers ought to be required to pay for this subsidized housing forever in some cases.

<DOCNO>Mr. CHABOT. (SECTION 8 VOUCHER REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is one of three amendments that I am offering this evening, two of the three with a couple of my colleagues, one Mr. Miller from California and Mr. Hensarling from Texas, that would encourage fundamental reforms in the section 8 program. 
   When we committed ourselves to welfare reform, it was the understanding that the program should no longer be a taxpayer-funded handout but should instead offer people a way out of poverty, helping them obtain job and education skills that are needed to become ultimately self-sufficient. Ending welfare's cycle of dependency has cut the welfare rolls in half, promoted individual responsibility, and saved billions of tax dollars in the process. Sadly, current housing programs closely resemble the failed welfare policies of the past. Like the old welfare programs, the section 8 housing program, unfortunately, discourages work and allows people to stay, in fact, encourages them to stay on the program, oftentimes indefinitely. It is also too often mismanaged by local governments or local housing authorities. 
   Unfortunately, this bill does not address those issues but instead expands the program to 100,000 new section 8 vouchers at the cost of approximately 2.4 billion taxpayer dollars over the next 5 years. That is 100,000, approximately, more recipients that get a chunk of the rent that is ultimately going to be picked up by their fellow taxpayers and ultimately, in my view, doesn't do the people that become dependent upon this good in the long term. That is 100,000 more recipients who don't have to work to stay in the program, and that is 100,000 recipients that are being supported by the American taxpayers for as long as they like since section 8 now imposes no time limits on the beneficiaries. 
   I represent most of the city of Cincinnati and its western suburbs and a few townships in Butler County, Ohio. Too many neighborhoods in my district have had to witness crime, despair, and hopelessness that are inherent in a government program that asks virtually nothing of its recipients, that encourages dependency rather than responsibility and waste, unfortunately, rather than work. Whether it is the  funding provided by the Federal Government or mismanagement of the program by local governments and agencies, section 8 has failed those who use it and those who pay for it: the American taxpayers. 
   My amendment is straightforward. It would simply stop throwing good money after bad and seeks to prevent more Americans from falling victim to a life of dependency on the government. My amendment would simply prohibit the dollars this bill authorizes from being spent on the 100,000 new vouchers that this legislation would create. 
   It is also important to point out that the dependency that section 8 has created is so great that there are long waiting lists to get vouchers. Why? Because many of those who gain access to the program ultimately don't leave. They don't really have an incentive to. The average stay is about 7 years. 
   Madam Chairman, if we simply put time limits and meaningful work requirements in the program, as the amendments that I have offered with Mr. Miller and Mr. Hensarling would do, there wouldn't be a need to create more vouchers because people would be moving through the system, moving toward independence and a better life, and that nondependence on the government is what every American should want. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chair, I would just like to reiterate the fact that I don't think we're doing either the children or the people that have become dependent on section 8 housing any favors by allowing, number one, the area that we covered in the last amendment, people to remain on section 8 housing indefinitely. I think that the time limit that's been proposed in the previous amendment is certainly a step in the right direction. The amendment that we have following this goes to a work requirement, which I think is also very reasonable in a program such as this. 
   I think encouraging people to remain dependent upon the government in the conditions that oftentimes we see in section 8 housing is doing no favor for those families, and that's why I think this is an appropriate amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I thank the gentleman from Texas for his efforts to bring more accountability to the section 8 program. It's much needed and long overdue. 
   As welfare reform has shown us, the section 8 program should not become a way of life. It should be a helping hand, a way out of poverty. Ending the welfare cycle of dependency that has trapped so many has cut the welfare rolls in half, promoted individual responsibility and saved billions of tax dollars in the process. 
   One of the primary engines that continues to drive the civic welfare reform is the requirement that those in the program must work, and that's all that this amendment does. To be clear, the Hensarling-Chabot amendment would simply require all able-bodied individuals who have received section 8 for more than 7 consecutive years to work. I don't see anything at all mean-spirited about that. I certainly don't see anything bigoted about that to say that if somebody is receiving tax dollars, they ought to be required to work, to do something in consideration for the tax dollars that are being paid to help that person live while they need that assistance. 
   So the amendment, again, as the gentleman indicates, exempts those that are under 18 years of age, that are over 62 or blind or disabled, and those already exempt under TANF, and single parents of children under six. The amendment benefits the taxpayer and those in the section 8 program. 
   I would urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It requires work, and I think that's a good thing. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Texas still controls a half minute.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Madam Chairman, I rise to express my deep disappointment with today's debate in the House. With our Nation facing record high gas prices, the majority leadership in the House has chosen to debate legislation not on securing reliable and affordable energy, but on beaches. 
   I suggest a better use of our time and the American people's time would be to have a serious debate about energy. How are we going to make energy more affordable in the short term? How are we going to make energy more affordable as the Nation needs to be more independent in the long term? What will be our primary fuel source in the future, and how do we get there? 
   Instead, in recent months we have periodically debated shortsighted and fatally flawed legislation that purports to fix our energy problems simply by raising taxes by billions of dollars on domestic energy companies and hoping for the best. That is not an energy policy, that is a tax increase on every American family. Energy companies will inevitably pass on their additional costs to consumers at the pump. 
   We should be debating legislation to streamline the Federal permitting process that has stifled construction of new oil refineries. We haven't built one in 32 years. We could be talking about benefiting consumers by simplifying our Nation's fragmented gasoline supply. The number of regional boutique fuels restricts the movement of our fuel supply and raises costs on Americans at the pump. 
   We could be debating the merits of opening Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, and the Outer Continental Shelf for energy exploration. We know that combined these areas have nearly 100 billion barrels of oil. Previous Congresses, urged on by their radical environmentalist allies, made the decision to keep these vast reserves off-limits. As a result, we see oil now at $110 a barrel. It is time we revisit the very important issue of being able to go after resources we have available to us in Alaska and in the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   What about encouraging the construction of nuclear power plants? We began that process in 2005 with the passage of the Energy Policy Act. But as we stand here today, we haven't built a new plant in decades. European and Asian nations are building them by the dozens. India has nine new plants under construction. Japan is building five more. And China has plans to build 30 reactors. We in this country have plans for exactly zero on the way. 
   Let's talk about how we intend to compete with China, which is canvassing the globe in its quest to ensure a reliable supply of oil. Reports indicate that the Chinese are forming energy partnerships with rogue nations like Iran and Cuba. And Cuba is purportedly planning to allow the Chinese to drill for oil off the Florida Keys, off our Florida Keys. 
   Shouldn't we be talking about boosting domestic production simply so we wouldn't have to rely on the mood of Third World dictators like Hugo Chavez? Wouldn't it be nice if prices didn't spike at your neighborhood gas station when terrorists decide to blow up a pipeline half a world away, or when there is instability in Nigeria? 
   Some may argue, and they might well be right, that oil isn't the long-term answer. It is a finite resource that may be scarce in the near future as developing nations like China and India continue to expand and industrialize; maybe so. But shouldn't we consider boosting our oil and natural gas supplies, increasing our energy independence that might just buy us the time necessary to develop the next fuel source? Maybe hydrogen fuel cell technology will take us into the next century. Maybe it is some other renewable resource. It could be a combination, or maybe something we haven't even discovered yet. We don't know. We do know that America has substantial reserves of oil and natural gas that we have locked up, we have placed off-limits. These resources could be the bridge that allows America to cross over the choppy waters of OPEC and Third World dictators to the secure footing of affordable and secure energy sources of tomorrow. Let's talk about these important things. Let's not talk about beaches.

   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I will be very brief. I appreciate the gentleman and I don't want to take time here. I would just make a couple of points. 
   This amendment is long overdue. Taiwan is our friend. It is a longtime democratic ally and a major trading partner. Just across the Taiwan Strait you have Communist China, with its more than 900 missiles pointed directly at Taiwan. China operates under a dictatorship. Its human rights record is abysmal. It ignores the rule of law. It practices religious persecution. It warehouses political prisoners. It carries out an unconscionable coercive abortion policy. Yet when it comes to dealing with the two nations diplomatically, we often treat Taiwan like a pariah nation and kowtow to the Beijing bullies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I, first of all, would like to thank the gentleman from Virginia for his leadership on this very important issue. I know Mr. Scott has been one of those who has cared greatly about those families that have suffered the trauma of a lost person within their family. So I want to thank Mr. Scott on this. And I think this is another issue in which we have seen bipartisanship in this House. Sometimes you don't see a lot of instances of that, but I think this is one where we can work together in a bipartisan fashion, and I want to thank Mr. Scott for his leadership on this. 
   Given that tomorrow is the first annual day of remembrance for murder victims, it is only fitting that we recognize and respond to a segment of the victim population that too often goes unrecognized: those victims who are missing and whose remains have yet to be identified. Unfortunately, it is far more common than one would think, just how many families are searching for some clue as to the location of the remains of their missing family members, and too often families are alone in their effort to locate their loved one. 
   On any given day, there are more than 100,000 active missing-person cases in this country. Just think of that: over 100,000 active cases in this Nation. Every year tens of thousands of people vanish under suspicious circumstances. Equally disturbing is the knowledge that the skeletal remains of more than 40,000 individuals are being stored with coroners, medical examiners, and police departments around  the country. And these may very well be the very persons that those families are trying to identify. They don't know what happened to their brother, their sister, their mother, their aunt, their uncle, whomever it might be. Many of these jurisdictions do not have the technology to identify these individuals. And even if they do, most States do not require these officials to obtain samples before burying or cremating the remains. Think of that. Your sister could be in the State right next door in the coroner's office or a police station and the remains may be cremated, and you may go the rest of your life and your family never knowing what happened to your sister. 
   I know the impact of this ineffective model on families, because in my own State of Ohio, a very good friend, somebody that, unfortunately, I have gotten to know through a terrible tragedy in her own family, Deborah Culberson, the mother of a murder victim, Carrie Culberson, has been searching for the remains of her daughter for the last 11 years. While Carrie's murderer will, hopefully, spend the rest of his life in jail, her body has never been found. Moreover, speculation exists that Carrie's remains may be in the State of Kentucky, we really don't know, which does not mandate the same requirements for identifying human remains as my State, Ohio. 
   Rapidly advancing DNA technology has proven to be a critical tool that law enforcement and families can access to locate and identify individuals and solve cold cases. Yet as Debbie Culberson's search demonstrates, the technology is not being utilized to its fullest. For example, many family members of the missing or unidentified do not know they can provide their own DNA to assist law enforcement. Some law enforcement officials do not know that this DNA technology can assist in solving cold cases. Even if law enforcement knows the technology exists, States may not mandate DNA testing for this segment of the victim population. 
   We, as elected officials, have a responsibility to take the lead in ensuring, number one, that adequate funding and effective education and training for law enforcement and the public exists; and, two, that all available resources and tools are being used to their fullest ability. 
   This resolution acknowledges Congress's commitment to these victims and to their families, that it will do everything within its authority to locate, identify, and return these sons, daughters, mothers, and fathers to those families who are still searching for their loved ones. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas, Judge Poe.
