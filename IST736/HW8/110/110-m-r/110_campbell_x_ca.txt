<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I guess this afternoon I am going to be a fairly lonely voice in opposition to this bipartisan agreement, and I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will listen as in the next 3 minutes I present to you five reasons why I think we should not be passing this bill. 
   First of all, it is not really going to be stimulative. Look at what caused the problem that we are in right now. This is a credit problem and a capital problem. We got into this arguably because people borrowed and spent too much money. So what are we going to do? We are going to send people a check and say, spend it. Go buy a flat screen TV and save America. I just don't think that is the proper stimulus or the right way to go about this. 
   Second, it is really wealth redistribution. People who pay well over 50 percent of the taxes in this country get nothing, zero, nada. But yet a substantial portion of this package will go to people who pay nothing in taxes. So we call it a tax rebate, but people are going to get a rebate who paid nothing, and people who paid most of the taxes will get nothing. 
   Third, it increases the deficit. We have had three years of decline in this deficit. We are finally seeing perhaps the end of these deficits. And now with this and everything going on, we are looking at increasing it for the first time in 4 years, maybe going back to a deficit as much as $400 billion, which gets us back almost to where we were before 9/11. 
   Fourth, I know that it says in there that nonresident aliens, meaning illegal aliens, are not supposed to get a check. However, this is a 2007 1040 form, and if you look at it, you can look around all over the place and see there is no box to check where it says I am a nonresident or illegal alien and therefore am not eligible to receive this check. This thing is ripe for fraud, because you send in a tax return paying no money and get a check. So there will be opportunities for fraud. 
   Finally, fifth, it goes against all of our long-term goals. We all sit in here on a bipartisan basis, particularly my friends on the Democratic side have talked about reducing the deficit and getting to a balanced budget. We have talked in this country that we don't save enough. We talked in this country that many times we need to invest more, as some of our friends in some of the emerging markets are doing. 
   We are sending completely the wrong message here, a message which is don't save, spend; a message for the government which is don't save, don't balance, but spend. We do need stimulus. 
   We should be providing stimulus that attacks the problem. If your leg hurts, don't do something to try and help your arm. Help your leg. Our leg hurts. The leg that hurts is credit and capital, and there is stimulus we could do that would enhance the availability of credit and encourage the movement and investment of capital. Unfortunately, this doesn't do that.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong opposition to this bill. Just last week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged Optiver Holding BV with manipulation of the oil futures markets. They charged them for using a system called ``banging the close'' and charged that they made $1 million dollars with illegal manipulation of the oil futures markets. 
   You see, Mr. Speaker, it is already illegal to manipulate the oil futures markets, and the CFTC is already enforcing that. What this bill unfortunately does is move beyond manipulation into what is legitimate trading. When Southwest Airlines, which is a well-known organization that recently bought contracts forward and hedged oil prices going forward, when they buy that, someone else owns the other end of that contract. And when oil prices start to go up, the person who owns the other end of that contract tries to reduce their losses so they go into the market to do that. That is not manipulation. That is legitimate trading. 
   If you stop that, which this bill will, then a Southwest Airlines may not be able to get this kind of hedge in the future, or if they do, it will be much more expensive.     
   There's a difference between manipulation and legitimate trading. This bill does not recognize that. 
   So I oppose this bill and urge my colleagues to oppose it. Manipulation is already illegal. The bill will impact legitimate trading. It will move a lot of these trades from the United States to London or Dubai. It will hurt American companies. 
   And in the end, Mr. Speaker, as the CFTC admitted last week, the major cause of oil prices is not speculation or even manipulation but is, in fact, supply-and-demand factors. If we want to bring oil prices down, we will do it when we increase supply dramatically in this country and lower demand.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask that while the House consider this energy legislation, that they take into account that the CAFE provision in this bill does nothing to clarify the critical issue of which federal government agency has the lead on regulating fuel economy. 
   To effectively improve fuel economy there cannot be two separate sets of fuel economy standards--one from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and another from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Having two agencies with inconsistent standards creates substantial regulatory uncertainty, confusion, and duplication of effort. 
   Most importantly, the legislation gives EPA free rein on the fuel economy issue which would allow them the ability to supersede Congressional authority over CAFE. This could mean that EPA could establish a CAFE standard that far exceeds the standard passed by Congress. 
   The White House agrees that one agency needs to be the lead entity responsible for a single national regulatory standard. The legislation should have harmonized EPA and NHTSA's distinct roles to regulate fuel economy and emissions. 
   A single, nationwide fuel economy standard would create certainty and achieve the mutual goal of reducing gasoline consumption in an effective manner. 
   It is my hope that this problem be remedied.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, two plus two does not equal six, but if I were to assume that it did, I could take care of the budget. Easy. 
   PAYGO assumes that when you increase taxes, revenue goes up, and when you lower tax rates, revenue goes down. But history shows that that is not what happens, because there are economic factors, and people change behavior. 
   Since the tax cut-rate cuts of 2003, revenue has been up every year, and in 2 of the last 3 years has been up by double digits. 
   Two plus two does not equal six. PAYGO does not equal fiscal responsibility. What PAYGO does equal is tax increases that will hurt the economy and will not raise revenue and will not help the deficit.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman from South Carolina. 
   Mr. Chairman, let's be clear what we are doing here: we are not cutting anything. We are proposing to do less of an increase in this bill than what has been proposed by the majority party. 
   Just to illustrate, as I have done before, what I will do again, because I keep hearing talk about cuts: one equals one; two is more than one, even if you want three. This bill, what we have proposed is to have two, is to spend more than the one that was spent before, to spend two. There are some people who would like to spend three. We think that's too much. 
   We think that we have a deficit. We think that we have seen the majority party propose to increase taxes by however much money they happen to spend. We think they should spend less. We think government should spend less so that the taxpayers can keep more of their own money that they earned. 
   Mr. Chairman, we can get this budget under control. We can get this deficit under control without cutting spending and without raising taxes, if we just  control how much we increase the spending by. 
   Instead of increasing it by 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 percent, 9, over 9 percent, which overall has been proposed in this budget, if, instead, we only increase it by 6, not a bad increase, but just increase it by 6, and we do that year after year, we will eliminate this deficit without digging more into the taxpayers' pockets, because we already dig into their pockets too much. 
   So that's what this whole debate, that's what the amendment of the gentleman from South Carolina is about, just controlling the growth of spending to something that is reasonable but manageable and will enable people to keep their own money and this government to return to a fiscal responsibility position without deficits.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (OPPOSING SINGLING OUT ISRAEL'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentlelady from Florida for yielding, and I thank the gentleman from Washington for his support and supportive words about this bill. And most of all, I thank my coauthor in this effort, Mr. Berman, my friend and fellow Californian, for his involvement and effort in this bill and this important action. 
   And I think it is an important action, Mr. Speaker, because, as the three previous speakers have mentioned, it's not like the world is devoid of problems in human rights. It's not like there are not repressive regimes in various places around the world. There is a place for the United Nations to be talking about this, to be dealing with this, to be trying to help this situation; but, unfortunately, this Human Rights Council, which was supposed to be that, is clearly not that. 
   Now, when this Human Rights Council was formed in 2006 to replace, as Mr. Berman pointed out, the discredited U.N. Commission on Human Rights, the then-U.N. General Assembly president, Jan Eliasson, said that the council would be ``principled, effective and fair.'' And during its establishment, the U.N. General Assembly went on to say that this council would be responsible for ``promoting universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind, and in a fair and equal manner.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I applaud those words. I applaud the basis upon which this council was established. But the facts show that in the year of its existence, it has not followed this directive. As was pointed out, the first three special sessions out of the first nine sessions they had condemned Israel for their possible human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories and Lebanon. The fourth one was a noncondemnatory expression of concern regarding the situation in Darfur. 
   Now, what about Belarus? What about China? What about Cuba, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, anywhere else in the world? They have not even had a session to discuss them, not to mention have a mild condemnation or a full condemnation, but multiple condemnations of Israel, and they have now placed Israel on the permanent schedule. Now, that is not a good thing. That means that every meeting they have, they will be discussing what human rights violations are in Israel. But as Mr. Berman pointed out, is Uzbekistan even on the calendar? No. Any of these other places even on the calendar? No. 
   Let's look at some of the members of the Human Rights Council now. Some of the members include Algeria, China, Cuba, Pakistan, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Now, I'm very disappointed that, as it has happened, a group that started out with such a noble cause and noble effort seems to have a complete lack of reasoned objectivity with their obvious inherent discrimination against Israel. And it appears they have become a refuge for human rights abusers to hang out and thereby avoid scrutiny or condemnation of their own actions. 
   Just this morning, the President was in New York speaking before the United Nations; and amongst the comments that he made was the following: ``Yet the American people are disappointed by the failures of the Human Rights Council. This body has been silent on repression by regimes from Havana to Caracas to Pyongyang and Tehran, while focusing its criticism successively on Israel. To be credible on human rights in the world, the United Nations must reform its own Human Rights Council.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that's what this bill hopes to begin the process of doing. This Human Rights Council is a sham. It is not accomplishing what it was set out to do, yet the objective for which it was put in place still exists, the need still exists. The United Nations needs a real Human Rights Council, not a cover for those who would abuse human rights.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Thank you, Mr. King. 
   We are talking about the budget this evening, and a number of things about the budget. The problem out there: We have a deficit. The problem is not that people are taxed too little; it is the government is spending too much. 
   I didn't just make that up. I didn't come up with that now. I am paraphrasing the words of President Ronald Reagan and comments he made several decades ago. But it is every bit as true today as it was then. The reason that we have a deficit, the issues with our government budget, are not that people  are taxed too little; it is that government spends too much. 
   Why, as a matter of fact, since 2003, revenues to the Federal Government, income to the Federal Government, have increased by 46 percent, assuming that this year it continues at the rate that the increases have begun this year, 46 percent since 2003. 
   Let me put that in a way maybe that folks listening can understand even more clearly. If you are making $50,000 a year in 2003, in order for your income to keep up with what the Federal Government's income has been, you would have to be making over $72,000 today, not bad. I bet most of you out there listening, if you were making $50,000 back in 2003, would be pretty happy if you had gotten raises to be at $72,000 or $73,000 today. But that is where the Federal Government is. 
   But what's interesting is, that is not because taxes were increased. That 46 percent increase in revenue is because taxes were decreased, because there were tax cuts in 2003. 
   Because there were tax cuts in 2003, a whole bunch of good things happened: More people are working. The unemployment rate is down. Business investment is up. Gross domestic product is up, and millions and millions of new jobs have been created. All that since these tax cuts that are so demagoged by the other side. Now, the people who spoke in the hour before me here were talking about tax cuts for the rich, and I think they said super billionaires or something like that. 
   Let us talk about what these tax reductions were. One of them was a reduction in the tax on capital gains and dividends. Let's see. Over 50 percent of Americans now own stocks or have been investing in the stock market. So I guess over 50 percent of Americans must be hyper billionaires because capital gains and dividends tax cuts saved them money. 
   Almost 70 percent of Americans own homes. When you sell your home at some point, you might be subject to a capital gains tax. I guess almost over 70 percent of Americans are hyper billionaires or the super rich. 
   Or perhaps the marriage penalty reduction, which saved money for every married taxpayer. I guess that means everyone who is married is a hyper billionaire type of rich. 
   Not true, but what is particularly interesting is that these tax reductions, these tax rate reductions, saved Americans at all income levels money, and it resulted in the economy growing, which is why you have had this 46 percent increase in revenue. 
   But even with that 46 percent increase in revenue, we still have a deficit, because we are spending too much. Now, the other side does have a tax that they don't like, which is interesting. It is the alternative minimum tax. 
   Now, I stand before you as a Member of Congress, yes, but also as a certified public accountant and an individual with a master's in business taxation. So I do have a little bit of knowledge in the area of taxation. The alternative minimum tax is pretty complicated. But basically you figure your tax on a regular tax, and then there is another tax, and you pay whichever one is greater. 
   The alternative minimum tax only kicks in if it results in more tax than the regular tax. The reason that would happen is because you pay a high rate. By definition, if you are not in one of the highest tax brackets, the alternative minimum tax cannot apply to you. 
   If you were to compare the capital gains tax, alternative minimum tax, and look at which one is more for the rich, it would certainly be the alternative minimum tax. Yet you just heard the Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle just say that the capital gains, the dividends, all these tax reductions that were in 2003 are terrible and are hurting the economy, and they are hurting people, and they are only for the super billionaires. But, yes, they insist on doing something to get rid of the alternative minimum tax, which, by definition, can only hit people in the highest tax brackets, can only create more tax for them. 
   You can't have it both ways, Democrats, you cannot have it both ways. If eliminating or reducing the alternative minimum tax is good policy, then so is reducing the tax on capital gains and on dividends and on the marriage penalty and all the other rate reductions that we did back in 2003. 
   Now, the President released a budget this week. The budget he released balances in 5 years without raising taxes. The other side of the aisle, the majority here 
   spent the last 2 days saying how terrible it is. I am trying to figure out what is so bad. Is balancing the budget in 5 years bad? I would rather balance it in 2; I would rather balance it in 1, sure. 
   I don't think balancing the budget in 5 years is that bad of an objective, and it balances it without raising taxes. Ah, that is really the part they don't like, balancing the budget without raising taxes. They don't want that to happen because they want to raise taxes, because a 46 percent income growth since 2003 is not good enough, because increases in jobs, increases in the economy, increases in gross domestic product, that is not good enough, because they want to spend more, more and more and more. They want to tax, and they want to spend. 
   The new Democrats are the same as the old Democrats. You are seeing it on this floor, in this hall, today, this week and this month. Unfortunately, I am afraid you are going to see it in the months going forward. 
   So what is the problem with balancing the budget without tax increases? That is what we want to do. That is what the President wants to do. But, unfortunately it is not what the other side wants to do. 
   Let me take a moment, and if I may, and yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King). Would you like to speak on some of these matters for a few moments?

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. King, one second, before you leave, figures, we talk about the progress we have made on this budget so far. The 12-month budget deficit, the last 12 months, is $188 billion. Remember, some time ago, we were talking about nearly half a trillion dollars. That $188 billion is down 38 percent as a rolling 12-month budget deficit from what it was a year ago. 
   For 22 straight months now, the budget deficit has declined by about 18 percent, year on year. There is a lot of progress happening on this budget deficit because of the growth in the economy, because of those tax cuts, and because we, the prior couple of budgets, were beginning to start to control spending. It is something we haven't done, well, frankly, a lot, lately. But we are starting to in the last couple of years. Isn't that right, Mr. King?

   It is as though the people on the other side, the Democrats, the facts of what is going on in the economy, what is going on in the budget, what tax cuts do, what they do not do, it just does not fit with what they want to do, which is tax more and spend more. 
   You know, I could put all of you here, keep you in this room where there is no windows, and tell you tomorrow morning that the sun did not rise. Now, you would have no proof that the sun did not rise, but it is very likely that it, in fact, did rise.

That is you people watching. It will be tax money taken from you to pay to build a rainforest in Iowa. 
   Now, Democrats have only been in charge for a little longer than 30 days, and already they have made it easier to raise taxes. They raise taxes on domestic oil and gas producers. I mean, I totally don't get that when here we are trying to become less reliant on foreign oil, and we have gas prices where they are, and they are going to tax domestic oil and gas producers. And, of course, when they tax them, they spend the money on an entirely new program, and then on top of that then they pass this budget which allows this rainforest in Iowa to go through and spends another $10 billion, which increases the deficit not reduces it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is dealing with an earmark for $140,000 for the Wetzel County Courthouse in New Martinsville, West Virginia. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, I actually looked up on a Web site to see the Wetzel County Courthouse, and it is a building that was built sometime between 1900 and 1902, and it looks like a very fine historic building. I actually am personally into historic preservation. I personally support, through charitable contributions, the preservation of various historic buildings around California, actually, and around the Nation. 
   I believe that we ought to keep our historic buildings and keep them up and appreciate them and treasure that history that we, as a fairly young country, are just beginning to build. So that's not why I am proposing to strike this earmark from this bill. 
   It's not that this isn't a historic building; it clearly is. It's not that perhaps it requires some renovation; I don't know, but perhaps it does. But the question is, is this really the sort of thing upon which we should be spending our scarce Federal tax dollars? 
   Let me point out again that this is a county courthouse. It's not a Federal courthouse; it is a county courthouse in West Virginia. Now, I'm sure that there are taxes, property taxes, whatever, in that county, and perhaps those tax dollars, if the local magistrates felt it was appropriate, could be used for this, or perhaps city dollars in that city or that area, or perhaps State dollars, or perhaps charitable dollars, a preservation society is set up or becomes set up, or whatever, to support this courthouse. 
   But it just seems completely inappropriate to me, Mr. Chairman, that we are spending scarce Federal dollars on this sort of thing. Now, I have a county courthouse in my county; it was built around the same time. It's old also. I'm sure we could use $140,000 for it. I'm sure we could use $140,000 for any number of county courthouses that are old and historic across this country. Are we going to fund them all? Is it the Federal taxpayers' responsibility to restore them all or to make some contribution to them all? I really don't think so. 
   And it's not, as I say, that perhaps this isn't a need, but I just don't think it's appropriate to spend Federal tax dollars on this sort of very local objective and local project that has no Federal nexus. 
   Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle spent a lot of time the last few days talking about PAYGO. But one of the things to point out is that this bill is not subject, the entire bill basically, all of the spending in the budget is not subject to PAYGO because there is a 4.5 percent increase in total spending in this appropriations bill that we're debating tonight. And there is no offset for that 4.5 percent. There is no other spending that is reduced by 4.5 percent. So every dollar we spend on this bill tonight is a dollar that adds to the deficit. Every single dollar contributes to further raiding the Social Security surplus. 
   So the question is, is this $140,000 that we believe we should increase the Federal deficit by $140,000 for this courthouse, should we raid the Social Security surplus by an additional $140,000 for this courthouse, or should we not spend the taxpayers' money on something like this local project? 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   If I may continue, then. I appreciate the comments from the gentleman from West Virginia. And I frankly don't dispute or have any basis upon which to dispute anything the gentleman said, but that wasn't my point. My point was that it is not appropriate to use Federal funds for this sort of thing, regardless of how great the local community may find this to be a local need. 
   The Federal tax dollars cannot support every little local project, every local need, every historic building everywhere that we need. 
   To close, I would like to quote, if I could, Mr. Chairman, Thomas Jefferson, just to let people know that this is not a new issue. And he said, ``Have you considered all the consequences of our proposition respecting post roads? I view it as a source of boundless patronage to the executive, jobbing to Members of Congress and their friends, and a bottomless abyss of public money. You will begin by only appropriating the surplus of post office revenues, but other revenues will soon be called into their aid. And it will be a scene of eternal scramble among the Members as to who can get the most money wasted in their State. And they will always get the most who are the meanest.'' 
   Thomas Jefferson is right. I would ask you to support this amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

And I'm sure that studying their habits, or whatever this is going to study, is a worthy, I'm going to presume, at least, that it is a worthy intellectual exercise and that perhaps it has value for researchers or people studying fish or whatever it is. And again, like in the last amendment that I offered, that is not my point in proposing that we not use tax dollars to fund this.     
   But my point instead is with limited tax dollars, limited to $3 trillion, but limited nonetheless, of Federal tax dollars, with a deficit that we have that all of these appropriations bills will increase, not decrease, with the fact that we are still raiding Social Security surplus, is buying equipment for this study in this place something that should command $150,000 of taxpayers' money? 
   Again, as I mentioned before, I have heard Members on the other side of the aisle constantly refer to their PAYGO as how they are attempting to be fiscally responsible. But yet this bill increases spending by 4.5 percent over last year. There is no PAYGO there. There is no other appropriations bill that is reduced by 4.5 percent to save this money. There are no structural reforms in the entitlement programs, which we all know are scheduled for disaster, to save this money. 
   So this $150,000 is not just an amorphous $150,000 in a gigantic budget that means nothing. It is a real $150,000 that is using taxpayers' money but will increase the deficit and further raid the Social Security surplus by $150,000. 
   So the question before the body is not whether this research is interesting, or even whether it is useful to some people. But the question is, is it worth increasing the deficit by $150,000 to fund this? Is this sort of research the sort of thing the Federal Government should be involved in? If we are involved in this, why are we not involved in many, many other forms of research that are going on in my district or the district of every other Member who is here? The reason is because we can't afford to do that. 
   So I would respectfully suggest that we strike this money. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   You are right. A big problem, big issues, and this resolution doesn't address them. 
   What does it do? It basically says that the military leaders have a suggestion that we have reinforcements that they believe may improve the situation, help us get a victory in Iraq. Now, they can't guarantee that. The President can't guarantee it. Nobody can guarantee it. But what does this say? It says we are not going to do that. Okay, fine. But what are you going to do instead? 
   This resolution, by rejecting the only plan on the table, basically is saying stay the course, keep the status quo. 
   I don't think the status quo has been working. I think we know we have to make some changes in strategy and whatever. We have to make something work. But this basically says we will take the only plan that is out there and reject it. We won't do it. 
   So my question would be what do you do instead? What do you do to ensure that we don't have a genocide in Iraq on the scale of what is going on in Darfur? If you don't want to do this plan, what do you do to ensure that terrorism does not grow and flourish in Iraq and that then they come to attack us on our soil again, which they haven't done for 5 years? What do you do to protect our troops? 
   I think these are a lot of questions that we have, Mr. Hoekstra, which is why just saying no to the only plan that is on the table won't do it. It is kind of like a football game: the coach and quarterback call a play, and they are in there, and then someone runs into huddle and says, No, we are not going to run this play. 
   What play are we going to call? 
   We don't have a play. 
   So the quarterback gets under the center. The center snaps the ball, and nobody goes anywhere. Nobody knows what to do because there is no play, there is no plan. That will fail. 
   This simple status quo resolution is not the solution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to all of this debate, and I guess what I don't really understand is, why? I mean, why the Democrats here on the other side of the aisle want to oppose this motion to instruct. 
   I mean, do you want to raid the Social Security surplus? Do you like telling people that they are paying money for their own Social Security and retirement and then taking it and using it for other things? Do you like that? Do you want to do that? I mean, do you want to enact the biggest tax increase in American history? Do you want really to tax people more on capital gains and dividends when over 50 percent of Americans now own some sort of stock? Do you want to go back to penalizing married couples and having them pay more taxes after they get married than two people would when they were single? Do you really want to reduce the child care tax credit? Do you want to stifle economic growth? 
   I know some of you say you don't think that these tax cuts caused this economic growth. Let's assume they didn't cause it all. It can't be a coincidence that since the tax reductions went into place, we have had enormous economic growth, enormous job growth and enormous revenue growth to the Federal Government. 
   Do you really want to do all that? Do you really want to pass the largest tax increase in American history; and for what? So you can raise spending a lot over the next 5 years because if you just didn't increase spending, you could do all of this. You could allow Americans to keep their own money. 
   But no, you want to take their money from them and spend it on your priorities. Now I guess that is what you want to do. I still don't understand it. I don't understand why the government having money is so much more a priority, but I guess it is because you look at all money as the government's, and you allow people to keep some. We look at money as belonging to the people who earned it, and we allow the government to take that which is necessary. 
   But understand that if all you did was keep spending level or increase it a little bit over the next 5 years, then you wouldn't have to raise taxes and then you wouldn't have to raid the Social Security surplus. But apparently that is what you want to do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I opposed both the earlier versions of this bill, of the TRIA bill, but I support this one. This bill is shorter in duration, and it requires more participation by the private sector. Effectively, in the bill the Federal Government is a backstop, a reinsurer facilitating and allowing a private market in terrorism risk insurance. 
   Now, some that we have heard today say that in this bill the Federal Government doesn't do enough. I disagree. I think it is the goal of this bill, and the goal of this act should be, to facilitate a private market, not to stand in for or subsidize either insurance companies or property owners.     
   Then there are others who say the Federal Government shouldn't be involved at all in this issue. Again, I disagree. The Federal Government is involved. Does anybody really believe that if there were another terrorist attack on the United States that the Federal Government would not step in to help? Of course they would. The Federal Government always steps in when disasters are too big for State or local governments to handle. And there are similarly casualty events that are too big for the private sector to insure without Federal involvement. Terrorism is one of them. 
   The best alternative is not to have the government sail in later to facilitate a private market so that property owners and people can insure up front and know where they will be at a minimum if there is a terrorist act. That is what I believe this bill does, and I support it.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I spent 25 years in the retail car business, so I know a little bit about cars and fuel economy. I support this bill because it is an effective compromise that will move us towards less dependence on foreign oil while still allowing manufacturers to build cars and trucks that people will want to buy. 
   This bill clearly represents Congress's intent for fuel economy standards to be regulated through NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Other agencies, like the EPA, may also stake a claim for fuel economy standards. If they do,  it would clearly make no sense for them to establish a different standard than the one being authorized by Congress today. The President said so in an executive order in May, and Congress is saying so today. 
   Anything any other agency may do must be consistent and harmonized with this act. There can and should be only one national fuel economy standard, and this is it. With this standard, consumers can look forward in the future to cars and trucks with the room and performance that they want, but with the fuel economy and alternative fuels that we need.

   There were so many inaccuracies in that last speech, but there are at least a couple that I would like to correct relative to taxes, one of them being that in the last 6 years, the tax reductions that have been put in place actually reduce taxes for every single American who pays income taxes, and actually took some people that were paying income taxes and took them off the tax rolls. And that the Democrats' budget, which has in fact been passed, unlike the minimum wage increase which is not actually in the law at this point, but the Democrats' budget which has in fact been passed has proposed potentially to roll back all of those tax increases and thereby increase taxes on every single taxpayer in America. 
   With that, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Colorado.

I thank the gentleman, and I would just like to amplify what he said, that if in fact what this amendment does is take spending to last year, then it's not a cut at all.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr Chairman, one of the last speakers on the other side of the aisle mentioned that he wasn't quite sure why we kept talking about taxes and tax increases, because inevitably if you head toward the balanced budget, that is what all spending turns into: it turns into taxes. 
   In fact, the Democratic budget, which, to the majority party's credit, is heading toward a balanced budget in 5 years, as were I believe virtually all of the budgets that were presented this year, but it does so by saying, in its own terms, that they will raise taxes as much as they need to at the end of that 5 years in order to achieve a balanced budget. 
   So when we are talking today about things that are increasing in spending, this isn't something that is abstract. This isn't $20 million here, $40 million here, $100 billion there of just sort of faceless, nameless money. That is money in figures that are so large that most people, Mr. Chairman, have a hard time even comprehending how much that is and how it can relate to the things that we are doing. 
   But it makes it a little more down-to-earth, brings it a little more home, when you look at each one of these, which is the way we should look at them, Mr. Chairman, each one of these spending increases on each program, on each bill, on each thing here, and realize that every dollar of increase there is a dollar that the majority party wants to go get out of the pockets of taxpayers at home. That is what we are really talking about. That is why, Mr. Chairman, I propose this amendment. 
   Now, this amendment refers to just one of the many, many projects and many, many programs in this appropriations bill. This one is something that deals with weatherization assistance, and the bill that is before us proposes to increase weatherization assistance spending by 20 percent over last year. 
   Now, what is interesting is that in the President's budget, which this amendment proposes to reduce the spending to, the President has actually proposed to reduce this to almost half. Why is that? Because in something that is called energy efficiency and renewable energy, this program is actually not at all efficient. 
   I actually had some personal experience with this program, not personal in the sense that I was dealing with the program from a recipient standpoint, but when I was in the State legislature with this program in California. By the time that you deal with the Federal bureaucracy and then you get the money to the State and there is the State bureaucracy, and then you put this money out, very little of this money was actually going to anything toward the goal that was accomplished. And what is interesting is it is also creating a subsidy for something that already pays for itself. 
   The reason people weatherize their homes or seal leaks and so forth or cracks in windows and doors is because it saves you money on your energy bill over time. 
   So this is a program that has been shown to be inefficient, has been shown to not be effective, that subsidizes something that doesn't need subsidization, and which in this bill is proposed to increase by 20 percent. 
   Now, the President's budget proposed to reduce this. It is one of those things on that list of programs that a number of people have that are saying these are some of the most inefficient programs in the Federal Government today, and this is one of them that certainly should be reduced or perhaps eliminated. 
   But instead, this bill proposes to increase it by nearly $40 million. And, again, $40 million, I guess sometimes this is the difference between government and not government. When things don't work in government, it seems that there is always a group of people saying the reason they are not working is because they don't have enough money, and we need to spend more money on them. Whereas, normally in the real world, Mr. Chairman, when something isn't working, that is when people take money from it, make it become more efficient, or not fund it anymore if it is not working. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, this amendment, just this one area of this one Department, proposes to reduce this to the President's proposed budget.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   I want to make a last couple of comments relative to the comments made by the gentleman from Massachusetts. A lot of what the gentleman from Massachusetts said I agree with. I think we differ in three basic areas. 
   One is that the gentleman from Massachusetts believes this program has been effective. My involvement with it in California and things that I have seen statistically here say otherwise. Certainly the administration agrees this program has not been a cost-effective program. 
   Second is talking about how this thing might save money here. But where does this money come from? It is $245 million. This money does not come from the sky. It does not come from the air. It comes from taxpayers. And the question is not does it save anybody any money or anybody anything; is it cost effective in what it does? And I think the answer is ``no.'' 
   The third comment I would like to make is that the gentleman pointed out a number of programs in this bill which have all been increased in this proposed bill. That is fine, but I guess I would ask this: Are there no programs here which are not effective? Are there no programs that deserve some reduction in spending or perhaps even elimination? 
   Ronald Reagan said that the closest thing to eternal life is a government program, and I believe we are seeing with programs like this that those words Ronald Reagan made some time ago ring true.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I was not going to speak on this amendment. I was somewhat encouraged by the silence on the other side of the aisle when it originally came out. 
   But then when the majority party indicated that they are going to oppose this amendment, I have to stand up and say just, at least, one thing. We are going to have some amendment debates later today about how much money to spend on various programs and how much to spend on various things and how much to spend overall on this bill, whether we should be spending more of the taxpayers' money on things or less of the taxpayers' money on things. 
   We are going to have that debate today and tomorrow and the next day, and there are certainly disagreements between the majority side and the minority side on those issues as to whether we should tax people more and spend their money or tax people less and let them spend their own money. 
   But, interestingly, this amendment isn't about that. This amendment doesn't change the funding in the bill. It simply says we ought to have a mechanism to make the money that's there go farther. 
   I really don't understand why my Democratic colleagues would have some ideological objection to that. If we are going to spend a certain amount of money on a program, regardless of what that program does, couldn't we all agree that we would like it to do as much as it can with that amount of money? 
   Certainly, if we allow private contractors, or contractors, the opportunity to say, hey, we can do this thing for less money, and we can do the same thing, and the agency determines that it's the same thing for less money, wouldn't we want them to do that? 
   This, actually, is not about spending less money. We will get to that later. But this is about having the money we spend go farther. 
   I mean, it's just like for people, Mr. Chairman, that are watching at home, imagining that, well, I am going to go out and, you know, get dry cleaning today, but I don't care how much it costs, and I don't care if the place next door does it cheaper, and they are every bit as good or better. I don't care, I am going to use the more expensive place because we are not going to make competition.

That's what this amendment says, is that we're going to allow people to shop or get the better product for the best price.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   This debate that began yesterday and continues today is really about two things. One thing we've heard a lot about here recently in the last few speeches that people have given is whether or not the majority party wants to have earmark spending that is secret and that is not subject to individual vote. We believe that such spending ought not to be secret and ought to be subject to an individual vote. That's one thing. 
   But there is another thing, and that is that this bill simply spends too much. This bill has an increase in it, and I know the gentleman from North Carolina and I had a discussion on this yesterday. Let's just talk about the nonemergency spending. 
   This bill increases spending from year to year by 13.6 percent. Again, that is a lot. It is a lot more than inflation, which has been running under 3 percent. It is a lot more than most people see as an increase in their salaries. Why, in fact, if someone out there listening, Mr. Chairman, makes $15 an hour, if they were to get a similar increase this year, they would make over $17 an hour next year. I mean, most people out there making $15 an hour would love an increase to $17 an hour, but they're probably not going to get a  $2 increase, but yet this bill proposes to expand the spending by 13.6 percent. 
   Now, people on the other side of the aisle, Democrats that continually criticize our amendments and the things we're talking about by saying that we are cutting spending, the two amendments before us right now and the previous amendments we voted on last night and most of the amendments, if not all, that we're going to see later, are not cutting anything. They are slowing the growth. If you get $1 a month and somebody gives you $2 a month, that's an increase; it's not a cut. But they keep saying cut on the other side of the aisle so much that I believe perhaps a little visual assistance is required. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I just want to make this very, very clear. One equals one. If you are getting $1 and you still get $1, that is not a cut. That's the same amount of money that you had before. Two is actually more than one. So that if you were getting $1 and now you get $2, that also is not a cut, even if you wanted $3. Because what Members on the Democratic side of the aisle continue to say is, oh, we're getting one, we want three, you're only going to give us two and so, therefore, it's a cut. No, it is not. One equals one, two is more than one, regardless of what you want. 
   Mr. Rogers will propose an amendment later that has already been described by the other side as a massive cut, except it will leave a 7 percent increase, I believe, roughly, in spending in this bill. A 7 percent increase from year to year is not a cut. 
   The amendment that is before us right now, Mr. McHenry's amendment, proposes to spend less money than the bill before us on the Secretary's bureaucratic operation, but it actually allows the Secretary's bureaucrats to spend more than they spent last year. That, again, is not a cut. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, let us make it clear here that Republicans are not proposing to cut this bill. We are not proposing to cut spending in the Department of Homeland Security. We are proposing to increase it at a rate which is sustainable because if you continue to increase things at 13.6 percent a year, then that requires that everyone out there who's making that $15 an hour get a raise to $17 and give it all to the government in order to keep paying for this sort of increase. American taxpayers cannot afford that kind of increase after increase after increase.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I've been listening to the debate on this particular amendment, and I've heard a number of people who are opposed to it speak, I suppose, about their theories, about how this won't work or why it may not be effective or what it may do or affect people in a community or whatever. 
   I am here, Mr. Chairman, not to talk about theories or not to talk about speculation, but to talk about what this particular program has done, in fact, in Orange County, California. My congressional district is entirely encompassed within the County of Orange in California. There are five other Members of this body whose congressional districts are either entirely within Orange County, California, or partially within Orange County, California, and two jurisdictions within that county, both the Orange County sheriff's department and the police at the city of Costa Mesa, California, have been engaged in this program. 
   I would like to read from a press release that was issued from the Office of Sheriff-Coroner Mike Carona. This press release was issued just last month relative to the effectiveness of the program that is the subject of the lady from Virginia's amendment. 
   It says, ``Since the inception of Orange County Sheriff Michael Carona's cross-designation program in January 2007, deputies have increased the number of immigration holds by more than 400 percent, from approximately 350 to over 1,600. Of this amount, more than 1,000 of the undocumented individuals who were booked into Orange County jail were charged with felony law violations, and over 100 were known gang members.'' 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, this is fact, that since the Orange County sheriff's department participated in this program and had its deputies trained on how to enforce our illegal immigration laws, they have taken off the street 1,600 illegal aliens, 1,000 of whom were felons. So because of this program, there are 1,000 fewer illegal immigrant felons walking the streets in Orange County, California. 
   That is not theory. That is not conjecture. That is actually fact. 
   Also, in the city of Costa Mesa, which I do not represent, but is represented by Congressman Rohrabacher, but it's adjacent to my district, they've recently trained their officers in enforcing immigration laws, and between March and May of 2007, they identified and placed containers on 146 illegal immigrants in the city jail, and of this amount, 53 had committed felonies. 
   Now, this is in addition to the 1,000 felons that I talked about before, because it's a separate jurisdiction, a separate city police force dealing with their jurisdiction within the County of Orange. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, this program is effective, and I know some people who are opposed to this amendment have said that somehow it's going to disrupt community relations or something like that. I can tell you that the Orange County sheriff's office has been very, very involved in the community generally, broadly in Orange County, both in ethnic communities and in regular communities, and very involved in stopping drugs. 
   Because what a lot of people are interested in, particularly in some lower-income communities, is getting the drug dealers and getting the problems that drugs create out of their community. That's what they're interested in. They're not necessarily interested in protecting felons or in making sure that somehow when we have illegal alien felons that we handicap or restrict the ability of local law enforcement to find those people, identify them and bring them to justice and eventually out of this country. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment from the lady from Virginia, and I support it on the basis of actual, real experience that has happened in my county; and, that we know of, well over 1,000 felons who are no longer on the street.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Speaker, I have heard it said that this bill is a $700 billion bailout for Wall Street. It is none of those things. 
   The $700 billion is not being spent. It will be used to buy assets. Those assets will have value. And there are three mechanisms built into the bill that are very likely to recover all of that $700 billion for the taxpayer and, perhaps, even earn a profit over time. It's said to be a bailout, but the people whose assets will be bought will probably get 30 cents or 20 cents or 40 or 50 cents on the dollar that they paid maybe just a year or so ago. 
   I don't think anybody here would consider getting 30 cents on the dollar for something you invested in a year ago or 2 years ago as a bailout. I think that's taking a bath, as well they should. 
   They made an investment. They took a risk. It didn't turn out well. 
   They say it's for Wall Street. Let there be no denying this. The impact of this financial crisis will extend to every American with a job, with a bank account and with a pension plan. We cannot allow that to happen. 
   I have come down to this floor many times talking about the benefits of Republican ideas and the problems with Democratic ideas. This is not a time for that. We cannot and should not be Republicans or Democrats or liberals or conservatives today. This issue is too grave. The consequences are too dire. 
   We have two choices in front of us. One is to do nothing. If there is consensus amongst everyone who has spoken today, it is that to do nothing will result in unconscionable consequences to this economy that will cause people to lose their jobs, lose their retirement, lose their savings. We do not want that to happen. 
   The other option is to take the bill that is before us, which has been working for 9 days, which has things in it which, it's not everything any of us want, but it is the product of extensive negotiations from all concerned parties. We can take that bill today, and we can give it a chance to work and save this economy. 
   I desperately hope and pray that we as a body, Republicans and Democrats alike, have the courage today to do the right thing and pass this bill.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, the bill that we have before us today would increase spending. When coupled with the supplemental bill that the President just signed a few weeks back, would increase spending in the area of homeland security by nearly 17 percent. Now, perhaps people on the other side of the aisle have not noticed, but we have a deficit, a very large deficit in this country. And we still are adding to that deficit every year. 
   Now, I think Members on the other side of the aisle have noticed this because they have talked about their PAYGO and other principles, that we won't be increasing spending without some way to pay for this. However, with this appropriations bill we are doing exactly that. We are increasing spending by billions of dollars, by 17 percent over last year's level, without paying for it in any way, without reducing spending anywhere else, which means that we are adding to the deficit because of the spending, the additional spending that is in this bill. 
   Let me just give you a sense of what a 17 percent increase is. If someone outside of this building in the world is making $15 an hour, they would have to get a raise this year to $17.55 an hour in order for their income to keep pace with the spending increase in this bill.     
   Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that most of the people out there making $15 an hour, or any number you want, are not likely to see their bosses come in and say we want to give you a raise of 17 percent from $15 an hour to $17.55 an hour, not something that they are likely to see. But yet to keep and sustain this level of increase in spending, that's exactly what would have to happen or else we just take more and more and more money out of individuals' pockets so we can spend it here. 
   Now, I'm sure that people on the other side in support of this bill are going to start to talk about how important this bill is to homeland security. Okay. We will have that debate over the next couple of days about what is in this bill, but what this amendment does is deal purely with bureaucracy. We're not dealing here with any program. We're not dealing here with officers in the field. We're not dealing here with equipment that's being used or computers or anything else for homeland security.  
   What this amendment says is simply that the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management, the office of the Secretary, purely bureaucracy, gave the Secretary of Homeland Security and the people in that person's office, right now this bill gives them an 11 percent increase, when we're trying to get a deficit down, when we want to, at least some of us do, keep taxes low. 
   What this bill says is you ought to be able to get by on what you had last year. It is not even proposing that we cut the spending of this bureaucracy, not even proposing that we take the Secretary's office and just their bureaucracy in there and cut it, but simply saying get by on the same amount of money you did last year. Now, how many people in America do that every day but somehow the bureaucracy in Homeland Security can't do that? 
   And by doing that, Mr. Chairman, this amendment saves $10 million. Now, maybe in a $3 trillion budget it doesn't sound like much, but $10 million is still a lot of money. It's a lot of money to everybody out there. It's lot of money to me. It's a lot of money to you. And $10 million and $10 million and $10 million and we will eventually get our spending down, and that, Mr. Chairman, is how we are going to eliminate this budget deficit and that's how we're going to do it without having the largest increase in taxes in American history, which the other side has proposed to do. 
   And what is that tax increase for? It's for things like this, for things like taking a bureaucracy of people, sitting around doing phone calls and paper and saying we're going to give you an 11 percent raise. We should not be doing that, not in this environment and not in this bill. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I would respectfully ask that Members support this amendment, not feed the bureaucracy further and save the taxpayers $10 million.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas. The gentleman from New York said that there were two types of amendments, one that tried to do something that you believe in and others that make statements. 
   I would like to assure the gentleman from New York that I believe in this amendment, and I think a lot of people on this side of the aisle believe in this amendment because we believe that we need to start controlling costs in this government. 
   And is this amendment all by itself going to do that? No, of course not, but it will begin the process of doing that, and in combination with a lot of other amendments like it, yes, it will start to control the cost of government, and, yes, I firmly believe in what this amendment is about, in spite of what the gentleman from New York suggested. 
   The gentleman from North Carolina talked about numbers, and perhaps my numbers are incorrect, but this bill is now at $36.254 billion over and enacted last year $31.905 billion which is a 13.6 percent increase.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   To the gentleman from North Carolina, this is something I guess we'll probably need to work out as we go along because I'm not looking at increase over a baseline. We're looking at increase over actual enacted last year, and maybe we can compare notes. But my notes show that that actual last year was $31.905 billion, and then there was the supplemental which has been added on top of this bill itself. 
   But in any event, one other thing the gentleman from North Carolina alluded to was that this amendment proposes to cut spending in this area in the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management. I want to make that clear. This is a definitional thing which we often have problems with in this House and in this building. 
   What this amendment proposes to do is to leave the budget for the Office of Secretary and Executive Management equal to what it was in the prior fiscal year. That is not a cut. If you have $10 and I give you $10, I take away $10, give you back $10, that is not a cut. That is the same amount of money you had before. What this does do is it prevents the 11 percent increase that is in this bill. 
   So let's make it very clear in vernacular that if I make $10 an hour and I want to make $11, if somebody gives me a raise to $10.50, it is still a raise; it is not a cut. And that's what is going on here. 
   We are not proposing to cut this office. We are merely proposing to tell them, do continue your operations on the same amount of money that you did last year. I don't think that is a great leap to ask of what is clearly an element of the bureaucracy, in spite of the gentleman from North Carolina's admonitions that it is not.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman from Georgia. 
   To the gentleman from North Carolina, just to clarify again on these numbers, we agreed that it's $36.3 billion in this bill, and the number you threw out, $34.2 billion, I believe, was the President's budget proposal for this, and that the prior year enacted, 2007 enacted, was $31.9 billion. 
   Do you have different numbers on that?

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina. 
   If I can refer to the gentleman, I believe I heard, and maybe we can sort this out, but I think that if you include  the supplementals on both sides, that we went from $34.2 billion to $39.2 billion, which would be a 15.2 percent increase, perhaps not the 17 I said earlier, but in either event, frankly, whether it's 17 percent, 15 percent or the 13.6, if you leave both of the supplementals out, it's a lot of money. It's billions and billions and billions of dollars of increase. 
   Some of that increase is a lot more than inflation, multiple times more than inflation, and it's a lot more than taking the growth in inflation and the growth in population and put it together. Most importantly, it's a lot more than personal income growth. 
   That's something we need to look at, as we are looking at all these appropriations and all of these spending bills. Because if we increase spending faster than people's incomes are increasing in America, it is unsustainable over time unless you continue to take more and more and more of their hard-earned money away from them. 
   Now, I know that's what many of you on the other side of the aisle want to do. But, A, we don't; and, B, even if you want to do it, eventually you'll run out of space. Eventually, you'll take it all if you increase at this kind of level. 
   Once again, this amendment does not ask anybody to cut anything. It simply tells this one element, this one part of the bureaucracy in Homeland Security to do, get by and exist on the same amount of money that you had last year. 
   I thank the gentleman from North Carolina.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I too want to comment on some of the comments made by the Appropriations Committee chairman, the gentleman from Wisconsin. 
   There are two things we are doing here. One was just very eloquently presented by the gentleman from Arizona.  We are trying to say and trying to insist that when these projects, when these earmarks, when these sorts of things appear in these bills, that there is sunshine, that people know what they are, that they can see them and that they are subject to an up-and-down vote, rather than these big slush funds that appear in this bill and others as they are currently constructed. 
   The other thing we are trying to do here is very simple, and that is saving the taxpayers $21 billion. There is $21 billion more that has been proposed to spend in the Democrats' appropriations bills than what the President proposed to spend. 
   Now, I might add that I am one of the 160 people who voted for a budget to spend $20 billion less than the President has proposed. It is not like what the President proposed was a flat budget. It is not like the President proposed a budget that didn't increase spending; it did. But what you have done is taken the President's proposals for spending increases, accepted all that, and added to it in most cases. 
   I think it is very interesting that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee seems so surprised that the amendments that some of us are offering, including the one that I offered just about an hour or so ago, that these were reducing spending that was actually proposed by the administration. 
   It may come as a surprise to people on the other side of the aisle, but we don't really care who proposed it, whether the President proposed it, a Democrat proposed it or a Republican proposed it. If it is spending more money than we believe should be spent, if it is increasing spending that increases the deficit, if it is further putting pressure, further trying to create a reason to enact the largest tax increase in American history that you all want to do, then we are going to want to stop it. And that is what we are doing. 
   Now, there was a comment also made by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that there were 120 amendments, I believe he said, on this bill. We are talking about a lot money. I would bet there are a lot more than 120 earmarks that get put in here by the time things are done. I know there is at least $21 billion of more spending in all of these appropriations bills, and specifically on this bill itself a nearly $5 billion increase in spending over last year. So, for $5 billion and countless thousands of earmarks, 120 amendments is not a problem. 
   It may be many more than that. It could take many more than that.     
   These are big issues. These are important things. This is about whether we are going to start to arrest spending where we can, or whether we are going to let it continue to grow and grow and grow. Whether we are going to allow Americans to keep at least the amount of their own money that they keep now, or whether this government is going to continue to tax them and tax them and take more of it. If it is 120 amendments or 240 amendments or 480 amendments, we will stand here and we stand ready to do that. 
   I would hope that the message would get across at some point to the other side of the aisle that what they are doing is not right, and that these amendments are processes by which we are getting to what is right, which is not increasing spending on everything, not increasing all of these things and trying to keep it under control and making sure that when we do spend the taxpayers' money, we are up front about what it is, about who requested it and why. And that people have an opportunity to challenge that request. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have begun some amendments and we have a lot more. This is not a joke. This is not silly, this is not something that we don't believe in. This is something we believe in very deeply, and it is something that is important and that's why we are engaged in this fight and will continue to be engaged in this fight.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  
   Mr. Chairman, I want to clarify again that the gentleman from North Carolina just said that this amendment proposed by Ms. Foxx cuts $1.24 million from the President's request. 
   It is true that, in fact, it proposes to spend less on the Office of General Counsel, which is the attorneys, than what the President has proposed. But that does not make it a cut. Because what it proposes to do is leave the spending for the Office of General Counsel, for the attorneys, in the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management at exactly the same level they had last year. 
   I really have a hard time understanding how it is always a cut when it is less of an increase than you want it to be, or than somebody wants it to be, in this case, I suppose, than the President wants it to be. But we are not looking at this as Republican spending or Democratic spending, we are looking at it as spending. 
   The reason, I am not sure that it's been made quite as clear as perhaps it ought to be, that in the Democrats' budget that you all passed a month or so ago, where you moved towards a balanced budget, and I take you at your word that it's your intention to, at some point, get to a balanced budget, but you did it by enacting, proposing, I guess it's the second largest tax increase in American history, which means that as you increase spending on things, you intend to then balance the budget by increasing taxes. 
   That is clearly what you are going to do. That is what your budget does, and you have made it very clear through your PAYGO provisions what you intend to do. When you increase spending, going to balance the budget will increase taxes. 
   So with this amendment and with every other amendment we are looking at, we are saying here that we are not going to increase spending in the Office of General Counsel by $1.2 million. That is $1.2 million of additional spending that will not occur if this amendment passes. 
   But that means it is $1.2 million of taxes that you all won't raise if this amendment passes. Now that works on this amendment, it works on various other amendments that will be coming up through the evening. So it's more than just an academic exercise about whether or not a certain department's budget should be increased.     
   It, in fact, affects, Mr. Chairman, people at home today now watching this. Is this $1.2 million that you want to see your taxes increase to spend? I think not. I think most of the people on this side believe not; and that is really what we're talking about, because if you say, as you did in your budget, that you will increase whatever taxes you need to to get to a balanced budget, then this $1.2 million is $1.2 million of money that you will take out of Americans' pockets that you're not taking now. 
   And it's really more than that, because if this were to go in, then next year there's a new base, and it's a higher base, and if you increase it another 10 percent beyond that, then it's another $1.22 million; and if you increase it again, it's another $1.44 million. And it goes on and on, and so that over a 5-year period this $1.2 million magically turns into about $6 million or so of people's money that gets spent, and which you will propose, undoubtedly, to increase taxes to cover so that you can balance the budget. 
   We can balance this budget, and we can balance it without taking any more money out of Americans' pockets. And we can balance it by passing amendments like this and simply asking government to live with the money they have now. This is not a cut, just live with the money you have now. 
   Can't this General Counsel's Office, can't these attorneys operate for another year on the same amount of money that they got last year? I think they can.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   You know, I would like to give some credit to my colleague from California, the author of this particular budget. It raises taxes; it raises taxes a whole, whole bunch. 
   But the lady from California, my colleague, stood up here and admitted  that. She said, yeah, we're raising taxes in this budget. That's what we're doing. 
   Raising taxes is a legitimate policy decision. It is something, Madam Chair, that people can make a decision to do. And in all three Democratic budgets, the authors have made the decision to raise taxes. They have made the decision to raise taxes. But in this budget, the people behind this are standing up here and are proud about it. We admit it, we're proud of it, and that's what we're doing. They are standing behind that policy decision to raise taxes. They are raising taxes on almost everyone, and they are proud to do that. 
   I think it is not a particularly good policy decision, but it is a legitimate one. They are raising taxes in all three of these budgets anywhere from $3,000 per taxpayer to $7,500 per taxpayer per year. It is a legitimate policy decision. I think it happens to be not a particularly good one, but at least they are standing up and saying, that's what we want to do, and that's what we're going to do, and that's how we're going to raise the budget. 
   Democrats have put together these three budgets that are raising taxes. Be proud that you are raising taxes if that's what you want to do, because that's what you're doing. Be proud of it. Stand behind it. Don't pretend like you're not doing it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Speaker, tonight, and the next 60 minutes, we are going to talk a little bit about one of the major issues that will be on the floor here in the House of Representatives as people vote later this week, and that will be the budget of the United States Government for the next fiscal year, the fiscal year that begins later this year. It's called the 2008 fiscal year budget. 
   There will be several budgets offered; but if history is any guide, the one that is most likely to pass is the one that is being offered by the majority party, or the majority Democrats, in this case. 
   That budget is a travesty. Tonight, we are going to show you why, why that is not the budget that should pass, why that is not the budget that should govern the United States taxpayers' money over the next year. This budget that we will see later this week proposed by the Democrat majority has the largest tax increase in American history. Let me say that again: this budget you will see the Democrats propose this week has the largest tax increase in American history. It has no reform of any of the entitlements. 
   If we are going to save Medicare, we are going to save Social Security for future generations, as we will explain to you later, they are unsustainable. They have to be reformed. They have no reform whatsoever. 
   They do not save or preserve the Social Security surplus. You know, people pay Social Security taxes. When they do, they presume that money goes to pay for Social Security. Makes sense. That is why it's called a Social Security tax. 
   But, no, every year, a portion of that money is used to pay various other priorities of the Federal Government. The budget that the Democrats will propose this year for the next 5 years will not change that one little bit. Yes, this budget, Democrat budget later this week, is full of empty promises except one, to give you the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Now, let's bore into a few of these things. Let's look into a little bit of this in detail. In order to do that I have a few charts here. I don't want to have anyone have some flashback to Ross Perot, I know he had charts, so I have charts too. I have charts to show you what's happening. 
   This first one shows there is a misconception there, particularly on the Democratic side of the aisle, in spite of all the statistics, that somehow the deficit that we are in today was caused by the tax relief that was enacted back in 2003, that somehow allowing people at home to keep more of their own money to spend on their priorities, rather than Washington's priorities, that somehow allowing people to do that caused the deficit that we have today. It's absolutely not true. 
   If you look at this chart, you will see that total Federal revenues declined until 2003, when the tax relief was enacted, and they have risen and are now up somewhere around 46 percent. Since then, the Federal Government has 46 percent more revenue, 46 percent more money than it did in 2003. 
   I would ask the average American taxpayer at home, do you have 46 percent more money, more revenue, more income than you had in 2003? If you don't, you should understand, the Democrats believe that the 46 percent increase for the Federal Government wasn't enough, and that whatever you got, it was too much. Because they want to take some of what you have and put it right here in Washington, right here in the midst of the Federal Government. 
   So the tax relief did not cause the deficit, actually caused an increase in revenue. Spending caused the deficit, too much spending, something the budget, the Democrats are proposing the majority party does, is more. Their  proposal over the next 5 years is to spend more and more and more, yet raise your taxes to do it. So they are taking the thing that is reducing the deficit and getting rid of it, and taking the problem that has created the deficit spending and giving you more of it. Let me show you a few more things why these tax reductions actually resulted in more revenue. 
   They stimulate the economy. When you have more money, what do you do with it? You save it, you invest it. You spend it, you create jobs, you do all kinds of good things with it. That is why after the tax relief was enacted in 2003, we created more jobs, lots more jobs, every single month, not a single month without more jobs created in this country since the tax relief was enacted. 
   What else did the tax relief do? It also increased gross domestic product. That is basically the size of the total economy. If you look, after 2003, it's not so good, but after 2003, gross domestic product has increased dramatically every single quarter. So many charts, they are falling down. The chart fell down and so did the unemployment rate after the enactment of the tax decreases. Again, here they go. Unemployment up close to 6.5 percent, and where is it now? Down around 4.5 percent. 
   These things are not coincidences. These good things that happened to the economy did not suddenly hit just when the tax relief went into effect by coincidence. No. The tax relief left billions and billions of dollars in the American public's hands and in the American taxpayers' hands so they could use it for their purposes and help the economy grow. That is what we should be doing more of, not less of. 
   But the proposed Democratic budget does a lot less of that. Let's talk for a second about how much less. This proposed budget has the greatest increase in taxes in American history. 
   Now, I could tell average taxpayers, people at home, how much is that? Oh, it's $392.5 billion a year. What does that mean? They don't know what that means. But let me tell you and bring it home a little better. It means $3,035 for the average tax return in America per year, per year, folks. 
   As people sit at home and they watch this, imagine the Democrats' budget is saying to you, $3,000 per year, you have to pay more here to Washington so they can spend it on more of their priorities. 
   We often hear, gee, in Washington, the spenders like to say, the tax and spenders like to say, oh, we need to do this, and we have to get the money. Where are we going to find the money if we don't raise taxes? 
   Well, I would say this, where is the average American going to find that money? Do you think they just will say, $3,000 a year, oh, that is no problem. That is just about $250 a month. That is nothing. I have got lots of that. That is no problem, we are happy to do that. 
   I don't think so. I think that would cause a tremendous impact on the average American family, a tremendous impact on their budget, and not a good one if it would have the reverse of all these effects. It would start to drive unemployment up. It would start to drive job growth down. It would start to the drive the economy down. We need to stop this budget that will appear here on the floor this week. 
   Now, I would like to introduce the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Barrett). Mr. Barrett, before you begin speaking, I would like to point out to you, because I have these figures broken down by State, that the average South Carolinian under the Democrats' tax proposal would pay $2,482.66 more tax per year. So you might tell me, Mr. Barrett of South Carolina, how do you think the average taxpayer in South Carolina is going to pay for that?

What are the major differences? I mean, could you lay out for me and for Madam Speaker and for anyone watching what are those differences? 
   And I yield.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Thank you, Mr. Barrett from South Carolina. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, so you don't think that we are just trying to do rhyming people here, we go from Mr. Barrett of South Carolina to Mr. Garrett of New Jersey. But before I yield to Mr. Garrett from New Jersey, you know, I am from California, and California taxpayers, under the Democrats' proposal, would pay $3,331.09 more per taxpayer in California. 
   Now, I thought that was a lot. I thought that was a lot. It is one of the higher numbers on the page. But it is not as much as New Jersey. Taxpayers in New Jersey would pay $3,779.88 more in taxes under the Democrats proposal than they do now. And that is an average, again, per tax return filed per year. Almost $4,000. 
   I am glancing here and I think, Mr. Garrett, there is only one other State that is going to pay, have more of an increase and that is Connecticut than New Jersey. So I am curious, Scott Garrett from New Jersey, what exactly do you think and what will people in New Jersey think and how will they deal with $4,000 a year more taxes? 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I was going to say, one thing that you can do here in Washington is print money. The average family can't. If the Democrats were to pass this budget and give them that $4,000 or $3,800 tax increase in New Jersey, your citizens in New Jersey can't print money like the Federal Government to just run a deficit, can they? 
   I yield back to the gentleman.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I think this discussion we are having right now gets to the core of the difference between what Democrats in Washington, how they look at things and how we Republicans in Washington look at things. They look at it from the sense of, well, if we don't raise these taxes, how is the government going to spend more money on this or spend more money on that, or how are they going to get to take that? Because that is what it amounts to. When you tax everybody else, you come here, the 435 of us, plus the 100 people in the other body, get to spend the money on the stuff they want to spend it on.     
   And so how can we spend that money if we don't do this? 
   You and I, Mr. Garrett, look at it from the standpoint of families, of taxpayers, of people. What are they not going to be able to do in New Jersey with that almost $350 a month? I mean, that is a nice car payment. That is substantial child care. That is a chunk of a house payment. It is a lot of different things to a lot of people. And we look at everything from the sense of the family, the taxpayer. They come first and the government comes second. That is not the way the Democrats in this town look at it, is it? 
   I yield back to the gentleman.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, it is a matter of it is your money. When you earn it, when people earn the money, it is their money. It is not the government's money. It is their money and the government takes some of it for necessary operation to run government. But it is not like it is all the government's money and the government allows you to keep some. That is not the way we look at it. 
   I yield back to the gentleman

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) so much for his comments and his hard work on these efforts and on these proposals to recognize that it is your money first, taxpayers. It is your money first. It is not the government's first that they let you keep some of. It is your money, and you should keep all of it except for the minimum amount necessary to properly run the government. 
   Now let us talk about a few more things on these taxes. Some of the rhetoric that people may hear from the majority party here is that this tax relief in 2003, 2001, this just gave tax cuts to the rich. We hear that over and over: ``tax cuts to the rich.'' Well, as Mr. Garrett pointed out, a $70,000-a-year family of four in New Jersey is probably not rich, and they would be paying $1,500 or whatever the amount was that you said. 
   Let us look at some of this. Now, these are numbers in billions of dollars, Mr. Speaker; so they can't relate to per person. This is the total Democrat proposed tax increase. This orange slice stands for the people who save money because of the 10 percent income tax bracket. Now, the 10 percent income tax bracket is the lowest tax bracket that exists. It is at $15,000 of income for a married couple. So this amount of this tax is going to people with roughly a taxable income of about $15,000. That is rich? I don't think so. 
   Look at this slice right here, this red slice. This is people who get the child tax credit and the marriage penalty credit, these benefits which the Democrats have proposed to raise, to cut in half the child tax credit and to eliminate what was put in place sometime ago so that people don't get a penalty, don't pay more tax if two people both earn income get married. Under the old law, a lot of them pay more tax. Now a lot fewer of them pay more tax. This would get rid of that. Both of these phase out over a certain income level. So all of these are geared only for people at lower income levels. 
   Let us look at this chunk. This is the death tax, which can affect all kinds of people, whether it is the 
   person who is deceased or whether it is one of the many beneficiaries of someone who is deceased. And we know how the death tax has been destructive for family farms, family businesses, people wanting to pass their home that maybe has been in the family for generations, maybe only for a short period of time, but they want their children to have it, and they can't because the death tax got in the way. 
   We are scheduled to have the death tax continue to decline. But the Democrat budget has proposed to put it way back into full force and effect with a rate, I believe, of up to 55 percent. 
   And then look at this chunk, the biggest chunk of all the marginal rates. That means seniors with dividends and capital gains income and people at all other schedules in the different tax brackets within the Tax Code. These tax increases affect everyone, not just the supposed rich. 
   And let us look at what this would do to certain tax rates: the 35 percent tax rate would go to 39.6. A capital gains tax rate of 15 would go to 20. The estate tax would go from 0 to 55 percent. The child tax credit, from $1,000 to $500. And the very lowest tax bracket starting at taxable income, technically, of 0 would go from 10 to 15 percent. So, again, tax increases on everybody all across the board. 
   We talked a lot about taxes tonight. But as I said when we started this conversation, the reason we have a deficit is not because we lowered taxes. Lowering taxes stimulated the economy, created more revenue for the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, the reason we have a deficit is because we spend too much. And here is a chart showing how spending drives the long-term problems: 
   Here is our spending today, roughly 20 percent of the economy; so already the Federal Government is spending about $1 out of $5 that exists in the economy. But if we leave things alone, if we allow spending to go forward and grow as it is in law now and if we just left all these things alone, it will go by 2049, you see here, up to nearly double that, nearly 40 percent of the economy. So $4 out of every $10 in the economy would be government spending. 
   Now, what this chart doesn't show is in countries where they have done this sort of thing before. The private part of the economy contracts. It doesn't have money for investment. It doesn't have money for growth. If government takes 3,331 more dollars out of each taxpayer in California, as the Democrats have proposed to do to spend on some of this stuff, they don't have that money to save. They don't have that money to invest. They don't have that money to buy things that help stimulate the economy. The government has it. The government doesn't save it. The government doesn't invest it. The government just spends it. And as we know, in a lot of cases not particularly wisely. So that is what happens if we leave spending alone. That is why we have a deficit. 
   Even with the Democrats' proposed tax cuts, which is the orange line here, Mr. Speaker, you see it isn't going to work. The spending increases much faster than even after those tax increases. 
   So I say to the people who have put together the majority budget, what do you plan to do here? Are we ever going to deal with this rapid exponential growth in spending? Or are you planning to raise these taxes further? Is the $3,331 per taxpayer in California just the beginning? Are we looking over a 10- or 15-year period of time at twice that? Three times that? Four times that? The sort of thing it would take to get anywhere near this spending level? 
   Chairman Bernanke is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. And the Federal Reserve, I think there is pretty general unanimity on both sides of the aisle, as well as with the economists, that the Federal Reserve has done a pretty good job of managing our economy for some time, interest rates and inflation; and they tend to know what could set this economy off course and what could keep it on course. And I think they deserve a lot of credit for keeping the economy on course, not just over the last 3 or 4 years but over the last 15 or 20 years. 
   But Chairman Bernanke said just earlier this year that ``without early and meaningful action to address entitlements, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened with future generations bearing much of the cost.'' 
   What does he mean by that? When he talks about entitlements, he is talking about Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, things like that that the government does. And he said if we don't deal with it early and meaningfully, if we don't take early and meaningful action to deal with the growth in these retirements, that the economy is in trouble. 
   Now, the Democrat budget that will be on this floor later this week, let's see, it is a 5-year budget. What reform of entitlements does it include? Oh, yes. Zero. None. Not one change. Nothing in the entitlements over the next 5 years. Is that early reform? I don't think so. Is that meaningful reform? Well, if zero is meaningful, then maybe; but I don't think it is meaningful reform. 
   So let us look at what happens if we don't reform. Again, here is revenue, this black line. That is income coming into the Federal Government, roughly the same tax rates that we have today. But look at what happens to spending. It goes from a little more than we are taking in right now to nearly double. Nearly double if we don't reform. That is why Chairman Bernanke said, Mr. Speaker, that we need early and meaningful reform or this economy is in trouble, as he said, with future generations bearing much of the cost. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a lot of discussion about children around here and what is good for children and how we are going to help children. Let me tell you something I know is not good for children, and that is sending them this kind of price tag for us, for our Medicare, our Social Security, our Medicaid over the next 15, 20 years, and asking them to pay double, at least, the tax rates, the tax burden, that we pay because we didn't act.     
   We know this is coming. This is not a Republican chart. This is not a Democratic chart. This is prepared by  the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget. Any number of nonpartisan government agencies agree. All the experts agree. On the Budget Committee that Mr. Garrett and Mr. Barrett and I sit on, every single expert who came in said that this entitlement spending, this planned growth in spending, is a disaster, a budget disaster, that we can see. It is a train coming down the track right into our eyes. But we are not blinded. It is not like we can't see it, Mr. Speaker. It is right here. We can see it. It is right here on this chart. We know it is coming, and we know the only way to deal with it is to reform these things. 
   So where are they? Where are those reforms? What will people do if that top tax rate rises? 
   Let me pull out one of these other charts. Just think about it. Doubling taxes. I realize it is quite a few years off, but if we don't deal with it now, we will get there. What does that mean? I guess that means the 39 percent rate would go almost 80 percent. That capital gains would have to go to 40. The estate tax, I guess you just take it all, which has happened in some countries before. The child tax credit, you probably get rid of it. And the lowest tax bracket would probably need to go up to 20 or 25 percent. 
   Those obviously aren't exact figures or anything like that, Mr. Speaker, but just to give a sense of what we are talking about here if we don't do something, if we don't change these processes and change this. Because if you look at this chart again, the reason we can see the train coming is, if we do nothing, absolutely nothing, to change Social Security, that is this one, Medicare and Medicaid is this one, interest on the debt is that one. If we did nothing to change existing law, it is not like you have to do more, that we have to take action to spend this money. This is the money that will get spent if we do nothing, if we leave it alone under existing law. That is why we have to take action, and it is for the kids. 
   Our kids can't bear this burden. People have said that if we allow this to happen that my children will be the first generation of Americans to have a lower standing of living than their parents. We have never had that happen in this country, and we should never let it happen in this country. The only way it is going to happen is if we shirk our responsibility today, because, gosh, it is 15 years off, let's deal with it later. 
   This isn't about destroying Social Security. This is about saving Social Security. Because you really can't pay for this. There isn't enough money in the economy. So we have to reform it. We have to change the way it works to save it. 
   That is why Republican budgets will say we should save the Social Security system. We shouldn't spend it. That is why it is part of the American Taxpayers' Bill of Rights, which a group of us Republicans introduced a few weeks ago, where we said if you pay money for your retirement it should only be spent on your retirement. It shouldn't be spent on something else. 
   This isn't about destroying Medicare or wrecking Medicare, as you will probably hear demagoguery on the other side. It is about saving it. It won't continue this way. There isn't enough money. We have to save it, and to save it we must reform it. 
   You will see proposals, you will see reform, but not in the Democratic budget that we see today. And that is what is so disappointing, Mr. Speaker. We can't ignore it. We shouldn't ignore it. It is right there. It is right before us. 
   Our children will look back at this time in the future as to what we did with their inheritance. And I don't mean about the death tax necessarily. I mean the inheritance of optimism that is so much a part of the American ethos, the optimism that the average American can always do better, that anyone can lift themselves up, that they can move things forward. 
   Instead, this is saying, no, we have to take more of your money. We have to move things backwards. You may not be able to have the same things that your parents had because we need more of your money for a failed and inefficient system. 
   That is not the America my parents left me, it is not the America that I want to leave my children, but it is the America that this Democratic budget is heading us towards. 
   Mr. Speaker, we do not need the largest tax increase in American history. We need to let people keep more of their money, not less. Families will not struggle because government doesn't spend enough. Families will struggle when government spends too much and takes too much of their money. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need a solvent Social Security system, a solvent retirement system, not one that takes the money that that is taken out of people's paycheck for their retirement and spends it on other things and not one that is unsustainable, that won't exist 20 or 30 years from now. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need a Medicare system, a healthcare system, where people control their own healthcare, where people control their own destiny, not where the government is telling them what to do and telling them how to do it and using one of the most inefficient methods and high cost to do so. We have to reform that, or it won't exist in the future. 
   Yes, this Democratic budget is full of empty promises. You will hear about them over the next few days and weeks. You will hear that they promise to spend more money on this and spend more money on that and spend more money on the other thing, and in some cases they are definitely planning to do that. What they are not telling you is where they are getting it, and they are getting it right out of your pocket. 
   In some cases, they are going to say we are going to spend more money on this and spend more money on that and grow this program and grow that program; and, as Mr. Barrett from South Carolina said earlier, they don't actually have the money in the budget to do it. They are just telling you, oh, yeah, we are going to do it. But we will find the money later. 
   Well, you can be sure where they are going to get that money, probably the place they get the other money, right out of the American taxpayer. It is the only place to go, unless you cut spending somewhere else, which we are very happy to talk about, very willing to do. That is always something you do in budgets, you set those priorities. 
   Yes, it is a budget filled with empty promises, except one, the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Mr. Speaker, American taxpayers deserve better, and I hope that we will defeat this budget later this week.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This particular amendment would eliminate all the earmarks in the bill, all 800 of them, all $1.1 billion of them. 
   Now, I have two confessions to make about this amendment before I proceed  here. Confession number one is that the amendment is rather inartfully drafted. And the way it is drafted, it may actually catch some things, some elements of spending, that were not technically part of the 800 earmarks in the bill. But the reason for that is that the 800 earmarks are not actually in the bill. Something I would like to address later. But the amendment is drafted the only way it can be drafted under the current situation, under the current process, to eliminate all of these 800 earmarks and $1.1 billion. 
   The second confession I would like to make is that one of those 800 earmarks that is in the bill is one I requested. Now, I believe a couple other Members requested it as well, but it is definitely one that I requested. 
   So you may be asking why would I be proposing an amendment to eliminate an earmark that I requested. Do I suddenly believe that the earmark that I requested is somehow not valid or somehow not appropriate? No. Had I believed it was not valid or not appropriate when I requested it some months ago, I would not have requested it. 
   But the fact is, Mr. Chairman, that the process by which these earmarks happen stinks. And I believe that this process is terrible and that until we reform this process, we should eliminate all earmarks. 
   And that, Mr. Chairman, is why I offer this amendment to you today. It is not because I think that necessarily all 800 earmarks, including my own, in this bill are inappropriate. I do think $1.1 billion is more money than I would like to see relative to this or any earmarks. But it is because until we reform this process and have a process that works, I don't think we should do any earmarks at all. 
   The earmark process has, I believe, actually hurt not just Republicans and Democrats and not just taxpayers, but I believe it has hurt this institution. And I believe that is why Chairman Obey, the gentleman from Wisconsin, has expressed his own distaste for earmarks and the earmark process. 
   So let me make a few suggestions, 10 of them precisely, if I may, as to how this process might be reformed, how we might get it right. 
   First, put the earmarks in the bill. The reason we have had to draft this amendment so oddly is because the earmarks are not actually written in the text of the bill. If we are going to spend the taxpayers' money as Members of Congress on specific things, those specific things we are spending it on should be in the language of the bill that appropriates those expenditures. 
   Second, let's have full disclosure of all the earmarks in the bill and let's have it at least a week before the vote. I think we got the list of these earmarks last, I think it was, Thursday or Friday, and here we are debating these today. There are 800 earmarks in this bill. It is a little tough for us or anyone else to go through 800 earmarks in just a couple of days. 
   Third, let's have full disclosure of all earmark requests. Every earmark in this bill in theory has a certification from the Member who requested it claiming what they have requested and why and also claiming that they have no financial interest in that earmark. Let's make those public. Those were turned in, I can't remember exactly whether it was February or March. I think it was March. Why should those be under some secrecy? Why should all those earmark requests not be available to the public? And when we have full disclosure of earmarks, let's have real disclosure of earmarks. The disclosure that we got last week was one list that has the earmark amount and the project and another list that has the project and the Member requesting. So if you want to take the Member requesting and match it up with the amount, you have to match up the two lists somehow. Now, if there are only 10 earmarks, you could do that. But with 800 it is really hard to do, and not in a searchable database. In fact, in a few cases where we were able to get disclosure of the actual earmark request, which only happened yesterday afternoon, the description of the project in the earmark request is not the same as the description of the project on the earmark list. So what we have now is an attempt at some late partial disclosure. It is not full disclosure in any way, shape, or form of earmarks or earmark requests. 
   Mr. Obey has suggested that Members often feel like they are ATMs. That is what this earmark process does. It diminishes, I think, the value of all of us that serve in this institution. We are here to make public policy. We are not ATMs. I was stunned when, in my first few months as a Member of this House, 70 different people came into my office not asking for a certain element of public policy, not encouraging me to support this or that or the other, but asking for money, asking for earmarks, because they saw Members of Congress as an ATM. 
   Number four, we should not have any earmarks for programs that are not authorized; otherwise, why do we bother to authorize programs? If we are not going to go through the process of authorizing a program, then earmarks can come in and be about anything. I think that is what you have seen in some of Mr. Hensarling's and Mr. Flake's objections is that earmarks have become about almost anything. 
   Number five, we should not have earmarks that do not serve a Federal interest and have a Federal nexus. This is Federal taxpayers' money.     
   There are many great needs out there in cities, counties and States, but cities and counties and States have sources of revenue. It's not like we don't have enough to do here. It's not like we don't have other things that we could spend the money on. God forbid we might give it actually back to the taxpayers. But even if we weren't going to do that, there are obviously plenty of truly Federal priorities that we should not be fixing sewers and other things like that, which are clearly local priorities. 
   Six, we should not be including earmarks that are requested outside of the State of a Member of Congress. Now, the point of these earmarks is to direct funds for things that our constituencies need. Why would we ever be wanting to direct funds for things that some other constituency needs? We know why. It's because some lobbyist or something somewhere requested it. So let's not be requesting or honoring earmarks that are outside of one's State. 
   Seven, we shouldn't be giving earmarks to private entities without some kind of a competitive bidding process. You know, if other elements of the Federal Government were to award contracts for millions of dollars to private entities without some kind of bidding process, we would complain about it here. And we do complain about it when we see it, and we should complain about it when we see it. But yet under this earmark process, many earmarks are given directly to private entities without any competitive bidding process. 
   Eight, conference reports should never increase an earmark. Now, everything we could do here in the House to disclose and provide sunshine for earmarks could be null and void if you simply can drop earmarks into a conference report that were not in either the House or the Senate version of the bill. So we should never have earmarks coming back to this floor that are more than the amount that was in either the House or the Senate version of that bill. 
   Nine, earmarks should be available for discussion at a hearing. We're spending the public's money. It should be exposed, what we're doing; it should be clear to people what we're doing; and we should talk about it and be willing to stand up and defend it, or not do it. 
   Ten, when we eliminate earmarks, the money we save should go into debt reduction. It should save the taxpayers' money. It should go to reduce the Federal deficit. 
   Now unfortunately, if this amendment were to pass, I would love to tell you that the $1.1 billion to the taxpayers would be saved, but the way the rules are, it would take another amendment, a subsequent amendment to then save that money for the taxpayers. 
   Mr. Culberson of Texas offered an amendment in the Appropriations Committee to change that rule so that if we do strike and/or eliminate any number of earmarks, that that money saved is actually saved, that it goes to debt reduction. But that amendment was defeated. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, those are 10 things that could put sunshine on this earmark process. But we are a long ways  from that sunshine. We are a long ways from that accountability. We are a long, long ways from all these earmarks being visible, justifiable and, in fact, justified. 
   So until then, I have made and will continue to make proposals to eliminate all the earmarks in any bill regardless of whose they are, myself included, or others, until we reform the process. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Flake said it very well. This House can do better than this earmark process. We can do better than what is going on. Their earmarks have led to some of our colleagues who are now in jail. It has led to other problems with other colleagues. Let's reform it or get rid of it. 
   This amendment is the beginning of that process. And Mr. Chairman, I would urge Members, even if they have earmarks in this bill, to support the beginning of reform or elimination of what has hurt this institution and has hurt taxpayers so much.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like the House and certainly the esteemed chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the gentleman from Wisconsin, to know that this amendment is essentially identical to the amendment you just offered and proffered, and it is my intention to ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment. However, I would like the opportunity to talk about my rationale behind it.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Chairman, we already had a debate and discussion about whether there should be earmarks and whether there should not be earmarks. And let me just say that as much as I think there are many inappropriate earmarks, I don't think there have to be no earmarks, but I do think that the process under which we do these earmarks now is still flawed. 
   Now, admittedly, it is frankly, more open than it was last year. But it is still not as transparent and still not as accountable as it should be. And I offered a few suggestions which I will run through quickly, and then I would like to yield to the gentleman from Arizona, as to things that I think we could do in this House in order to make earmarks completely transparent and completely accountable so that this House is not embarrassed by them because, frankly, we have been embarrassed by them in the past, and there are ones I believe that are embarrassing this House that are presently involved in this bill and some other bills and will be in the future. 
   So my suggestions are simple. First, disclose all the earmark requests. Why should we not do that? When we enter a bill, it is disclosed. It is public knowledge that this is something we are trying to make a change on. If any Member wants to spend the taxpayers' money on something and they want to do an official form where they sign that says they have no financial interest, then why shouldn't that be made public? 
   Let's put every earmark in the text of the bill. As I believe the gentleman from Wisconsin knows, it is very difficult to write amendments to take all the earmarks out of the bill because they are not actually written in the bill. So let's write them in the bill so that we do that. 
   And the bill should fully disclose all earmarks with the requesting Member, the amounts, recipients, and the purpose at least a week before we bring them to the floor. We got the certifications less than 24 hours, I think it was only about 12 hours, before we started debate on the last bill. And that is just not enough time to review or make clear what these amendments are. 
   All earmarks should be available for discussion and open congressional hearing. If there are earmarks in a bill, there should be a congressional hearing on those earmarks. Now, that doesn't mean that if there are 200 that you are going to discuss every one, but certainly every one would be available for discussion at that point. 
   All earmark programs should be previously authorized by Congress. If not, why do we even have an authorization process? If we are not going to follow it, if you are just going to be able to earmark anything you want, then why do we have an authorization process? And that is what I think is a lot of what has gone wrong with this process. 
   They should serve a Federal interest or have some Federal nexus. The Federal Government does not, should not, cannot, will not fund every single need and every single desire of every Member and every person in this country. There are lots of things which are properly left to State and local governments and charitable organizations. So we should make it clear that we only spend Federal money on those things with a Federal nexus. 
   No earmarks outside of a Member's own State. If the point of this is just to do things for your constituency, make sure you are doing things for your constituency. 
   No earmarks for private entities without some kind of a competitive bid process. I will tell you a story of a defense contractor in my district who came to me and showed me this fine device, and I said, That's great, but how do I know it works? And if I knew it works, how do I know you are the best source for that? And if I knew you were the best source for that, how would I know that this is the right price for that? The answer is I don't think Members can know those things. So if it is a private entity, let's competitively bid it. 
   Nine, no earmark can be added or increased in conference committee. That is a way to go around all of this. Let's make it that you take the Senate version or the House version but you don't make up a new one. 
   And, finally, that the dollar amount of any earmark that is reduced by an amendment, that money should be saved to the taxpayer. It should go to debt reduction. It should go to deficit reduction. Congressman Culberson had a proposal in the Appropriations Committee, which was defeated, to do exactly that. And why shouldn't we do that? If there is money in a bill and we are not going to spend it on that, let's save it for the taxpayers. That is one of the ways we can reduce this deficit. 
   So those are some thoughts that I have as to how this process can be improved. 
   How much time do I have remaining, Madam Chairman?

But I do believe, and I hope the gentleman from Wisconsin can hear me, that there is an alternative. There is something between the current very flawed process and no earmarks. I hope that we can engage in a discussion about this. I realize it is too late for it in this appropriations cycle but to discuss in the next appropriations cycle.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I will just add one thing as I have been listening to the general debate here. 
   It seems that quite often on this floor, particularly on the other side of the aisle, that we measure how much we care about something by how much money we spend on it. If that was the measure of everything, Paris Hilton would be the most well-adjusted kid on the planet. 
   It is not just how much we spend, but it is whether it is effective. It is whether it is duplicative, as we are alleging in the case of this program. It is whether it is getting the job done. 
   It doesn't do any good for anybody to spend money that is duplicative or that isn't effective or that wastes a lot of money along the way. That is not good for anybody. So whether it is this program, frankly, or any others, we should, in this House and on this floor, realize that we are stewards of the taxpayers' money, not just spenders of the taxpayers' money, and we should ensure that it is being well spent, not just totally spent. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman very much. 
   This is a press release. It doesn't matter what press release it is, it is just a press release. Which means, it says something, argues a position on an issue, and it is on a piece of paper, but it doesn't actually do anything. It just talks about things. 
   What is before us, this bill, is like a press release. It makes an argument, it is on a piece of paper, but doesn't really do anything. 
   I heard everyone on the other side of the aisle here talk about how people can't afford to pay for college. Well, this bill doesn't help people pay for college. It claims to help them reduce their interest rate once they are college graduates, after they are out of college, but it certainly doesn't help you pay for college while you are there. 
   I have also heard the argument that it cuts the rate for student loans in half, and in fact it does: For 6 months, 5 years from now. For 6 months, 5 years from now, it cuts the rate in half, but the rest of the time the rate is either the same as it is now or somewhere in between those two. So let's not say that it cuts it in half. 
   And, to its credit, the bill is cost neutral. Now, cost neutral, it doesn't cost the government anything because although it cuts interest rates to some degree, it also raises or reduces subsidies on fees. So it is like I give you a dollar with less interest rate and then I take that dollar out of your other pocket with less fees. If it doesn't cost anything, net, how is it supposed to help someone, net, pay for the program? And because, perhaps, some of the loan providers could choose to absorb some of these fees if they did that, then it would likely result in less student loans. You know, this is not a bill, it is a press release. 
   Now, it is an issue we ought to be dealing with, because college tuition, I have two kids in college, has gone up four times the rate of inflation. But this is not the solution. This is merely talk and press and not substance.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Let's talk about what is really going on here. If somebody is an alcoholic, they understand they shouldn't drink. What they will do oftentimes is they will ask their friends to help them, you know, come in the house. Make sure I don't have any alcohol here. Keep me honest. Make sure I don't do this. 
   This Congress is drunk on earmarks. The majority party has said, well, we want to get better. We want to stop drinking. We want to stop doing these bad earmarks, so we set up a point of order on the bill so we can stop this. 
   But it is the equivalent of the alcoholic saying, I want you to help me, Mr. Speaker, and I want you to come check my house to make sure that I don't have any alcohol, but then locking the door so you can't go in and you can't look. That is what the majority party is doing here. 
   They say we have this point of order on earmarks, but we are waiving it. We are going to bury them in the bill so you can't see. The majority here in this Congress is not serious about controlling earmarks, and they should be, because of the ones that the gentleman from Arizona read, and whether it is teaching people how to play golf in the defense budget or monuments, to me, whatever it is. We have budget problems, we all agree. We disagree on how to take care of them. But one thing we must do is stop these earmarks, and the majority is not doing that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   There is already existing law on this subject. This is clearly a critical subject. There has been discussion about unfair and deceptive practices, and I don't think there is any disagreement that unfair and deceptive practices exist in the credit card industry. The question is, how do we deal with it and what do we do with it? 
   Right now there is existing law. The existing law says that the Federal Reserve is supposed to crack down through regulation on ``unfair and deceptive acts or practices.'' 
   To that end, the Federal Reserve in May issued proposed regulations to do exactly that, to try to stop those things that they determined were, at that time, unfair and deceptive. As the lady from New York correctly pointed out, there have been tens of thousands of responses and input to the Federal Reserve on their proposed regulations. The Federal Reserve has said that they will make those regulations final prior to the end of the year, which by the way, is more likely to be sooner than this legislation could possibly pass both Houses and perhaps be signed by the President. 
   I don't know why at this point we would want to interfere with this process, which appears to be working well. Clearly it is working well because the proposed bill is pretty much identical to the proposed regulations that the Fed put out in May. 
   Now the Fed may make some changes to those regulations based on the tens of thousands of responses that they got, which is how that process works. For us to come in and intercede in that process and overrule that process is, first of all, wrong; and, second of all, sets a bad precedent. 
   The reason that we often, in this situation and other situations in Congress, allow the definitions of these sorts of things to be done by regulators is that things change quickly. Congress doesn't act quickly. 
   Next year, there could be new deceptive practices. There could be some things out there this year that are in the proposed regulations that have been determined to actually not be deceptive or perhaps to interfere with the marketplace. By doing this, we are stepping in, and we are defining what these things are, and that is not something I believe we should be doing when the existing law is in process and appears to be functioning correctly. 
   Second of all, it is well known the major issue that we will be dealing with this week is the financial crisis in which the country finds itself gripped. This is clearly a very, very serious financial crisis and a very serious issue. 
   What are the ramifications? What are the manifestations of this financial crisis? Right now, credit is contracting. Currently, it is happening in the corporate and business markets, but it is also already extending, and has been, to home loans, car loans and, yes, credit cards. 
   We are in a financial crisis in which the availability of credit to Americans everywhere, in all forms, is becoming more difficult to get and more expensive. Clearly, the solutions to this crisis go way beyond the scope of this bill that we have before us today. But one thing we don't want to do is to further constrict credit markets that are already constricting and further increase the interest rates to consumers that are already going up. 
   This bill, by stepping in directly in this way and interfering with the process that the Federal Reserve has in place, has the potential to do that. I would say that before people vote on this bill, I think they need to consider carefully that if it becomes more difficult for people to get credit in the future, if in the next weeks or months it becomes harder to even get a credit card or the interest rates thereon go up, do you want to be a part of pushing that credit out and pushing those rates up, or do you want to be a part of looking at the solution to those issues? 
   Let's remember that many of the credit card issuing companies are those companies that are on Wall Street and that are in trouble. They are not making any money right now. 
   Now we are not here, and the purpose of credit cards is not to ensure that they make money through their credit cards, that is not where I am going. That is the market at work. That is their problem; that is their issue. But the fact is that when companies don't make money on something, they do less of it or they charge more for it, and that is where we appear to be headed now.  
   I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and suggest that you consider that if this bill does not pass, that still unfair and deceptive practices will be reined in by the Federal Reserve's regulations before the end of the year in a rational manner and hopefully we will then proceed to deal with, later this week, the issue of trying to make sure that credit and credit cards will be available. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes to respond to the chairman of the Financial Services Committee. 
   I would argue that this bill already defers to the Federal Reserve because it basically parroted the proposed regulations that the Federal Reserve put out in May. So this bill basically says okay, we are going to take what you guys proposed and we are going to make it law, not regulation which can be changed, not making any changes based on the 50,000 or 40,000, we are going to make it law. 
   Second, on this side we are not deferring to the Federal Reserve; we are deferring to existing law. And the will of the people based on existing law was that it is best that these sorts of determinations and definitions, which is what is unfair and what is deceptive, be handled on a regulatory basis, than that it is that Congress come back every year or 2 years or 6 years or whatever and try and determine what is new out there in the marketplace that is now determined to be unfair.

   In listening to the arguments on the other side, it sounds as though they are debating for changing certain things in credit cards as though we are debating against that. We are not. 
   What we are here saying is simply that this kind of thing is better done by regulation than it is by proscriptive statute, which is what this bill would do. And actually, it would be more effective in protecting the consumers if there is a regular regulatory process and review and so forth, not just this year but ongoing forward, than if Congress keeps stepping in and interfering with and, in fact, probably slowing down that particular regulatory review and process. 
   That is what we are talking about here, in addition to the fact that the other very important thing to keep in mind is that we have the availability of this credit going forward given the current crisis in which we find ourselves.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself a minute just to respond to that, that what we have here is that the unfair and deceptive practices should stop. The Federal Reserve is probably going to do that. But by stepping in now, they will be considering all of the responses they got, and by the way, the lady from New York mentioned about the credit card companies are against the Federal Reserve proposal. I'm sure they are. But the Federal Reserve will make the decision they believe is right based on the statute which says they are supposed to crack down on those unfair and deceptive practices. And they will do that. 
   But what we don't want to do is send more messages to the marketplace now that we are stepping in to do things that may include some things that aren't unfair and deceptive, or that may mess with the financial markets because they are very, very fragile at the moment.

   But this bill, make no mistake, will not help consumers. It will hurt consumers. Unfair and deceptive practices will be dealt with on a regulatory basis as they should be by the Federal Reserve. And then hopefully this Congress will act this week in a bipartisan and reasoned manner to try and deal with the financial crisis so that credit availability for people is continued and assured. And then we can deal with this continuing issue, and it will be a continuing issue without the current environment of the potential shutdown of credit to availability. It is not the way.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have heard and we know this budget has the largest tax increase in American history and it also doubles the deficit from what the last Republican budget was. But somehow the majority seems to want to convince us all that this is good for America. 
   Well, in considering that, I'm reminded of this commercial I see on TV, this guy named Matthew Lesko. Have you seen it? He wears this funny suit with these symbols on it, and they film it right out here on the west side of the Capitol. And he clearly makes a great living. He publishes books to tell people how to get their hands on government money. He says in the commercial: ``Let Matthew Lesko be your guide to join the millions each year who get free money, grants, loans, giant contracts, and free assistance from the Federal Government.'' 
   Here are some of his book titles: ``Free Money for Business''; ``Free Money for a Better Home''; ``Free Money to Pay Your Bills''; and, my personal favorite, ``Free Money to Quit Your Job.'' 
   Now, the Democrats would have you believe that they're perpetuating with this budget the concept put forward in this commercial, that government money is free. But you know what? It's not. Because every dollar that the government sends out in free money to somebody is a dollar they took, this government took, from some American who earned it or that this government borrowed from some American who has yet to earn it but will have to pay it back, plus interest, in the future. 
   The majority in this budget has refused to set priorities and, instead, is just spending everybody's money on everything and demanding more and more of that money that they would like to think of as free. But we all know every single dollar will eventually come from us.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, this particular earmark is for a swimmer detection sonar network for $1.5 million. The company developing this technology is in New Hampshire. 
   Interestingly, there are about three other companies that do a similar technology or do something intended to do the same thing, which is detect people swimming in the water up towards a ship, at least three others that we have determined, and one of which is currently being used by the Coast Guard that doesn't use sonar but already is in place and in effect. 
   Mr. Chairman, I could ask the same series of questions of the chairman of the committee on this earmark that I did on the last. I won't do that, because the point of this, frankly, is not that this particular earmark is particularly egregious, nor, frankly, that the previous one that I brought up was particularly egregious. 
   I believe that there are literally hundreds of earmarks like these offered by many members in this Defense Appropriations Committee. 
   The reason I am bringing these forward is because of a personal experience I had when a defense contractor came to me in my first few months in office and came forward with an earmark, and I asked these questions. 
   I said, does the military want this, or, have you developed something you want me to give you $2 million of the taxpayers' money for something the military doesn't want? 
   Then I said how do I know that your technology will work? How do I know that this $2 million is effective in curing or dealing with the situation that you claim you want it to be? Then I said how do I know you are the right supplier? It's great that you are in my district, that's wonderful, I think that's fine you have those jobs, but how do I know the best supplier is not in Pennsylvania? How do I know the best supplier is not in Connecticut? How do I know you're the right company to do this? 
   Then I said, even if I did, how do I know that $3 million is the right price? How do I know that it doesn't cost you $50,000 to develop this thing, and you are making $2,950,000 off the American taxpayer. Then if you do, is the American taxpayer going to get this product for free, because if we pay for it, we should. 
   That is the point of what I am doing here. When you look at all of these earmarks, those five questions, in my view, should be asked on every single earmark that goes to a private company that is in this defense bill or, frankly, any other bill. 
   If the answer to all five of these questions is not yes, I don't care if it's a company in my district, or the chairman's district or anybody's district, we should not be using taxpayers' funds for it. 
   I will tell you that I told that defense supplier and every defense supplier in my district that I met with, no. Because they could not give me a yes answer to all five of those questions. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I understand, but there are a number, there are at least three, and I am not on the committee, and I didn't do exhaustive research, there are three others of these currently in use and currently in development. The Coast Guard, at least, apparently, believes that their system is better than this system. 
   So my question is, for this sort of earmark, are we going to fund, if there were a company, and all 435 of our districts that was interested in developing this thing, should we give them all $1.5 million and see who wins? 
   I just don't think that this earmark, or, as I have said, hundreds of others out of the 1,300 that are in this bill, really meet the scrutiny when we are using taxpayer money and giving it to private companies to develop this stuff without the proper scrutiny in terms of this technology, did the military ask for it, is it effective, is it the right supplier, is it the right price and what do the taxpayers own when they are done paying for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank my colleague and friend from Washington for yielding. 
   You know, Mr. Speaker, the original intent of why we allow gambling on Indian reservations was so that we could give some economic opportunity to full-blooded Indians on their native tribal lands in very remote areas in which hardly any economic opportunity existed. 
   So what do we have now? Now we see various Indian tribes that have already achieved tremendous economic benefits that are now wanting to put casinos in urban and suburban areas that are long distances from their native tribal lands and where there is a lot of economic opportunity, and to fill those, not even helping any of the people in their tribe who are back on the reservation. 
   With a bill like this, we have strayed a long ways from the original intent of Indian gambling. Now, this bill is about two tribes specifically in Michigan. I am from California, but yet this trend, this movement, is not limited to just Michigan. Throughout the country, you see groups either trying to create new tribes in urban areas in order to locate gambling operations or, like these in Michigan, to extend from a remote area and set up new gambling in a new metropolitan area. All of this has nothing to do with the original intent of the Indian gambling laws. 
   If communities like Detroit, or anywhere, wish to have gambling, they don't need this House; they don't need this Congress; they don't need the Indian gambling laws to do it. Through their State and local communities, they can allow people to gamble. They can set up various gambling operations, if they want, within their community and within their State. That's up to them. But let us not all here in this House, in this Congress, set a trend. Let's not set a precedent. Let's not use Indian tribes in order to dot the urban and suburban areas of this country with monopoly gambling operations.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (THE BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Tennessee very much for yielding on this important issue of the budget. 
   Now you know in the next couple of weeks we will vote on a budget here, Madam Speaker, in this Ho use. And that budget will undoubtedly have a deficit somewhere over $400 billion. Let me say that again: we will vote on a budget in the next few weeks with a deficit of somewhere over $400 billion. 
   Now as Mrs. Blackburn indicated, these are big numbers and they're hard to relate to. I understand that. Until I was elected to Congress, they were pretty hard for me to relate to, too. When 9/11 happened, we had a big deficit. The economy dropped off, as you recall. We spent a lot of money going after al Qaeda and so forth at that time. But since then, we've had three straight years of declining deficits. It has been coming down. And in fact, this last year it looked like finally perhaps a balanced budget was in sight. 
   But now this year, this year for the first time in 4 years, the deficit's going to go up, and it is not just going to go up a little; it's almost certainly going to more than double, more than double this deficit. And that's just this year. But if we look at the future, it gets even wo rse. If we look here at what is going to happen, and if you just look at this, this shows what will happen to the deficit, to spending in this Government over time if we don't change where we are headed. 
   You see, the problem we have got is not that the American people are taxed too little. It's that this Congress spends too much. There were tax cuts back in 2003 and in 2001; but since 2003, the revenue of the Federal Government has risen almost 50 percent. Let me make sure people understand that. We red uced tax rates, but because economic activity was generated by that, revenue to the Federal Government actually went up, and it went up every year. But spending keeps going up faster than that, and that's what has got to stop. 
   And where is it going up? It's going up in just about every category. As we pile deficits on deficits, the interest we pay goes up. Defense spending is continuing to rise; other spending is continuing to rise. But we also have Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, three things w hich currently take up over 50 percent of the taxes that everyone pays, Madam Speaker. 
   If we leave them alone, if we don't reform them, if we don't change them, you will have to literally double tax rates on every single American in order to have Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and keep anything else like a military, like national parks, like anything else. Nearly double tax rates. That is unsustainable.     
   What are we doing in this budget to deal with that? Nothing. Not a single thing. 
   Now, this isn't just me saying this or just Republicans saying this. Every single analyst, liberal, conservative, right, left, Republican, Democrat  agrees that we're headed towards these numbers, that we are headed towards a situation that's unsustainable. Either Medicare goes away, Social Security goes away, Medicaid go es away, Defense Department, all military goes away, and pick two or three or four of those or we more than double taxes on the American people. 
   Now, we can wait. That's what we always seem to do, we just wait, let time go on a little bit, let the next generation deal with it, let the next Congress deal with it. But the longer we wait, the worse it gets. 
   And we're not making this hole any smaller right now. We're more than doubling the deficit. It will be proposed to more than double the deficit in what we're about to vote on in the next couple of weeks. So, we're actually making this chart much worse. 
   The problem is spending. You can't tax the American people enough to spend everything that all of this is, that all of this that we're headed for, that all everybody in this Congress seems to want to spend, so we've got to control the spending. 
   Now, I have a suggestion for that, Madam Speaker. Because if you look, since 1960, over the last, I think it's 48 years now, I believe this is right, it may be off by one, but since 1960, I believe we've had only 4 years in which there was a surplus, only 4 years in the last 48 in which the government did not spend more money than it took in. So, that shows you that deficits aren't new. And they're not assigned, frankly, to either party. There have been deficits under Republican Congresses, Democratic Congresses, Republican Presidents, Democratic Presidents, and every combination thereof. Deficits seem to be a fundamental problem with this institution. 
    Our Democratic colleagues came into power last year. And when they came in, they said these deficits are terrible, this debt we're putting on our children is terrible, we're going to solve these deficits. And what did they do? They set up a few rules which they've, within a year, decided they would waive and ignore, and now they're about to propose doubling last year's deficit. You see, the spending goes on. 
   And there are people out there now talking about socialized medicine. They're saying, gee, we ha ve to cover everyone with some government plan on health insurance. Where is the money going to come from? Where is it going to come from? You can't pay now for Medicare and Medicaid. The people that are currently under government function programs, you don't have enough money to pay for them for the next 20 years, where are you going to get it to pay for everybody else? 
   Madam Speaker, that's why one of the suggestions that the lady from Tennessee and I have, and various other people, is that we're goin g to need a spending limit. You know, average Americans understand, Madam Speaker, that they should save for their retirement. Well, you know, it's tough sometimes because there's things you would like to spend, things maybe you need to spend money on now, and it will eat up all the money you have if you let it. So, you set up an external discipline, like a 401(k) or something, where money comes out of your paycheck so I don't have the opportunity to spend it and I'm saving for the future. 
   Congress can do the same thing as American taxpayers do, which is, set up an external discipline that keeps us from spending more money than is coming in. We need a spending limit. We need something that keeps Congress from spending money faster than the American taxpayer is earning it. Because, you see, if government grows faster than the income of the average American, the only way to get that money is to take more of the average American's money. And that means you're giving the average American less of their own mon ey to spend on their priorities so that we here in Washington can spend more of their money on ours. And that's just wrong. 
   Spending in this place should not be allowed to grow faster than American's incomes. And we will make some proposals to put that kind of limit on this Congress so that the limits are here and Americans have limits and restrictions removed off of them so they can earn more money and keep it, because that's what everyone wants to do. 
   I yield back to the lady from Tennessee.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Sure. I appreciate the lady from Tennessee yielding for this. 
   Yes, we have had increased tax revenues every year. In fact, all but one year out of the last 4 years it has been double digits, in other words, 10 percent or more. That's pretty good. I think a lot of Americans out there would love to see their paycheck rise by 10 percent a year. Well, the Federal Government's paycheck has been rising by that amount over the last 4 years, but we've continued to spend money. And so now revenue is dropping off a little bit, the increases aren't quite as big as they were the last 4 years, but government spending has proposed to keep on trucking, keep on going up. And that's why you're going to see this deficit nearly double, probably more than double.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. That increased spending, and the fact that revenue has dropped off some. I mean, the growth in revenue has, in fa ct, dropped off, the economy is down, and so people are not making as much money and paying as much taxes. So, there is that, too. 
   But that's the point of all of this is that the government can't keep on spending; when times are good, increase spending a lot, and when times are bad, increase spending a lot, too. That's what we can't do. And that's what has gotten us in this mess, that's what has gotten us this big national debt, and that's what has gotten us into these deficits. And now we're having a l ittle drop off in revenue. It's still probably going to increase, but just not at a 10 percent rate like it has before. 
   And so I'm looking to see, where is the proposal on the part of the majority party here to reduce spending so that we can try and, if we don't balance the budget this year, so that at least we don't double it, at least we try to control it a little bit, try and get it back on track towards balance. But that's not what we're seeing. That's not what we're seeing.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Sure. If you look at this little red line here, that's the taxes that people pay. That's the 30-year average tax revenue. And this isn't in dollar terms; this is in terms of a percent of the economy. So it's not like this year you're paying the same dollars in taxes that you would in 2080; it's that you're going to pay the same percentage of the overall economy in t axes. 
   So, if you look at that, that's the tax rates. And if you see right here, 2000-2010, we've been running deficits during all this period, but you still see that this line here is the total spending, it's a little bit over. And we don't like the deficits we have now. I mean, I've talked about it, people on the other side of the aisle talked about it. You don't like the deficits you've got now. Well, look at the difference between this red line and the spending now and what happens in 2030 or 2040 or 2050. It's huge. And when you get out here to 2060, you see that you have to just about double taxes to pay for everything at that point. And if you double taxes, people can't and won't make as much money because it will all be coming here and nobody will have 
   money to invest. And so it's really worse. This chart, it's scary, but it almost actually makes i t look better than it really is. 
   And so we really have to tackle some of these things. We really have to take this on because we say, 2050, that's a long time, I may be dead by then. Whatever. But that's not what in this House we're supposed to be thinking. We're not supposed to be thinking about us; we're supposed to be thinking about the American people now and in the future. And if we're going to be thinking about the American people now and in the future, it's going to be a whole lot tougher to deal with this problem in 2020 than it's going to be to deal with it in 2010. And that's why, Mrs. Blackburn, we should be dealing with this now, in the budget now. But nope, it's just kick the can down the road; accept that doubling of the budget deficit and just kick the can down the road. And I yield back.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. And if the lady will yield for one last parting comment, as you look at this chart, if you look at this chart, because you will hear some people in the majority party talk about that the whole problem is the war in Iraq and it's defense spending. If you look at this chart over time, the width of this green defense bar doesn't change that much over time. Now, who knows what will happen, but projections are that defense spending as a percentage of the economy, which is historically not that high right now, but that it wouldn't change over time. The big problems, the ones that are small here and get really fat there, are if you take the two biggest. One is Medicare and the other is interest on the debt. 
   Interest on the debt gets big because we keep throwing deficit after deficit after deficit. The way to get that down is simple: Balance the budget, stop running deficits. But we haven't, as I mentioned, except for 4 year s, I think over the last 40-something, we haven't had the will here to do that. 
   The other thing is Medicare. And what's so interesting is that that is government-paid-for medical insurance for older Americans, for seniors. But you have people out there now advocating that we should have Medicare for everyone, which you've got a problem with Medicare as it is, a huge problem in that it would almost take up all of your tax money by 2080, almost take up all your tax money all by itself. 
   So, I thank the lady from Tennessee very much and yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Let's stipulate here that there are and have been instances, plenty of instances, in which executive compensation has been excessive for the return given to shareholders. 
   I have spent my entire life investing, and there have been times when I have seen excessive executive compensation, and return for the company wasn't there. And it made me mad, and I wasn't happy about it. Let's stipulate to that. 
   Let's also understand there is a difference between that and when an executive gets high pay for a very excellent result. Pay for executives has been increasing, as it has for sports stars, as it has for people in the music business, authors, actors and investors. 
   Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve, when he spoke before our committee and when he has spoken before other committees, has been quoted as saying this is, to a degree, because of the effective technology of being able to take the talents of these various people and make them more valuable because it spreads across the world much quicker. 
   But let's take that aside and stipulate that there have been instances, plenty of instances, where executive compensation has not been commensurate with the results. But there are a lot of other things that are more injurious to shareholders. There are other highly compensated individuals as well who have been overpaid for their jobs or for whatever they have done. 
   There have been union contracts that have been out of line. Let's take Ford Motor Company right now. People are objecting to the current compensation package of the new chairman of Ford Motor Company; but no one is suggesting that that pay package is going to bring Ford Motor Company under. People are not happy because they say Ford Motor Company isn't making money, and the chairman is getting too much pay, but no one is suggesting that is going to take the company  under. But what most observers say will take the company under is all of the retiree pay that they have due to union contracts that were inadvisable that were done some time ago. That may take the company under. 
   There could be acquisitions. There could be legal settlements. There could be just poor management. All of those things can actually take a company under, whereas executive compensation that is excessive, although maddening, won't drive a company down. 
   This bill does absolutely nothing to deal with any of those other problems. Why not? If we are worried about shareholders and care about shareholders and their ability to influence a company, then why don't we give them the right to influence the company on something that actually might bring the company down. 
   Some people on the other side mentioned several instances, and I can't recall them all right now, but where a company is doing poorly and an executive received very high pay. I agree with you; bad, I don't like it. I didn't like it. But what ought to upset the shareholders more is not the pay; it is the poor performance. And this doesn't do anything to help shareholders with that. 
   We should give shareholders more rights. I agree with that, through the board. Otherwise, why not let shareholders vote on other highly compensated individuals, on union contracts, on acquisitions, on legal settlements, on the marketing budget, on all kinds of others things that might have something to do with affecting the company's pay?     
   I believe this is a statement, not a solution.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, as has been mentioned in the debate tonight, we had a substantive hearing on this subject, and there were six witnesses at that hearing. The witnesses were split as to the substance of the bill that is before us. Four of them liked the bill, supported it, and two of them opposed the bill. However, there was one thing on which there was unanimity with the witnesses. All six witnesses agree that a better solution, a better proposal, would be to allow to have shareholders, or to require companies to require a majority vote before seating a shareholder on the board. 
   All six witnesses preferred that to this very prescriptive executive compensation proposal. Because, as we discussed earlier, that would actually give shareholders more rights, through the board, to express their displeasure with a company for excessive executive compensation or simply executive operations that they don't like: for a poor performance, for a bad union contract, for whatever they wanted to express their displeasure more effectively by voting against people who were proposed to be on the board. Because if a majority vote is required to put anyone on the board, it's going to take a lot more votes to get people on there than would have happened under the current system. 
   What this amendment does is, this amendment says that a company will not be required to have an advisory vote on executive compensation if they, instead, require a majority vote, a majority of those voting, to seat a director on the board. That is simply all this would do. 
   Now, therefore, companies, if they didn't really like the executive compensation proposal, they could go for a majority vote instead, if they felt that was better for them. And as I stated before, I and people all over the spectrum believe that is a better solution. 
   Interestingly enough, the Business Roundtable believes that is a better solution, and I have a letter here from the Teamsters Union from March 13, 2007, bragging about how FedEx recently adopted a majority vote by law and how important this was for the management of that company. So it is clear that on all sides of this the people believe that majority votes to seat someone on the board of directors is a more effective way to deal with this issue. 
   Now, let me anticipate some things that my friend, I will get your State right this time, from Massachusetts will say. I have heard the argument that this proposal is too intrusive, that it is more intrusive than the basic bill that is before us. I would argue that it is not, because it actually gives the corporations a choice. They can either accept the vote on executive compensation that is before them, or if they wish to go the route of majority voting for directors, they can do that instead. 
   I have also heard the gentleman argue that my proposal here is not intrusive enough because it does not require a majority vote of directors for all corporations at all times. 
   I will tell you that if the author of this bill, the chairman of the committee, wished to amend this bill or pull this bill back, or whatever would be the correct parliamentary procedure, to replace this with a requirement for a majority vote of directors, I would support him on that. 
   However, with the bill that is before us, this is the only germane solution that can be offered to give shareholders the opportunity to have a majority vote for directors, which will really give them more voice, instead of this silly advisory vote thing, which is so narrowly focused on just one thing that shareholders may have a problem with, rather than the greater issues of governance of corporations.

In fact, I think it creates problems when companies have to hire somebody quickly and that sort of thing. I didn't say it was toothless and ineffective. I said it was silly. I did say it was silly because it only targets one element of shareholder displeasure with a company, which is an element, and although it can be very irritating, amongst many, many elements that are out there, is the least likely to actually destroy shareholder value, and that is what shareholders are interested in, is shareholder value. 
   So I didn't say it was toothless and ineffective. I said that I think it is the wrong solution to the problem that is before us.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman from Alaska for yielding. 
   There are no Civil War battlefield sites in California. There was one place where shots were fired near the Arizona border, but I do admit to having more than a passing interest in the study of and learning about the Civil War. I stand today strongly in favor of this bill. I can't tell you how many times I invoke the quotes or the deeds or the actions of politicians and generals and citizens from the Civil War and the Civil War era in giving us guidance and perspective on how we deal with some of our problems today. 
   As we today and this week are facing a financial crisis which is not something that could ever even have been conceived in the Civil War but they certainly dealt with crises of their own. How they dealt with them and how they worked with them and the courage with which they faced them are instructive to all of us today. 
   These battlefield sites bring that history alive. They remind us of the sacrifices that those who came before us  made to give us what we have today, and they instruct us and teach us of the bravery and the courage and the principles upon which they stood and how we can remember and call upon the same bravery and courage and principles today. 
   As was said, this bill not only protects private property rights but also leverages a tremendous amount of private funds, largely private funds, that are collected from around the country to preserve these battlefield sites. 
   Madam Speaker, again I stand in strong support of this bill, both for what the Civil War sites have done for us in the past and what they can continue to do to teach us in the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit funds from being used for the Abraham Lincoln National Airport Commission in Illinois. 
   The committee report says that this earmark is providing $231,000 for this local project. According to the committee report in the letter requesting the earmark, the earmark has been requested by Congressman Jackson of Illinois for the purpose of ``minority and small business development and procurement opportunities.'' 
   According to the Web site for this organization, the organization was established by Congressman Jackson, and the executive director currently is a gentleman by the name of Richard Bryant. Richard Bryant is apparently on the staff of Congressman Jackson and is his deputy district administrator, according to records. Mr. Bryant has stated this week that he is not paid in his position as executive director of the airport commission and that he is there because of efforts to build a third airport in the Chicago area that is strongly supported by Congressman Jackson. He also said that the money from the earmark would be used to study ways to make sure that local workers and minorities are hired when and if a new airport is actually built. 
   Also, Mr. Chairman, according to Mr. Jackson's Web site, this organization exists to try to promote a third airport in the Chicago area and that last year many of its activities were related to advertising on behalf of that airport. To quote directly from the Web site, and this is from an article published in April of 2006: ``Last month the commission called on the south suburbs to donate a total of $250,000 towards the advertising campaign scheduled to begin June 1.'' It goes on to say that about $40,000 is budgeted for billboards. The remaining funds would pay for direct mailings to voters in the region and radio commercials and for yard signs closer to election day. 
   So it would appear that the activities at least last year of this commission were related to trying to drum up support or actually lobbying on behalf of, or certainly advocating on behalf of, getting public support and, I presume, elected representative support for this airport. 
   I would also like to point out that there is a press release from Congressman Jackson dated November 16, 2006, in which he says: ``So even with the change of leadership in Congress, I won't pursue Federal funds for the Abraham Lincoln National Airport. Chicago's share of Federal dollars are already committed to O'Hare modernization.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to suggest that this earmark does not appear appropriate; that a Member of Congress directs money to an organization they set up, run by someone who is an employee of the office of that Congressman, and whose purpose appears to be to advocate on behalf of an airport that does not currently exist. If the airport does currently exist or whatever, also, it appears to be in contradiction to the Congressman's own statement as of November of 2006 that he would not pursue Federal funds for this airport in the future. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I fully understand the gentleman's desire to close, and I am happy to do that. But I believe that he should at least state some of the reasons that he believes this earmark is justified so I can at least have the opportunity to rebut those before he closes. But I am perfectly willing to allow him to have the last word. 
   I suppose I will anticipate, perhaps, what the gentleman is going to say. I understand that the gentleman from Illinois may suggest that the Ethics Committee has approved that his district employee be the executive director of this commission, and I would take him at his word and assume that is the case. 
   I don't think that is the issue here. We are talking about over $200,000 of taxpayers' funds here, and I think the question at issue is whether or not that is an appropriate use of Federal funds and what these Federal funds are going to be used for. If he is suggesting, as some of these reports indicated, that these are going to be spent on minority and business development procurement opportunities for an airport that doesn't yet exist, my question would be how can you have hiring or whatever opportunities for an airport that doesn't exist yet and won't exist even if it were approved today for some number of years?     
   Is the gentleman willing to say that there will be no further advertising, no further lobbying, no further expenditures of that sort?

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit funds in the bill from being used for the Wittenberg University East Asian Study Center. The committee report provides there will be $500,000 spent on this local project. 
   Now, Wittenberg University is a private college. On all these earmark things that I am bringing up and that the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake) has brought up, it is not an issue of whether this is a good university, I am sure it is a great university; or whether this is a worthy, charitable endeavor, I am sure it is a worthy, charitable endeavor. It is a question of whether or not it is appropriate for taxpayers' funds.  
   On the last amendment that I had talked about, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson) made a very eloquent report of why he believes there should be a third airport in Illinois. But that really wasn't the point, as to whether there should be a third. I am not qualified. I don't know whether there should be a third airport in Chicago or not. 
   The point was, is it appropriate to use Federal taxpayer funds to fund an organization that you set up that is for the purpose of basically applying political pressure to create this airport when it doesn't exist. I think that is clearly not appropriate. 
   In this case here, this is to be used ``for the development of an undergraduate interdisciplinary program in international business, with a focus on the field of experience in Asia.'' 
   According to the Web site, this East Asian Studies Journal has existed for 27 years. This is the 27th consecutive annual edition of this particular publication. So this center, it would appear, has existed for 27 years in this university. 
   Again, Mr. Chairman, this is actually a Lutheran university. I am on the board of advisors of a Lutheran university in my district. I think they do very fine things. I just don't think it is appropriate to use taxpayer money. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to see the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, here, because this is an amendment that he suggested right here on the floor of the House on June 13, earlier this month. 
   During debate that evening, which was the evening in which it was decided that we would make earmarks public and that they would be included in the bill, Mr. Obey said, ``I want to make clear, I hate the earmarking process. I absolutely detest it.'' 
   Further on in his comments, the gentleman from Wisconsin said, ``And I am going to be very interested in seeing which Members vote for the amendment that I intend to attach to every appropriations bill which would call for a total elimination on earmarks. I want to see how many of you actually vote for it.'' Well, I want the chairman of the Appropriations Committee to know that I agree with his comments. 
   In the previous bill that we had before this House yesterday, the Interior bill, this amendment did not show up. So I took it upon myself to offer this amendment, which the chairman of the Appropriations Committee had suggested that he was going to offer on every appropriations bill. So that is, in fact, the amendment that I have offered. 
   What this amendment would do, Mr. Chairman, is it would strike all 148 earmarks that are currently in this bill from the bill, and thereby would save $33.71 million of taxpayer money. 
   I hope that the chairman will support me in this effort. Obviously I am offering this amendment. I intend to vote for this amendment, and I hope the good chairman of the Appropriations Committee would join me in this offering and in voting for it as well. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, we did fight hard for this transparency, and I am glad we have this transparency. But the reason we have it is not simply to rubber-stamp every earmark that the Chairs of committees decide in their judgment to put in. 
   Let me quote again the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, on June 13, 2007. He said, ``The reason I hate earmarks is because they suck everybody in. They suck them into the idea that we have to be ATM machines for our districts.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I don't think we want to be ATM machines for our districts. This amendment which has been suggested by Mr. Obey, I don't believe he or certainly I necessarily think that all 148 of these are bad. However, if the chairman of the Appropriations Committee believes as he said, ``I hate the earmarking process, I absolutely detest it,'' then maybe we should start to reform it. This is a way to reform it. This is a way to change it. Let's just take them all out for now, and let's talk about a way that perhaps something can be done in a way in which we are not ATM machines for our districts. 
   By the way, by doing that, we will save the taxpayers $33.7 million, which I would imagine they will be able to use in their pockets in their districts as they want to and I would argue in a better, more effective way than we will, even though we represent them. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, later today we will have a budget on this floor proposed by the Democratic majority which is guaranteed to raise taxes by about $200 billion. Now, that budget will also increase spending by about $200 billion over and above the budget that the President proposed. 
   Do we think that those two numbers are the same by coincidence? No. And it's not an increase in spending by $200 billion, it's an increase over the increase proposed by the President by $200 billion. This is not a tax increase that we need to have. This is a tax increase that they want to have because they want to spend a lot more money than we are already spending, and we are already spending too much.

Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to this debate and listening to the arguments on the Democratic side of the aisle, and I am waiting for David Copperfield to show up as a member of their Budget Committee because what they are doing is magic. They are over here bragging about all of the additional money they are spending. And bragging, which they are, and bragging that they are balancing the budget, which they say they are, but then saying they are not raising taxes. Which they are. 
   This budget contains over $200 billion in tax increases. That is about $1,000 for every taxpayer in America. And oddly enough, isn't it strange that it also contains about $200 billion in additional spending over the President's proposed budget. 
   So they want to raise Americans' taxes by $1,000 a taxpayer so they can spend it on new spending. Make no mistake about it, a vote for this budget is a vote for at least the second largest tax increase in American history, if not the largest.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, on Monday afternoon after this House rejected and defeated the economic recovery bill, Americans lost over $1 trillion in the stock market. They lost over $1 trillion in their savings and in their investment and in their retirement accounts. If we do not act, that will be just the beginning. Why, they would have been better off if we had taken the $700 billion in that bill and thrown it in the Potomac. But that is not what this bill will do. 
   This bill takes that $700 billion and buys assets which have three different backstops to make sure that the taxpayers not only get all of their money back, but could perhaps actually make a profit. 
   Mr. Speaker, American jobs are at risk, the economy is at risk, their retirements are at risk. We must act. I hope we follow the Senate's lead tomorrow and pass this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, we have a budget problem here in Washington, the Federal Government. The budget that was recently passed off of this floor has a deficit in it, continues that deficit for the next 4 years. It has a tax increase in it, the largest tax increase in American history, going forward. And it also continues to raid the Social Security funds, take the Social Security surplus that we have and spend it on things that are unrelated to Social Security. So we have a budget crisis going on. 
   What this amendment does is it says that there are certain things upon which we should not be spending money through this bill during this time of budget deficits, stealing Social Security funds, and increasing taxes. 
   What this amendment does, it says there's just a couple of things that we should not be increasing the deficit by spending money on, and I quote, ``The Archives of Andean Knotted-String Records,'' or to study ``The Accuracy in Cross-Cultural Understanding of Others' Emotions.'' 
   This amendment also says that we don't want to increase spending and, therefore, increase taxes in order to pay for a study of ``Bison Hunting on the Late Prehistoric Great Plains'' or ``Team Versus Individual Play'' or ``The Sexual Politics of Waste in Dakar.'' 
   And it also says that we don't want to increase spending and spend any of this money in this authorization and, thereby, be continuing to raid the Social Security Trust Funds in order to study ``The Social Relationships and Reproductive Strategies of Phayre's Leaf Monkeys'' or ``The Cognitive Model of Superstitious Belief.'' 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, I understand that there is a process of peer review from which these studies come in the National Science Foundation, and that's all well and good. But our job here is we are the elected representatives and stewards of the taxpayers' money, not the academics in the National Science Foundation, and it is our decision whether or not we wish to spend taxpayers' funds on studies of the social relationships and reproductive strategies of Phayre's leaf monkeys or on bison hunting on the late prehistoric Great Plains. I think we should not do that. 
   I am sure that some believe that these are very fine academic studies. That's excellent. Within the realms of academic halls, they may think a number of things are fine academic studies. That's not the question. 
   The question before us is, do these things rise to the standard of requiring expenditures of taxpayer funds in a time of deficits, proposed tax increases and raiding Social Security funds? I think the answer is a resounding no. I think the answer should be a resounding no, which means that I would hope that the vote on this amendment would be an equally resounding yes.

   The United States taxpayer cannot fund every bit of academic research for every university, for everything that every professor wants to do across this country. We can't do that. The question before us is, are these the sorts of things we do want to spend taxpayer money on? I would suggest that they are not, and that is why I would suggest that to vote against this amendment is to say that you believe that taxpayer money should be spent on these specific items. That is the question before us. Not whether it is interesting. I am a Civil War buff. I love all kinds of interesting stuff about that, but I don't think the taxpayer ought to pay for research into it.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, my colleague from Washington mentioned that he didn't think this last amendment that I proposed was the correct way to save money, so perhaps this is the more correct way; maybe this is something that he would find more to his liking. 
   H.R. 1867, this bill before us, would increase spending for the National Science Foundation by 9.9 percent in the first year, 7.4 percent in the second year and 7.3 percent in the third year, for an increase of over 25 percent over a 3-year period. Now, Mr. Chairman, that is an amount, and I, too, am someone who has sympathy for some of the things that the National Science Foundation does. However, even over the last few years where we have had very large percentage increases in our revenues to the Federal Government, they haven't been as large as this over the last 3-year period. In fact, in the next 3-year period, any of the prognosticators, whether it be the Office of Management and Budget or any of the other prognosticators, are not estimating that we will have a 25 percent increase in revenue over the next 3 years. So therefore, this proposes to increase spending at a rate greater than revenue is projected to increase over the next 3 years. 
   This amendment would simply reduce the amount of this increase by 1 percent per year. So instead of increasing by 10 percent the first year, it would increase by only 9; instead of increasing by 7.4 percent, the second year would increase by 6.4 percent; and 7.3 percent, it would increase by 6.3 percent in the third year. These are still large annual increases, larger than most taxpayers at home are likely to see the increases in their incomes, in their salaries, in their wages. 
   So this is just a small reduction. It does not deal with, as the gentleman from Washington mentioned, it does not specifically say what, it leaves that issue open. So, therefore, it does not interfere with the selection of these various proposals and research things that the gentleman from Washington just supported in the last amendment. 
   So with that, Mr. Chairman, I would ask for an ``aye'' vote.

   I am proud today to celebrate the accomplishments of this team that represents a tradition of excellence at the University of California, Irvine. But, you know, it is not a very long tradition of excellence, because the University of California, Irvine, was only established in 1965. But already in just over 40 years, the school has grown accustomed to receiving accolades in both academics and in sports as well. So I would like to also extend my congratulations to Chancellor Michael Drake, who is continuing this, albeit short, but continuing tradition at UCI of excellence in both sports and in academic fields, particularly in the fields of science and technology.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I've heard the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee talk about that the appropriations process is about allocation of resources. Because resources, even in the United States Federal Government, are not unlimited, and so we always have to make choices of where money goes and where money doesn't go. And that's what this discussion and that's what this particular amendment are about. 
   There are, in the United States, excluding the territories, excluding overseas, there are 4,402 military sites, 4,402. Here we have, in this bill, Member earmarks that picked 103 of these sites--excluding the other, roughly, 4,300--and send those $622 million of taxpayers' money. And the question before us really is, why those 103? Why not the other 4,300? 
   Now, as much as the speakers before me have criticized the executive branch or the Department of Defense or, in fact, military leaders, Department of Defense and the Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, Department of the Air Force have a responsibility for their share of all of these. Department of the Army has 1,768 sites. So they have responsibility for all of those. 
   When left the construction budget for them, they will, we presume, try and put the money where they believe it is most needed, where they believe it is the greatest warranted use. You might disagree with that, but they have a perspective over the entire country. 
   We are each elected to represent our individual districts. And although all of us are here and care about the entire country, clearly, our first responsibility is often to our individual districts. 
   So I would argue that those who have a perspective of the entire country are perhaps in a better position to look at the proper allocation than this. And if these 103 were fairly allocated, then I would ask, why does Mr. Flake's chart come out the way it is? Is that simply coincidence that the greatest need of these facilities happens to be in districts that are represented by appropriators? Is that purely coincidence? I think not. 
   And when we examine how and where all this money will go, the other thing is, what does the Defense Department think? Well, we didn't call all 103, but we did call a few. We called up the Defense Department and asked them about a few of these; did you request this? Did you think this was a need? Did you think this was important for the military to spend this on this particular site, this particular facility, this particular area? And the answer we got was no in all the cases in which we asked. 
   So I think, Mr. Chairman, what we have before us is a process that does not work, that is not fair, that is not the best allocation of what are always limited resources. And that is why, Mr. Chairman--I am a cosponsor with Mr. Flake of this amendment--and that is why I hope our colleagues will look at this and remember, as he said, this is likely the only chance anyone in this Chamber is going to have to express their opinion on earmarks. And if you think the earmark process is broken, if you think there are problems with it, if you think there are abuses, if you think we need to reform it, this is your opportunity; this is the opportunity for Members to send a message and vote for this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, you know, I find this whole debate rather perplexing. What the majority party is saying is that in order to leave people's taxes the same, in order to leave them where they are now, they have to raise taxes on somebody else. They have to pay for leaving your taxes alone by raising taxes on somebody else. Now, that's just warped logic. But let's just accept that warped logic for a minute and let's say that somehow leaving taxes alone required being paid for. 
   What about reducing spending to pay for it? Where in this rule is the ability to have an amendment to do that? What about reducing spending instead of raising taxes? 
   Now, later this week, we are likely to see a gigantic budget bill that will spend $50 billion more than last year. Where is the pay-for for that? Now, that's pretty clear. If you spend $50 billion, nearly $50 billion more than last year, that's a clear increase in spending for which you would think someone  would want to pay for it. But instead, here you're going to leave people's taxes alone, the same as last year, and somehow that's a tax cut that has to be paid for? The logic is so distorted here, and the rationale is so distorted. 
   Let's go ahead and spend all this extra money and not pay for it. You know that if you held the line on spending and didn't increase that spending this year and you looked at what that did over a 10-year period, you could almost pay for repealing the alternative minimum tax completely.     
   But, no, that is not what the majority party is doing. That is not what this rule talks about. That is not what this rule allows. This rule continues this distorted logic that says that spending more money is okay and doesn't have to be paid for but leaving people's taxes alone is not okay. 
   This rule and this proposal should both lose.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Thank you for that kind introduction, my colleague from California (Mr. Dreier). 
   Mr. Speaker, we learned this week that 8 months into this fiscal year we now have a deficit of $317 billion. If you project that out for the rest of the fiscal year, we are looking at having a deficit of $476 billion. That would be the largest deficit of any year in the history of the country, and today we are making it worse yet again. 
   I understand that much of the spending, as you've just heard in this bill, are priorities for Members of this House, for citizens--frankly, many of them for this Member, but not every one of the well over $3 trillion that we're spending now in the Federal Government can be a priority that we cannot do without. We are going to have to start, when we add more spending, take some spending out of something else, offset it with reduced spending. 
   What we're talking about here are priorities. And if we look at what's happening ahead of us, the appropriations bill that we now see for the coming year increases spending by another 7.7 percent, while revenues are essentially flat. And that's $72 billion that would add to this deficit next year. And that doesn't include the entitlement programs, which increase at a dramatic rate every single year and which were actuarially bankrupt. 
   Where are we headed, Mr. Speaker? Are we headed for a $600 billion, $700 billion deficit? Do we care? Are we going to do anything about it? 
   Now, there are some on the other side of the aisle who would say, well, we'll raise taxes, and that's how we'll cover it. Well, I'm not even sure you can raise taxes enough. Taking aside the arguments of what that would do to a now struggling economy, what that would do to many people out there struggling either in their business, with the cost of energy, or personally with the cost of energy, but you, frankly, can't raise taxes enough to cover the massive deficits that we're having this year and that look to be getting even greater next year. 
   So I would say, in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, to both the Democrat and Republican leadership, we need to stop spending without offsetting it by reducing spending somewhere else. And I hope that we'll start that now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, 9 years ago, this House passed this ban on Internet taxes. It has been in place for 9 years. During that time, we have seen tremendous growth, economic growth, come from the Internet and also tremendous opportunity for people to access information that before they could not access over that 9 years. 
   During this time, e-mail, which once cost everyone something, now costs most people nothing. Instant messages now exist which are generally entirely free. There are all kinds of Web sites that allow people to access information for free that prior to the evolution and growth of the Internet they would have to pay to get that information. Now you have a number of municipalities and organizations looking at free WiFi, meaning that is even free access to the Internet. 
   In the face of all of this, all of these market pressures lowering the cost of people accessing this information and adding to the economic growth that comes from the Internet, the last thing that government should be doing is imposing their cost on it, their cost meaning ``taxes.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand today to support this legislation, although I firmly believe, as the previous speakers have said, that this ban should have been made permanent.     
   I don't think we are going to learn anything in the next 4 years that we didn't learn in the last 9 years, that the Internet is a tremendous engine for economic growth and an opportunity for information transfer available to people of all demographics all across the country. We do not want to retard its growth. We do not want to slow its growth by imposing taxes from government. We haven't done it in the next 9 years, and this bill make sure we don't  do it for the next 4 years. I hope we don't ever do it.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   Let's make it clear what this bill does not do. What it does not do is it does not prohibit States or localities from putting general application taxes on Internet transactions as they would apply if that transaction were taking place not on the Internet. For example, it does not ban sales taxes on transactions over the Internet, as long as those taxes are the same sales taxes as would be applied if that purchase was transacted in a store or over a catalog, but what it does do is it says you cannot put discriminatory taxes on the Internet.     
   You cannot take that sales transaction and give it a sales tax that is higher because it was transacted over the Internet than if it were not. It also says that you cannot tax access or use to the Internet. 
   Can you imagine, can anyone out there imagine that if every time you sent an e-mail there was a tax that went on your credit card or something for using it, or every time you went on a Web site, there was a tax? That's absolutely unconscionable. Particularly today, when we realize how much of the economic growth we have experienced in this decade has come from the Internet and how much distribution of knowledge there has been and how it is a great equalizer that so many people at so many incomes and in so many locations are able to access knowledge that was previously unavailable. 
   The Internet has been a great engine for economic growth and for the distribution of knowledge. We don't want to slow down that engine by taxing it. 
   Now I, like I believe every other speaker this morning, wishes that this bill were a permanent ban. I can't imagine a time when we would want to restrict your access to the Internet by taxing it. 
   However, 4 years is better than zero, and 7 years is better than 4. So this 7-year extension is something that I will heartily support. 
   However, I also desperately hope that before we get to the day of the expiration of this next 7-year period, that sometime within this 7 years that this Congress realizes and recognizes once and for all that taxing the access to or use of the Internet is a bad idea and makes this ban permanent in the future.

And this is going to make it ever more difficult because it restricts the amount of loans they can get, and it puts in liability as well.  
   And, you know, it won't hurt the person buying a $1 million house with 50 percent down. That person will be fine. Who it's going to hurt is the person out there buying a $200,000 house with $2,500 in cash and a loan from their uncle. But they've got a good job and they think they can get this thing done. But under this bill, banks and lenders are not going to make that loan. And that's the problem with this bill, and that's why this bill should be roundly defeated.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman from Arizona. I will be very happy to hear what the answer from the lady from New York is because I think the question before us is if the majority party wants to clean up this earmark process, or do they just want to say they are cleaning up the earmark process when it actually doesn't occur? If we are going to have these rules that enable you to raise points of order on earmarks that have been air-dropped in, we have earmarks air-dropped in which shouldn't happen in the first place. Some of these are clearly inappropriate. But yet all opportunity to raise them against the bill  has been waived. So why are you even doing this? It appears that they are not serious about really stopping or reforming earmarks; they simply want to act like they are. If we are serious, none of these earmarks that were air-dropped in should be allowed.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I stand here before you as a Member of Congress not from Florida; in fact, from California. But I support this bill. If a tsunami were to hit Honolulu, there is not enough insurance base in the entire State for all the types of insurance there could possibly be to cover the effects of that kind of disaster. 
   I come from California, which is not a small State. It is in fact the largest State. But we have earthquakes. After the Northridge earthquake, you could not buy earthquake insurance pretty much from anywhere at any price in the entire State of California after that earthquake. So even in a large State like California you can have problems getting disaster insurance for various disasters, even today; and it has been a number of years since we have had any significant number of earthquakes in California. The earthquake insurance, currently there's a State program to cover earthquake insurance and it vacillates between not providing very much coverage and being not actuarially sound. 
   So I support this bill because we do need to look at tsunamis in Hawaii, earthquakes in California, hurricanes in Florida and tornadoes in Kansas, and ways that we can pool those risks. Now, if a disaster of any type hits any one of those States, as I mentioned, that earthquake or that hurricane or that tornado will not discriminate between single families' homes and apartment buildings or commercial property. The amendment that I offer today, Mr. Chairman, would add commercial property to this bill because, as I said, the disasters don't discriminate. But also, when you think about it, if a hurricane hits, and I know the sponsors of this bill are very familiar with that, or an earthquake hits and an apartment building goes down, the people living in that apartment building need that apartment building rebuilt every bit as much as the people in the single family home need their single family home rebuilt. 
   If jobs and economic activity are to be restored in the region hit by the disaster, then the businesses that were destroyed or severely damaged in that disaster also need to be rebuilt. So what this bill would do is it would not compel any State to include commercial property in their State program. But if a State chooses to include commercial property in their State program, then it could be included in the risk pools that will be set up as a result of this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I support this bill today, which is going to leave taxes alone. 
   And understand that's all it's going to do. It is not cutting taxes on anyone. It's just leaving them where they are. 
   But yet to do this, the majority Democrats are going to violate their own vaunted PAYGO rule. And I would argue that PAYGO was just a sham to begin with. I mean, you can add $40 million more than last year to the budget. You can add $10 billion more here, $20 billion more there, and you don't have to pay for that. But to leave somebody's taxes alone, somehow you in theory were going to pay for it. But today that's a sham that, even as a sham, the Democrats haven't been able to keep. It goes from a sham to a double sham. 
   The lesson here is clear: You can balance budgets by holding down spending, and that's what we ought to do.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding. 
   As I listened to the arguments, what arguments that are presented, from the majority Democrats, I hear some things that don't quite ring true. They talk a lot about their pay-as-you-go rules and that their great fiscal accomplishment of this Congress is that they are going to pay for spending as you go. Yet this bill increases spending by $1.2 billion, and it is not paid for. There is no $1.2 billion cut somewhere else. They are simply going to increase the deficit by $1.2 billion more because they have decided they want to spend it. 
   They say that they are not raising taxes. But yet their budget increases spending every single year for 5 years and then miraculously says they are going to balance the budget. How do they do that? Because they did have in their budget the largest tax increase in American history. 
   You just heard them recently just decry the former deficits. Oh, my gosh, Republicans drove up these deficits. And, in fact, we did. And we agree that that was not the right thing to do. So what is their response? Make the deficits bigger. Take the spending that we had while we were in charge and increase it by more.     
   And then they have one other thing they continue to do which is to call something like this bill a ``cut.'' You heard the gentleman from Washington on the last proposal say that it was a devastating cut, when in fact all this does, as the gentleman from Georgia pointed out, is take what's already a 4.5 percent increase and reduce it. 
   Now, what I want to do is, since they're having a hard time understanding this, I want to put this up graphically so that maybe they will understand better. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, here are 100 donkeys. I figured that donkeys were  something that Democrats would be able to relate to. So we have 100 donkeys here. Imagine that this is 100 donkeys of spending. Here's what this bill will do. There, Mr. Chairman, are 99 donkeys; 100 donkeys here, 99 donkeys there. Probably having a hard time, I would imagine, Mr. Chairman, people in the gallery are probably having a hard time telling the difference. That's because there isn't much difference. That's because it isn't a big cut, it isn't a big reduction. If you have a million-dollar program, all we're asking is for that program to get by on $90,000. If it's $100 million, we're asking them to get by on a mere $99 million. If it's a billion-dollar program, do you think that some government agencies can squeak by on $990 million rather than a billion? 
   But here's the big point: It doesn't look like a lot of difference in donkeys, but if we do that, if we spend the 99 instead of 100 on every single government program, we save $30 billion. That is real money. And this is how you save it: a little bit at a time. Ask a million-dollar program to get by on $990,000, ask a billion-dollar program to get by on 1 percent less. And when you do that with every single program in government, you save $30 billion a year. That, Mr. Chairman, is how we can get to a balanced budget without not only the largest tax increase in American history, without raising taxes on the hardworking people in America at all simply by asking government day by day, get by on 1 percent less. I think we can do it. I think we should vote for this amendment.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentlelady from Colorado. 
   You know, we have heard a lot today from the majority party whenever we talk about this amendment, this bill, this spending, they want to bring up last year's bills, last year's spending. We acknowledge, last year's spending was too much. Last year's bills were too much. That's not what we're talking about. It's like the baseball team wanting to play last year's season again. Look what we did last year. Look what happened last year. No, we're in the middle of this year. We're in the middle of this season. It doesn't matter who won the World Series last year. It matters who's in first place this year. What matters is this year. How much are we going to spend this year? That's what we're voting on. How much are we going to increase the deficit this year? How much further are we going to raid the Social Security surplus this year? That's the question before us. And we think we ought to have the deficit increase a little less and that we should raid the Social Security surplus a little less and that we shouldn't set up a situation where you're going to raise taxes on all of the American people. 
   The previous amendment, I showed a couple of charts. The previous amendment was to reduce spending by 1 percent. I tried to point out to the majority that it's like this. Here are 100 donkeys, something they can understand. If we reduce that by 1 percent, we have 99 donkeys. Not that big a difference in donkeys. And so we proposed an amendment last time, which the majority party defeated on voice vote, will undoubtedly defeat later, that said, let's just get by on 99 donkeys, money, instead of 100 donkeys, money. Well, they said they couldn't do it. 
   So the gentlelady from Colorado offers an alternative, which is get by on 99 1/2 donkeys. If I had a half donkey, I would stick it up there. You can pick whichever end of the donkey you want, but put another half a donkey on that chart. And so we're saying rather than 100 donkeys, get by with 99 1/2 . It's just saying if you have a million-dollar program, we said, well, get by on 999,000. They're saying, no. Okay. How about $999,500? If you have a $100 million program, we're saying can you get by on $99 million. They said, no. We're saying, okay, how about $99 1/2 million. 
   That's what this argument is about. Just asking for a half a percent, each government agency, each government program to deal with a half a percent less. People at home make these kinds of decisions with way bigger percentages than that all the time, Mr. Chairman. And if we do it, if we reduce it by 1 percent, we would save $30 billion if we did every program every year. If it's a half a percent, it's still $15 billion. That is real money, Mr. Chairman. Real money no matter how you cut it. And that is the way we can balance this budget without raising taxes. 
   There, Mr. Chairman, is the big difference between the majority Democratic Party and the Republican Party. We're saying, get by on 99 donkeys or 99 1/2 donkeys instead of 100. Tell government bureaucrats that we can balance this budget without raising taxes. They, however, want to give the bureaucrats 100 donkeys of spending every time and raise taxes on the American people to make up the difference. That's what we're talking about here. That's the difference in this debate. That's the difference between these parties. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would urge all Members to vote to make government bureaucrats deal with a tiny bit less and let people save and keep their own money.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   You know, our friends on the other side of the aisle may not like and may have problems with our budget, but the one thing they can't say is that we are not doing what we say we are going to do. We have said that we are not going to raise taxes, and it doesn't. We said we will balance the budget in 5 years without raising taxes, and it in fact does that. We have said that entitlements are a big problem and that they will swamp this budget and the next generation with debt if we don't deal with them, and this budget begins to deal with it. They may not like that, but we are doing what we say. 
   And there is an old saying that says ``do what I say, not what I do.'' That is what somebody who intends to have their actions be different than their words says, ``do what I say, not what I do.'' 
   Let's take a look at this Democratic budget, which I would argue is the ``listen to what I say, don't watch what I do budget.'' We have heard over the last year how PAYGO and all these other things were going to result in and lead towards a balanced budget and that is where they wanted to go. But yet this budget nearly doubles, actually more than doubles, the deficit from the last budget passed under Republican rule. 
   Our friends on the other side say that they want to eliminate the alternative minimum tax, at least they say for whatever they define as ``middle-class taxpayers.'' But yet in this budget, this budget counts on and continues the revenues from the alternative minimum tax at its current rate or higher for the entire 5 years of the budget. 
   Our Democratic friends have always talked about how they want a tax cut for the middle class. But yet as has been mentioned, this budget counts on all of the money, all of the tax increases that have been described. It counts on eliminating the marriage penalty credit and the child care credit; it counts on raising the tax rates all the way from the 10 percent rate to 35 percent, raising them all. 
   They talk about health care, that they want to cover everyone with health care, universal health care and all of that. Is any of that in this budget? No. There are no changes to anything like that in the budget. They were offered the opportunity to put that in the Budget Committee and they didn't do it. 
   They talk a lot about the death tax, that the death tax is strangling farmers and small businesses. And it is. And what does this budget do? It takes the death tax back up to the rates it was 10 years ago. It increases the death tax over where it is now. 
   Then there is the big issue of entitlement reform. All of the analyses, liberal, conservative, in the middle, everyone agrees if we don't reform Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid, they will bankrupt this country. What do they do to reform those in the next 5 years in this budget? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
   Yes, my friends, Mr. Chairman, this is the ``listen to what I say, but don't pay attention to what I do'' budget. It is like the Wizard of Oz. Watch the smoke in the front, but don't pay attention to what the man behind the curtain is doing. This budget, if you look at it, is what the man behind the curtain is doing and really wants to do, but it is not what is right or what is good for America or for taxpayers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, in listening to all this discussion, I have to think that the taxpayers of America have to wonder what's going on here, that in this bill there has been a proposal to say, well, we'll let these government agencies spend 100 cents on the dollar, 100 percent of everything they had last year. Oh, it's terrible, we can't do that. 
   Then there was one at 102 percent of what they had last year. No, we can't do that. Then there is one at 102.5 percent of what they had last year. No, it's terrible. They can't do that. 
   So here's one more try. What this does is reduce the increase in spending by .05 percent. That is 5/100 of a percent. That leaves them with a whole lot of money and a lot more of an increase, almost the same increase they had last year. 
   Now, I am sure, Mr. Chairman, that the people of America can't understand why people on other side of the aisle, the majority Democrats, would have a problem with this. I can't understand it either. 
   I think perhaps they don't understand what this is. Now, this amendment would save the taxpayers $27 million. Now, that's real money, $27 million, by which the deficit will not increase. We have a deficit, and we are robbing the Social Security surplus. It's $27 million we would save the taxpayer. 
   I have five explanations, five examples I would like to give here to perhaps help my friends on the other side of the aisle understand just what this proposal is to see if there is anything, anything at all that they believe is possible to reduce spending. Is there any waste in government? 
   Is there anything government can do for only 103 percent of what they had last year? First of all, this does take the spending increase from 3.5 percent to basically 3.45 percent, basically the change in the interest. That's number one. 
   Number two, it still increases spending in these Departments by $1.574 billion over last year, $1.574 billion more. 
   Let me give a third example. This is a $100 bill. This represents how much the government is spending on these programs now. Here's three more dollars and five cents. This bill represents this bill as it's currently written, the $100 they had last year, three more and five more cents. Here, Mr. Chairman, is how much the government would have to get if this amendment were to pass, $100, $3, but not the 5 cents; 5 cents on $103. Somehow this is going to greatly damage programs and what we are doing. 
   Let me give a fourth example. The gentleman from Ohio mentioned in the last debate a particular function that he said would have 245 agents under their bill as proposed. If this amendment were to pass, how many agents would there be? Well, there would still be 245 agents, but you would have to tell one of those agents that they would only work a 7-hour day instead of an 8-hour day. That is the significance of this bill. 
   Now my final example, if we look at the entirety of this blue donkey as a complete government program as proposed by my friends on the other side of the aisle, we have seen a proposal already to have 99 percent. 
   Now, when you look at them, you may say, well, gosh, they look almost the same. That's because they are almost the same. I don't know if you or others can see the change we made, but what we did was we tried to reduce about 1 percent of the total donkey surface area up in the air, but, no, that's been rejected. 
   So we said let's make it 99.5 percent of what you want to spend, still an increase over the last year, but of what you want to spend a little more here. There is still not much difference, I think, to most people, but, no, can't do that. 
   So on the last bill I proposed a quarter of a percent cut. Quarter percent. Could you get by on quarter of a percent less of an increase than what's been proposed? That was ``no'' also. 
   Now we are trying again, 5/100 of 1 percent. Let me try to do that graphically here. I do have a blue marking pen, 99.95 percent of the increase that you want, you can hardly tell the difference. But if we do this on every bill, every bit of spending over the government, we will eventually start to save money. 
   This is the way it works. The average American taxpayer understands that, that if I put away $10 a week, $10 a month, eventually I will have quite a bit of money. But I have to have the discipline to do it. That's what we are trying to say here. 
   We have a deficit. We are robbing the Social Security surplus. One thing that is not in dispute is that we are heading for a fiscal train wreck. Within 30 years, Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid alone will eat up 100 percent of the taxes currently received. What are we going to do? Are we going to double or triple taxes, or are we going to reform those systems, reform government and start now? 
   Yes, it's 30 years from now, but if we don't start on it now, the problem will be closer and bigger and closer and bigger. We see that if the other side is not willing to do this, what will they do, other than increase taxes? 
   Now, we see tax increases going on now. We have seen a budget that includes either the largest or the second largest tax increase in American history, and right now we are seeing tax increases proposed by the Democrat majority on minority groups, on smokers, they are a small minority group. Then just this evening we will probably have one on foreign companies who are setting up businesses and creating jobs in America. 
   Now the other side I know says, oh, no, that's not a tax increase. I would like to read you a letter here. This is a letter from BART GORDON, who is a Congressman from the Sixth District of Tennessee, a Democrat, to the chairman of Ways and Means, and he says: ``Concerns have been raised by Bridgestone America, a company with facilities in my district, about the impact the proposed Farm Bill offset would have on them. Bridgestone is concerned that the 30 percent withholding tax imposed by the proposal would have a broad and negative impact on its legitimate international business operations. 
   ``I understand the importance of ensuring that multi-national companies are not able to abuse tax loopholes to avoid paying taxes, but we must also be careful not to punish legitimate business practices and discourage foreign companies from insourcing operations in the United States. Concerns have also been raised about the effect this withholding tax will have on our international treaties.'' 
   That, Mr. Chairman, is a Democrat, not a Republican, talking about this tax, this withholding tax. It's a potential impact on jobs in America and the potential impact on trade agreements we have with other countries that will affect the ability of American companies to do business overseas. 
   Now, it's quite a contrast, because that's what they are proposing. The majority keeps proposing tax increase after tax increase after tax increase, and they will start on minority groups, and they will move to everyone, because they can't get it done without everyone. All we're asking here, all we're asking here is 5/100 of a percent, one nickel on $100, a slightly less increase so we can begin the process of spending less, not taxing more. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey. 
   I just wanted to clarify that my colleagues' arguments from California were very fine arguments, except they don't apply to this amendment. This amendment does make a 0.0005 or 5 basis points, one-five-hundredths of a percent reduction in the growth of each program equally across the board. So it is 5 cents on $100 of everything. 
   I appreciate the argument. It is clear that our friends on the other side of the aisle believe that government cannot survive on this, but they believe that all kinds of people, companies, entities can survive on a whole lot less than that with the taxes they want to increase. It is a very clear distinction, Mr. Chairman, between 5 cents on $100 across the board on every program, which I think would be fine, versus all of the various tax proposals, increase proposals, that you have both on various minorities, like smokers and foreign companies, and in your budget on basically every taxpayer in America.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does is this strikes an earmark, $200,000, for the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
   Let me explain, Mr. Chairman. I know that the gentlewoman from Nevada, who is here, and I believe the gentleman from Nevada also are supportive of this. What this amendment is not about is about the merits of this particular academy, as I understand it is a charter school, or whether it is a good school or not. 
   I received a call yesterday from the director of the Andre Agassi Foundation, who has provided a lot of the funding for this school, inviting me to come to the school in August and to see what they are doing and take a tour. And that is very nice and very flattering, but that actually isn't the point. I am sure it is a very fine school. I am sure it is doing lots of great work. But my understanding is that this school is at least half, if not more than that, funded by charitable donations, including from Mr. Agassi and from one of the Las Vegas casinos and lots of other people. 
   What I raise this about is whether we should be using earmarks to give out like this to what are essentially charitable works. Now, I am sure there are many other good schools in Nevada. There are many in my area. I am sure there are fine museums. I am sure there are fine research facilities. I am sure there are all kinds of different things that we can spend Federal money on. 
   But I don't think that when the taxpayers pay their taxes that they intend that part of it is a repository for us, as Members of Congress, any of us as Members of Congress, to delve into that money and go out and say this is a charitable organization which I find worthy in my district and here is the taxpayers' money for that from me. Because it is not from me. It is not from the Member of Congress. It is the taxpayers' money. And I think we are better off leaving the taxpayers with their own money so they can give it to whatever charitable organizations, schools, museums, historical developments, research, that they feel they should. And I just don't feel that it is our right, as Members of Congress, to hand this money out, no matter how beneficial or how worthy the cause is, to hand this out to various charities in our districts, because it is not our money, and act as though it is something that we did. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, you know, I don't disagree, and I'm not in a position to disagree with anything about this school said by either the lady from Nevada or the gentleman from Nevada. Again, let me reiterate, that is not my point. 
   My point is that there are probably many other schools that are worthy. There are probably all kinds of health considerations that are worthy. There are probably museums that are worthy. There are all kinds of things that are worthy. But the Federal Government does not traditionally fund charter schools. Schools are inherently local and State, and I think should be, and hopefully will continue to be. It's not a Federal school. And so I just don't think that it is right or appropriate that any of us pick something and essentially say this is where we're going to use the taxpayers' funds in a charitable endeavor. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would eliminate a $2 million earmark for the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York, New York. 
   Currently, Mr. Chairman, the City College of New York does not have a Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service. The Web site shows there are 16 centers of study, none of which bear Mr. Rangel's name. So ostensibly this $2 million is going to be creating the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service. 
   Currently, according to the Web site, it appears that most everything dealing with public service careers at the City College of New York currently goes through the Colin Powell Center for Policy Studies, which was founded by a charitable grant in 1997. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Rangel provided to me yesterday a brochure here on the Center for Public Service in New York. And this has a lot of stuff in it, admittedly, it mentions many things. But there are a few things in it I thought were troubling, because amongst the things that it says this center will have are, quote, ``a well-furnished office for Congressman Rangel.'' Second, ``the Rangel Library to house its Rangel archives.'' And it goes on to say, quote, ``The Rangel archivist librarian will organize, index and preserve for posterity all documents, photographs and memorabilia relating to Congressman Rangel's career.'' 
   House rules, and House rule XXI, clause 6 says, and I quote, ``It shall not be in order to consider a bill, joint resolution, amendment or conference report that provides for the designation or redesignation of a public work in honor of an individual then serving as a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner or Senator.'' In other words, the rule says that we don't name public works after ourselves while we are in Congress. 
   Now, it's my understanding from the Parliamentarian that this amendment does not violate the letter of that rule. I would argue, and argue to my friends in the majority, that it would violate the spirit. I really do not think this is a road we want to go down, where we, as Members, have the ability to create and name things after ourselves using public funds while we are in office. If you think about that, there are five colleges or universities in my district. I'm sure if I went to one of them, any of them, with $2 million and said, Let's have the John Campbell School of Fiscal Responsibility, I'm sure they would at least listen to that. But I don't think that would be right and I don't think that would be good and I don't think that would be proper. And I don't believe that this earmark is either. 
   So, I would request that my friends on the majority side and on the minority side consider, before you knee-jerk oppose this amendment, consider what this is opening up for this House. And do you really want to open up that we're going to have earmarks to name things after ourselves? 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Chairman, I would like to point out to the gentleman that under his logic that $141 million proposed in here is actually a cut, because it is a cut from $150 million. It is a $9 million cut from $150 million. Why aren't we spending $150 million?

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Chairman, first of all, I am happy to stand up here and identify myself with, as the majority party says, ``the fringe.'' You know, you may have noticed recently that the approval ratings for this Congress are not  very good. In fact, I think the latest I saw was that only 17 percent of Americans believe that this Congress is doing a good or a fair job. So I guess that being on the fringe of this Congress is meaning that we agree and associate ourselves with 83 percent of the American people. I would tell my friends on the majority that I am very happy to be on the fringe in Washington but on the mainstream outside of Washington. 
   And the mainstream outside of Washington wants to keep their own money to spend it on what they want. And they believe, Madam Chairman, even if the other side doesn't, Americans believe, and they are right, that government wastes some of their tax money. And what this proposed amendment does is it would increase spending on this bill by 4.6 percent instead of 4.8 percent. It is a reduction over what is proposed by a quarter of a percent. A quarter of a percent. It still provides an increase of $6.6 billion over last year. 
   So under this amendment if there is a government program that is scheduled to get a million dollars, it would instead have to struggle through on $997,500. 
   Madam Chairman, I would ask you, I understand that it appears that the Members of the majority party believe that life as we know it will end if that million-dollar government program must exist on $997,500, but I don't think that the majority of Americans feel that. 
   Let me point out again that first of all this amendment is not a cut because one equals one. Two is more than one even if you want three. So this amendment still enables a gigantic $6.6 billion increase in spending on this bill. But what it would do is it would put $379 million back in taxpayers' pockets, back towards deficit reduction. So it is not a cut. 
   The other thing that is amazing to me in this whole debate and discussion is there seems to be a direct correlation on the majority side between how much you spend on something and the outcome you are going to get. If that were the case, you could take every school in America, line them up by how much money is spent per student and you should see a direct correlation with the outcomes with how those students succeed out of school. 
   Well, there are many situations where there are schools spending $3,000 to $4,000 a student significantly outperforming schools spending 10, 12, $15,000 per student in the same place. 
   Why if there were a direct correlation between how much you spend on something and the outcome, then wouldn't Paris Hilton be the most well-adjusted kid on the planet; and I think perhaps she is not. 
   So does anybody out there believe that in this gigantic bill of billions and billions of dollars, that there is not one-quarter of a percent of waste, that is not one-quarter of a percent less that any given agency could do without than they have now? 
   Now I know that my friends on the other side of the aisle seem to have a very difficult time understanding what it means to save the taxpayers a little money, what it means to ask government to be a little more efficient, so I would like to explain it to you graphically, if I may. 
   This, Madam Chairman, represents 100 percent of a government program. I have used a donkey because I feel that is something that the majority party has some familiarity with. This represents 100 percent of a government spending program. 
   Let's look and see what we have seen so far. There was an amendment to reduce this program which has already been increased by 1 percent, so there is 99 percent of a government spending program. 
   Madam Chairman, I would suggest perhaps people in the gallery and people at home may not even be able to tell much of a difference. But the majority party rejected that. 
   The amendment from the lady from Colorado was a half a percent reduction, so here is 99 1/2 percent of a government spending program. Looks to me like that donkey is pretty much intact. I think it could probably survive. But that was rejected just a moment ago by the majority party. 
   So here is one last chance, one more chance. I would ask my Democratic colleagues: Can this government program survive like that with 99.75 percent of its spending? You know what, I think the American people will look at this and say yeah, they can. You know what that means, it means that $379 million back in the American people's pockets and back to reduce this deficit and hopefully leading us towards no longer stealing the Social Security surplus. I don't think they see much difference here, but they will see a difference at home. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Thank you for yielding. You know, I was trying to do the math on the previous one. I guess the question before us is this: can the program you described before, because I'm a little behind on my math here, that was $11.8 million, can it survive on $11.78 million? Is that going to mean the end of the world as we know it? Is that going to mean that this program is devastated? Are you telling me that there is not a quarter of a percent that any agency or any program in government can find that they can do their job as well?

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Madam Chairman, I stand here as a member of this fringe that is happy to associate with the 83 percent of Americans who think this Congress is doing a poor job. 
   We have got a lot of talk about cuts, but there is one thing that's clear. There is an increase in this bill as written. There is an increase of $6.6 billion in the deficit over what there would be if this bill held spending flat. That is an increase in raiding the Social Security surplus, and that will lead to the many tax increases that your side is currently proposing both in your budget and in other bills floating around in both this Chamber and the other. Those are increases there. This bill will not stop those increases, but just a little bit of a time, a quarter of a percent, it will help to slow the growth. 
   I would ask for everyone's support on this bill. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, we learned this week that in April of this year, the Federal Government received more tax revenue in that month than in any month ever in the history of the Republic. It results in an over 11 percent increase in revenue to the government this year, on top of over an 11 percent increase last year and an almost 15 percent increase the year before that. But, yet, the budget that the Democrats propose includes the largest tax increase in American history as they continue to impose tax increase after tax increase after tax increase. The question is, why? When Federal Government revenues have increased over 37 percent in the last 3 years, why do we want to increase spending by 40 percent in 3 years, 50 percent, 60 percent? Why? We should not be confiscating more money from the people in order to increase government. We should be allowing the people to keep more of their own money so that the economy can continue to grow.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENT SAFE HARBOR ADJUSTMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding. 
   The reason we have this bill and the reason we are having this debate is because the D.C. voting bill, which just passed this House, costs $2.5 million. So in order to have it be neutral, there needs to be $2.5 million found. 
   Now, what this bill proposes to do is what I would argue is basically a tax gimmick because no one's final tax, no one's ultimate tax pay, will be changed as a result of this bill. What it, in fact, does is change how quickly some people must pay their tax. So they will have to pay it a little earlier. They won't pay any different amount over a year. They will simply pay it a little earlier. But that is what this bill does. 
   But what was the alternative? Well, normally you would think that if you were interested in fiscal responsibility, if you were interested in keeping budgets balanced over time, that if you are going to spend $2.5 million extra, you would save $2.5 million somewhere else. That is what people at home do. That is what everyday, average American citizens do. If they are going to spend a little more money on something, they spend a little less money on something else. 
   Let's talk about what you would need to have done. If the Democratic majority had wished to reduce spending, and reduce the growth in spending is all you would actually have to do, but if they had wished to reduce the growth in spending in order to offset this $2.5 million, we are talking about 0.0002 percent. That is the reduction in growth, not even a cut, but the reduction in growth of spending. That is all you would have to do to offset the $2.5 million in this bill. And then we wouldn't even be talking about taxes and tax gimmicks and all that. Point zero zero zero 2 percent. 
   I ask you, if you can't find 0.0002 percent to reduce growth, not even to reduce entitlement spending, but to reduce growth of entitlement spending, where and when will you ever deal with the entitlement tidal wave that we have coming? By 2037 the entitlements will eat up 100 percent of the Federal budget as we currently know it. 
   So you have a couple of choices. You can either reduce the growth in entitlement spending over time so we don't have that, or you can double taxes. Well, if you can't find today 0.0002 percent to reduce the growth in spending, I would have to presume, and I think people would have to presume, Mr. Speaker, that the doubling of taxes eventually is where you want to go. 
   Now, we already saw a budget where you have had the largest tax increase in American history included in the budget, and now we can see why. You can't even find this amount of reduction in spending. 
   I oppose the D.C. voting bill because I think it is not right and not constitutional. But I oppose this bill as well because if we are ever going to control this budget and we are not going to control it on the backs of the average working American person, then tinkering with the Tax Code to find $2.5 million is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to go find 0.0002 percent of the growth and reduce that amount.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, let's look at what this bill does. It basically leaves the alternative minimum tax the same as it is now. That is not a tax cut. But to ``pay'' for leaving some taxpayers' taxes alone, they are going to raise other people's taxes. Now, I'm sure that in a moment the gentleman from Massachusetts will give some number of taxpayers in California he says will benefit from this. Those taxpayers will benefit from having their taxes the same as they are now. What the gentleman will not say is the number of taxpayers in California whose taxes will be increased by this bill, and there will be many. So some people's taxes stay the same and others go up. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a straight-up, direct, unadulterated tax increase. It will not be the last straight-up tax increase brought to you by this Congress.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank my friend, Mr. Westmoreland from Georgia, and you are equally a friend of the taxpayer and a Georgia bulldog in terms of fighting for taxpayers and consumers and for Americans to be more free rather than less free in the future. Thank you for yielding. 
   I stand here in front of this chart which says that gasoline is $4.09, which is the national average. As my friend indicated, I'm from California. I can tell you that this last weekend when I was home I paid $4.91 for premium unleaded.     
   In California, where we have even more restrictions on refineries and fuel and gasoline than you do nationally, our price is even higher than it is nationally, so we're headed for $5-a-gallon gasoline in California. 
   The one thing that's not very well known is it's not going to stop there. Natural gas price has gone up as well. The price of natural gas is now about 50 percent higher than it was just about 6 months ago. Now, in my home State of California, about 95 percent of our heating comes from natural gas and about 50 percent of our electricity comes from natural gas. So my constituents are already being shocked at the gas pump; but come this summer, they're about to be shocked with their electric bill. And come this winter, they will be shocked with their natural gas heating bill. 
   All these energy prices are going up. They're impacting consumers, and they're impacting businesses. I can't tell you how many business owners I have talked to that are being squeezed by the price of fuel in the costs of their products, whether it's a pizza place that delivers, or whether it is a delivery place that has delivery trucks. It doesn't matter what it is, whatever you get, it got to you because somebody brought it. And when somebody brought it, they used some kind of fuel to do that, and the price of that fuel is up. And those businesses can't pass that price on right now because the economy is so weak. And so if they pass that cost on, consumers won't pay it and their volume will go down and down, so businesses are being squeezed. 
   I talked to an owner of a company the other day who has a lot of his employees--we have long commutes, often, in California--and the price of their commute has gotten so high that he's probably going to see if--which, again, is often restricted by State law--the company can go to a 4-day work week or maybe even a 3-day work week in order to reduce the huge costs that his employees have commuting 50, 60, 70 miles to and from work every day. So this is impacting everybody. It's the biggest issue I hear about when I go home. 
   And so what are we doing? What is this Democratic-led Congress leading us to do? I mean, it's affecting homes, it's affecting businesses, jobs, employment, the economy, everything. And what are we doing here? Nothing. This Democratic-led Congress is doing absolutely nothing on the biggest issue that is facing America today. 
   A week or so ago we did pass a resolution, though, commemorating the end of the Revolutionary War 225 years ago. Now, that's great. I mean, I'm glad we had an American Revolution, I'm glad we won, I'm glad it ended. But I think we could be doing a little more productive things on the floor of this House with energy and with energy prices. 
   Now, the Democrats on the other side, they will have you saying, oh, well, we can't do this and we can't do that and we can't do the other. Let me tell you what I think and what we Republicans think we should do: Everything. There shouldn't be anything off the table, basically, in this discussion because of the crisis we're in and because of the magnitude of this situation. 
   Let me try and break it down into three areas of things that we ought to be doing. And the first is more production and supply and delivery of oil and natural gas. Now, you will hear Democrats say, oh, I heard Senator Obama the other day say, oh, that won't affect the price for 5 years; you won't get any of that oil out for 5 years. True, you won't get any of that oil out for 5 years, but markets are anticipatory. Part of the reason that gas prices are so high today is because of the markets anticipating increasing demand in India, in China, and in Brazil that will eat up more supply. If we send a strong message from this House of Representatives that we are going to do everything we can to produce more oil and gas from everywhere we can produce, the markets will react to that. Does that mean it will go back to where it was? No. And that's not the only thing we should do. But it is something we should do, and it should be one of the clubs we have in our bag that we use to bring these numbers down. 
   Second, we should be trying to develop all alternative forms of energy that are out there in order to reduce the demand on the fossil fuels. Now, the first thing we should be looking at is nuclear. Now, you look at France, Japan and Sweden. Sweden, arguably the most environmentally conscious country on Earth, and they get over 80 percent of their power from nuclear. What shocks me, Mr. Westmoreland, is that I hear the Democrats say all the time, well, we want to do more nuclear power if it is safe. You always hear the qualification, ``if it is safe.'' Oh, my gosh; you've got three big countries out there have 80 percent. You can go to Italy and a whole bunch of other countries where they're producing a significant amount of their energy from nuclear and no one has had problems. 
   To say ``it is safe,'' and everyone looks back at Three Mile Island, but that was 40 years ago almost, that would be like looking at a 40-year-old Altar computer and trying to assess whether you could run things with that computer today. 
   Nuclear technology has progressed every bit as much. And the nuclear technology that exists today is much more efficient and much safer than anything we had a long time ago. And we should be putting up nuclear plants as quick as we can and replacing those natural gas plants, replacing some of those others. 
   Liquefying coal is another thing we should be doing. We are the Saudi Arabia of coal. We have more coal in the United States than any other country on Earth. And second, by the way, is China. And what are the Chinese doing? Developing their coal and using their coal as quickly as they can. And what are we doing? Nothing. And then we should be looking at other alternative fuels like methanol, ethanol, butanol, all these different possible fuels. 
   But let's talk about ethanol for a second. You've heard a lot about it. We hear a lot about the subsidies and making it from corn, but the best thing to make ethanol from is sugar. But in this country, we have a huge tariff, I believe it's 75 percent--I could be wrong on that, but I believe it's 75 percent on imported ethanol and imported sugar.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Fifty-four cents a gallon. Fifty-four cents a gallon--thank you, Mr. Westmoreland--tax on imported ethanol or imported sugar cane to make ethanol. Why? If we think this might be one of our future alternative fuels, why would we tax it more than we tax anything else? It makes no sense. So we should be developing all of those alternative fuels. 
   Wind and solar, them, too, although they will never be more than 1 or 2 or 3 percent, but we should be developing them as well, and hydrothermal. 
   And then the third leg of this stool is efficiency. Yes, we need to have more efficient cars. Yes, we need to have  more efficient homes. Yes, we should have more efficient production capacities in business. And yes, we should do all that, too. But we can't do it only on efficiency, we can't do it only on oil production, we can't do it only on alternatives, we need to do all three. 
   And what so disappoints me about the majority Democrats in this House is some of them want to do one of those, occasionally they want to do two, nobody wants to do all three on the Democratic side. But that's what we need to do. 
   This is a crisis; it's not going to go away soon. And the American people have the right to have us in this House react and give them the tools they need to get the price of energy down to help them lift this economy. 
   I thank you for the time, Mr. Westmoreland. I yield back to my friend from Georgia.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (HISTORIC FISCAL CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, shh, there's a secret. I have a secret. It's a secret that the leadership in this House doesn't want the people to know; but I'm going to tell you anyway. This Nation, this Federal Government, is in a historic fiscal crisis right now. 
   It was announced earlier this week that the deficit for this fiscal year which we are in is projected now to reach $470 billion. Now, Mr. Speaker, for most people when you talk like this, these numbers are so huge they sound arcane. What does that mean.  Well, it is half a trillion dollars which I think most people know is a lot of money. Let me put it in perspective. 
   If we reach that level by the end of September, this will be by far the largest single year deficit in American history. Let me repeat that. We are currently in a year in which we will likely reach the largest deficit in 1 year in U.S. history. 
   But it doesn't seem to stop there because also this week the Appropriations Committee released their spending request for the next fiscal year, for fiscal year 2009. And they requested to spend 7.7 percent more than this year; 7.7 percent more. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the appropriations request is made up of 12 separate bills, 12 separate areas of the government. They propose an increase in spending in all 12. They are not proposing to keep the same or reduce spending anywhere in spite of the largest deficit in American history. 
   And because of the economic doldrums that we are currently in, revenue right now is basically flat. It is not rising very much. And entitlement spending, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, is going up by nearly 6 percent a year all by itself automatically if we don't do anything over the next 5 years. 
   So you don't have to be a rocket scientist to say okay, if revenues are staying the same and we are increasing some spending by 7.7 percent and the rest by nearly 6, the deficit is going to go up. So with the way things are projected, we could have a deficit of $600 billion, maybe $700 billion next year. And what are we doing about it in this House, well, we are just trying to make it worse. 
   Yesterday in a very broad, bipartisan vote, there was a vote to spend an additional $261 billion over the next 2 years, much of which is not included in the numbers that I just gave you. So $261 billion more. Deeper debt, bigger deficits. 
   Now some of the things that were included in that bill yesterday are priorities. One of them was continuing to support the troops in Iraq. I personally support that. But we have to make choices. There have to be priorities. We can't spend on everything. We should support the troops in completing their mission in Iraq, but we should cut something else so we are not making the taxpayer be the loser on all of this. 
   It seems like every week in this place, in fact I believe every week here we have either added a new program, new spending or a new entitlement. And hardly ever do we reduce the spending on something else to pay for it. 
   Now we are spending well over $3 trillion a year in the Federal Government. You would think that some of that $3 trillion is not something that we absolutely need. And we need to be reducing those things and setting priorities. If this is more important than this, then we spend on this and don't spend on this because we can't spend on it all. 
   But unfortunately what is happening around here is all right, I have my spending program, and another Member has their spending program, and so what's the compromise? I know, let's spend both. I get to spend what I want to spend and you get to spend what you want to spend, and those are the compromises we have been reaching in this place recently. Great deal. Politicians win; special interests win; taxpayer loses. 
   Mr. Speaker, this has got to stop. We have to stop the spending, and when we set priorities on things that we want to spend money on, we have to cut something else. 
   You know, the last thing I have here is: Are we going to have the highest tax rate in the world? Senator Obama recently proposed to lift the cap now on Social Security and Medicare taxes for incomes above $250,000 and repeal all of the tax cuts that were put in place in this century in 2001 and 2003. If both of those things Senator Obama has approved become law, the highest tax rate in the United States will be 54.9 percent. It will be the fourth highest tax rate in the industrialized world. We will be exceeded only by France, Sweden and Denmark. Oh, and by the way, all three of those countries are currently moving to reduce their tax rates because they see what that kind of tax burden will do, is doing to their economy and to brain drain from their countries. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that people will not keep this a secret but will tell everybody.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, you know, I am a little stunned by this debate tonight, by what's being said by the other side. I am hearing a lot of stuff about how this budget balances the budget, but also about how it doesn't raise taxes. The gentleman from Georgia said, and I believe I wrote it down correctly, that it ``does not raise taxes one single penny.''  
   Well, this budget either doesn't raise taxes, or it doesn't balance the budget. But it absolutely mathematically cannot do both. It will not and cannot mathematically do both. 
   This budget includes every penny of tax increases, in the dollars, in the revenue dollars, every penny, which will tax my constituents and the people of California $3,331 each per taxpayer per year. Now, your numbers, the numbers of their budget, includes every bit of cutting the child care tax credit, eliminating the marriage penalty deduction, raising rates at every income bracket, raising the capital gains tax, raising the dividends tax, raising the death tax, raising all of those taxes. Every penny of that is included. 
   That is how their budget balances. Without it, it doesn't balance. Without it, it has a deficit in the fifth year of somewhere close to $100 billion, which is just a little less than the deficit that we have now. 
   Now, we didn't write this budget. This is their budget. I will give them the benefit of the doubt, and, presume, that perhaps they would like to have a budget that doesn't raise taxes, or perhaps they would like to have a budget that balances. 
   But they have increased spending in this budget, which is the reason we have the deficit today. It is not because taxes are too low, it is because spending is too high. 
   So, I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, choose. You are either raising taxes, or you are not balancing the budget, but you mathematically cannot do both. It is your budget, it is your decision. You tell us which one you are going to do.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, they should tell the American people which one they are going to do, because they either are increasing taxes or not balancing the budget. They mathematically cannot do both. 
   Mr. Chairman, the budget, the way it is written, is, absolutely is, and assumes every penny of the largest tax increase in American history, and that is something the people of this country cannot afford.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I spent 25 years in the retail car business, so I have done my share of negotiating. There is a golden rule of negotiating to buy something that if you want to get the best price, you have to be willing to say, No, I won't buy it. 
   So if the government negotiates and says, No, I won't buy it, when they say no, which they will say a lot or have to say a lot to get a good price, then that means that seniors will be denied various drugs, and that is what has happened in the VA. 
   If they take the other course and decide they are not going to say no, then they are not negotiating; they are price setting. And when they set prices, they will either be too low and people won't get what they need, or they will be too high and we will be wasting money. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a solution that won't work to a problem that does not exist.

   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank my friend from Louisiana for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote against this bill tonight. I hope you will vote against it because it's too late. The most important quarters are this quarter and next quarter, and the vast majority of this won't even take effect until after or at the end of the next quarter. I hope you will vote against it, because it may be political stimulus, but it is the wrong economic stimulus. We are in this problem because of a credit crunch leading to a capital crunch because, arguably, Americans bought, borrowed, and spent too much, and we are going to ask them to spend more. 
   I hope you will oppose it because it is wealth redistribution. People who pay  over 50 percent of the taxes in this country will get nothing, and roughly 30 percent of the benefit of this will go to people who pay no taxes at all. 
   I hope you will vote against this and oppose it because illegal aliens will get this in spite of the new language put in the bill. You see, we have lots of laws that say it is illegal for people to be here and do what they do anyway. The problem is we don't enforce those, and we can't enforce what is in here either. It will be another unenforceable law. 
   I hope you will oppose it because of the potential for fraud. When you give money for nothing, there is an ability for fraud. The GAO estimates that roughly one-third of all the earned income tax credits paid out are fraudulent. It will be the same here. 
   I hope you will oppose it because it encourages spending when what we need as a society is more saving and investment. 
   But if none of that mattered, if none of that mattered to you at all, I hope you will oppose it because it nearly doubles the deficit for this year. After 3 years of declining deficits, we're going to begin the other way. We are going to nearly double that deficit. 
   Buy a flat screen TV and save America. It's not a good policy. I urge you to vote ``no.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I just wanted to bring to the chairman's attention a situation with HUD financing that kind of makes no sense to me, and a specific situation which I'm aware of involves the Villa Nueva Apartments, which are in San Ysidro in the San Diego area of California, where the owner of this multi-family, affordable housing project wants to sell it. The buyer wants to keep it as an affordable housing project. He's committed to keep the rents unchanged, but yet since it is HUD financed, under current, I guess, rulings or something that HUD is making, that 100 percent of the proceeds of this project would actually not be available to the seller. I don't know why someone who owns something would want to sell it if they couldn't have any of the proceeds. So, as a result, the seller may not sell this project. They may hold on to it for a couple of years, and then the restrictions will expire and then they could sell it for something else. 
   So it seems to me that HUD's procedures on this are actually standing in the way of affordable housing companies acquiring and continuing affordable housing multi-unit projects.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are a whole bunch of things in this bill I think are awful. I don't like funds, government funds to buy foreclosed properties. I don't like having a fee that might increase the interest rates that people pay for loans. I don't like creating a slush fund that will probably largely go to some political organizations. And I do not like helping irresponsible lenders that don't deserve to get any help. 
   However, I am going to support this bill today. I am going to support it because we are in a position where we cannot afford to not have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the marketplace. 
   If you think the economy is tough now, watch what would happen if we took 50 percent of our lending capacity out of this marketplace today. 
   We can argue about whether Fannie and Freddie should be as they are constructed today, and I don't think they should be. We should have an argument about how they should be constructed in the future. We should have a debate about that. But they are as they are now, and the guarantee from the Federal Government is implicit, and this bill will make it explicit, and I think that is, very unfortunately, something we are going to have to do. 
   The bill also does provide some lending support out there. There are people out there who did get in a problem that was not of their own making and who do deserve some help and some support. Unfortunately, we will be supporting a lot of people who don't deserve, but at least it will get to people who do deserve support as well. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I stand before you reluctantly supporting the bill, but supporting it because we cannot afford at this time to see the housing market slip further and further into a problem. Although this has a number of things which won't help at all, it does have some things which I think are necessary.

<DOCNO>Mr. CAMPBELL of California. (CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives voted on legislation (H.R. 2638, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009) to fund government operations through March 6th of next year. The legislation contained a provision to provide up to $25 billion in loan guarantees to companies that engage in the manufacturing and distribution of automobiles and trucks. Although I was advised by the House Committee on Ethics and Standards that I had no ethical conflict under the rules relative to this provision, I believe that I do have a conflict. A company which I control derives substantial income through real property leases to one of the auto companies that may receive loan guarantees under this bill. Therefore, I felt it would be improper for me to vote on or to engage in any debate or discussion on this bill. Accordingly, I voted ``Present'' on H.R. 2638.
