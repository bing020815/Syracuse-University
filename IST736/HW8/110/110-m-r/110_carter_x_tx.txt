<DOCNO>Mr. CARTER. (LIFT THE AMERICAN OIL EMBARGO -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. Madam Speaker, today we vote on a bill to draw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by 70 million barrels of oil. The U.S. consumes 21 to 23 million barrels of oil a day. So this is just over 3 days' supply. 
   The good news is that our Democrat colleagues have finally started to realize that supply is the problem. Seventy million barrels may help slightly the pain at the pump, but so would the billions of barrels of oil in ANWR, offshore, and in shale oil. 
   Increasing American energy supply is not an ideological issue like traditional marriage or abortion. It's a simple issue of do you support the American people or radical environmental groups. 
   Sixty-seven percent of the American people want safe, environmentally sound drilling for oil. This is what the American people want. This is what they should have. The only obstacle seems to be Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat Congress. 
   Americans are counting on Congress to work together and lift the American oil embargo. Americans stand ready to work with the Democrats, as do the Republicans.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARTER. (DRILL RESPONSIBLY IN LEASED LANDS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I have been listening to this debate, and it has been extremely interesting. But I think that we have got a situation here where, because of the fantastic nature of the Congress, nobody understands what we are talking about. In reality, we are talking about leasing, and they are saying use the lease you paid for. 
   Now, I think the American people, almost every one of them out there, they know what a lease is because probably they have leased an apartment, or they have leased a home or they have leased a car. They have leased something in their life. And I doubt very seriously if they paid a lease price, a pretty good size lease price that came out of their family's pocket, and then didn't use what they leased. They parked the car in the garage and didn't use it. They rented the apartment for a year and never set foot in it, but lived someplace else. Or if they were in business, they rented a warehouse to store things, and then didn't put anything in the warehouse and wasted their money. 
   Now, what we are talking about here is leases that the people who are in the oil business have spent billions, with a B, of dollars to lease. Does it make sense to anyone's common sense that they would spend that kind of money and then not look to see if there is some way they could get their money back on the deal? Of course they have. 
   And in fact, as Kevin Brady pointed out, they have been looking and looking and looking and looking in this area to find enough resources to justify billions of dollars worth of expenditures to drill. 
   I will tell you, you are welcome to drill in my back yard. I have got about two, a little over 2 acres. I will lease it tomorrow, okay? But there is no oil in my back yard, and I don't expect anyone to lease it or drill there because they know in Round Rock, Texas there is not any oil. 
   Now, the same thing goes here. You can talk about use it or lose it, but once you know there is no production in an area, there makes no sense to spend millions of dollars to find nothing. That is what this is all about. Common sense tells you there is no oil there.

   Mr. CARTER. Mr. Speaker, President Bush listened to the American people this week, and he lifted the executive moratorium on energy exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf. Unfortunately, a congressional ban still exists and remains in place. 
   Congress needs to listen to the American people. Whether it is the folks back in central Texas that I represent, or the people on the coast of Maine or Southern California, Americans want to explore safely and properly for American energy. 67 percent of the American people want sound exploration using safe practices, and to have American industry. 
   There is only one obstacle that stands in the way, and that is Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress. Americans are counting on Congress to work together to lift this ban. 
   Republicans are ready to work with Democrats to do just that. Give us a chance to have a vote on this, and we will have American energy for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. There is talk that the $100 billion war supplemental will include an extra $20 billion in goodies. Such projects are seemingly irrelevant to the mission our soldiers are expected to carry out. For example: 
   $60 million for the California and Oregon salmon fishery disaster of '06; 
   $400 million for timber revenue program in Oregon; 
   $400 million in low-income home energy assistance for State grants; 
   $448 million unrequested funds for State children's health insurance programs, and; 
   a half a billion dollars for wildfire management and suppression. 
   Now, these are valuable projects, but they don't belong in an emergency war supplemental. They appear to be nothing more than an attempt to buy votes at the expense of our soldiers in the war on terror. The supplemental is meant to be an emergency troop funding vehicle and there is no excuse for $20 billion worth of pork in that supplemental. 
   Let this Congress respect our soldiers and deny this pork.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARTER. (THE DEMOCRAT ENERGY BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I thank you very much for recognizing me on this issue. 
   You know, tonight, as we gather here, a bunch of Texans have just weathered a pretty rough storm down there in our part of the world. And it brought to the forefront something that Americans have already experienced in Indiana, and that is, when one-fifth of the refining capacity of the United States is hit by a hurricane because it is concentrated on the gulf coast, then we're going to see gas prices and diesel prices go up. 
   And even though tonight there are double shifts working in every refinery--and we were blessed that those refineries were not damaged more than just slightly--to bring that production back up is just like any other factory you shut down, you have to bring it back up to get to full production. And it will take days, and maybe even weeks, to where we're back. And the market knows that, and the market fears that. Just look at what happened when one refinery burned outside of Chicago partially, that's the first jump in gas prices, if Americans will think back to when the first jump in gas prices occurred. 
   Now, the reason why I bring this up, not only do I think about my neighbors back home and all the pain and suffering that they're going through, and then I think about the neighbors around the country that are going to suffer as a result of this natural disaster down there with the prices, and then I think about the fact that Republicans on this House floor have been trying to get something done about refining capacity for 30 years. And for 30 years, it has been the policy of the Democrats to say ``no more refineries.'' 
   And as the gentleman mentioned, we finally got at least an incentive package to try to get refineries to start building new refineries. And quite frankly, if you're putting together an energy plan and you're talking about just refineries, shouldn't you maybe think about putting them someplace else besides the Texas and Louisiana and Mississippi gulf coast, seeing as we know what happens there all the time when it comes to hurricanes? We should be having a plan for just the simple matter of having some gasoline and diesel produced in this country. 
   Now, Americans have common sense. Things don't have to be complicated for them. They look at an issue and say, are you telling me that this bill was written by the Speaker of the House and her folks with really no input from anybody? What makes them experts? And do I want them planning my life and my energy needs for the next 20 years in the back room of the Speaker's office?     
   Now I think the American people say no. 
   And I think the American people would say that this is an issue that should have some concentrated effort. Maybe they should have been here for the 5 weeks that the Republicans were here. I think the people back home were saying maybe we should have been meeting, which they seem to talk a lot about, in a bipartisan method to come up with a real all-of-the-above energy solution the Republicans started talking about 6, almost 7 weeks ago on a Friday afternoon when they shut off the lights, shut off the mics and ran off the press in this very House. But we Republicans stayed. And we talked. And we said this is a crisis. And then we've had another natural disaster which has enhanced that crisis. It's time that we wake up and realize, quit playing politics with that long distance trucker who is going to have to pay maybe $6 or $7 for diesel and not make a dime on his load. Or I had a rancher tell me that today, if you sell a calf at the auction in central Texas and you get $90 for him, $45 of that is in energy costs. It's time for us here in this Congress to wake up and instead of cramming eleventh hour pieces of legislation that look like the Fort Worth phonebook down our throats, maybe we should have that bipartisan discussion. 
   It's a shame that this type of legislation, and I can see it in your hand there, has come here in the last, it's 10 o'clock, in the last 20 minutes. It's time we get to work as Americans and pass a comprehensive energy plan that we all participate in.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. Madam Speaker, now that the Democrats have satisfied their base and passed a bill that is guaranteed to be vetoed and delayed the necessary funding for our troops, we need to get down to business and pass a clean supplemental. 
   Yesterday I received a letter from a marine mom. She said she was embarrassed and saddened by the fact that somebody would leave her son and those fighting forces that are doing such a wonderful job in harm's way without funding their needs as they fight the battle for freedom. This lady was heart broken that a portion of this Congress would vote not to provide a clean bill for her son's protection. 
   The Chicago Tribune editorial says that President Bush is going to veto this spending bill because it has a timetable for withdrawal, and it goes on to say: ``He is right to do so.'' 
   We have a new commanding general on the ground and he has a plan, and that plan has not even started to be executed. We are already seeing modest improvements. 
   I urge my colleagues, and that marine mom urges my colleagues, to support a clean supplemental. It is time the Democrat leadership put our troops, not political statements, first.

   Mr. CARTER. I thank my friend for yielding, and I thank both the chairman and ranking member of my committee. 
   I bring to this discussion and this bipartisan support, I hope, the perspective of having been in the trenches and having dealt with this issue. 
   I can't count on all the digits that I have the number of times that I have sat in a meeting of the Williamson County law enforcement group about the overcrowdedness of our jail in Williamson County, Texas, now a county of about 350,000 people. 
   We always look to see how many Federal prisoners we had in our jail, and always we would see 22 to 30 percent of these people would be what we considered Federal prisoners, illegal aliens, that had committed crimes. Now, yes, this is an immigration issue. Yes, it is a border protection issue. And these are issues that we all agree we must address. We will, I am confident, address them. But it is also a law enforcement issue. It is an issue that our people who enforce our laws at the local level and do the right thing, take them to court, try them, convict them, hold them while they are ready for trial, have space taken up by a responsibility of our Federal Government. And what we are doing here today is providing resources for those local people so that they can do their job and enforce the laws of the United States and of our various States. 
   This is a good use of our money to assist our locals, counties, States, and other authorities that have this duty of enforcing our laws in America, to help them do their job so we are not burdening the taxpayer at the local level and shifting funds from good things that keep our communities safe in order to keep these people in jail. And, believe me, they will do what it takes to keep them in jail. 
   So, therefore, let's do our job. Let's pass this additional funds for helping those who would incarcerate criminals on our behalf, and by that, I think we will be doing a good thing for our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I would also like to thank Ranking Member Buyer and Chairman Filner for bringing this forward today. I think this is an important resolution. 
   When I heard about the fact that someone had defaced the Vietnam Memorial, I just didn't really know what to think about it. It wasn't a front page item; it was a back page item. But to me it was just a shock. So I went down to the park to take a look at it. 
   And as I walked along there, and I know some others have done this too, you could see where this substance had cast what looked like a shadow across the names that were printed on portions of this wall. And it brought back to me a memory of the time when the traveling wall came to the town I am from in Round Rock, Texas, and was put up out in the park, and I went out there with one of my good friends and one of the lawyers who worked in my court who was a true Vietnam veteran and a hero, and we walked up to approach that wall. And it was sitting up on a hill in our park, and he got about 75 or 50 yards from the wall and he just stopped. And I said, Mike, are you going up there? And he said, Not right now. And then he stood there and stared at that wall and cried. And it  took him a long time before he approached that wall because, as he said, there were too many names on that wall that he missed and loved. 
   That wall means that kind of thing to our Vietnam veterans. And for someone to go out and deface the honor of these fallen heroes whose names were carved on that wall is intolerable. I too hope the Park Service finds these people and prosecutes them to the full extent of the law because this is a shame. It's not only a shame to our national monument, which is against the law, but it is a shame to our national honor that this happened. And that is why I brought this bill forward. 
   I want to note that there are others who feel the same way, and many of them are here today and I am thankful for them. The Gathering of Eagles and the AMVETS posted a $5,000 reward to try to find out who did this defacing of the wall. That's how much it means to them. 
   This act of vandalism cannot be tolerated, should not be tolerated. And by passing this resolution, we will reaffirm to our veterans who fought the war in Vietnam that they did it with honor, they did it with principle, and we respect them as our warriors who did their job and should have been treated accordingly with honor when they came home. We need to continue to honor our Vietnam vets. That's why I feel this resolution is so important. And I hope it will be passed unanimously by this House.  
   The Vietnam Veterans Memorial serves as a memorial to the 2,700,000 men and women in the United States Armed Forces who served in the designated war zone during the Vietnam Era. 
   While serving in Southeast Asia or as a result of their wounds or a service-connected disability, 58,256 men and women died. 
   On Friday evening, September 7, 2007, the United States Park Police reported being notified of a light, oily, and unidentified substance that was spilled over portions of some of the names, panels, and paving stones of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. 
   At least 14 of the 140 inscribed panels of the Memorial Wall were damaged. 
   The National Park Service has determined that the damage was the result of an act of vandalism. 
   Thank the Gathering of Eagles organization and AMVETS for bringing attention to this crime through the $5,000 reward they are offering and by spreading the word to their members.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARTER. (OUR ONGOING MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I thank my friend for yielding, and I thank my friend for holding this special order this night where we try to lay the truth out about what is going on with our soldiers. 
   I have had the opportunity to go to Iraq on four different occasions and visit with soldiers. I am a blessed Congressman in that I have the very privilege and honor of representing Fort Hood, Texas. Fort Hood, Texas, is the only two division post in America, and both of those divisions are now famous for operations that have taken place in Iraq. 
   The 4th Infantry Division, one of the divisions at Fort Hood, captured Saddam Hussein. The 1st Calvary Division put on a free election in Baghdad. Both were major accomplishments in this war, major accomplishments in the future of Iraq, and the blood, sweat and tears that went into those projects have been brought back to central Texas on numerous occasions. So it is clearly an honor for me to be able to stand up and talk about what is going on in Iraq and why we, in my opinion, my humble opinion, and I think the opinion of those who really think about the issues, it is my opinion that we must stay the course. 
   What I want to be able to promise, I want to look every soldier that I see, and I see soldiers every week because I go back home every week and I go visit these soldiers, and I see them and I tell them what I want for them is I want them to come home, just like every American wants those soldiers to come home. But when the 4th Infantry Division, III Corps and the 1st Calvary Division and all those the other fine soldiers march out of Iraq, I want to see them marching out under ``The Star Spangled Banner'' and the red, white and blue, and not the white flag, and that is what they want too. 
   Every soldier I have spoken to, bar none, has told me they are doing a good job, they are winning, they will win, they want to stay the course. They want to finish the job they started. They say they owe it to their fallen comrades. They owe it to the effort they have put forward on behalf of humanity in Iraq. 
   I get real upset and tired when I hear people ragging on and insulting and writing stories about the ``evil American soldier.'' The evil American soldier that they describe doesn't exist. American soldiers are some of the closest things to sainthood that I have seen, because they are willing to stand up and fight for people, in many cases that don't even like them. 
   But what is really wonderful and what has changed in Iraq and what needs to be recognized by everyone is the last time I was over there in July, previous to that I was over there in May of 2006. First let me tell you, May of 2006 the weather was a lot better than the last day of July in 2007, and it was, as we say in Texas, it was hotter than a $3 pistol over there. But, seriously, when I went over this time, the difference was the interaction between ordinary Iraqi civilians and United States marines and United States soldiers. And they all talked about it at length, and I saw it demonstrated. 
   Prior to that time, I had never seen an Iraqi policeman anywhere. When we were in Ramadi, there was a pickup truck full of policemen on every corner and they were patrolling the streets, and people, ordinary people, were doing ordinary business in an area that had at one time been the bloodiest battlefield in Iraq, where they had pounded each other for days across this five-lane road. Now, ordinary Iraqi citizens of all ages, dressed all different ways, men and women and children, were walking, going about ordinary business there, addressing United States soldiers and United States marines, talking to them, discussing things with them, discussing things with their local politicians. It was an amazing turnaround. Amazing. 
   I talked to a young soldier, he couldn't have been more than about 19, a tow-headed kid, and I said, ``Tell me how it has changed?'' He said, ``Well, sir, you know, they plant these explosive devices in these streets and they plant them in the curbs and they plant them in garbage cans.'' He said, ``Boy, we used to crawl down these streets, watching everything, looking everywhere, just really concerned that the next step might blow up on us. Now we approach the streets and a member of the Friends of Iraq,'' I believe it is called, they have a belt across their chest, ``steps out and says, `Excuse me, but don't go down this street. There is an explosive device planted in the middle of street. The arms of the other explosives are in that blue building over there. And one block over, the green front building, that is where the guys who planted it are.' '' He said, ``Sir, that makes life a whole lot easier for a marine patrolling the streets here.'' You know what? That is a good story, because that is Iraqis talking to soldiers. 
   We visited with sheiks, and they told us that they had come to the realization when al Qaeda began to kidnap their families and try to make them take certain positions by kidnapping their families, they realized, like a revelation, who the bad guys were. 
   Americans had never kidnapped their families. Americans had never intimidated them in that fashion. They had never seen anything from American soldiers but trying to help, picking up the garbage, trying to make the sewer work, trying to make the electrical plant work. And then they realized these people were kidnapping their children and in many instances killing their children to try to pressure the sheiks to get their tribes to do certain things. So the sheiks said, that is it. That is it. We have had enough of this. And they went to their tribes and they told them, we are going to join the Americans. 
   These were Sunnis. So the first thing, of course, that we had to be concerned about was we hear so much about the difference between Sunnis and Shias, the sectarian violence. Was this going to create a rift in Iraq? We heard this story. 
   We have got General Funk who is a very good friend of mine who lives in my district. His son is in command in another location in Iraq. I also went to visit him while I was over there. He is a colonel. He told me that the week before, I think it was 11 or 12 Shiite sheiks came to his place where he was settled in and wanted to meet him and said, ``We have decided to join in helping the Americans get rid of al Qaeda.'' So that is the whole story. 
   Those of us who can remember back to the Vietnam War, we were told we were going to win the hearts and the minds of the people and that is how you won this type of war. We haven't heard that term in this war, but I remember that term. And the difference is, we never quite won the hearts and minds of the people because of mistakes that were made. 
   General Petraeus' plan was to capture the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people on our side, and I believe he is succeeding, and I believe, given the tools, he will continue to succeed. I can tell you one thing, he has got the best fighting force that ever walked on this Earth and the best bunch of human beings that are trying to help him do it, and we should support them in every form or fashion. That is what I think this war is all about. That is how we will walk out under the red, white and blue, and not a white flag.  
   So I thank my friend for yielding to me.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. Absolutely. You know, a story I love to tell, because it was so funny, KEVIN BRADY, our colleague from Texas, was a chamber of commerce representative for a long time before he came to Congress. Of course, he worked for the local county commissioners, courts and city council and things like that. 
   Well, when we were in Ramadi we walked into the market, and there was this old man, and he looked like the ancient age, sitting in the chair in front of a kind of a destroyed shop. Right next door was another shop where a guy was putting wares out and getting ready to sell something. We were walking in with the general and also with the newly-elected mayor. 
   Well, immediately he called to have the mayor come over there, and he told the mayor, he said, ``Look,'' he said. ``You fixed his shop up. I want to know what the timetable is for fixing my shop up.'' And the mayor said, ``Oh, well, you know, we are getting the resources in. We will get it done.'' He said, ``Well, I am going to hold you to your promise, and I am going to come by the city hall and I am going to check on this, because I need my shop up so I can start operating too.'' 
   BRADY leaned over to me and says, ``It sounds like somebody at the city council meeting in The Woodlands in Texas.'' 
   So, you know, that is the kind of normalcy we want to see start to happen, where people are starting to think about living their life, not dodging and ducking for their life. So to me that is a good story. That is a story that says peace is breaking out in some small area anyway, because this little old man wanted his shop open. That is a great story.

   Mr. CARTER. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. You know, it is very important, there has been a lot of talk about this latest fight down in Basra. Fifteen thousand Iraqis went into the fight there and there has been a lot of talk about over 1,000 of those Iraqis ran. That is kind of looking at that glass half full or half empty. Yes, maybe 1,000 or more soldiers turned and ran, but 14,000 stayed and fought. 
   If you went 3 years ago when I went on my second trip to Iraq and I sat down at a dinner table with a bunch of ordinary soldiers and said what are we trying to accomplish over here? And they said, sir, when they think about their units the way we think about our units, they will be a qualified fighting force over here, and we are trying to instill that in them. 
   I say 14,000 of them acted like soldiers, and that is something we should be proud of.

I have gotten home and I immediately went and checked the evening news, as we all 
   do here in Iraq, to see what folks were saying back home, and I saw someone say ``I support the warriors, but I don't support the war.'' He said, ``Sir, we are the war.'' 
   I think that's something we ought to remember. As far as they are concerned, not supporting their effort is not supporting them. We need to remember that before we hurt feelings.

   Mr. CARTER. Madam Speaker, we have got an investment crisis that seems to be rising and the talking heads were on television last night talking about it. Most everyone agreed that we needed a long-term plan that our investing community could look to as we grow our economy. It needs to be long-term and it needs to have solutions. Part of that was an energy plan, a plan you could rely upon. 
   I heard an environmentalist this morning say we need to go to alternative fuels, but we need a transition with carbon-based fuels. Yet we passed an energy plan which purports to have drilling for these necessary oil and gas resources, but there is still in place the availability of radical environmentalists to stop all drilling by filing lawsuits. They have declared 80 percent-plus of the areas off-limits to drilling, and they have set up kind of ``gotchas'' that will prevent the rest of that drilling. 
   We need a good energy plan.

   Mr. CARTER. Would the gentleman yield? I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Very good description of what we are looking at this week. And you are right; this may be one of the most critical votes that the people that hold these valuable seats that our people back home gave us are going to cast in their lifetime, because they are going to cast a life-and-death vote here. 
   You know, as you mentioned, the troops and the 1st Infantry Division that you represent over there in Georgia, I am very blessed to represent the folks at Fort Hood, Texas. We are the only two division posts in the entire world, as I understand it, and I am very proud to represent the 4th Infantry Division and the 1st Cavalry Division and III Corps. 
   As we meet here tonight, the 1st Cavalry Division is in Baghdad, and General Odierno and III Corps are in command.     
   Now, I have my soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division, and I call them mine because I care about every single solitary one of those soldiers as they serve our country. I have them in harm's way tonight as we stand here, with great generals who know what they are doing, know their mission, and are ready to accomplish it. 
   I don't think the American people have really understood what General Petraeus is trying to do with what some are calling a surge, but more familiar to our soldiers is a call for more boots on the ground; or as Jack said, for somebody to take your back. 
   But the real issue here is what is the plan for victory that General Petraeus has painted for us. Well, the plan is to involve Iraq in their own defense. The plan is for one battalion of American soldiers to back up a brigade of Iraqi soldiers as they go in and execute a new policy in the neighborhoods of terror in Baghdad. The Army will be backing up a brigade with a battalion. There are five battalions in a brigade. So that means it is a 5 to 1 ratio is the plan for the Iraqis to be in the fight versus the Americans. The Americans will provide all of the great resources, all of the know-how, all of the skill, all of the training, all the can-do that our American forces provide to the fight. But the Iraqis will go in and they will take care of cleaning out the neighborhoods in Baghdad. They speak the language. They know the culture and the religion. They know the various groups. They can do this in a much more effective way, with the support of General Petraeus' troops. And he has told us that he needs the additional boots on the ground to make this plan work. 
   Now, I think the American people are a people that believe in winning. You know, I sit around this House in our off time, and what are we talking about, who is going to win the next basketball game competition that is going on in this country? And we are talking about who is going to win, not who is going to lose. 
   When it is football season, we are looking for a winning season. When we have a baseball team, we want them to have a winning year and to win the pennant. We are a Nation that likes winners. We have the most effective fighting force in the history of man on the ground today, and they can win. And they are telling us we have a plan. 
   One of the problems that we have run into in Baghdad, and I have learned this by visiting with these generals. I visited just recently with the general who brought the 4th Infantry Division back, and they are ready and training to deploy again next fall for their third or fourth deployment. 
   What was said was we have demonstrated we can clear out an area like Sadr City, for instance. The 1st Cavalry Division went in 2 years ago and cleaned out Sadr City, redesigned the sewer system, got the electricity system working slightly, got the garbage that had been in the streets for years under Saddam Hussein cleaned out, and they did this under fire. And they also killed or captured the bad guys that they found, and ran the rest of them out of Sadr City. But they didn't have the resources to hold Sadr City. 
   This plan is to clear, hold, and rehabilitate. That's the plan that General Petraeus talked to the Senate about. That's the plan he has, as I understand it.  
   And the Iraqis will set up like stations in the various neighborhoods to do the clear with our help; they will do the hold with our help; and then teams will come in from the Army and the Marine Corps and like from the State Department to do the rehabilitation of the area and give them services they practically haven't had under Saddam Hussein, and some have never had in their lifetime. 
   This is a plan that I think we owe to our soldiers and their sacrifice, to give them a chance to get done. I am heartsick that we have a plan that is supposed to be funding these troops to get this job done that is coming to the floor of the House, and it has provisions in that plan which it looks like to me are saying we don't think you can succeed. Therefore, we are setting up kind of a track to get you out because by a vote for the bill in its present state, we are saying to our soldiers overseas, we don't think you can get the job done and so here is how we are going to get you out, and here is the drop-dead date, August of next year, when you are getting out, like it or not. 
   You mentioned General PELOSI micromanaging. I have real problems with this bill, and I hope every Member of Congress will look at this bill and look at it in terms of human beings, i.e. our soldiers. It has a provision, and it has a provision which says no unit can go to the fight unless they are certified by someone, that they are fully trained, fully equipped before they are allowed to go. And if they cannot meet that certification on their demarcation date they will be by this bill defunded because they are not certified to go to the fight. 
   Meanwhile, there are troops in Iraq who are expecting to have a replacement coming in. They have been there for a year. But what does this bill say about those troops in Iraq? In this case, the 1st Cavalry Division from Fort Hood, Texas, next fall under this bill, once they reach 365 days in theater, this bill defunds those soldiers. 
   Now, if we fail to certify their replacements and we have defunded the soldiers and now you have a 1st Cavalry Division soldier who is short on gasoline and ammunition in the war, is that where we want that soldier to be? Is that caring for the American troops? And all of this is being managed from here, not from the generals that are in the fight? 
   I think it is a tragedy that we would even consider doing something like this, thinking we as a body have the military knowledge, superior to the people we just, by the example you gave, by a unanimous vote of the Senate hired a man to do the job.

   Mr. CARTER. You go ahead. I have been there three times, and let me tell you, I like the professional soldier and the job he is doing. 
   Another interesting thing that is not being said that you need to know, and I think it is important and if you talk to the soldiers you will learn this, in the Anbar Province where the marines are operating with some of the airborne folks, and that is where the marines asked for 4,000 more troops to help them, for the first time we have had a change of support from the populace in Anbar Province. Al Qaeda is there. That is where our enemy that blew up our country, that is where they are. The marines are hunting them down, capturing or killing them. They are saying give us 4,000 more, and we will get this job done. Why is that? Because the sheiks are now cooperating. They are now saying to the marines, we will tell you where these guys are.

   Mr. CARTER. I think that is a very good point. I also think it is a very good point to note that we are talking about, we need to get back to what we set out to do here in Congress with this supplemental bill. I mean, what did the President and the generals who are in charge of this fight ask us to do as a Congress? Did they ask us to load up a bill with pork so that folks back home would have all kinds of pork projects? No. They asked us to give them what it takes for them to do their job. They did not ask us to run the war. They asked us to help them do their job. 
   People love to quote generals around here, and, in fact, today I have heard twice quoted generals. Of course, these were all generals that are no longer in the fight, but they quote them, and they are certainly valid sources, and I do not criticize the opinions of those generals. They love to quote them. But I do not hear anybody quoting the opinions of the generals that are in the fight today, and yet they are giving us their opinions. 
   One of the things that some folks back home ask me, and I think this is a valid thing to pass on to everyone here in the House and to whoever may be listening, General Petraeus was asked about an exit strategy from Iraq. He said, let us get this deal to work because we think we have the right formula to make it work, and as we stand up the Iraqi troops and they show what they are showing us in preliminaries right now that they are now ready to participate, as we have these successes, we can start drawing down the troops. 
   So he told an exit strategy. How many of us have heard that in the media? All we hear is we are going to war, it is never ending, and there is no exit strategy, and the man that we just elected or voted for in the Senate  unanimously to be in charge has told us, this is not a never-ending situation. It is all about standing up the Iraqis and standing down the Americans, and we can get there if we do this thing well. 
   This man is considered by everyone in the military as the counterinsurgency expert of the Army. That is why we have got him over there. 
   So let us get back to what we are doing here. American soldiers, one of the things that just amazes me what the soldiers and marines do, they strap on between 80 and 100 pounds of stuff, sometimes more than that, and they go out in 140-degree temperature in metal vehicles and fight for the freedom of those people in Iraq. But this Congress and this bill wants to load on their shoulders an additional $24 billion worth of pork, and it is a shame. 
   And why does this bill have this pork in it? What I mean by pork is things that have nothing to do with what we were asked to do, which is help our soldiers do their duty.

This is like the Federal Government, and now they have got a shortfall, which that is not kind of hard to figure out if you calculate it, what it costs to take care of the kids, and then you added all their extended family to the program, yes, they will have a shortfall.

   Mr. CARTER. We are sitting here with a concern that goes back 1,000 years between the Sunnis and the Shiites. That is why people talk about civil war. 
   Now, has anybody read what has been put in the Middle Eastern newspapers about if the Americans pull out, and it blows up in Iraq, the countries that will come to the aid of these two groups? The Iranians have said, we are not going to let Shiites be put down, we will come to their aid. The Saudis have said, we are not going to have genocide for the Sunnis who are the minority party, we will come to the Sunnis' aid. 
   I think Americans know that if you take Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia, that is the basic oil production region of the entire Middle East who could become involved in a region-wide conflict because of America's early pullout, as recommended by Speaker Pelosi. Then  you know how upset folks got about $4-a-gallon gasoline? So what happens when over two-thirds of the world's supply is involved in a civil war or region-wide war in the Middle East if you don't care about doing the right thing? We certainly know people care about having $10-a-gallon gasoline. It's kind of a sad, tragic thing to argue. 
   But let's get realistic about this. If we get stability in Iraq where there is not going to be this threat of genocide, if we can get there by them turning to their government for assistance rather than to militia and terrorists, that is our goal. If we get there, we keep a stable region, and America is affected by having stability in that region.

   Let's get back to why we are here. We are here to give our troops the tools they need, the weapons they need, and the fuel they need to continue this fight and to see if this new direction will bring victory for a bunch of folks that deserve a victory.

   Mr. CARTER. I agree with you wholeheartedly. That is our issue here tonight. I agree with you. They worked hard to put a lot of the needs in here. Let's not say that these other things that have been, in my opinion, wrongly added to this bill in the way of pork, those things are still very important to this country. Many of those things are important to my district, but I would tell my folks back home, as important as some of those things are, our kids have enough to carry on their shoulders in Iraq without carrying the burden of these projects which can be dealt with in the regular appropriations process which is still to come, and the regular budget process which is still to come. 
   You know what? If passing legislation, if there were a drop-dead date we were told, we would be voting on this bill today. So if we were going to be having a drop-dead event in world politics today, it would drop dead today, because we didn't pass what we were promised we were going to pass today. 
   To put a time limit, to do it by the 1st of July or everybody comes home, when we are talking to them, that's the voice of a legislative body talking to another legislative body. And they know they can't meet deadlines in their Congress. We can't meet absolute deadlines in our Congress. Things happen. This is what's wrong with micromanaging from 6,000 miles away.

   Mr. CARTER. I thank the gentleman for letting us have this discussion tonight and allowing us to participate in this discussion. It has been a good one. I hope that the folks that are looking at this bill very hard and trying to decide how they will vote, I hope that they will vote to give our American soldiers all the resources they need, and give the trained professionals the opportunity to direct the fight, not certain Members of the United States Congress. And if that happens, I believe that we are on the road to success. 
   But we will have to have oversight, and we will have to watch it closely, and I for one am in favor of that, because what I care most about is the lives of those soldiers that I get to say good-bye to and welcome back home on the planes in Texas. And they matter to us in Texas, they matter to us in the United States. And we are proud of them, and we owe them everything we can to keep them alive, healthy, and successful. And I thank you for allowing me to participate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I thank my good friend from Virginia (Mr. Forbes) for yielding to me. 
   I've been very, very impressed with the folks that have gathered here today to tell us about the religious history of the United States of America. It is so important that Americans and Members of this House remember the history of this country and how important the Christian religion has been to the history of the United States of America, and what an important part of the very basis of our society it is. 
   But I think it's important, too, for the people of this House and for the men and women back home to know that this religious history continues in the House of Representatives of the United States of America. 
   The first day I walked through the door of this beloved building, the Capitol of the United States, the first time my old Texas boots set foot inside this building, I was approached by a man who said, ``I think you're Carter from Texas, right? You just got elected.'' I said, ``Yes, sir.'' He said, ``Well, my name's Ron from Kansas.'' He said, ``I saw by your Web site that you proclaim yourself to be a Christian. I want to invite you to a gathering of men and women that get together and study the Bible and pray together for this country, and we're meeting tomorrow morning. Would you join us?'' 
   Recognizing who Jim Ryun was, the famous miler from Kansas, I was flattered by the invitation, and I actually got there an hour early for the event and sat outside in the halls before the rest of them showed up. But I can tell you that that has been a major part of my life for the 6 years I've been in Congress because of the fellowship of those men and women who gathered that day in various numbers. Bipartisan is part of the deal, and we will sit and talk, visit, pray and discuss the Bible, and it revitalizes my life every day and every week. 
   And I have a friend back home who is in the radio business, and I call him from time to time. He always signs off with me by saying, ``Be sure and do the Lord's work in the devil's city.'' It's a joke and we laugh about it, but the reality is that there are people who think of that, of this city as the devil's city, and I'm here to tell him that the Lord is alive and well. The Lord Jesus Christ reigns in the capital city of the United States of America. 
   They need to hear that that is part of the present history of the United States, and there are men and women who gather almost every day as people of faith and pray for this great Nation. 
   The little group that we're a part of, we formed up the National Prayer Caucus. That National Prayer Caucus is catching on around the country, and people are gathering and praying for the United States of America. I would hope that every Member of this Congress and every American citizen would take to their knees and pray for the future of our country and for the salvation of America. 
   That is what we need. That is what saves our Nation and that's what's here. The history is not only the history of the past, which is glorious; it is the history of the present, and the present is full of grace and peace and love of Jesus Christ in this building and around this town, and I want everybody to know it. It's part of our Nation today, just as it was at its founding and throughout its history. 
   So it's wonderful that I may stand and rise in support this week where we acknowledge the history, the religious history of our Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARTER. (REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. That is correct. And I thank the gentleman for yielding. As it turns out, we have got a whole room full of folks here that want to address this issue. But we talked earlier between you and our neighbor from New Mexico, and we have each been three times. 
   But let me point out that as Congressman Pearce pointed out, the men and women that are in Iraq today, most of them are on their fourth rotation over there. Many of those people have been there four times, four times for a year, sometimes, or better, each time they've been. When we go, we are very blessed to be able to go over there, but generally time is very short and if we spend 3 or 4 days in country, we have been there a long time. These soldiers have gone over there voluntarily. 
   You know, one of the things that I think is a misconception that seems to be played out both in our coverage in the media and in the comments that we hear from our colleagues across the aisle is that they think that we are dealing with people who are being forced to go over there. These people volunteered. These men and women are true American heroes, and they know what their mission is, and they will tell you they know they are accomplishing that mission. They wonder why what they are accomplishing is not what they are viewing on American television. They wonder that a lot, and they say that to you a lot when you go over there to visit them. 
   And so it has been said here tonight already, but I think it is very important that the American people think about this. The Democratic Party in this House and in the Senate is in the majority. They have a responsibility now to govern this Nation. They ran on a campaign that promised what they were going to do when they got here to govern this Nation. And as we heard in the early hour, we do have three distinctive parts of the government. The President is one, but this is a coequal branch of government with the authority to take charge and be responsible for what you promise. And if it means to the American people what they think it means to the American people, that we have to get out immediately of Iraq, they have the authority and the ability to vote to bring our troops home. 
   But you see, it is easy to talk about wanting the responsibility, but taking the responsibility becomes very difficult. In fact, the real story of this debate that we are having on what should happen is they don't want to take the responsibility because they really, I would hope, in their heart of hearts, realize that the consequences are dramatic. 
   My friend Congressman Pearce mentioned to you, and I think it is everybody's opinion that looks at that map of Iraq, that should the American troops strike their colors and march home tomorrow, that the southern part of Iraq falls almost immediately into the hands of the Iranians, because they fought a whole war over that issue; and only because the Iraqis stood up their Armed Forces and fought to a standstill that the Iranians didn't take those southern oil fields. But the Iraqi Army, which we are in the process of building up, would not be able to do that in today's life. They are too busy straightening out their own country. 
   We hear so much about the American soldier. And God bless the American soldier. The American troops are doing an outstanding job, but so are the Iraqi troops. And that is the news item that is not out there these days. The Iraqi troops are dying actually at much greater numbers than the American troops, side by side with the American soldier, learning as they go how to fight the kind of war that professional soldiers fight. And they are doing a good job. And we have to give them the opportunity to finish the job and stand up their military and stand up their police force. 
   And that is what our soldiers tell us when they go over there, and they tell  us that from the corporal or the private all the way up to the four-star general. 
   And the surge has a purpose. It is more than just feeding in troops. It is clearing a neighborhood, and then having the Iraqi troops, along with Americans, to hold those neighborhoods until we are able to get this thing done.     
   And you know, al-Anbar Province, when I was over there the second time, that was the Wild West. That was the worst province in Iraq, al-Anbar Province. Now the Marines report to us on a daily basis that because the sheiks who are the tribal leaders of that area, and particularly one sheik who's got the vast majority of the tribes in that area, have joined the fight, told their people, when you shoot at an American, you shoot at one of us; join us in getting rid of this al-Qaeda that's trying to come in here and turn all sides against each other to create turmoil in our country. And we are having outstanding success in that area, because the indigenous population is joining in the fight. 
   When an Iraqi hears a pounding on his door and calls the local policeman, this war is won. But they have lived for a long time under a dictatorship where the local policeman was the bad guy. We have changed that. 
   Ask a soldier, what was your mission, and he will tell you, sir, we've accomplished a whole lot of our mission. Our first mission was to go in and take out Saddam Hussein, and, sir, we did that. And I'm proud to say that the 4th Infantry Division from Fort Hood, Texas, which is in my district, pulled that tyrant out of that hole and started him in a lawful judicial process established by a government that the 1st Cavalry Division, which is also from my district, helped to defend as they voted, and in a properly impaneled judicial process we took care of Saddam Hussein. That's part of our mission. Mission accomplished. 
   The second mission was to help rebuild the Iraqi people. And if you look at that map at the number of projects that we're working on currently, and then you have a young soldier say, you know, sir, they reported last week that they killed an American soldier, what they didn't report is that we got water for the first time almost in the history of this country to a village of 400 people that never had water, because that's not a big fancy news item for The New York Times and the Washington Post. But that is a very, very important news item for the 300 people who had to pack their water in small jugs to have drinking water, that we got water, drinkable water, usable water to those people in the desert community. This is the kind of thing that changes the future of Iraq. If we pull out of Iraq, we create disaster. 
   Now, as I pointed out, the Democrats have an opportunity to do what they promised everybody to do and stop this war, but they don't have the will, and they don't have the courage to be responsible for their actions. So instead, they have prevented necessary supplies to keep our men and women in combat safe now, for 100 and what days?

   Mr. CARTER. For 108 days. 
   I got a phone call last night from Fort Hood, actually from a newspaper in Fort Hood, asking about the fact they a bad rain out on Nolan Creek, and some people got stranded out there. And, of course, when you are next to the largest military facility on Earth, the helicopters went out and started pulling people off of the roofs. 
   And this reporter called and was worried that she had heard that maybe the resources were not as available as they had been before or wouldn't be as available because there were cuts going on on the post. We had already checked that out with Fort Hood, and that actually was not true of this event. 
   But I told her, you know, you are from a military community, so we who have a military community know what happens when the Congress doesn't do its duty to the military when they have troops in harm's way, like in Iraq and in Afghanistan. 
   The Army doesn't leave, or the military doesn't leave their soldiers without the gear. What they do is tighten their belt back home. And that's happening now, and it's going to get worse and worse as this delay continues over and over. 
   It means training missions could be in jeopardy. It clearly means that operations on these large military posts around our country have to be reduced. Expenses have to be cut so that we keep the people in harm's way supplied, because we don't leave our dead or wounded on the battlefield, and we certainly don't leave our fighting soldiers on the battlefield without the equipment it takes to do the fight. 
   And so the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines and the Coast Guard will all be contributing from home to the war zone until this Congress does its duty. And I think it brings shame to know that those folks back home just came back from their fourth rotation, and their resources they are counting on for their year back home are being cut back. They're doing it willingly, but they are being cut back so they can supply their fellow men and women in arms over in Iraq, in Afghanistan. 
   This is a crisis that people don't realize the strain we're putting on our soldiers. And then to constantly tell them, like the leader, the Democrat leader in the Senate, this war is lost; and those soldiers are looking around and saying, what war is he talking about? Where's he see the loss? We haven't lost. We're winning this war. That's what the people who are there are saying. Give those folks a chance.

   Mr. CARTER. Hearing my colleague from New Mexico reminds me of another vote that was taken on the floor of this House that had to do with our intelligence for our United States military. And in the bill, the Democrat Party had diverted millions of dollars to take our Intelligence Community and have them study global warming. I have this vision of one of our spy satellites being relocated over the North Pole to check on the polar bears that was sitting over Baghdad checking on the terrorists. 
   I think the American people want our American soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and coastguardsmen to have on the ground intelligence, which they cut, and in-the-air intelligence, which they want to move to study global warming, so that we can make sure that our soldiers, our American citizens in harm's way, have the security of good intelligence. But there's a vote that we took. We tried to fix that, and that fix was voted down. And so now we have an intelligence bill that has a big chunk of it set aside for global warming. 
   Meanwhile, it was discovered when we had the debate that there are 13 agencies in this government studying global warming right now. And why does our Intelligence Community have to study global warming at this point in time when American soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and coastguardsmen are at war? That's a question that the American people ought to ask themselves.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I thank my friend from California for recognizing me on this very important issue to the people of the United States of America, the opening of our borders and the pouring in of somewhere between 12- to 20 million people who have broken the laws of the United States of America. 
   I want to talk a little tonight about what's going on in my district and what's going on in Texas and what's going on in the country. But, first, I would like to respond to some talk that took place in the last hour, just for a second. 
   When we talk about gasoline prices, you know, all this talk about gasoline prices, I saw in this last hour, they kept trying to say all this was President Bush's fault. The Democrats are in charge of Congress. They have told us tomorrow that they are an equal branch of government, and that they are, in fact, in charge of this Nation at this time, and they are responsible for these gas prices. It's time to be responsible to go along with your rights. The Democrat majority has something they can do about gas prices, but, of course, let's look at what they have done. 
   The first thing they did in Six for '06 was take away the incentives to encourage domestic drilling and, in fact, place a tax on gas production, and, thus, decrease the availability of American petroleum to replace our burden on foreign petroleum. They proposed a cut-and-run theory on dealing with the issue in Iraq, which, if we cut and run, would turn over the second largest oil reserve in the world to Islamic terrorists. 
   They propose now, out of the Senate, to open our borders to the illegal aliens that are already here and to put together a policy which would encourage more illegal aliens to come across our borders and consume 20 million people's worth of oil and gas in this country. These are the things that they are criticizing the Republican minority for causing the gas prices to go up? 
   But that all just gives you a picture of where we are going right now. Now the Democrats have come out of the Senate, remember, they are the majority in the Senate, too, and they have come out with a proposal to, they say, solve our immigration crisis. 
   I want to say, and I have told this to the White House, and I have told it to my colleagues here in Congress, and I tell them again, the American people want a solution to the illegal immigrant problem. That's where they see and know the crisis is, and they are saying you have the tools and have had the tools to do something about this problem for a long time, over 20 years, and nothing has been done. The American people see this as a crisis, and they are right. 
   You know, for 20 years I sat on the bench as a district judge in Texas. When people broke the law, the people of our country, in Williamson County, Texas, they wanted the laws enforced. They called upon our sheriffs and our law enforcement officers to enforce the law, and they called upon our courts and our juries to enforce the law. I am proud to say we did. 
   This issue is a law enforcement issue as much as any other issue. There are between 12- and 20 million people in this country, we are told by some, came here to start a new life. You don't start a new life by breaking the law, and the American people know that. The American people want something done about it. 
   The American people want us to defend our sovereign borders of the United States and to tell these people, you cannot break the laws of the United States and then expect to come into this country and get the benefits and the privileges of being a United States citizen. They are unhappy. 
   When the Senate bill was announced, I believe it was last Friday, before the end of the day and into Monday, we had over 1,000 phone calls, an estimation. I know we had over 400, I think it was, right here in D.C. Then our other two offices were overwhelmed with phone calls, all from citizens who we, you know, who are people of our community, who live and work in our community, and every one of them said this is an outrage. Do not support this concept of amnesty for people who have broken our laws. They have to be responsible for their own behavior. We raise our children to be responsible for their behavior, and we expect them to be. 
   We tell the American citizens, we set up a series of laws, we call it the rule of law. It is a basic principle of the Republic of the United States that the people respect the rule of law. Without it, democracy and the Republic cannot function. Yet we have proposed a bill that will waive the rule of law for up to 20 million or possibly more than 20 million people that are in this country illegally. 
   That's just not right, that's just basically old country boy not right to the folks back in Texas and to the folks, I believe, across this Nation. They get up  every day, and they abide by the laws of the United States. They pay their taxes. They do the right thing for the right reasons because that's what Americans do. That's the kind of people we want in the country, people who abide by the law. 
   To just say that it's a good way to start a new part of our population by letting them break the law to become part of our Nation, it just flies in the face of everything America thinks is right. We hear the argument, we are sure they are good people. I am sure they are good people. They are hard-working people. I have lived in Texas all my life, and I have seen this phenomena all my life. 
   These are hard-working people. I have visited with many of them in my limited Spanish and find them to be people looking for a job and who are hard-working. But it doesn't change the fact that they are starting their life in the United States of America illegally. This is wrong, and the American people know it's wrong.

   Mr. CARTER. Absolutely. And you hit on a very good point, and I thank the gentleman for yielding. The point that you hit on is that there are people that are trying to do it the right way, that have been waiting patiently to do this the right way in countries around this world; not just from our neighbors to the south, but all over this world that have waited patiently to get the opportunity to come to the United States, following the rules in the effort to go to work, enjoying the freedom of the world we live in, and ultimately by doing the right thing, the right way, hopefully become American citizens.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. And I thank the gentleman for yielding. And you mentioned that your wife came here as an immigrant, and my wife came here as an immigrant also. And I'd like to share just a little bit of our story because I think it gives us a good comparison to what's being proposed in the Senate today and what we used to operate under in this country when you do it right. 
   I am very blessed to the fact that my wife, Erica, fell in love with a law student from the University of Texas law school back in 1965. And I happen to humbly be that law student. And we married in 1968. 
   And to be very honest, I really never even thought about the fact that my wife might have to actually apply to come to the United States after she had married a red-blooded American. You know, I thought that was just the ticket, but quickly found out that wasn't the ticket. 
   We had to go down to the embassy, and we had to fill out all these papers. We had to have someone pledge $5,000 to ensure that she would have a sponsor who would take care of her when, if she was allowed to enter the United States and ultimately get a green card to be a resident alien of the United States. 
   She had to take a physical, and as she took a physical with several other women her age, one of whom looked very much like her, when they got the lung exams back, this is a personal  thing that happened to us, they came to us and said, I'm sorry, but our exam of your wife's X-Rays shows that she's got tuberculosis, and she may not enter the United States, which we were newly married. We hadn't even been married a month at that time, maybe a month and a half. We were crushed. And then the doctor came back and said, I'm sorry, we got the wrong X-Ray. This is something we will never forget. And unfortunately, that X-Ray was for another redheaded girl who was in the same physical group that had their physicals, and so I felt very sorry for her, who was also marrying an American, but she was not going to be allowed to come to the United States because she had tuberculosis. But, praise God, it wasn't my wife. 
   So we paid our fee. We took our physical examination, we had the background check which is required for all people coming into the United States, and then when we arrived in the United States, in those days every year you had to register with the Federal Government. Every person who was not a citizen but had a green card, between January 1 and January 31 you went down to the post office and you filled out a form every year and told the United States Government where you were if you were a green card holder in the United States. We don't have that provision anymore. It went away. 
   We did all those things. My wife learned American history. She learned the English language. In the meantime, she had three American children, but she still met all the qualifications that you had to have to get to be an American citizen. And in 1976, I was very proud to see my wife raise her right hand and take the oath of allegiance to the United States of America and become a United States citizen. And I am proud of her for many, many reasons, and that's one of them today. 
   That's how you do it to do it right, to do it legally, and to become part of what this mysterious wonder that is America. It's not to sneak across a border in the middle of the night and hide out as a lawbreaker to make money. That's not the way you're supposed to come into the United States of America. 
   And as you pointed out, we have a procedure where people legally come here by the millions, and we welcome them. 
   And let me point one more thing out, and then I'm going to yield back, and that is here about a month ago we had about, I don't know, looked like several hundred people walking around this building with T shirts on that said ``Legalize the Irish.'' And I stopped some of them in the elevator and said, what in the world does that mean? And they said, well, we're all here illegally, and we want to be made legal. 
   This is not an Hispanic issue. This is an issue for the people who came to Disneyland and never went home. This is the people from all over the world that have overstayed their visas and are staying in the United States, as well as those who come across our borders. They are just as big starting life as a lawbreaker as people who swam the Rio Grande or walked across the desert of Arizona or California or New Mexico in the middle of the night. This is something that is not the right way to become an American citizen, and we can do better than this, and we must. And I yield back.

   Mr. CARTER. And I thank the gentleman for yielding. There are a lot of interesting things in this bill that common sense tells you that nobody's thinking about this. I'll just give one example. They have told us that there are people that have been waiting legally, and they're going to make sure that these illegals will get behind those people, and it will take approximately 8 years to process these people. 
   Now, I just sat down and looked at it. If you take the people that are in the pipeline right now, and I don't remember the number, but it's a couple of million, I think, and we're going to process them over 8 years to get them processed in doing it the right way, these are people doing it the right way, and I can tell you this, I know this for a fact. The last time I checked, which was about 3 months ago, those people we were helping who were doing it  right processed their papers through the San Antonio office, which is where, our part of Texas, I live just north of Austin, San Antonio office, they were still working on 1999 and 2000. They may be up to halfway to 2001 right now. So they're 7 or 8 years behind. So they got the number right. 
   Now they're going to tell us that they're going to take 12 million and instantly process them for a Z visa. About 18 months they say it'll take. So that tells you right off that the standards have got to be different. They have to be different. 
   And I was asking questions of someone who seemed to have some knowledge of the bill, and he said, well, you take a full handprint, you run it through all the criminal records, and you find out whether they've got a criminal record. Well, if that's so easy, why is the number one answer that we get from the Immigration and Naturalization Service when we call them, why are we delayed, FBI's got to do background checks? These things are extensive. They take a long time. Wait a minute. Take a full handprint and run it through the records. That's what we're told we're going to for these Z visas. That's not enough for the legal people, but it seems to be enough for the illegal people. 
   How about the fact that we've got diseases south of our southern border which are incurable, like a strain of tuberculosis? Shouldn't everybody that's here have a medical check? Where is it? Is it going to be there? It doesn't sound like it is.

   Mr. CARTER. Not even mentioned. 
   So, you know, I think there was some good-hearted people tried, but they tried miserably on this bill. The American people want to take our time and do this right. And right now their concern, if you ask them, you don't hear them say, I want new immigration policy. You hear them say, I want the illegal immigration problem stopped, which means pour the resources to the border, pour the resources to law enforcement, enforce the laws that are on the books. And then when the American people say, you know what, we can trust our government again to enforce the law, that's when they will be willing to say, now let's work with coming up with alternatives to make this whole thing work. And we can do it right the next time. 
   This is the wrong bill, the wrong time and, as Ms. Foxx pointed out, shoved down our throat by the Democrat majority.

   Mr. CARTER. If the gentleman would yield, I am very honored to appear here with you, Mr. Chairman, with all the great work you are doing on the Immigration Caucus trying to come up with a solution to this illegal immigration in this country. I salute you and all of our colleagues who join you in this effort to come up with reasonable solutions for a very difficult problem. 
   I want to join you in saying to the world, we are asking the rule of law to prevail. It's very simple. This Nation was built on the rule of law. Let the rule of law prevail. And the rule of law does show compassion on the poor and the downtrodden, but it has to exist or they have no protection. And if we start to tear down the rule of law, it is going to be as harmful to those who are downtrodden and poor as it is to the richest man in the world because the rule of law is the basis of our Republic. 
   So I reach out to the Hispanic community who feels like this is targeted to them and say, no, it is targeted to all who come into our country illegally. I reach out to those friends back home that say be compassionate, and say to them we can be compassionate. Let's get law and order back in our land and then let's show compassion. But law and order must come first. It is what this country was built on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  
   First, I'd like to start out by saying that I do serve on the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. It's a deep honor for me to be there. It's a deep honor for me to work with Chairman Price, who is an honorable man and has done hard work on this bill. It's an honor for me to work with Ranking Member Rogers, who has done hard work on this bill. 
   And I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that there has been a lot of diligence on this bill, a lot of hard work on this bill, and in my opinion, every Member of this Congress probably has, as a first thought, what the Homeland Security Department does to protect our families from terrorists around the world and from other disasters that can strike our families. I can assure you that this subcommittee certainly does that. 
   This hard work being done does not mean that there aren't differences of opinion on how things should be done because, in fact, in our very subcommittee, and in the overall committee of the Appropriations Committee, there is a difference of opinion on directions that we should take. 
   Just, for example, on the issue of the border fence, there are those who think that the border fence needs to be built and it needs to be built now, and all obstructions have to be taken away from that that might obstruct building that fence. I happen to be one of those people, and yet, honorable men and women disagree. And those who are in the majority, they do set the policy for the bill that is before us today. 
   I personally think that it's our duty and responsibility as Members of Congress to debate the issues, whether you're on the Appropriations Committee or not, and by raising issues that are being raised on this side of the aisle on this bill, that we are saying that the Appropriations Committee has not done their job. We're saying we want to put a microscope, put sunshine on the process and see what we see, and then each Member, whether they be right on their amendment or whether they be wrong on their amendment, certainly has the responsibility to submit their opinion on this bill. 
   We talk about a term that I think that's kind of peculiar, and I certainly was not a Member of this Congress when whoever came up with the term ``earmark,'' but there's a whole lot of folks in the United States that know what an earmark is, and it doesn't have anything to do with what we're doing here in Congress today. 
   It has to do with a method of identifying livestock, and in old days and maybe in some more rustic scenes today, an earmark was actually the notch cut in the ear of an animal. Now, I'm sure that's offensive to many people, but today, it generally is a tattoo or a tag that designates what the owner intends to do with that animal. And at least in the ranching business, they go out and they mark those that are the keepers and the culls. There are the animals that they're going to keep in their breeding stock, and there are the culls which are the ones they're going to take to market and sell as one way the earmark functions. 
   And the owner of that livestock designates someone to make that designation of how they should earmark the livestock, and I assume that whoever came up with the term ``earmark'' as it relates to special projects in the appropriations process thought it was a good term because basically, that's the decisions that the owner, i.e., the voter, the American public, asks their individual representative to make about the spending on special projects that's going to be done by the United States Congress. 
   And so who is the designated person for the 31st Congressional District to make this decision? And I think the people elected me to do that. I think there are 435 individual people here that the folks who originally own this money and gave it to us to use, they said you make the decision on how this money is going to be spent. This is a republic, and we have sent our representative to speak on our behalf to say this is a project that has worth and this is a project that has no worth; this is a keeper and that is a cull. 
   And that is actually the duty and the responsibility by our oath of every person who sits in every chair of this House.

   Mr. CARTER. Mr. Chairman, the reason we are in this debate today, one of the reasons, is we have created a process where instead of 435 people will meet their constitutional obligation of their oath to determine how the earmarks will be spent, we have narrowed it down to one or whatever his designation may be, and I think that is inappropriate, although I will say and I wish to end by saying Mr. Obey is an honorable man, and I have the greatest respect for him. 
   But that's not the way we were supposed to act when we came to Congress. We were supposed to participate in this process of determining the earmarks.

   This has been a stimulating debate, and I want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for joining in this debate. Yesterday evening we were accused of delaying and taking up all of the time, and I think we have equally shared the time this morning, and I am very proud to have the help of the Democrats on the other side of the aisle in continuing this debate because I think it is important that we hear from all sides. In fact, that is what this is all about. 
   We keep talking about us, but I think that the Democratic Representatives on the other side of the aisle individually have the same right to see and debate these earmarks as the people on the Republican side of the aisle. I am not arguing this point only for Republicans. I believe that the individual Members who are elected by the people in their district to make sure they are on top of spending have the same right.

   Mr. CARTER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, this has been a wonderful debate. For about 30 years, I hung around courtrooms and watched lawyers talk to juries, and a lot of times lawyers use terminology that people didn't understand. 
   We just used a ton of terminology, and every once in a while pick up on one or two that I think that maybe newcomers to this House really don't understand, maybe someone else that might be in the House or listening to the House might not understand. I want to talk about some of those things. 
   First I would like to address, before I do that, I want to point out that we have done an awful lot of talk about history. You know, last year is history. 
   In fact, yesterday is history. Today is reality and tomorrow, who knows. 
   But there was just a tirade of numbers thrown out of Congresses just a few months ago. If you want to play that game, then let's take the 40 years prior to the Republicans coming into the majority of Congress and say, what about those 20 Congresses that had the opportunity to reform the appropriations process? 
   That's a ridiculous argument. That argument carries no water whatsoever. The reality of the problem that we are addressing on earmarks actually came to the forefront when the vast majority of the people that sit in these chairs, in both parties, were surprised by the activities of a few who violated their sacred trust to the United States Government. 
   We had an election where all of us got painted with the brush of that few. But the reality is, the vast majority of people on this side of the aisle, and I am sure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, were shocked to disbelief over some of the things that occurred with Members of the Congress, and are continuing to occur, to come to light. Recently, we had light spread on another shocking event that we have had here in Congress. 
   You know, the nature of democracy is that problems leap up in your face, and you react to those problems. We have had leap into our face that secretism when dealing with money causes people like Jack Abramoff to end up in prison, and those that may be associated possibly end up in prison. 
   If you look and study what happened, it's all secret things. That's the real offense we are talking about, when we say let's let daylight in on this earmark process. A term that we have used a lot is airdrop, but most people think airdrop, plane, parachute, that drops it in. 
   What we are really talking about is once a process goes through the House and the Senate, bills come to a conference committee, which is made up of representatives of both bodies. It is in a closed room behind closed doors where the bills are worked out to where they can get a compromise that both bodies can then vote on. 
   When we refer to airdrops, these are these expenditures and appropriation bills that when it comes back to this body, if we can dig through and find it, we go, where in the heck did that come from? We can't find any record anywhere of anybody talking about that in the Senate of the House. There it is. Where did that come from? So it's like it dropped out of thin air. 
   I think that's where the term ``airdrop'' gets its meaning. It's that when the Members of this body and the other body look at the final product and say where did that come from. 
   I think the proposal that's being made by the majority on their new earmark reform, by its very definition, creates a large body. We hear 31,000 possible ``where did that come from'' from for every Member of this body, except maybe one and some staffers who, some believe, are more competent than the Members of this body.

   Mr. CARTER. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased that I follow my colleagues that have worked in law enforcement, for I, too, have worked in the court systems of criminal justice. 
   This 287(g) program to me is an exciting idea that has great potential, and I would love to see it expanded to where we have trained every law enforcement officer in America in just the style that my colleague from Washington just described, so that they can not only honor the diversity as he described, but also can participate in enforcing the laws of the United States, where the resources required for interior enforcement of the immigration laws, the number is overwhelming. To me, it is a good use of resources to use good, honest law enforcement wherever it exists to enforce the laws of this land.     
   I thought about this the other night, because it's an experience that most everyone here probably, if they will confess, has had. If you live in Houston, Texas, where my colleague, Ms. Jackson-Lee, lives, or pick a town, it doesn't really matter, Washington, D.C., Cincinnati, Ohio, and you get a parking ticket, if you fail to pay that parking ticket, you're probably going to get a notice from the department that takes care of parking tickets, and they're going to send you that notice and tell you that you have failed to appear to answer to this parking ticket. 
   They're going to stick a fine on there to go with the parking ticket fine. It could be $100, it could be $50, whatever the jurisdiction chooses, and then that letter is going to say, if you don't pay these two offenses, then we're going to issue a warrant for your arrest on a parking ticket. 
   Believe me, it happens every day. Ask my daughter, okay? Now, they probably aren't going to get out and serve that warrant unless they do some mass roundup, but generally they don't do that. But you're driving down the street, if you get that ticket in Houston, Texas, and you happen to be in Dallas with a broken taillight, and a police officer stops you to tell you he wants to give you a warning about your broken taillight and he runs the national system of warrants that's available across this Nation. Guess what he finds? They have a warrant for your arrest for a parking ticket in Houston, Texas, and he will arrest you; and he will put you in jail or hold you until you deal with that ticket. 
   Now, that's what happens to every American citizen that follows the scenario that I just gave you, or could happen to them. 
   Now, 18 months ago, when I was meeting with ICE people, I asked them how many absconders we had from these folks that were catch-and-release that had been ordered to court and had failed to appear on the ICE warrants. I found the number was approximately 700,000 people. It's probably more now, because I'm talking about 18 months ago; that's the number they gave to me. 
   And I asked the ICE agents, are there warrants issued for their arrests? Are they in the system? And will local law enforcement respect those warrants? And I couldn't get an answer. I was privately told, ``No.''  
   Now, this program, with trained officers out on the street, at least we could pick up violators of the Federal law who had disrespected the court system created by this Federal law and had failed to appear in that court. At least we could pick them up in the manner we pick up people who get a parking ticket. 
   We have to be inventive in this problem that we are facing with massive violation of the law in the immigration system. And I think the 287(g) is the core, so that we train to find these people in prison. There were times when we were at the jail commission trying to close our county jail for overcrowdedness that the district judges would review it every Friday evening, and we would find that 30 percent of the inmates in our jail would be illegal aliens. Thirty percent. And sometimes higher. 
   Let's have trained people. Let's support this amendment. Let's have trained people and let the departments that want to participate put trained people on the street to deal with ICE issues.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I rise in support of the motion to instruct conferees. 
   I've been sitting here listening to what's been said here today and trying to figure this all out. I think everybody, I think the American people are trying to figure it all out. It's an interesting process to analyze how the Congress is working on this appropriation process. 
   But when you really look down as to what we're doing here, we're trying to solve three problems this week on this issue of appropriations. We've got three areas that we're going to look at. 
   We've got a problem that we want to resolve. We want to fund the Department of Defense and the job that they do defending our Nation, and we've got an appropriations bill that deals with that, deals with protecting our soldiers in the field, getting their mission done and all the things that go attached to the Department of Defense. 
   We've got a second issue we want to deal with. We want to take care of those veterans that have served us so well and so proudly over the years, make sure that we fund the programs that are necessary for them and to do the necessary military construction of the various bases around the world that is necessary to make sure we're providing for our active duty military what they need. We have those two bills that we've got to deal with this week.     
   We have a third bill, which is the Labor-HHS bill, that deals with issues of labor, health and human services. All those are important bills. Let's figure out how we can best get this done. The American people gave us a little survey this last week. They told us the one thing they are mad at us about is they say, why don't you just get something done? Why don't you get through the bull and get down to doing the job? That's their number one complaint. 
   Let's look at this. What's the best way to do this? We've got a Defense bill that there is really no obstacles for that anybody can find. Everybody is pretty much okay on that. We've got a MilCon-Veterans bill. In fact, we made an agreement when we had that little fight over earmarks that we would let those go without even discussing the earmarks, because they were going to go fast track through and be done very quickly. Nobody has got a complaint with that. 
   Then we have got one bill that a third branch of government has a serious complaint with and has the ability to actually veto. Let's see. Is it an efficient way to do our job this day, to take the two bills we can get done very simply and attach it to a bill that has a major roadblock on it? Is that doing our business efficiently? It seems to be not a good idea to me, but maybe it is. But why would we want to do that? We can pass two easily. The third, we're going to have a long discussion about and a fight and maybe a veto. We could get it done if we separated them apart, but we're putting them together. Why do we do that? Maybe it's because they've got people on their side of the aisle that won't vote for the Defense bill. There are 89 of them that said they won't. So maybe this would coerce them to do it. Or maybe they think they can roll over the President and the Republicans on the issue of spending. Who knows. But let's get down and do it efficiently and just deal with Labor-HHS today.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARTER. (CONDITIONS AT WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. Madam Speaker, I want to rise today before this House to talk about something that weighs on the conscience of every Member in this House, a news story that broke very recently that has upset us all, the conditions at Walter Reed Hospital. Many Members of Congress have gone out there and looked at these conditions, and we are shocked by them. 
   Every Member that I have spoken to is as concerned as I am. I am particularly concerned because I am from a district that I would argue has probably put more fighters in this war than any district in America, having Fort Hood, Texas, a two division post, the only two division post in the Army in my district. The 4th Infantry Division and the 1st Cavalry Division, along with the 3rd Corps, have deployed now to Iraq on three separate occasions each. The 3rd Corps and the 1st Cavalry are over there right now as we speak and the 4th Infantry Division is gearing back up to go back. 
   Our soldiers have given a lot of their blood, sweat and tears to this war. They believe in their mission and they go to their mission as heroes, as far as I am concerned. And to learn that someone, whoever they may be, from whatever post in America or around the world, would have substandard conditions at what is supposed to be one of the two or three premier medical facilities for our Army in the country, shocks me and concerns me. 
   I would think it concerns every Member of this Congress, whether they are for this war or whether they are against it. But for me in particular, having 50,000 soldiers that depend on me and other Members of this Congress to make sure that we have an adequate facility that gives the absolute best medical care that we can give, that we have that, is important. It is very important. It is actually lifesavingly critical. 
   Now, first, to get the right picture, I have been to Walter Reed. I have been there on multiple occasions. I have visited one patient as he cycled through there a 9-month period of time, maybe even longer than that. 
   I will tell you that the emergency care, the intensive care that was given in that unit, I can't say enough good about the doctors, the nurses, the orderlies and everyone who was doing the work there. I think that they gave outstanding service, the kind of service we would expect for our soldiers. 
   The trauma medicine that is developing and has developed in the military today, from a medical standpoint, and I am no doctor, but I have sat in a courtroom and heard an awful lot of medical testimony, the trauma treatment that we have for our soldiers today is, quite frankly, state-of-the-art in what they can do to save lives, and we, by the procedures we have set up for our soldiers, are saving a lot of lives. 
   But then we learn that people who are there as holdovers, who are at the recovery side of their phase through Walter Reed, are being housed in substandard housing, where there were rodents and infestations of insects, where there was black mold, which I happen to have personal firsthand experience with, having been moved out of my house for a little over a year because of stachybotrys, black mold, and having had my house totally wrecked to get that stuff out of it. I am very familiar with the health hazards that are claimed for that mold. 
   To know that soldiers who have given their hard work and suffered an injury of some sort on our behalf are being required to stay in substandard housing such as that, or substandard facilities such as that, it is appalling. Quite frankly, if it turns out that is what the black mold was that they found there, that has health implications that affects the breathing of every human being, and it is very critical that we be concerned with that. 
   So this is an issue where the light of day needs to shine on it, and we need to talk about it. I hope some of my colleagues will join us later here so we can discuss this matter, because I think it is important. I think it is important, and the American people expect, as I expect, that we will give the best quality health care from beginning to end for every soldier and veteran in the United States. 
   It is Congress' responsibility to ensure that these medical facilities are providing the best possible care. The buck stops here. We have that responsibility. 
   I think overall we are very proud of the medical care that is provided for our soldiers. But we can only hope to expend much more time and, if necessary, much more resources to make sure that what is going on at Walter Reed is corrected and that we look to see if there is anything we need to do at every hospital in America. 
   I want to applaud the Army for getting on this deal right away. They have dispatched officials to inspect the quality of care at 11 hospitals, and they are doing that this week and next. Of course, the President immediately acted and appointed Bob Dole and Donna Shalala to head a bipartisan commission to look into the solution to this problem. I think that is commendable, and I think that clearly shows how much the President and the White House care, as we care, about the health care of our soldiers. 
   Because I have a major hospital in my district, at Fort Hood, I went this weekend out to Carl Darnall Army Medical Center in my district. This wasn't my first trip there. I have been there on numerous occasions. This hospital serves approximately 50,000 active duty soldiers and airmen, approximately 56,000 family members, and over 40,000 retirees and surviving annuitants. This hospital, quite frankly, we have been working very diligently and we are very hopeful that we will expand Darnall so that it can be bigger and better. 
   I was not concerned from what I had seen on multiple visits in the past that we would find problems at Darnall. But it seemed like to me that in light of the fact that we had this issue at Walter Reed, which by my visits to the intensive care unit at Walter Reed, I 
   certainly did not see these conditions that are being described at Walter Reed, that I should make sure to talk to the folks, to go look at the hospital, to look at where we are housing our medical holdovers, and just see exactly what is going on at Darnall, too. 
   I am happy to report, Madam Speaker, quite frankly, I was very impressed. In fact, I went into the rooms where some of our holdover medical folks were. Most of them were Guardsmen. They are living in dormitory-like rooms, dormitory barrack rooms, two to a room, occasionally one to a room, the kind of room I checked my boys into when I checked them into Texas Tech University to go to college. They were the kind of room you would put your child in, you would be happy to put your teenager or young adult child in while they were going to school; clean, well-established, well-furnished, kitchenette-type rooms. 
   I visited some of the soldiers and asked them how things were working, were things working well there at Darnall. They were pleased. I went into more than one room and dropped in to visit with these folks. 
   I want to say in defense of the people in the Army Medical Corps, these folks do care about our soldiers. I don't  know what fell through the cracks out there at Walter Reed, and I am sure we are going to find out about that, but overall I cannot impress upon this body how much we have to respect these doctors and nurses and the time they are giving, because these folks are being deployed as well as serving our soldiers here. Many of them are being deployed to the two theaters of war today, working in theater hospitals that are part of the lifesaving process that we provide for soldiers today. 
   It is a tragedy when we talk about the number of soldiers that we have lost and airmen and, of course, Marines and sailors. It is a tragedy when we lose one, and it breaks the heart of every American to lose any soldier. But as we look at what the medical community has been able to accomplish in this war over previous wars, we have kept fatalities down because of doctors and nurses and administrators and the plans they have to get our soldiers to the doctor, to get help quickly. 
   The key is if they can get them off the battlefield and to a professional in 12 minutes, the vast majority of the time, no matter how serious the wound, we are able to save their lives. That is a track record that we don't have from previous wars. But it has been done by a combination of utilizing our medical facilities that all the branches of the service are involved in, and I have an example from back home that I will talk about sometime today to show how that works. 
   Also while I was there, I went and visited the Olin E. Teague Veterans Center in Temple, and I will tell you, you think about what you have heard about veterans hospitals in the past. Well, I am telling you, everything you have heard, you need to go visit Olin E. Teague Hospital in Temple, Texas. I promise you, you will be impressed with the quality of health care and the quality of that facility, which houses everything from our old soldiers in nursing care to intermediate holding care to hospital care for our veterans. I am telling you, it is state-of-the-art, first-class medical care that they are providing there. 
   Their new center, where they have about 400 men and women, it is better than what I live in here in Washington. It is a nice place. It looks like we have got a bunch of really happy veterans in that center. They have a lot of amenities. It is gloriously beautiful. I commend the foresight of those who preceded me to build that hospital up to the quality it is, and I feel very confident any inspections that take place there or at Darnall are going to come back with a very good report card. 
   But that doesn't get us away from the issue we have been talking about, the Walter Reed issue. These dedicated professionals can do just so much, and I will tell you when the Army was called upon to respond I think they responded very quickly. 
   I see I have been joined by my friend ROBIN HAYES.  
   I yield to ROBIN HAYES.

   Mr. CARTER. That is a great idea, wonderful idea. We introduced a bill last session, we are going to put it back in this session, that is going to encourage employers to hire the spouses of our soldiers. We give a tax break to employers who hire ex-cons. We ought to give a tax break to employers who hire the spouses of soldiers who have gone to war for us because that is the kind of caring we have got to do, caring about what happens to them when they get back but caring about the worries they carry as they go to battle. That is very popular among employers who are interested in doing that. 
   There are so many things, and what a great idea you have got, a job fair-type, national job fair promoted by the Congress for our wounded soldiers. That is a great idea.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARTER. (CONDITIONS AT WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. Thank you so much for being here tonight. Let me tell a story about an 82nd airborne soldier. This is an 82nd Airborne soldier from my hometown. My son and daughter-in-law are a high school teacher and coach, and they knew this young man; we knew his family. He, in the invasion of Baghdad, he charged out on a bridge in the open to pull one of the fallen, he was a medic in the paratroopers, 19-year-old medic, and he charged out on his bridge and pulled one of his fellow paratroopers to safety. In the process of going back for others, he received a round through his abdomen. 
   Now, I told this House earlier that this is a joint effort, and Alan Babin is a perfect example of the joint effort. He was immediately treated on the battlefield by a fellow medic, immediately evacuated and flown to the Navy ship offshore, I have forgotten the name of it now, to a mercy ship off the shore, where they treated him. From there he was flown by the Air Force, air evac medical team to Landstuhl in Germany, where he was stabilized and then he was flown to Walter Reed Hospital and had hundreds of surgeries, and for 7 months laid with an open, exposed abdominal cavity which had to be scrubbed clean every day. That boy would have died on any other battlefield, anywhere else in the world; but he was an American soldier, given American medical care. 
   Today, he is recovering. While in the process of being treated, Alan suffered a stroke. His wounds are healed now, and he is rehabilitating himself with help from the Army on the damage that he received from the stroke while being treated for his wound. 
   We expect all of us in Round Rock, Texas, Alan Babin, to be back and functioning and doing well and heal completely because his spirits are great and he is working hard like every soldier and every Airborne trooper would; and he is the pride of Round Rock, Texas. He won the Bronze Star with valor for his treatment of his fellow soldiers, fellow paratrooper. 
   Those stories, there are a million of them. We see them every day in Landstuhl. I wanted to tell that story, because I want the American people to know that is the kind of medical care that our medical doctors are giving. This week, when I was at Darnall Hospital in Fort Hood, they told me about the fact that we couldn't make it if it wasn't for the doctors who were willing to serve in the Reserve. 
   In this Reserve, we sent 11 doctors downrange to Iraq in our last deployment. Someone has to fill in for those 11 doctors back at Fort Hood. It is the Army Reserve doctors that come in there and do that and the Army Reserve nurses. I visited with a nurse, I believe, from Jamaica, New York, who was filling in as a Reserve nurse who had been called up, or maybe she was a National Guard nurse. 
   So not only are the heroes in the war but the heroes in the Reserve and the Guard, they are doing a great job. It is abominable that we had this condition at Walter Reed. We will address it, we will fix it, but let's not take away our doubt that these doctors and nurses and medical professionals are doing everything they can to make sure our soldiers are getting the best care they can. 
   My friend Mr. King, Steve King, has joined us. I want to recognize him and allow him to say a few things here.

   Mr. CARTER. I thank the gentleman for joining us here today. On that issue of electronic records, when I was at Darnall on Saturday, we were talking about them implementing the electronic recordkeeping. I said, well, now, I need to know, are the electronic records that you are working on here, are they interoperable with the VA's electronic records? They said, well, they are so far ahead of us, we will certainly work to have interoperability, but we are way behind the VA. 
   Most Americans wouldn't expect that to be heard. The VA is getting a reputation on their electronic records of having a state-of-the-art electronic records system. People are coming in from the private sector to look at what the VA has done. The Army is using it  as a model to bring Army electronic records up to par. It is important, it is one of the missions we need to have here in Congress to make sure we provide the support and the funds to make sure we have an electronic record system which will take our soldier and track him from the minute he raises his right hand to serve our Nation, until, at the point we all get there, he is buried in one of our veterans cemeteries, until we have accurate records for him that are electronic, easily found, so we can get him the care, he or she the care, that they need. 
   Madam Speaker, this is an issue that has concerned every American, Democrat and Republican, since it broke. We are all concerned. We all want the American people to know that whatever differences we may have on the issues concerning the war, this is an issue of the lives of the American soldier; and all Americans care for our American soldiers.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARTER. (ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) for yielding to me. And I appreciate him joining me in the previous hour in our discussion of Walter Reed and the health care for our soldiers and our veterans and how important that issue is. 
   But I guess, at least in the State of Texas, if what I hear in my town hall meetings is anything to be compared, I think the issue of what is happening on our borders and what we are going to do to resolve the issue of immigration is a topic that has never failed to come up, now, in the past 3 years at literally, every occasion at which I have held a town hall meeting; and I generally hold between 17 and 25 a year with the addition of the new tool of the telephone town hall. I held one of those less than 3 weeks ago for an hour and a half. 
   And once again, the people of Texas are concerned about the issue of the illegal aliens that have invaded our country. And they are concerned about who is coming, and what are they going to do, and what are we going to do to resolve this problem? 
   I have a Hispanic Council. The gentleman from Iowa knows that Texas is a State that you would put down as a Hispanic State. In fact, I believe we have now, over 50 percent of the people in Texas are Hispanic. The difference between Texas and some other parts of the world is we have lived with Hispanic neighbors all of our history. I mean, our culture is a kind of a combination of West and Mexican culture. It is the Southwest culture. It has a lot of the influence of Mexico in the Southwest culture. If you don't believe that, come on down to Austin; let me feed you the best Mexican food on Earth. 
   This is what is going on in Texas. We have lived with our neighbors like this all of our lives. When this issue cropped up I decided I wanted to form a Hispanic Council in my district. And we talk about issues, of course, immigration, the border, these are issues that are primary we discuss. But we made ourselves a promise that we were going to look at the world, all the world of litigation, legislation, and international relations, not just the immigration issue. But we always discuss the immigration issue. And at least my council, which has a membership of folks that are, some of them first generation American citizens, most of them second or third or fourth generation American citizens. All of Hispanic descent, most of whom are from Mexico, although there are some from other places. And we have a let your hair down, no holds barred discussion. And overall, my Hispanic community,  recognizes there is a problem and realizes we have to come up with a solution, and they are supportive of a solution that is within the law. 
   And I think that is important because, quite frankly, the reason we have a crisis, I would tell my colleague from Iowa, is because we haven't been enforcing the laws we have got and we haven't been enforcing them since 1986 when we cranked out the amnesty program under Ronald Reagan. The key to the Reagan amnesty program being a success was enforce the law. And administrations, Republican and Democrat, have not done it. I mean, those are the facts. 
   You know, one thing about history, it is history. You can try to write it a different way, but the reality of history is there is only one history and that is the truth of what happened. 
   And what happened was we didn't enforce the laws. And as a result, we went from a trickle across our southern border and our northern border to a six-lane highway bumper to bumper invasion. And that is what we have been facing now in the last 4 or 5 years. 
   I would say, I have met with the White House on numerous occasions and been a very big critic of making sure that we got border enforcement. I will say, we are doing better at the border. We are not there yet, but w 
   are doing substantially better. The numbers are down. The catch and release program and the ending of the catch and release program, although not 100 percent, but it is better than it was when it was 100 percent catch and release. We are detaining people. And there are those who want to stop us and there are those who call us inhumane. And, in fact, in my district, one of the real things that we desperately needed was a place to care for families that cross the border. And we had no facility that was family friendly. They built a family friendly, or remodeled a correctional institute to make a family friendly center to hold illegals with children, people who come in this country illegally with children. And it is in my district. It is 22 miles from my home in Taylor, Texas. That thing has come under fire from our neighbors to the south who are sort of San Francisco-like, we would call them, in their views and they have been picketing this facility and claiming it is inhumane. I was there when they started remodeling this facility. I was there two-thirds of the way through the remodel, and so I went back the last month, the last week we were there during the President's Week, and I toured that facility. 
   I have the expertise of having built two juvenile detention centers as a judge. I was the chairman of the Juvenile Board from its inception in Williamson County until I retired, so until I retired I was the only chairman the Juvenile Board ever had in Williamson County, now a county of about 300,000 people. And so I was in charge of the board that built our first William S. Lott Detention Center, back when we were a lot smaller county. We are probably the second fastest growing county in the Nation every year of the last 20 years. And so now we have built a much larger, 4 or 500-bed facility, the second one, the Williamson County Juvenile Detention Center. 
   So when I went into this controversial holding situation that we have got there in Taylor, I was looking for the kind of thing that we put our juvenile offenders into. And, you know, juvenile offenders are not, under the law, criminal offenders. It is a very special category of the world. And so I looked at the classrooms, which, quite frankly, were better than the classrooms that my son and my daughter-in-law teach in at Round Rock High School, and I am pretty proud of the classroom that they teach in at Round Rock High School. They were very well managed. The teachers were bilingual and very, very compassionate. 
   There was a glitch, bureaucratic glitch that caused some of them not to be taught long enough. But now they are meeting the Texas educational standards. They have recess, they have a playground, the rooms are decorated. They have done the best they can to make it juvenile friendly. And I figure if it is good enough for juveniles, it is certainly good enough for their parents. 
   But there is a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, and I am certain that our crisis is not over on that facility. But why did we have to build that facility? Because there were coyotes in Mexico who knew that if, for sure, if you were caught and you had a child in your possession, they had no place to house you, no matter where you came from. And 97 percent of the people in that Taylor facility are OTM, other than Mexicans. They knew if you had a kid they couldn't detain you. And so we had to have some way to detain. Those things are improvements. But that is the kind of, this is a very complicated situation. And you are right, it is not something that calls for a quick easy fix that suits certain people's political agenda. It needs to be analyzed and it needs to be done, I still say, as we secure the border and get the confidence of the American people that we care about what is going on, and we are getting there. We need to come up with a way to identify people so we know who has the right to work and who doesn't have the right to work in this country. Then our work program, with those who are here with no pathway to citizenship, in my opinion, and then a work program for those that want to come in legally to work in a legal system, work for a period of time and go back type of system, and finally rework our immigration and naturalization laws to where they work, they are workable. And at that point in time, if you have violated the law, and you want to go for citizenship, you reapply from the nation you come from and you get in line like everybody else with some kind of penalty for having broken our laws. That makes sense. That is not something we should throw in in a quick laundry basket full of clothes, everything mixed up, and it will all work it out. We will work it out later, because, my friend from Iowa, ask the people that are in the trenches that are dealing with this immigration problem at ICE and other places. They are overwhelmed now. If you throw the 7 to 20 million that are hiding out in this country back on their shoulders to deal with, what are they going to do if we don't think this out logically?     
   They are going to be more overwhelmed. And when a government system is overwhelmed, it just stops working. And that is what we are experiencing in the United States today. You can't blame these people. When they have got a pile of a thousand applications on their desk and you walk through the door with 10,000 more, they are going to say, I can't do the thousand, I sure as heck can't do the 10,000. 
   So I think it is really wonderful that the people in this Congress are willing to keep bringing this issue to the floor and reminding the American people that we care, because there are those of us who care very, very compassionately about this issue. We can do it and we can do it right. And when it is done right, justice will prevail. I have been in the justice business all of my life, and I have been in the justice business as a judge for almost 21 years. I believe that what we owe all people who reside in this country is justice. Justice occasionally requires responsibility for your actions, and these are the kind of things we need to think about as we address this problem.

   Mr. CARTER. If the gentleman would yield, I absolutely agree with that. And as law enforcement, we have learned how to cooperate over those jurisdictional boundaries. There is no reason in the world why we can't cooperate over jurisdictional boundaries with the Federal law enforcement officers, also. It can be done. We have done it in Texas, we have done it across the country. We can do it with the immigration issue. 
   And I do agree with you, also, that no one is talking about what do you do with the people who don't? That has to be addressed, also. If we are going to hold out a carrot of a work permit for people to come out and turn themselves in and report and file whatever pre-procedures this Congress establishes, we have to have a stick for those who don't; that if we don't, it won't work. 
   I am not for pounding anybody, don't misunderstand me. My whole point is the carrot and the stick policy is law enforcement, the way we do some things in law enforcement. And it is important that we have that. If you don't, there are going to be serious ramifications for not joining and trying to solve this problem. 
   And those people that are in this country illegally out there tonight, if they are listening, I hope they know that whatever this Congress does, and I am with you, as it works out this thing logically and putting a focus on each element as we move along, not a big trash basket, when we do, we put together a program, we expect you to participate. And if you don't participate, I think there should be serious consequences.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, first, I would like to thank Chairman Price and Ranking Member Rogers for the hard work that they have done on this Homeland Security bill. What we are trying to do is secure our Nation with our Homeland Security bill, and this goes a long way to doing that. But I have some concerns about this bill, and I have expressed them. 
   We have got to secure our Nation, and it is of primary importance to this country that we secure this Nation at every level. We have been working diligently and hard to do that. We have tried to use an open process in the Homeland Security Subcommittee, and that is, we lay all our cards on the table in our appropriations bill. We have historically let all the spending on homeland security be laid out before this House so that the daylight and reality of how we are spending the American people's money is in the bill. 
   I am concerned, and I wish to express the concern that in the appropriations process this year there is a lot that is going to be done in the dark. In this particular bill, it is a very small item as compared to what is coming down the road at us, but there is $16 million for bridges which we won't know exactly how that is going to be spent for this House to examine it, but it will be ``air dropped'' in in the conference committee. That is an indicator of what we are looking at as we deal with Member-initiated spending with the nickname of ``earmarks'' in the future. 
   At present, the plan is to set aside the money but not tell us how to spend it, and, oh, by the way vote for it. But I think in the last election the American people told us that they wanted sunlight on this process. They wanted to be able to see how we spend our money, including they wanted our names put on the things that were individually requested. In fact, the Republican House passed such a rule, to put the names on every earmark. 
   Yet we see in a very small part in this bill, and much expanded in the bills to follow, that there is going to be no sunshine on this process. In fact, it is going to be inside closed doors in the conference committee where there is really not a whole lot this House can do about it. 
   With increased nonemergency spending of $81.4 billion, these are issues that American people want to know about it. They want their elected Representatives to take a look at it and be able to figure out how the money is being spent. We debated this process the last session of Congress. We made it important to us as individual Members. We talked about it and discussed it and voted on it. 
   Now, all of a sudden, we have a process that has gone behind closed doors in secrecy, and as we vote these things  out, as Members of Congress we are voting a bill which has a fund set-aside which we are not told how that fund is going to be spent. We are told it could be published over the break. This is inexcusable.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I have absolutely the highest respect for the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey. He has worked very hard on this, along with Ranking Member Lewis, on the overall appropriations process. 
   The conversation he had with this House a few minutes ago concerns me in that I think Mr. King, what Mr. King has proposed, it is small but it is frugal. It is trying to set a tone. As our chairman points out, we have offered, there have been offered over 100 amendments to this bill. What does that tell us? That tells us there are people who are looking at this in detail and trying to see if we are doing things wisely. We are exposing this bill to scrutiny. 
   I think the message that we are trying to send to the Congress and to the process is that it is good to lay out before the world honestly how we spend our money. And, in turn, it is a way to show concern for a process that has been created by the chairman which will not disclose how we are going to spend special project money as we debate these bills. 
   Two of the previous speakers have raised this concern. Quite frankly, the chairman mentioned we are trying to shut down the House. Well, if examining the work of the House is shutting down the House, examining it in detail, then, yes, I guess we are trying to shut it down. But I don't think that is the way you shut it down. That is the way you open it up. You let sunlight come on the process and let everybody look at it and decide: Is it worth that extra $79,000 or not? That is what this process is all about. 
   But in the earmark process that is being proposed in appropriations this year, there is no sunlight upon that process. This process is in the dark. In fact, we are being asked over the next couple of weeks to vote on numerous bills that have billions of dollars set out in some sort of unidentified account that tells you we are going to spend this money, we will let you know how. 
   I am sure my beloved wife, whom I love dearly, would love to have that deal; and I am sure there are a lot of other people who would love to have that deal. Here is the pot of money; I will let you know how I am going to spend it later, but I am going to spend it. 
   In this particular process, it is going to be done behind a closed door. And behind that closed door, and the Members of Congress, who by the way in this Republic were sent here to do just what we are doing here today, examine this spending in detail, we were sent here to take a look at this spending on the earmark process. But we are being excluded. And if we have an objection that we think is offensive to America, we should be able to have a process to stop that. 
   But when you ``air drop,'' as has been described, secretly drop into a conference committee the earmark process determined by one or more small groups of people without the 435 Members of Congress looking at it, too, I don't think that is any sunlight at all. That seems to be a dark, dark room where legislation is taking place. And it will only be exposed when you get a ``take it or leave it'' proposition back on the floor of the House. Take it or leave it. You can't amend it; you can't deal with it. Take it or leave it. 
   Really, we are showing what it means to put sunlight on a procedure. We are going to try to continue to put sunlight on this procedure because the American people have raised the issue to us at the polling place that we spend too much money. So let's let them see how we spend it. 
   I commend those who have examined this bill in detail and are willing to come in and make such delicate surgical cuts so as to say, this guy doesn't deserve an extra $79,000. You know, that is the kind of thing that is going to save this Republic. If we can just get the earmark process to be done out in the open, in the sunlight for all of us to see, it would be a better process.

   Mr. CARTER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Well, we are right back doing what we said we were going to do because we think it's important. We are talking about cutting back the level of administrative costs that we had last year. And you know, for a whole year, almost 2 years, the now majority, then minority, told us what a lousy job the Department of Homeland Security was doing, and in some ways I agreed with them. Well, I don't give raises to people who do lousy jobs. I don't think that's the way you ought to do it. I don't think you just automatically get a raise in this world, that your department should automatically give an increase if you're not doing the job. And in some areas I think a message needs to be sent that you hold the line and do the job we paid you to do, and you will be doing what we want you to do, and then we will talk about what your needs are for the future. 
   But I think the present, going back to the 2007 budget numbers, is the proper thing to do. I support the gentlelady's amendment. It is about telling the American people that we are ready to tighten the belt and show fiscal responsibility. We are not willing to push spending levels so high, as this process is doing in the Democratic plan, to where, once again, if you look at their budget, and it has been talked about tonight over and over, if you look at it, it is an inevitable road to a massive tax increase, which, quite frankly, as my friend from New Mexico was saying, is not good for the United States. 
   So, once again, let's let the sunshine in. As the sun rises over the mountain, let it shine on this appropriation bill. And let this appropriation bill be open to all in the United States. And how do we do that? Well, one thing we've got to do is we've got to talk with the chairman; he has got to be convinced to put some light on the process of earmarks. 
   And I want to make something very clear, Mr. Chairman, nobody on this side of the aisle is fighting for their earmark. We are asking clearly, whatever the process may be, we want to be able to see it so we can do something about it. The American people told us, do something about earmarks. We wrote a law that would work, the Democrats agreed, and now all of a sudden the whole process is behind closed doors. And somebody, and I am not sure exactly yet who, will be behind those doors to make the decisions of how Member-initiated projects will be funded. 
   This debate is not about Member-initiated projects. The debate is about letting us see, while we still have a chance to do something about it, and don't airdrop this into committee where it can't be done. I don't think this is hard to figure out. I think this is an easy process, and that is a process that the chairman can work with us on and come up with a solution for. 
   It is important, Mr. Chairman, that we have sunshine upon the earmark process. And if we get that, I think we will have what the American people asked us for in the last election. It is very critical.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARTER. (ENERGY IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I thank the gentleman and my good friend for yielding and allowing me to talk on this. You know, having two Texans here, somebody is going to be saying, Well, there they are in Texas again, talking about energy. And we know something about it. But let me tell you about a couple of energy experts that I ran into when I held a little impromptu event of standing around a service station in my district and talking to the people at the pumps as they pulled up to buy gasoline and diesel. 
   The first memorable energy expert that I remember was a lady that pulled up there and she had a baby, I would say about 2 years old, and then she had probably the age 6, 7, 8-year-old girl in the car who looked like she was on her way to her ballet lesson. I said, I wanted to ask your opinion on gasoline prices. This lady started crying. She said, I am a single mom. I have got three kids, two of which I have to transport to everything that they go to. I don't want to deprive my children of anything that they can go to, like their ballet lessons or their ball games. But I just don't know how I am going to be able to feed my family and be able to take my kids around, with the price of gasoline. 
   That is an energy expert. This lady knows that the fact that we have failed in our energy policy in this country has caused her to have a harm imposed upon her family. There's not much you can say to that energy expert but I'm sorry, ma'am. We are trying. 
   Then we have another energy expert that pulled up there, and he had a plumbing truck. And he was a family plumbing business in Georgetown, Texas. I asked him how he felt about the energy business. He said, Well, I will tell you what, partner. The price of plumbing in this part of Texas is going up, and it's going up in a big way. Me and my boys are running four trucks. And he said, I am telling you, the cost of fuel going up is killing us,  and we are going to pass it on to our customers, and the price of plumbing is going up. And he says, You know the old joke about plumbers charging more than lawyers? Well, I guarantee it's going to be that way from now on. I laughed and said, Yes, sir. I hear what you're saying. He said, I hope you hear what I am saying. 
   I wanted to share that story with you because that story took place 2 1/2 years ago when gasoline hit $2.85 a gallon. That was that same 2 1/2 years ago when the Republicans were in the majority in the House of Representatives. When they took their shots, they were taking them at me, because the party that I belong to was the party in power and we were being heavily criticized for $2.85 a gallon gasoline. 
   Fortunately, that gasoline went down some and it lightened up after a point in time, but the criticism continued about the price of gasoline. And in the last election, we had promises that there was a plan to bring down the price of gasoline, absolutely commonsense plan to bring down the price of gasoline. Well, since that promise, I think gasoline has gone up $1.65 a gallon. At least when I was home this last week, gasoline in my part of Texas was $3.95 a gallon. I understand now it's over $4 a gallon. 
   I have to think back to that lady and those kids and that family plumber with his boys and their business and all those people who are having the services and are having the relationships with those people. Those were the kind of oil and gas and energy experts we ought to start listening to. 
   There is a commonsense solution to our energy problem. I want to tell you that at the time that I was talking about previously, then-Chairman Barton had presented an energy plan that was excellent; that sought energy from all sources, including renewables, but certainly looked at the oil and gas resources, coal resources, atomic energy resources that are available to this country. Yet, that bill was killed by the Democrats in the Senate and got nowhere. We are now sitting here looking at a worse situation than that by almost two. And we are not getting anything done. 
   As my colleague pointed out, while we are doing this, the Chinese Communists are drilling off the shores of Florida in Cuban waters. But we don't drill in those waters. Did you know that last year the oil and gas industry in the drilling process spilled one tablespoon of oil worldwide? One tablespoon. Yet, we are not willing to even take a look at seeking the resources that were there. 
   When I was a kid, I guess I was in high school, they had an article in the Houston paper where they talked about the dwindling resources in the oil and gas business. My father worked for an oil company. So I was concerned. And I asked him about it and he told me, son, there's shale oil in the Rocky Mountains but it's too expensive to go get. When the price is right, we will be able to harvest trillions of barrels of oil from the mountain regions of our country. That oil is still there and the price is available now to where it's worth going after. We should seek the resources that will bring down the price. The American-made power is what our American citizens are asking us for. They are begging us for it. 
   When you go home now, I guarantee you there's not a member of this House that if they went home and stayed home this last Memorial Day break, if they didn't have somebody ask them about the price of gasoline, they must have been deaf or slept through the whole period. Because they asked me at church, they asked me at the grocery store, they asked me at the service station, everybody that saw me, and they asked me everywhere I went, even at the hospital. 
   So, you know, when you're sitting there realizing that the American family is now suffering and looking down the road and saying there is no relief in sight, it's time for us to wake up America, wake up this Congress. Let's do that bipartisan work that so many people are bragging about right now. Let's do it, and let's do it now. 
   Let's do all the energy resources that are available to Americans. Let's don't be afraid of one or another industry. The American intelligence can make every one of these resources clean and available and nonpolluting to this country. We have proven it. Let's look off the coast of California and let's look off the coast of Florida and let's look in Alaska, let's go to known reserves, and let's take care of that lady and those three kids so that she has affordable gasoline so she can live her life in the kind of good, free manner that Americans and Texans want to live. 
   I thank Mr. Barton, my good friend, for allowing me to come here and talk about this. I am no energy expert. I just know that the American people are. And they want energy that provides the ability to drive their automobiles and heat their homes and light our world and give us the prosperity of industry that will keep us going. If we have that, we will have done our job, and this is our job today. 
   I thank you for yielding time.

To stand up and say this is a bipartisan bill when the first Republican saw it, I was present when it happened at 9:45 last night while we were speaking on the floor of the House, ought to make somebody's nose grow. 
   To call this a bipartisan bill is a sham, and we ought to call it what it is. This is a bill shoved down the throats of the American people, without the voice of the majority of the Members of this House having anything to do with this energy plan. 
   Look right here and see what it doesn't do: No real offshore exploration; no renewables without high taxes; no real oil shale drilling; off limits permanently, Arctic coastal plain; emissions-free nuclear, no; clean coal, coal-to-liquid, no; new refinery capacity, no. We got five of them out in Texas right now. No energy tax hike, no; no electricity spikes, no; lawsuit reform, no; playing politics with energy, yes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I have here a copy of three letters that I have received out of 500 letters I have received on this bill that we are addressing today, from my constituents in my district in central Texas. They are raising a lot of issues that they are very, very concerned about. 
   The trend of the letters is, we were promised a 50 percent reduction in interest rates for the money that we borrowed to go to school or that we are going to borrow to go to school and we are not getting that. The only subsidized loans for undergraduates fall in the category of this bill. They are concerned about that. They are unhappy and mad about that. 
   Then the cost of this bill comes out of the Federal Family Education Loan Program, those other loans that are not being addressed in this bill, to reduce the interest rate which was promised to the American people by the other party. This is a concern for people in my district because many of those people are going to school with the same financial burdens that they thought that were going to be addressed by the bill, that are not being  addressed; and the programs that they work through are going to bear the cost, which is going to make that market weaker and less available for those students who have to go to that market so they can go to school. Quite frankly, these letters are very concerned about that. 
   And then I have letters from people who work in the FFELP program, who are concerned about the fact that what this bill is going to do is put them out of work. Eight hundred people in my district work in the student loan program and have expressed a concern that this bill will put them out of work because it actually puts the burden of taking care of the subsidized undergraduate students on all the other Federal programs in fees and taxes that are added on. 
   So I have 500 letters in my office expressing concern, three of which I have with me. 
   When we tell the American people we are going to do something, we ought to do it. This bill would be much more acceptable, I think, to these people who have written me from my district if we were meeting the promise that was made to the American people, and, more importantly, to our college students, and addressed lowering interest rates for everyone. 
   So I rise today on behalf of the 500 letters that I have received in my office since this bill came on the radar screen, and I rise on behalf of those of us who wish we could have had some input into this bill so that possibly we could have addressed these issues and possibly we could have come up with better solutions that would not deprive others of the ability to go to school. 
   Finally, nothing is done here to address the real costs of education for our American students, which is also a promise broken. 
   So I rise here on behalf of the people of central Texas to express our concern about promises broken  
   I must oppose this legislation because of the negative effects this program will have on the Federal Family Education Loan Program, FFELP, program. The new taxes and fees imposed by this legislation will devastate the FFELP industry--an industry that has been proven successful by any imaginable measurement. FFELP makes higher education more affordable by using market forces to provide borrowers with the most competitive rates. FFELP also works with students to manage their debts, an effort that has led to record-low default rates. By attacking the FFELP industry, this language will cause decreases and lender competition and affect the ability of families to choose the lender that best suits their needs. I wholeheartedly support attempts to lower the costs of higher education, but the unspoken consequences of the bill will result in less competition and fewer options for these students. That is a consequence I cannot support.

   But now a good bill, and I am blessed to serve on that subcommittee, a good bill is now going to be loaded down with spending pork and we're going to ask our soldiers, once again, to lug extra weight on behalf of the American citizens, and that's just flat wrong. 
   We need to have a clean bill, by itself, so we can fund the veterans. We're already a month late on doing this process. It's time to get ready, do our job, have a clean, non-loaded-down veterans bill pass out of this House. It's important for our soldiers. They deserve this blessing.

   Mr. CARTER. I thank the chairman for recognizing me. I would also like to  thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey) my colleague, who has joined me as a cosponsor of this amendment. I am very pleased to thank the chairman of this subcommittee, who has done a wonderful job on this bill, and I am very honored to serve with him. I would also like to thank the ranking member, Mr. Rogers, for all the hard work has done on this bill. 
   We all agree, our southern borders are in crisis. We don't want to create any problems to get our fencing that's authorized and appropriated for. We don't want to have any interference. This amendment removes bureaucratic and environmental obstacles that restrict funding for the construction of the fence on our southern border. 
   This amendment strikes a number of restrictions on the border funding of fencing and tactical infrastructure, including various reporting requirements attached to funding restrictions, requirements that DHS must coordinate with Interior agencies to minimize the impact on wildlife and natural resources, requires DHS must formally consult with State and local communities and solicit their advice and support of the projects, ultimately giving them some sort of veto, and restricts the funding for the use of the Secretary's environmental waiver until the waiver has been published in the Federal Register for a period of 15 days. 
   Each one of these things has the potential to slow down or interfere with or stop the construction of the fence. Bureaucratic hurdles are not what we are looking for on the southern border. It's protection for our southern border. 
   To ask for advice and support gives local communities potential for a veto. Our border security shouldn't be held hostage to some group like that. We do consult with the landowners, over 400 have been consulted, one Governor has been consulted, 60 Governors' assistants have been consulted. A multitude of city and council officials have been consulted as border and fencing plans are developed. 
   We are doing the job. We don't want funding withheld. That's what this does. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Price).

   I agree that we should consult. I do not agree that they have to support it. And the question I would raise is, what happens if they don't? Do we then not build the fence that the Border Patrol in Laredo, Texas, told me they had to have to survive? So that's the secret word that I'm concerned about. 
   Consult, I'm all for. But if they vote 4-3 on the city council not to do it, then what happens to the funds? What happens to the fence? 
   On the issue of wildlife in Texas, we have wildlife-proof fences in south Texas on literally every ranch there because, quite frankly, the deer on those ranches are very expensive and they protect them. And already we are providing water gaps for those whose cattle graze in the Rio Grande.

   Mr. CARTER. Chairman Price, in Texas, it's my understanding that over 400 landowners have already been consulted. The Governor of the State has been consulted. Sixty of the Governors, Homeland Security advisers in our State and other States have been consulted. Thirty-five city mayors and county judges have been consulted. Twenty-eight local sheriffs have been consulted, and seven town hall-type meetings have been held to discuss the border. 
   We are a part of the country where private property borders Mexico from Brownsville all the way to El Paso. And so we are very, very aware of private property rights and the rights of our cities, and we are consulting with them. 
   My concern is the withholding, the stall or withholding of funds when the process is already in place. We've already been working with our landowners on wildlife. And the environmental concerns, should we hold back our homeland security because of a fear that trial lawyers are going to file frivolous lawsuits to try to stall this fence on environmental concerns? 
   I think we need to take a hard look at what our goal is. And, quite frankly, our goal is to secure the people of the United States along the border and protect our borders from incursions.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I thank my friend and colleague from North Carolina. 
   This is an interesting document that we have got here. I have got a copy, certainly a smaller version than is on the board there. These Top 100 broken promises, I thought it would just be interesting to just thumb through here and turn to a page and see if we can find one that we might find interesting. 
   I am just going to randomly look here. Let's see, energy policy, Energy Independence Day. 
   Promise: ``We will make this 4th of July Energy Independence Day.'' That's coming up next week, I believe. That's from Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi back on May 9, 2007, at a press conference. ``The House energy bill has evolved into a heated internecine battle'' that threatens to spoil Democrats' hope of passing an overall energy policy by July 4. ``Pelosi versus Dingell Heats Up.'' 
   ``Energy Tension Rises At Meeting,'' Roll Call, one of our newspapers here on the Hill, June 13, 2007. ``House Members will depart for the 4th of July district work period without passing independence energy legislation of any kind.'' That's a quick look through here. 
   Let's look over here at something else. ``Eliminate Reliance on Foreign Oil,'' promise: ``To free America from dependence on foreign oil, we will achieve energy independence for America by 2020 by eliminating reliance on oil from the Middle East and other unstable regions of the world.'' 
   ``Nancy Pelosi, A New Direction for America,'' her speech, page 6. ``During the first 6 months of the Democrat-  controlled Congress, no energy independence legislation has been passed by the House, much less sent to the President's desk. But 228 Democrats voted to impose more than $6.5 billion in new taxes on small and independent American energy producers, which will lead to less domestic supply, higher prices for consumers, and an increase in America's dependence on foreign sources.'' That's also from Roll Call. 
   Let's turn over here a couple of more pages and look at what we can find. 
   Probably one of the things that Americans worry about most is their security for their families and their that children. You know, we don't ever want the United States of America to have to suffer the kind of terrorist activity that our friends in Israel suffer where, when you send your kids to the park to play ball or just swing or just visit with their friends, there is some idiot that wants to blow you up and kill you. We don't want that in this country. Homeland Security is important. 
   The Democrats, when they ran the last election, they made promises that they would implement all of the 9/11 Commission report. That was kind of their campaign. 
   ``On the first day we control Congress, we will begin by passing all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations,'' that's what the then minority leader Nancy Pelosi promised in the last election cycle campaign. 
   Another part of that promise, ``House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says she plans to pass all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations within 100 legislative hours of a Democrat takeover of the House of Representatives.'' That comes from Congressional Quarterly. 
   But, now, I am afraid that promise got broken. Let's see what they actually did here. ``But the 9/11 package will not include a reorganization of congressional oversight of Homeland Security Department or an attempt to declassify the intelligence budget, despite the fact that those two were key recommendations. Although the Democrats pledged during the election to implement all of the Commission's unfulfilled recommendations, aides now concede that doing so will be harder than they thought,'' Congressional Daily, December 15, 2006. 
   ``Pass clean spending bills without Iraq policy changes. House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Ranking Member John Murtha, Democrat from Pennsylvania, told reporters last week that he would not use the spending bills to enact policy on Iraq, a war he strongly opposes.'' That's from Congressional Daily. 
   Then we have ``A Broken Promise.'' An editorial in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette accused Democrats of using the supplemental spending bill to author resolutions that would severely restrict supplies and reinforcements for American troops in harm's way and would tie the President's hands by imposing all kinds of conditions on his ability to reinforce the troops. It comes from the Arkansas Democrat Gazette editorial, February 21, 2006.

   Mr. CARTER. And I thank the gentlelady for yielding to me. 
   As you were reading those interesting broken promises, I was thumbing through here and saw my name in one of them so I thought I might read about it. Broken promise No. 43: Protect U.S. Borders. Promise: ``I believe there is virtually unanimous agreement in Congress that we must secure our borders and know who is entering our country.'' Then-House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, press release May 25, 2006. 
   Promise: ``Democrats are for the rule of law. We want to get the border security right. We would do what's necessary to protect our borders.'' Then House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, press release December 15, 2005. 
   Broken promise: ``Just 6 months after Democrats took power in the House, 114 House Democrats voted against a Republican proposal to provide the funds necessary for construction of at least two layers of reinforced fencing, the installation of additional physical barrier, roads, lighting cameras and sensors pursuant to section 102 (b)(1) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1986.'' This comes from the GOP Motion to Recommit, a rollcall vote, June 15, 2007. 
   Broken promise: ``218 Democrats voted against an amendment by Representative John Carter, Republican,  Texas to strike new bureaucratic hurdles in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill designed to undermine the Department's efforts to complete the construction of the fence along the border. As Brit Hume said recently on Fox News: `House Democrats added more than a dozen new rules the administration must meet before it can spend more money on the border fence.'

<DOCNO>Mr. CARTER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I spent many years of my life being a trial judge in the beloved State of Texas, and as we are trying to make these decisions here today, I think there is a good parallel to be struck between the decisions that this House is going to make and the decisions that a jury gets asked to be made in the courtroom. 
   The process always begins with pleadings, and I have here in my hand the pleadings of the majority party of the House of Representatives, pleading for relief from this body. 
   They begin by section 1, the Congress and the American people will continue to support and protect the members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving and have bravely served honorably in Iraq. 
   Well, they are not really pleading for any relief there. They are not actually  asking us for anything, other than stating this is what they stand for. So we have to kind of fall back on our experience and what we have experienced recently. 
   We have just experienced a continuing resolution, as they called it, which cut the military over $4 billion. But that is okay, it is going to be put back in the supplemental, we are told. Yet in the argument in this case, I have heard many folks that step up there and start talking about they are part of the Out of Iraq Caucus and they wish to defund to get the troops back home. So if they are going to defund, when are they going to put that money back? 
   They say they support our troops. They, this Congress, has elected by its vote, General Petraeus, an expert in counterinsurgency, to give us a plan. And he has. He has told us, I need more boots on the ground to back up the Iraqi troops as they go in and clean out these militias and give some stability to Baghdad. That is what he has asked us for. And he has also told us that this type of action by Congress will discourage his troops. 
   Secretary Gates has told us in his opinion this will encourage our enemies, just this statement, this kind of thing that we are doing here today. And yet we hear arguments that is just not true. 
   Yet I don't know, I have got a little note here that ABC News, certainly nobody's conservative press, reports that they talked to some Army sergeants in Ramadi. First Sergeant Louis Barnum says, ``It makes me sick. I was born and raised a Democrat. When I see that, it makes me sad.'' 
   Sergeant Brian Orzechowski says, ``I don't want to bad mouth the President at all. To me, it is treason.'' 
   Then in this morning's paper, in the Washington Times, Cal Thomas' column, Army Sergeant Daniel Dobson, 22, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, in his second tour in Iraq, says, ``The American military has shown a stone-cold professional veneer throughout the seething debate over Iraq. Beneath that veneer, however, is a fuming visceral hatred. We feel as though we have been betrayed by Congress.'' 
   So the evidence seems to be that this does seem to discourage our troops. 
   And how will it encourage our enemies? Let's think about that. If the majority gets its way and we pull out of Iraq, the enemy will be able to say, the jihadists of whatever faction they may be, will be able to say, ``We defeated the Russians in Afghanistan; we defeated the Shah and the United States of America in Iran; we have now defeated the United States of America and its coalition partners in Iraq.'' 
   Won't this make a great recruiting poster and slogan for those who seek further jihadists who wish to do us harm? 
   So although their pleadings don't call for anything other than a statement of what they stand for, the consequences may be dire. 
   Then we go on to see what also they are telling us that they want to do. They are just telling us that Congress disapproves of the decision of President George Bush, that President George Bush announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 22,000 additional United States troops in Iraq. 
   Okay. What does that tell us? That tells us they don't like what the President's decision was. That is what it tells us. Does it tell us why? Well, we have heard a lot of people tell us why. So I guess that is what we have to rely upon. Has it told us what alternative they feel like we are going to have? Does what they are asking us to do today give us an alternative? I find nothing else in this piece of paper that says that. I don't find any solution proposed. 
   So what should Americans expect from what is being asked for here today? I think they should expect discouraged troops. I think they should expect an encouraged enemy. But, more importantly, I think we as we make this decision should realize that what we may be doing is bringing this fight to the very people we are here to represent, so that when we stand in those metal detector lines at our malls we will know it all started with H. Con. Res. 63. Now we live in the unsafe world that the Israelis deal in every day. 
   Mr. Speaker, the relief sought here today is minimal, this action does nothing to help our troops or help our effort, and the only solution, if it goes bad, is prayer. We have a chance to have a solution here today, and I would submit that that solution is vote against House Concurrent Resolution 63.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about my friend, CHARLIE NORWOOD. I have prepared remarks, but I would really like to just relate like others have. 
   The first time I ran into CHARLIE I was a new freshman in this body. He sat behind me. And when you are brand new here, you are listening and you are trying to figure out what is going on. And when CHARLIE NORWOOD opened his mouth, he was saying things sometimes that others were not, and stood his ground to those things, even though they might be in conflict with both the other side and his party, both. CHARLIE had a way of standing up for his principles. 
   I also want to talk about Gloria, because Gloria took my wife under her wing and was kind to her. And I can tell you for this last year and a half, literally every week that I have served in this Congress, my wife has asked about CHARLIE's health because she fell in love with Gloria Norwood. 
   Everyone in this House sends out their hearts to Gloria at the loss of her beloved husband. We were proud to serve with him. He was a great American.  
   Today I rise to honor my friend and colleague Mr. CHARLIE NORWOOD from Northeastern Georgia who passed away yesterday morning. As a man of strong character and unwavering convictions, his passing is surely a saddening loss to the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the committee for all they have done on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution honoring the memory of United States Marine Corps Corporal Steven Patrick Gill of Round Rock, Texas. 
   In January of 2002, Steven Gill placed his college education on hold to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. The events of September 11 moved Steven to take up arms to defend his country. On July 21, 2005, he paid the ultimate sacrifice while deployed in Iraq doing that duty of defending his country. 
   Steven Gill was born on November 3, 1980, to Bill and Rose Gill of Houston, Texas. After moving to Round Rock, my hometown, in 1993, Steven attended Westwood High School. He was an active member of King of Kings Lutheran Church, and took part in numerous mission trips to help those in need. 
   After high school, Steven enrolled at Concordia Lutheran College in Austin, Texas, where he studied towards his goal of becoming a youth minister in the Lutheran Church. As it did for so many Americans, the tragic events of September 11 changed the course of Steven's life. 
   Upon completion of basic training, Steven received follow-up training to become an infantry marine rifleman at the School of Infantry, Camp Pendleton, California. He also attended Amphibious Reconnaissance School at Naval Amphibious Base, Norfolk, Virginia. On July 21, 2005, Steven was serving as a reconnaissance man with Echo Company, Third Reconnaissance Battalion, Regimental Combat Team 8, Second Marine Division in Zaidon, Iraq, when he was killed in action. 
   Steven served one tour in Iraq and was awarded a Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, Selected Marine Corps Reserve, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, two GWOT Service Medals, and an Armed Forces Reserve Medal. 
   Steven Gill gave his life so we can enjoy the freedoms that we have today in this great Nation. It is my honor as his Congressman and a resident of Round Rock, Texas, to honor the sacrifice of Steven Gill for his country here today and to honor his family who gave us their son. As Congress returns to work after honoring our Nation's war heroes, I am proud to offer this small tribute to one of those heroes from Texas.

   Last night I had the pleasure of visiting with some of my constituents back home, several hundred of them. And at this time of the year, Texans generally try to get their old folks and their kids out of the heat wherever they can. So historically Texans have loaded up in their pickups with their campers or their tents, and they have gone to visit our neighbors in New Mexico and Colorado to get a little bit  up in the mountains and get a little bit cooler so we can stay alive when this heat hits us. 
   But it's not happening in Texas today because, quite frankly, ordinary folks can't afford to load up their pickup, put gasoline in it, and drive the distance it takes to get to the mountains. And they're concerned about it, and they're worried about it. And they want to know if they are having to take the heat, why can't this House stand the heat and stay here until we have resolved this issue of offshore drilling and drilling in other parts of the country.

They told about families being slaughtered, being separated from their families, having to run and escape the guerrillas that came out of the woods. And they ran to escape, and then came back to find their families slaughtered, and so they joined a paramilitary group. And a question was asked, rather naively, I think, by us, you mean, you were carrying weapons? Absolutely. Every one of them, male and female, were carrying weapons. And now they are working in programs that are changing the culture of these people that joined the violent behavior. They have laid down their weapons. We asked them why. They said the comandantes said we have talked to the president, we lay down our weapons, and they did. 
   They are out studying. They're proud to say they're getting high school educations. They're proud to say they're going to trade schools. A few were proud to say they had received admission to university. These were jungle fighters just a short while ago, and now they are coming into society and working very hard because they see a future for Colombia.

   But I think Speaker Pelosi needs to release this and let us have a vote. That is the key thing. And you notice that letter you just read kept talking about national security. What we really have here, if you look at it closely, is a contest of two socialist--we used to call them Communist--a regime in Hugo Chavez, and we have Uribe who is trying to create a free democracy, and a free enterprise system. These are two, side-by-side competing systems that will influence that entire continent. 
   And that is why this is in our national security interest. It is not just a trade agreement which is going to benefit American workers. It is a security agreement that points to the direction that we stand up for what we believe in, democracy and free enterprise.

They want to tie the hands of our generals by setting a surrender date. The first surrender date, they said, is July 1 of this year. 
   We don't need 535 generals in Washington commanding our troops. We need the professionals. 
   It is past time for the Democrats to do the right thing and pass a bill which funds our troops in harm's way. Their final drop-dead date deadline that they have set is very interesting, April 1, 2008. April Fool's day. Who are they trying to fool?

When you point out that we are actually going to create a series of benefits for people who have committed felony crimes that are not available to the average American citizen, not even available to those people who stand in harm's way and stand on the wall to protect our Nation every night from harm, and yet they are going to be available to people who commit acts, felony acts, punishable by long terms in the penitentiary. 
   I want to get clear exactly this Second Chance Act and these benefits, almost entitlements that are being created by this bill, does that pertain to only people who are incarcerated in Federal penitentiaries or does it expand to the States and localities?

   Mr. CARTER. I think you will agree with me at least in the Texas prison system, an ambitious prisoner who is trying to turn his life around can get a bachelor's degree, can also get a master's degree, and I suppose if he stayed in prison long enough, he can get a doctor's degree. One school that has correspondence courses is the University of Maryland, which is not far from here, and a prisoner in the Texas prison system can get the degree of his choice if he is willing to work hard enough there. 
   I happen to know in the Texas prison system one of the most sought-after jobs, and I point out jobs where you work for the skill, is in the print shop with very high tech print training. And most of the people who finish that training, and I have actually had prisoners that I have sent to prison who have asked not to be paroled until they have completed their term of working in the print shop because after they have done their print apprenticeship, they could get jobs coming straight out of prison at $60,000 to $75,000 a year as a master printer. It is not like we are not offering an opportunity to work your way to success in prison today; would you agree with that?

So if I understand what you are talking about here, we have people in the United States today that work 10 or 12-hour days, some of them 6 days a week, and they are struggling to pay their own medical bills and pay for health care insurance. They are asking us, crying out to us for help on paying their medical bills. 
   So there is an easy solution to their problem. Under this bill, quickly get a handgun and commit a felony. You serve a little time, and you are back out with the ability to get grants to pay for your medical bills. 
   It reminds me of stories that we have heard and experienced of the guy who just before Christmas throws a brick through a window so he can spend a warm night and have Christmas dinner in the county jail. There are people who do that. You know that happens and I know that happens. But is that what we want? Are we saying that the good-heartedness of the American people, and I think there are good-hearted people that are behind thing.     
   I don't think they have thought it out, and I am not for punishing criminals. I'm for giving them a start, but what do we owe to the people who have violated the laws of our society? I think we owe them a fair chance, but I don't think we owe them an open-ended chance for the rest of perpetuity.

   Mr. CARTER. I want to expand a little bit on what my good friend from Tennessee was talking about. 
   I happen to be blessed to have Fort Hood, Texas, in my district, which is the only division 2 post in America. It is the largest gathering of military forces on Earth, and we have experienced already, since I have been in Congress, a delay on getting a supplemental to the post. 
   Now, I think the American people need to know, and I would hope my colleagues in Congress would know, that today, as we speak, there are between 4- and 5,000 American soldiers going door-to-door in Baghdad and looking for three soldiers. Why is that? Why that concentration of effort? 
   Because the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps and every one of our services, they value every human life that they have. They care about their soldiers, and they are showing it by 24/7 putting their lives on the line looking for these guys, because they know what happens to these prisoners, what has happened in the past, people who were castrated and skinned alive, and their throats cut, and left on the side of the road dead with bombs strapped to their bodies. So they care about those soldiers. 
   This issue goes right down to what happens at home, when the supplemental money that provides the bullets, ammunition, transportation, vehicles for our soldiers in harm's way, when this Congress fails to meet its obligation to those brave men and women. By passing a supplemental, what does the Army do? Do they let the guys in the war suffer the consequences? No. 
   What happens is they look into the pocketbooks back home, and they have to cut the soldiers that are back in Texas or back in Tennessee or back in one of the other fine States in this union, they have to reduce what they have available for training, for services on their post. 
   You know, last year, when we didn't get the supplemental done until August, I can tell you that the people of Killeen, where Fort Hood is located, the people on the post, were talking about will we have enough money to pay the bills, the kinds of bills that American citizens understand, light bills, water bills, service bills, cutting the grass. 
   Are we going to be able to provide that at this post because the money, first, goes to the war fighters. They don't leave American soldiers in harm's way. So they cut their own pocketbooks. 
   Are we going to be able to pay the people we have contracted with to provide services? These issues are facing our soldiers today, because of the 100-day delay in providing this supplemental for our soldiers. 
   So it's important to know that our Army will not leave those guys without the goods that they need, and they will cut whatever they have to at home much. 
   But what does that mean to the next round of people that may have to go back to that war or any war? Also, you have at risk the possibility of cutting the training budgets for these soldiers, and what makes the American fighting man so superior to anybody on Earth? He is the best-trained soldier that ever took to the field. But if you cut the training bills in order to provide bullets for the guys in harm's way, then the training has to sacrifice. We can't get to that point. It is critical that we get a supplement passed from the standpoint of the American soldier. 
   Finally, today, we heard all rhetoric on this great, by the way, great bill  that we just passed on defense authorization. We are providing funds for the soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, yes, in 2008. 
   But what are we going to do about it now? I think this is something that really has to be addressed because we are harming the best military on earth.

   Mr. CARTER. I agree completely with what my friend Judge GOHMERT had to say. You have given a very good history of what has been the history of the Democrat Party when they were in the majority or where they were in control of the White House. They have a history of cutting and providing less than the necessary supplies for our military. 
   In fact, one of the great brags that Al Gore used to say is that he reduced the number of employees in the Federal Government by this huge amount. But if you looked at where they came from, they were United States soldiers. Members of the military made up the vast majority of the numbers of reducing the size of government that were taken credit for during the Clinton administration. They cut our Army down from multidivisions, down to where it is now. 
   But you know what? That is all water under the bridge. You had mentioned something that is very important to me: We took an oath. 
   We took an oath, and our colleague from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) got asked a question by one of his folks back home: Why do you feel so that you are doing the right thing by providing for these guys that are fighting over in Iraq? 
   He said, You know, it is easy to criticize. But when you become responsible, then you have really got to look at it. And he said, I am by my oath responsible to the American public to provide for the common defense. 
   It as a perfect answer. That is exactly what we all did, Republican and Democrat, is we took an oath to be responsible to the American people to provide protection for those people. And some of these are hard calls and hard votes. These are not for me. These are not for me nor for anyone in this room. But it is a hard vote for some. So it is just sad. And sometimes we have just got to remember why we are here. 
   I would like to mention one more thing because I know our time is getting late. But we talked about this $392.5 billion tax increase that is coming down the road. Let me point out to folks that are paying gas prices. If you don't like $3 a gallon gasoline, which, by the way, there was supposed to be an instant solution for that problem when the new majority came into power, but we haven't seen it. In fact, it has only been made worse, in my opinion. 
   But take that, and I looked at that long list of what it means to everybody's district for this tax increase, and everybody gets--at least $2,000 it is going to cost the average family, At least $2,000. So take that money that you are putting aside to pay for that gas and subtract $2,000 a year from it. So the price of gas is going up. If nothing else, the price of gas is going up for the average American family by this tax increase, and it is something that will hurt our economy and turn us in the wrong direction. 
   I just wanted to mention that before we have to quit.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARTER. (AMERICAN ENERGY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I thank my friend Mr. Latta for yielding to me. Let me say that when the uprising started, I was one of the 10 that began the uprising. I was the fourth person to speak that day. In fact, I got to speak just after the microphones were turned off, just before the lights were turned down. And I'm very proud of the fact that the Republicans stayed in Washington and demanded that the voice be heard of the American people on the issue of energy. 
   And what we were really saying, we were calling for the Speaker to, Come back, come back, call the House back, let's work together, because we are in an energy crisis. Let's reason this out and come up with solutions that we can all live with that will allow us to prosper in this country. I think that is what this is all about. 
   So I got to thinking today if you look at the pie chart--and Mr. King from Iowa had a pie chart in here one day that showed what all our sources of energy are. I can't get the numbers exactly right. I can remember that the alternative energy today, that is wind, solar, and biofuels, is about 2 1/4 percent of our energy use in America. Right now. That is things we are looking at in the future and that is part of what the American energy act promotes, is research, development and working on those issues. But today it's about 2 percent. 
   And then the other sources of energy are gasoline and diesel to power our vehicles; natural gas, which we burn in industry and our homes; coal, which we burn in industry and our homes; oil, which we burn in industry and our homes, and a small portion we still use of hydroelectric power, which was one of the original sources of energy in colonial America. 
   And so what the proposal seems to be and the debate seems to be between our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats who are in charge of this Congress and have the power to make things happen in this Congress, I think that it's that debate we are talking about. It's those fuel sources that we are talking about. And nuclear energy, which make up right now I think it's around 18 percent of our power, but don't hold me to the numbers. But that whole chart makes 100 percent. But I do remember alternatives that today are a little over 2 percent. 
   The proposal we seem to be hearing is there's some things that now are bad. These are bad resources, even though the rest of the world, when they find natural gas off the coast of Brazil, they celebrate. When they drill a well off of--my wife is from Holland, and back in the sixties when they drilled a well in northern Holland and found this huge source of natural gas, they celebrated.     
   When people in Venezuela drill wells and find oil and natural gas, they celebrate, and yet we are ashamed of those resources. 
   Those resources are evil now, so we are basically starting to have a policy being proposed that says that there are some things that are just off limits for power right now because they are bad, and even though we don't have sense enough to know they are bad, we are going to get taught by the government that these are bad. And those things, by the way, most of them have to do with hydrocarbons, but we will start off with the one that doesn't, nuclear energy. 
   Now, we have heard arguments here tonight and examples were given here tonight of what other nations are doing in the way of nuclear energy. An example was given that the Chinese have on their drawing boards I believe it was 42 nuclear plants they are planning on building. And we are not planning to build, I don't think, any. Maybe there are a couple that are on the drawing board someplace, but we haven't built one in decades. Nuclear energy, our colleagues don't seem to want to open up nuclear energy, so it is sort of off limits. 
   Now we get off into the really evil stuff. Coal, terrible. You can't use coal. Oil, horrible. Horrible. As Speaker Pelosi said, we have got to wean ourselves off of hydrocarbons. And she said the solution is natural gas. I am sorry, but that is a hydrocarbon too. But still, let's throw natural gas in there. 
   Now, between coal, oil and natural gas, they probably make up about 75 or 80 percent of the fuel sources for industry and for transportation in America today. If those are off the table, let's just call it a small number, 60 percent, if 60 percent of what we are today using for power is off the table, then we have to replace it with something. 
   The proposals are solar, wind, biofuels, and new ideas we are going to come up with, like batteries and a lot of stuff, all of which is good and is in the American Energy Act. But today and tomorrow, and in fact for probably about 10 years, these things are not anywhere near the size and capacity to come even close to covering 60 percent of the power in this country. 
   So we are going to replace these oil, natural gas and coal resources with those power sources overnight, and we don't expect to stop right now on those things and not see prices go through the roof because of a supply shortage? 
   So what are we going to do for that supply shortage? Well, what we have been doing. We are going to buy from foreign countries, who are happy to have those products and happy to sell those products. But wait a minute. We just saw a comparison of the streets of Dubai. We don't have anything against Dubai. They are good friends of ours. But the change in that country between 1976 and today is like watching a miracle in the development of that country because of their intelligent use of the money that we are buying oil from them with and the rest of the world is. 
   So as we look down the pike, the corridors of time, if we make all these things off limits, then where are we going to go, except to foreign countries? And what we are talking about as part of our energy crisis is our dependence on foreign countries, whether they are friends or whether they be enemies. 
   So I think the average American back home in my district, when I talk to them, they all get it. They know that tomorrow, all this year for sure, and probably for at least the next 8 or  10 years, when they get up in the morning to go to work they are going to start a vehicle that is probably going to run on oil, an oil product or a natural gas product, gasoline or diesel. To say that we are going to keep this dependence going is insane in their opinion, and they want to know why we can't go after our own resources. 
   So why don't we put some things back on the table? Let's put American oil and gas back on the table by going to find it where we know that it is. Let's don't drill where it is not. If you want to lease property that has no oil and gas on it to drill on, you are welcome to lease my place. It is 2 acres right outside of Round Rock, and I guarantee you, you can put a drilling rig on it and it won't produce one drop of oil. But if you like drilling on places where there is no oil, I volunteer mine, and I will take the lease money. But that is ridiculous. 
   So when we hear proposals, why don't you drill where you have already got leases or where we have already offered leases, and our research tells us there are little or no resources there, why would we place millions and billions of dollars worth of drilling rigs on those sites to lose money? Why would anybody do that? So that doesn't make sense. 
   So let's go back. Let's start with the hard one, coal. But, you know what? We are learning very quickly how to clean up coal. We are learning how to liquefy coal and find new uses for coal. We are abundantly wealthy with coal. We shouldn't just put that off the table. And I am not from a big coal State, although question have got some coal. But the facts are we can't shove that resource off the table completely. 
   Oil, we know, as has been explained by Chairman Barton and others, there are at least 10 billion barrels of oil in the Arctic, up in ANWR, in an area which we intentionally set aside. There is abundant oil and gas resources off all the coasts of America. 
   Chairman Barton pointed out the reason they started looking at Alaska is because some whalers saw some oil seepage. Do you know that a place where there is oil seepage to this day is off the coast of California. In fact, those tar pits, that is just really, really thick crude at the top of the ground. But that is off limits. 
   Let's start being reasonable, taking care of the environment and drilling for these resources, producing them and putting them on the table. I for one am 100 percent in favor of Boone Pickens' proposal that we put natural gas in certain vehicles. It works. But he tells you 20 percent is the solution. 
   I think wind is a great idea, and it works. But it has got to be boosted to transport, and so we have to work on that. And still, with all the windmills we have got in production right now, we couldn't power Austin, Texas, for 2 days. 
   So, in order to meet our power needs, we have to be intelligent about what we are doing. As we reason with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, let's look at this picture and say reality says today, tomorrow and at least the next 10 to 20 years, we have to deal with what we have got. We can't hope that miraculously 2 percent of the power generated in America will instantly become 60 percent, just because we wish it to be. 
   I once asked a physicist from Austin, Texas, how big the solar panel would have to be to power Austin, Texas, for a day on the best day, that being a day in the spring when we don't need air conditioning and we don't need heat, and he said the size of the Texas panhandle. The size of the Texas panhandle is bigger than quite a few of the States in this country. So solar has its means, we will find a way for it, but today it is not going to even power Austin, Texas. 
   So as we look at this comprehensive energy that we have got to look at, if we are trying to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, let's wisely use the resources 
   we have. Let's protect our environment as we do this. Let's make these burns and new scientific methods. For instance, you can burn things in pure oxygen and have no air emissions. You can capture carbon dioxide and use it to replenish oil fields, to bring more oil to the surface. We can do a lot with science and technology available and all those things on the table to be learned. 
   The bill that the Republicans are putting forward calls for us to wisely use all available resources, researching and developing the new ideas, offering incentives for more new ideas, offering incentives for conserving energy and all the things we need and want to do to make this country competitive, so that Indianapolis, Indiana, will look like Dubai some day, and not like Dubai in 1976, as was described earlier in a presentation here. Our infrastructure needs resources. We need to start taking care of America. 
   By the way, these lost jobs that people move overseas, did you ever think the high cost of energy might have something to do with that too? 
   So let's start thinking about ourselves and let's reason this out together. We have 3 weeks to do it. Time is running out. Our friends are back from their vacations, our Democratic friends are back from their vacations. Let's put our heads together. Let's don't give us an energy policy that comes from one person from San Francisco. Give us a policy that we work out in a bipartisan fashion, and I believe we can do it in the next 3 weeks. 
   Thank you for allowing me to speak.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. Mr. Speaker, when you sit here and listen to what's been talked about, you wonder who's in charge of this House of Representatives. Well, the Democratic Party is in charge of this House of Representatives. They have the majority. 
   We have heard today that the Republicans blocked the Democrats' plan. How did that happen? Democrats have the majority. It must have been some of the folks on their side of the aisle thought their plan wasn't very good or else they would have passed their plan. They can pass anything they want to. The majority rules in this House. 
   But the reality is those things that were brought forward were brought forward without any input from the Republican side at all. 
   Now we hear we are going to get an energy plan today. I would be willing to bet my whole life that there is not one person who has checked with our committee chairman or anybody else. This plan is Nancy Pelosi's plan written while she was on vacation selling her book, and she has come back to deliver it to us, take it or leave it. No wonder the Republicans wonder what in the heck is going on on energy. 
   We ask for an up-or-down vote on the all-of-the-above energy plan that has been discussed for the last 5 weeks.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker for recognizing me for this hour. We are up here this evening because I have had a chance to go to Iraq recently, and some of the things that I have heard in the House just a few minutes ago don't ring up with what I observed when I was in Iraq. 
   But I want to start off by saying this: When I went back home this past month, all over my district the main thing I heard from the people on Iraq, get the politics out of it and just tell us the truth of what you know and let us try to figure it all out together, and why don't we try to figure this out together instead of thinking about who is going to win the next election or who is going to get the next advantage in the political process. I kept hearing that over and over. 
   I want to get up, and some of my colleagues tonight are going to talk about what they know. Some of them have a lot more wisdom than I do because they have been there more times than I have and have had more experiences. 
   My experience is relatively limited. I have been to Iraq four times since I have been in Congress, the last time being late in the month of July. I went on a long weekend to Iraq. So I was there the first time right after we caught Saddam Hussein. The second time I was there was just before the elections took place. The third time was May a year ago when we were pondering what to do and there was discussion of Petraeus having a plan. And then recently this July. 
   I can tell you that the difference between May and July is the difference between daylight and dark as far as the comments that I received from American fighting men and women and from Iraqis that I visited with while I was there for what was just a real long weekend. 
   Soldiers are always proud of their mission and accept their mission, and they do their mission and duty and we should always be proud of them. But you didn't hear the kind of comments that we have heard now about the enthusiasm that our soldiers have for the fact that ordinary Iraqi citizens, as we say in baseball, are stepping up to the plate and they are taking a swing, and that swing is helping our soldiers and our marines as they do their duty to try to eliminate al Qaeda from being that thorn in the side of Iraqi freedom that is causing the ultimate cause of all of this violence that is going on in Iraq. 
   Someone here tonight said there is brazen political maneuvers. Well, what I am saying has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with the fact that within my district, I have 52,000 soldiers who reside within my district, all of whom have been deployed at least once and some as many as three times in Iraq. I have the largest military facility that exists in the United States, Fort Hood. 
   Our guys told us a lot of good news, and I will report the bad news. The bad news they told us is that 15 months is tough and it is hard on their families and they hope we can get this mission done so we don't have to continue 15-month rotations. 
   So I don't come back just preaching good news. Our military, our soldiers don't like the 15-month rotation, but they do their duty. But time and time again I had soldiers tell me: Man, whatever you do, don't pull the rug out from under us just as we are starting to see daylight. We are committed in blood, sweat and tears over here, and the Nation has committed its resources and we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Don't pull out the rug now. If you do, don't ask me to come back when this place goes to hell in a handbasket. That is a quote from a sergeant. 
   We have to think about this. We have big decisions to make this fall. General Petraeus is going to come over here, and he will tell us the truth about what is going on, and I don't think it is all going to be a beautiful, rosy picture. But I do think he is going to tell you what ordinary soldiers and ordinary marines told me, and that is, as compared to 6 to 9 months ago, it is substantially better. It has to do with the fact that we now have the necessary troops on the ground. 
   I would like to correct an error that a general asked me to correct. The surge did not start in February of this year. The surge was announced. The surge started the second week in July of this year. That is when the entire 30,000-soldier contingency was in Iraq, and at that point in time the plan began to be executed. 
   But the idea that we were building up troops brought good news. The surge is now less than 6 weeks old. That's the truth about what the surge is. In fact, one of the people who is in charge of bringing these additional forces to Iraq told me, he said: You know, I hear you are having votes to pull out in 2 weeks or 2 months. Well, just tell somebody it took us a hard 6 months to get 30,000 soldiers over here, and if you think you can move 160,000 out of here in 120 days, you have lost your mind. It can't be done. 
   The reality of that war is they come over there on ships, and just like they did in the Second World War, they train before they go in, and when they are ready, they go in. And the whole 30,000 finally arrived in July. 
   So the picture, as I see it, is good news because of Iraqi involvement, and we will talk some more about that. Right now I would like to recognize CHRIS SHAYS, my colleague who has probably been to Iraq more than any Member of this Congress. Congressman Shays, do you want to share your feelings.

   Mr. CARTER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, as I was listening to everybody talk here and listening to people talk earlier today, I get struck by the history of this Chamber. And as I was sitting here, I wondered how often this debate had occurred during my lifetime or did it occur during my lifetime. I would like to think I am a student of history, but I will admit that my concentration on history from the end of the Second World War until I was in high school, there is a gap there where it is only kind of the history of me and not the history of the United States. So I don't know a lot about it, but I was thinking the Second World War in Europe ended in 1944. Germany was divided into zones, I believe, until 1952. So we actually were the government of a zone, as were Britain and  France, from 1944 to 1952. I wonder if this debate took place in this Congress during that period of time: Bring our troops home. Why don't those people stand up a government over there? Why can't they get their act together? I wonder if that debate took place. I don't know. I might go look it up and try to find out. 
   Japan we defeated in 1945, unconditional surrender. And yet MacArthur established the occupation of Japan and, in fact, was heavily criticized when the Korean War broke out for still being the czar of Japan. And occupation forces remained in Japan until some time in the mid 1950s. I wonder if that debate went on about Japan. The last time I checked, which was the day before yesterday when I was talking to some soldiers at Fort Hood, we still have troops in Korea, and that war technically ended in 1954 I believe it was, 1952 or 1954, and we still have troops there. And I don't know if during the 1950s we had debates about why can't those people get their act together? Why do we have to defend that country? Why do we have to defend them? I don't hear that debate anymore, and there are still American soldiers standing watch in Korea. 
   I am not saying that we are going to occupy for this period of time, but where is our commitment to the commitment that our soldiers have given us? That deeply concerns me. I worry about it. And I can tell you our fighting men and women worry about it too. 
   So I guess that is why we get up here on the floor of the House and we want to let the American people know what we saw and what we heard and what we experienced. And I know the fighting generation that are living today; those soldiers are a great generation. The question is, will we be also ranked as a great generation, the people back home, for standing behind this great generation as they have done an outstanding job in defeating our enemy.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARTER. (AMERICA'S FAILED ECONOMIC AND ENERGY POLICIES -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I am honored to be here with my colleagues from Texas. As I start, I am sure there is someone somewhere who is saying, yes, there are three Texans on the floor from the largest petroleum-producing State in the Nation, and of course they want to talk about oil and gas. Well, of course we do. 
   Also, I think most of us who are here tonight have lived with this industry in our homes and our hometowns in our State. And there seems to be some kind of mystery about terminology that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle I assume are confused about but I don't think that they would intentionally use sloganism to misadvise the American public. But they are in charge of the House, and it is their responsibility to know what we mean when we say lease space for production of oil and gas. 
   Now the concept of leasing is not a tough concept. This House is full of lawyers, but it doesn't take a lawyer to  talk about a lease. Most Americans know what a lease is. Most Americans some time in their life have leased a home or leased an apartment. Some Americans have leased a house for their family or they have leased a car over a period of time. 
   Now when they lease, let's say, a car, they say I will pay you so much money for the ability to have this car in my possession and use it as I see fit for a period of time. And I am going to use it for transportation. But they don't have to use it for transportation. They can park it in the garage if they want to, but they would be economically stupid to park it in the garage when they are spending good money for the right to use that leased car. But they certainly would be entitled to do that. If they were doing it for business purposes, they certainly would lose money on that business. 
   There is no difference, really, between an oil and gas lease and any other sort of lease. The concept is the same concept. A company goes and bids to lease from the Federal Government a certain amount of land for the production of oil and gas and petroleum products. And they pay money to the Federal Government for the right to be able, for a period of time, 5 or 10 years, to explore and ultimately drill for and produce petroleum on that land. If they haven't done that within the period of time of that lease, then the lease is void and goes back to the government. I suppose the government can lease it to somebody else. 
   Now, we have a term that has come out ``use it or lose it'' which is nebulous, to say the least, because every single oil and gas lease that I have ever heard about from the Federal Government is a use-it-or-lose-it lease. The terms of the lease say you have the right to explore for and produce on this property for a set period of time, say 5 years. After that period, if you haven't done that, if you haven't explored and you haven't produced, the lease goes back because that's the purpose of your using this land. You either use it for that or after 5 years, the terms of the lease that you paid for, you lose it. 
   Now the oil companies spend billions of dollars for these leases because there is something peculiar about oil, and I think most people in this country understand this. The peculiarity is that it is not everywhere. It is sometimes in your backyard, and sometimes the nearest place is five States away. So the oil companies are speculating based upon sort of known concepts, but they use very highly technical equipment and procedures to give them an indication of whether or not there is oil or gas underneath a piece of property. 
   For my lifetime they have been using seismic measurements to determine whether or not there is the possibility of a formation below the ground that would be producing oil or gas. This seismic thing is not really fancy. It is vibrations through the earth and they use explosives to make it. Now from the time when I was a kid when I tried to get a job on a seismic crew, that was pretty old-fashioned technology. Today I am sure it is digital and high tech and much better than it was in those days. And I just recently learned they are using some kind of magnetic survey that the big companies are working on that give them other indications where it might be. But the bottom line is it is either there or it is not, and they have to look for it and spend money to see if it is there. So they lease large parts of the country or the offshore area, and they go out and they spend lots of money to look and see if there is oil. And you know what, if they don't see any good indications for production that will pay for itself, they are in the business of oil and gas. So just like you wouldn't lease something you wouldn't use, they won't continue to lease a lease that they can't produce on. 
   But to say use it of lose it for the leases that are out there, believe me, every oil company that is in the business of producing petroleum products is going to utilize the money they spent on those leases to try to make discoveries to find oil and gas products. 
   So to come up this slogan that means nothing because it is already in the contract, it doesn't make sense. It is not a good way for us to stand up for the American people. The Democrats are in charge of this House. They have to be willing, as we were when we were in charge, to take the heat for the things that are happening in this country. And quite frankly, the heat right now is the price of gasoline. It has gone up $1.75 or so since they got in office, and they have to take the heat. 
   What we Republicans are saying is basically what we 
   have been saying since 1990: America has the potential to produce its own energy in multiple forms and we support all those forms that are clean, can be produced environmentally safely, and oil and gas falls within those parameters. And we should be using American energy that we can produce in America. 
   I would like to tell you, there is an issue about ANWR. ANWR is the frozen tundra area in the far north part of Alaska. You can probably see the pictures of those pristine mountains in the distance if you use a telescopic lens to make it look like they are in your backyard. But most pictures you see of actual ANWR, it kind of looks like this table but it is marshy and frozen. 
   And this is a good example so you know what we are talking about. I think every American knows what a football field looks like. If they don't, they know what a soccer field looks like. If you take a book of matches and toss it out on the football field, that book of matches would represent the area that is being sought to drill the well to produce in ANWR, and the football field would represent ANWR. 
   So when they are talking about destroying the wildlife preserve, we are talking about a tiny bit of a place the size of South Carolina. That's what we are looking to drill on, that is what we are looking to produce on. And the track record is undisputable as far as drilling is concerned. Drilling is environmentally safe and almost spill-proof. Last year we spilled one tablespoon of oil in the drilling process. Remember, I said the drilling process. So one tablespoon of oil worldwide producing oil through drilling. So yes, there is a little spillage, but that ain't bad. That is pretty good, and I think we could do that without even spilling a drop in ANWR. 
   So these issues that are making so much noise come down to basic, sound principles that we can't afford $4 or $5 or $6 a gallon gas until we start making some common sense about American policy towards oil and gas. 
   I don't even want to mention because I happen to be blessed to live down in a State where at least in my part of the State it doesn't get real cold in the wintertime. But I have been in Congress long enough to know that the minute it starts getting cold up here in the northern clime, people start getting real cold when they don't have heating oil to heat their homes. And then they start running to Congress and asking us to give them money to supplement their heating bills because the price of oil is through the roof. Well, they haven't seen the price of oil through the roof until they look at this $138 or $139 a barrel price for crude oil. And the heating cost that is going to be hitting the northeast and the midwest and the far west and the mountain areas of this country come cold weather time is going to make this problem with driving our automobiles look like a walk in the park for people in that cold weather. 
   So let's start dealing with this issue now so that we can, as we show the courage to do what is right and not block what is right, then those people who are speculating, and also just bidding in competition with us on the futures that are available in the oil market, will realize that America is serious about producing its own energy. And when they see us serious, they will know that we won't be the big players to drive up the market, and I believe they will start to dump those holdings they are holding now. As they dump those holdings into the market, the price will go down. It is the argument that everyone has said here today, the law of supply and demand. Right now we are short on supply, certainly short on domestic supply. As we show the will to seek domestic supply, our competitors will realize we are going to have our own supply which will make that international trading in the market less valuable to them and they will start to dump their oil before they start to lose money on their speculations. So I think this is common sense. This is easy. This is economics 101. I hope that everybody will remember that leasing is just exactly what it is.  There is nothing magical about an oil and gas lease. It is paying money for the use of land for a period of time. That's what we are talking about here. So this use it or lose it idea is really strange. 
   In addition, there are some facts that have been thrown out that I want to mention, and then I will yield back my time. 
   Democrats are saying that 4.8 million barrels of oil per day and 44.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day may be extrapolated from the oil company's Federally leased land that they already hold today. This is not true.     
   No Democrat, not Speaker Pelosi, Hoyer, Rahm, any of them can give us one source where they got that number, and it's been specifically requested by the Republicans in the Natural Resources Committee to ask them where they got that number and how they extrapolate it, and there's been nothing forthcoming. I can't imagine that they just made it up. 
   But the reality is if it is there, it has got to be found. If it has got to be found, there's going to be hundreds of millions of dollars spent to find it. And believe me, they're not going to waste their money. If it's there, they're going to go get it. And so this is simple stuff. And I hope the American people and the Members of this Congress know it's simple stuff.

   Mr. CARTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I hope that everybody is listening in detail to what my colleagues are talking about here today. 
   You know, I spent a long time as a district judge and watching lawsuits. It is very fascinating, this sue OPEC argument that's out there, because as I understand it, the lawsuit would be you are not producing enough, therefore, you're fixing the price and we're suing you. And I would see a lawyer for the Saudi Arabians or whomever we had sued, they would say, well, wait a minute, you're not producing, therefore, you're influencing the price of oil; so I'm going to counter-sue you under this lawsuit, and now, America, let's see who's not producing the most. 
   I'm afraid we'd lose because we're not producing anything on the east coast, anything on the west coast, anything in half of the Gulf of Mexico and anything in a quarter of Alaska, where they can argue that they're producing everything they can pump. It's just how fast they turn up the pumps. So that lawsuit might turn its back on us right there, and that concerns me. But that's all speculation. 
   It's not speculation that that family's not getting to go on a vacation. You know, it's not speculation the people who worry about how they're going to get their children to their schools and their after-school activities come the start of school in the fall. 
   I talked to a lady two-and-a-half years ago when the Democrat minority, when we were in the majority, were criticizing us for $2.40 a gallon, $2.50 a gallon gasoline. They were criticizing us, and I went and pumped gas in a gas station for about 3 hours and talked to the people as I filled up their tank. 
   And the lady who told the most compelling story was the one who said, I have to get my kids to their various recitals, practices, after-school activities and make sure they get to school on time. They go to three different schools. I'm a single mom, with three kids in three different schools in three different parts of town. 
   And I have to choose between what we eat or if we eat and whether I get to drive the car to get these kids. 
   That was at $2.50 a gallon of gas. We have now got $4.07 a gallon of gas, and I can't help but think about that lady every day and wonder--I'd like to actually hear from her--wonder how she's doing. 
   Also, the trucker that hauled a load from Houston to San Diego and got paid $1,800, and his fuel costs were $1,700, how is that man going to make a living? 
   This is about making a living, living the American dream, just being good Americans, and we're being kept from that by the Democrats' energy policy. It's time to wake up and produce American energy for America.

   Mr. CARTER. I thank my friend from Iowa, my classmate from Iowa. We came in this Congress together and have been close friends since we have gotten here. The one thing that I have learned about people from Iowa, like Steve King, is that they are blessed, like a whole lot of my folks back home, hopefully I am too, with something called common sense. You know, this is really about common sense, and I think the American people get it. 
   Tomorrow morning, in Round Rock, Texas, where I am from, that used to be a little bitty town of 2,500 people, and now we are bumping up against 100,000 people, but I estimate we have got at least 15,000 to 20,000 vehicles that are operated out of Round Rock, Texas. 
   So, tomorrow morning, in just my hometown, 15,000 people are going to get out of bed and go out and start up a vehicle to go to work, and it's summer, they may be wanting to take the kids on vacation, maybe taking them to swimming practice or to baseball practice or down to the park to play, or they are going to grocery shopping, as the price of groceries go up, or they are going out to work, or they are driving down to Austin, 30 miles away, to their job. But they are all mobile and going some place. 
   There's no mass transit that comes to my town of 100,000 people. There's a Greyhound bus that passes through, going places. But I wouldn't call that mass transit. It won't get you back and forth to work. And all those peoples are going to start their vehicles tomorrow morning, either on gasoline or diesel. We may have a couple of hybrids. But the power that is going to recharge the batteries of that hybrid vehicle is going to come from a source of some sort. Hydroelectric used to be a big source, but it's one of the minute sources now. We got scared to death of nuclear energy and so we stopped making nuclear power plants. So we burn coal and we burn natural gas and hydrocarbons to make electrical energy most everywhere in this country. 
   Now, sure, I like what I heard from my friend, T. Boone Pickens, from the panhandle of Texas, where the wind blows all the time. Wind mills are a great idea in the panhandle of Texas, and they are going to help a small amount. I am all for it. I, of course, am a big fan of natural gas because my daddy was in the natural gas business. I grew up in the natural gas business, and every summer job I had from the time I was 16-years-old was in the natural gas business. Which brings me down to something that I discovered. 
   Most of the people here in Congress know that I am married to a little lady who's from the Netherlands. I worked on a pipeline in the Netherlands back in 1965. That is how I met my wife. That pipeline was being laid because the Dutch discovered in the northern province of Holland--and Holland is a little country. It's not very big at all.  I think it's 190 miles long by 90 miles wide. 
   They discovered natural gas. In fact, one well in north Holland produced the same amount of natural gas as the entire west Texas gas field in the panhandle. Now they were elated. They were overwhelmed. Europe was fascinated. They had found a resource to power their homes, because they were still burning coal, they were still burning coal that was made into liquid. They were still burning coal oil in their homes in northern Europe in 1965. And they were excited about this great resource that they found. 
   And then they moved offshore; off the shore of Norway, off the shore of Scotland, off the shore of Sweden, and out into the North Sea, out into the Baltic Sea, and they drilled and they found more oil and natural gas. And Europe was excited. Yet, we are ashamed of our natural resource that we know is sitting off the coast of the United States. Oh, woe is me. We can't touch that. That is not good for us. 
   Now what is wrong with us? Because tomorrow morning in Round Rock, Texas, 15,000 people want to run their vehicles to live their lives as Americans. And, you're right, these folks, the intercity folks, they have got mass transit. Some of it's good, some not so good. But they have got it. Maybe that is what is part of the divide that divides the red States from the blue States in the old comparison that we get right now. Maybe us red State folks don't have as much transit as the blue State folks. I don't know about that. 
   But I know this. The Republican Party stands for the right idea. Let's develop every power source known to man to make this an American independent power country. American power for Americans. 
   You have got a chart right there. You have got a great list. I will be glad to yield back for you to go over that list of the power sources that we say are available and how we support each and every one of those power sources. I yield back.

   Mr. CARTER. There are commercials running on television on both sides of this issue, and one of them says, Why don't the oil companies do something about energy, not just oil? And do something about the environment. 
   Well, we are told that the big challenge we have today is CO  
   2. Carbon dioxide is ruining our planet. We talked about the polar bears earlier. If we captured carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere from some type of burn process,  what will we do with it? Who has a use for carbon dioxide; taking it out of the atmosphere? The oil companies have a use. 
   The oil companies can use carbon dioxide to deep inject into fields like east Texas, where Brother GOHMERT comes from, which just about spinout oil fields, and geologists tell us there may be 50 percent of the oil in that field may not be recoverable without some change in the field. 
   Under this future gen project, which this government is looking at spending billions of dollars on to study how to take coal, clean the burn of coal, capture the carbon dioxide and put the carbon dioxide deep in the ground, where it will change the composition of--I assume it's like tar sands that are left down there--and bring light crude to the surface. 
   So, you know, these are not the evil empire. They actually have a solution to a problem that we are talking about, and as we learn how to capture carbon dioxide, which we are working on right now. 
   I was in a meeting the day before yesterday with a group that has a process of capturing carbon dioxide from a burn process. As we capture it, it has a market price in a free enterprise world to the oil and gas industry to bring petroleum products to the surface safely, without polluting the atmosphere. 
   We don't talk about these things because these are the things that they do in the regular engineering in their business. But the reality is this is a solution to the very problem that our friend, Mr. Gore, is talking about. And if you believe that carbon dioxide is the end of the world, there are energy companies, oil and gas companies, that are ready, willing, and able to take captured carbon dioxide to work in their business. 
   This is the kind creativity when you challenge Americans to solve a problem. We say, Go to the moon. Yes, we can go to the moon by using these kind of new ideas to make life better for Americans so that when we get up tomorrow morning, we can comfortably start our automobiles and our pickup trucks and our SUVs and together work.

   Mr. CARTER. The other bogeyman, strawman out there, is Big Oil. Big Oil finds the oil rigs. As a Member of this House, and I don't think you would be ashamed for me to tell this, and it is not a long story, his name is TRENT FRANKS, he is one of our classmates, and he made his living drilling for oil. You know how he started? TRENT was 18. His partner was his 15-year-old brother. They bought a makeshift drilling rig that was basically rigged on the back of an old truck, and they went down outside of Midland, Texas, and started looking for a place to drill for oil. 
   TRENT is out of the business now because he is a Member of Congress, but his firm today is drilling offshore off the coast of New Zealand and Australia. So he and his 15-year-old brother obviously found some someplace so they could keep drilling. 
   The average person who seeks oil is an independent, more or less for the oil industry, small businessman, and we should stop throwing these bogeymen out there, because these are the people looking for our oil, and they are going to find it and they are going to change things, as are our coal miners and all the other people we have talked about. We will get clean coal, we will get oil that we can live with, we will have American energy. 
   I thank you for allowing me to join you today. I yield back.

   Mr. CARTER. I thank my friend from Arkansas, the ranking member, Mr. Boozman. And I want to thank Ms. Herseth Sandlin for the work she did  incorporating into 6225, which I rise in support of, H.R. 6070, the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act. 
   I have a very similar story to the previous story. I had a spouse of a captain at Fort Hood come to me and say, you know, we have been transferred to the Pentagon. And my husband, he still votes, pays his taxes and everything else in Killeen, Texas. But I have been transferred with my husband up here to Virginia, and now I am having to register to vote in Virginia. My Congressman is from Virginia. I have to register my car titles and everything in Virginia, independently of my husband. I have to pay State income taxes in Virginia. And quite frankly, my husband serves in the Army, and we serve the military out of patriotism to our country, and we are proud to do it. But I make twice as much money as he does, and this is a burden upon me, taxwise and it is a burden on me with my family. 
   And I made the assumption that that was fixed, had been fixed a long time ago. So this, 6070, which is incorporated in 6225, allows the spouse to have the same benefits we have given to our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, that they can designate a residency and that remains their residency no matter where the military sends them. 
   My wife is from Holland, and she has a little saying in Dutch that she has got written on the wall. And it says, ``It's not the mountain you have to climb that gets you, it's the grain of sand in your shoe.'' And this is one of those grains of sand in the shoes of the spouses of our military which is an irritant to them that is easy for us to fix. 
   And I want to thank all those involved in allowing this to go forward. This will be something that seems small to some, but it is a big hurdle to the spouses of our military.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARTER. I am just real pleased, Madam Speaker, to be able to stand up and speak in favor of this, because this is a great example of conserving fuel for America. These cars don't run on gasoline or diesel. These kids are just going to let gravity take its course. I guess this trucker from Houston that I met with this last week who told me that he took a load from Houston to San Diego and got paid $1,800 and his fuel costs were $1,700, he probably wishes it was all downhill from Houston to San Diego so he wouldn't have to pay the kind of fuel costs that are being imposed upon the American public. 
   The American public is asking this House to address this issue. I don't think anybody who went home and talked to their constituents this last week could not have found out that people are frightened at the cost of fuel. Single parents are concerned that they can't get their children to school. They are concerned they are not able to get to do shopping. They are having to choose between food or fuel in families across our country. It is time to use American energy intelligently. 
   As we look at this great race, which I support, I am excited for these young people and I think it is really Americana at its best. But using America's resources wisely is also Americana at its best, and our citizens expect us to find and use the fuel that is available for them to bring these prices down. 
   I encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us on this side of the aisle in trying to find new sources of fuel from all over this Nation, from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico to offshore. It is important to America. It is important to our families. 
   I thank you for allowing me to express my opinion.

   Mr. CARTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Last week, the so-called experts came to town and they told us that we need to shore up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide stability to the housing markets and to shore up and give stability to our financial institutions. 
   I listened very calmly to that and decided it made sense to me, and I think it makes sense to most everybody in this conference. I didn't hear anything about blank checks, but I did hear about shoring up the system. I certainly didn't hear anything about a housing trust fund or community block grants for buying foreclosures, but that's in this bill and that concerns me. 
   If we just take a look at the housing trust fund, we see a $9 billion permanent tax against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Now wait a minute. I thought we were shoring up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Now we're taxing them. 
   But besides that, over the next 3 years this will be used for the FHA bailout, and that makes some sense. Sixty-five percent of these funds will go to States that spend it on rental housing activities and low-income homeownership. That sounds like it makes sense, although it really wasn't what we were talking about but it makes sense. And then 35 percent will be distributed by the Secretary of Treasury to groups, groups that work in housing, I suppose, like ACORN and La Raza. 
   But there's a problem here that I see that there doesn't seem to be any permanent oversight that would prevent this kind of money that could potentially go into something that would be very abusive or fraudulent. It concerns me. The community block grants were not part of what we were asked to do either. Both these items have come before this House before unsuccessfully. But now when we have one of these must-pass golden opportunities that  the Democrat majority sees, then they put the things on there that otherwise they didn't feel confident they could get done, and then they ask us to do this to save the financial institutions of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and others. 
   This doesn't sound like what the American people sent us here to do. They sent us here to work on the problems that are before this Nation and are important.
