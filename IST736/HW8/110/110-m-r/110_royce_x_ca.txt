<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (AMERICAN ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Well, perhaps I could engage the gentleman from Iowa in a discussion here of the fact that I don't think many were really paying attention in this country over the last few years, but today, 80 percent of oil reserves are owned by nationalized oil companies of foreign governments. We don't think a lot about this, but if we reflect, we will remember that, in many cases, the property has been seized and that OPEC now controls these assets through cartels overseas. As a matter of fact, it controls about 80 percent. 
   In my view, I think Congress sort of shrugged off the testimony of our former CIA Director, who warned of the OPEC cartel spearheaded by Saudi Arabia, deliberately lowering production levels in order to drive the price of oil up. Now, as it turns out, the price of oil they managed to drive up to $140 a barrel. In his view, this was a bid to siphon $10 trillion over the next 10 years from our economy here into the coffers of the OPEC members. 
   So I wanted to just touch briefly on the national security component of this. I think Congress watched as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board explained that our supplies in oil are so tight in the United States today that a 1 percent increase in supply could lower costs by 10 percent. Just 2 weeks ago, our Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, testified to that point. 
   So what is the studied indifference as consumers and policymakers lay out the case for more supply? 
   My concern is that the Democratic leadership has made a commitment to maintain the moratoriums against new drilling, new refineries, new nuclear power, the opportunity to extract oil from shale. Like my colleague from Iowa, I believe that market economics still have consequences and that the American Energy Act, which we have cosponsored which would lift these prohibitions, would increase supply by 33 percent. Now, if a 1 percent increase in supply drives down the price in the estimate of the Federal Reserve Chairman by 10 percent, what would a 33 percent increase in supply do for the price? 
   You know, a majority of the House of Representatives, I now believe, is feeling enough heat back home that they would vote for increased supply, but the congressional leadership has blocked not only the American Energy Act, but the Democratic leadership has also blocked all other amendments that might lift any of the prohibitions from coming to the House floor. 
   Well, under this American Energy Act that the gentleman from Iowa and I are supporting, we would open our deep water ocean resources. That would provide another 3 million barrels of oil per day to our domestic supply. Currently, we use 20 million barrels a day. Now, Cuba and Venezuela are already operating in these waters. It would open the Arctic coastal plain. That would provide an additional 1 million barrels of oil a day. Now the Russian oil exploration is already operating in the Arctic today. It would develop our Nation's oil shale resources, providing an additional 2.5 million barrels per day. Canada is developing its oil shale resources. 
   It would cut the red tape that hinders the construction of new refineries. None have been built in the last 31 years. It would extend the tax credit for alternative energy production, including wind and solar and hydrogen, and it would eliminate barriers to the expansion of nuclear power production. As we know, France gets 80 percent of its energy from nuclear power. My State of California gets 12 1/2 percent. 
   So, today, the OPEC cartel controls more than three-quarters of the world's global oil reserves, and it severely restricts both supply and access to its oil fields. This is one of the factors that helps cause this dramatic spike in the price of oil, which not only hits consumers at the pump but which, frankly, harms nearly every aspect of our economy, and the moratoriums here maintained by the Democratic leadership, in my view, help drive up energy costs and risk further sinking this economy. 
   This is the reason I've come to the floor, to make the case to have our colleagues bring this bill before the floor of the House of Representatives.     
   I don't know of a case where we have gone so long without an appropriations bill before this Congress. Article I, section 9, clause 7 of the Constitution says that, ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'' 
   Normally, we have the 13 appropriations bills that come out of our committees that fund every government agency, but this is being held off. And one of the reasons why we are not having these votes on the House floor is because of the concern that we might bring up these amendments. We might attach this Act to one of the appropriations bills. 
   And we've gone over 200 years on this House floor, and the House has never gone into the August recess without passing a single appropriations bill. In fact, the House has always passed at least one appropriations bill prior to July 9. 
   And I am concerned that the Democrat leadership is so insistent on blocking any votes to increase energy production that they are rolling over until the end of the year all of the work that this Congress--and we will have one omnibus bill in which we cannot bring up any of these amendments to increase energy production in the United States. 
   I would ask if my colleague from the State of Iowa shares my concern.

   Mr. ROYCE. If the gentleman would yield, what would the gentleman think the consequence would be over the next 10 years presuming that these moratoriums are kept in place? We can't do anything, presume for a moment, to address the issue that the Federal Reserve Chairman warned, that the supply of energy is so tight that a 1 percent increase in supply would drop prices by 10 percent. Let's say that things remain as they are, we don't get any additional sources for production because of the moratoriums. What do you think the consequences would be of the transfer of $10 trillion out of this economy over the next 10 years into OPEC, into the members of the OPEC cartel?

   Mr. ROYCE. If the gentleman will yield, I think it's pretty clear at this point that high gas prices are hurting the pocketbook of families across this country. Family budgets are strained. And the bottom line is we are pushing for short- and long-term solutions to lower gas prices and to address our future energy needs. 
   We're doing that with the American Energy Act, which is going to provide tax incentives for businesses and families that purchase more fuel-efficient carts. It provides tax incentives to those that improve their energy efficiency. It permanently extends the tax credit for alternative energy production, including wind and solar and hydrogen. Barriers to the expansion of emission-free nuclear power production are eliminated in this piece of legislation. It spurs the development of alternative fuels. 
   It's a balanced piece of legislation, which gives us more energy, and frankly, with gas prices increasing, it's vital that we utilize our Nation's vast energy supplies, and at the same time, we should continue to develop new, clean technology. And this would significantly reduce our use of foreign oil.  
   That's what this bill is intended to do, and doing so is an economic necessity. It is vital to our national security. So I encourage our lawmakers, our colleagues to join us in this effort to bring this important piece of legislation to the floor for a vote. 
   And I appreciate the gentleman from Iowa yielding to me, and I appreciate also his explanation of energy production and energy consumption here in the United States so that people can better understand just how tight the supply is and how great the need is for more energy production, to say nothing of the jobs, by the way, that this would create here in this country if we allowed more production.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, Sunday, July the 20th marked the 34th commemoration of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. That invasion claimed the lives of 5,000 Greek Cypriots while an additional 200,000 were forced from their homes. Today, nearly 36,000 Turkish soldiers, 1 soldier for every 2 Turkish Cypriots, are embedded in Cyprus, occupying 35 percent of the island. It is one of the most militarized areas in the world. 
   The Turkish and Greek Cypriots, themselves, live in harmony, making the occupation all the more unacceptable and unnecessary. There have been  no recent incidents of violence between the two communities. In a show of friendship, Ledra Street, which connects Greek and Cypriot Cyprus, was recently opened for the first time since 1964. Thirteen million Greek and Turkish Cypriots have crossed the border, each time without incident. 
   In the House, House Resolution 620, which I cosponsored, cites these crossings as evidence of the goodwill between the two communities, and it refutes the Turkish claim that a military presence is necessary. 
   As we remember the invasion to split Cyprus in two, it is important to note that there are concrete efforts underway by the heads of the communities to reunify.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Madam Speaker, I am rising today to speak about the consequences of some 80 percent of oil reserves around the world now being controlled by a foreign cartel, a foreign cartel that works in concert with Russia. And if you take Russia into the mix, you now have over 90 percent of the oil reserves of the oil that's being pumped around the world controlled by this cartel, OPEC. 
   Now, many of us remember when Aramco was nationalized, where the U.S. fields were seized in Saudi Arabia. And we remember when British Petroleum in Iran was nationalized by that government. Not too many years ago, Hugo Chavez seized the European oil companies, their derricks, off the coast of his country. 
   This is a phenomenon that, as it has occurred, has allowed, according to our former CIA Director Jim Woolsey, the cartel to pick a price. And what he suggested some years ago to us in the Congress was that there was an attempt to set that price at $140 a barrel of oil. And, specifically, what the cartel did, what OPEC did, was to curtail production in order to drive up the price. 
   Frankly, we need a long-term and a short-term solution to this problem. The long-term solution is to continue the investment in lithium-ion batteries that the market is driving and continue incentives for hybrids so that we reach the point where you can actually go 100 miles per gallon of gasoline used because the first 40 miles that you would use to go to work typically or back will be off a battery. In other words, his argument is that long-term electricity is going to be the solution to this by converting the economy, which today 95 percent of the transportation costs dealing with fuel are petroleum, converting that over to electricity. 
   But that's 10 years out. And in the meantime, we have a short-term solution that we need in order to break this cartel's ability to hold that price as high as they hold it. And as the price began to dip down the last few weeks, you saw the cartel again doing what? Saying they were going to, again, curtail production in order to increase the price of gasoline. This represents, according to the former CIA Director, a $10 trillion transfer in wealth over the next 10 years out of this economy into their economy, billions of dollars every day going into their sovereign wealth funds in Saudi Arabia or throughout the Persian Gulf and some of it also going into the madrassas, the special religious schools that they're setting up across Central Asia, across Africa, even in Europe, which, frankly, are radicalizing a younger generation. 
   So how do we take some of the profit out of this? What we do, frankly, is we lift that moratorium on drilling. And our hope on the Republican side was that we might see a series of moratoriums which were put in place lifted. 
   One which was put in place a little over a year ago was the moratorium on using oil shale from Wyoming and Utah and Colorado. We have more oil shale in this country by threefold in terms of what the Saudis have in reserves in the Persian Gulf. So with 2 trillion in oil shale reserves, frankly, we could do a lot. But there has been a moratorium put by those who do not want to burn fossil fuels. 
   Then we have the moratorium on drilling offshore. We know that the Cubans are drilling off the coast of Florida; we're not allowed to drill off the coast in those waters. 
   We know that in the Arctic we have Gazprom, which was nationalized, seized by the Russian government a few years ago. They're bringing their two biggest derricks up to the Arctic. They're going to drill, whereas we can't expand in Alaska, in the Arctic, and drill there on the U.S. side. 
   So what we are witnessing is the fact that we have hamstrung our ability. Gasification, as the South Africans use a process to transfer coal into gasoline, a moratorium on that. Nuclear, well, France has 80 percent of its grid supported by nuclear power. In my State, California, it's 12.5 percent, and there is no chance of getting more because of the restrictions and moratoriums. And, frankly, when a lease is let, there is a lawsuit that follows it instantaneously. 
   So the question I have is why are we moving legislation which purports to lift only one of these moratoriums, which is the drilling offshore, but with it says that no State can take a percentage of the profits of that drilling to help its State budget? All that guarantees is that no State will allow drilling offshore. Right now if you're in the State of Louisiana and you have a certain area where drilling is occurring,  part of that goes back to the State of Louisiana. 
   The fact is that this measure, this legislation, will prevent, will absolutely stop any State from going forward and allowing additional drilling. And that's what it's intended to do because the intention is not to have any energy produced in the United States, not to create jobs here, and not to help the inflation that, frankly, is being driven right now by these high energy prices. And I am very concerned about it.

   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prevent the expenditures of any funds for the purpose of enforcing the judgment or imposing the sentences handed down in the case of United States v. Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean. 
   As most of you know, President Bush so far has rejected appeals by many of us for a pardon for these two Border Patrol agents who are now sitting in Federal prison for shooting a professional drug smuggler who worked for the cartels, who was fleeing back across the Rio Grande. These two agents are now serving 11 and 12 years, respectively. 
   I have talked to many Border Patrol agents about these cases, about the circumstances they face down there. I haven't found any that don't support Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos, and certainly their association supports them fully. 
   In the meantime, of course, the great irony here is the smuggler they apprehended for attempting to smuggle some 750 pounds of drugs into our country is free.

   Mr. ROYCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as The Washington Post says today: ``Altogether, the House Democratic leadership has come up with more than $20 billion of new spending, much of it wasted subsidies. And it makes us wonder how $74 million to extend peanut storage payments or $250 million for MILC subsidies will aid our troops.'' 
   Perhaps my colleagues believe that these agricultural subsidies are necessary, but I don't see how they are going to help us defeat Islamist terrorists. Is this really what General Petraeus needs? Is this what he asked for? No, it is not. And it is bad policy to start, and it is worse by mixing it without backing of our forces in the field. 
   It is not just the language that gives us pause here. If it is our mission to win in Iraq, then we should not be making it more difficult for our troops to succeed. Cutting off funding and micromanaging a war does that, according to our commanders in the field. And as The Post adds: ``The bill excludes the judgment of General Petraeus, excludes the judgment of the U.S. commanders who would have to execute the retreat that the bill mandates.'' 
   And as The Post goes on to say: ``Democrats should not seek to use pork to buy a majority for an unconditional retreat that the majority does not support.''

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. I will begin my remarks by saying that I hope that these 3 days of debate, Mr. Speaker, are characterized by civility and respect. Without doubt, this is the most difficult issue that we will confront in this Congress. 
   Iraq is terribly complex. The stakes for our national security are great, and the sacrifice in American lives and the loss of Iraqi lives have been very painful. 
   This is a war unlike any other we have fought, and it has been vexing. All of us, supporters and opponents of this resolution alike, Republicans and Democrats, all Americans, have a vital interest in our Nation succeeding in helping to build a stable Iraq and defeating Islamist terrorism. That is the challenge of our time. 
   As we have heard, mistakes have been made. There is no doubt about that. I have been dismayed by some of them: the lethargy in training Iraqi troops, the inability to meter oil and protect civilian infrastructure. But we can't allow this to cloud our strategic judgments. 
   To my mind, this resolution, indeed our struggle in Iraq, can be boiled down to two questions: Are Iraq and the global struggle against Islamist terrorism separable? And is Iraq hopeless? The answer to both questions is no, which leads me to a ``no'' on this resolution. 
   The rationale for this war has changed, whether we like it or not. We are now fighting for stability and moderation against the Islamist terrorism that is now host in Iraq. 
   Our Civil War didn't start out as a battle against slavery. It was a fight to save the Union. 
   We started out fighting Saddam and to stop what the majority of this House believed was his weapons of mass destruction program. We are now fighting Islamist terrorism. It is a different and more daunting fight, but the consequences of our success or failure are no less critical because the stakes of this battle have changed. 
   Let there be no doubt about this: Defeat in Iraq will be a terrible blow to our national security. It will psychologically boost the Islamist terrorists who we are fighting there and elsewhere. 
   The bipartisan Iraq Study Group reported Ayman al-Zawahiri, deputy to Osama bin Laden, has declared Iraq a focus for al Qaeda. That declaration is more than words. 
   While not all fighters in Iraq are jihadists, many are. Some have wrongly denied that here on the House floor today. Jihadists are coming from all over the world. The report reads, ``They will seek to expel the Americans and then spread the jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring Iraq.'' Chaos in Iraq will allow for more terrorist safe havens there. 
   The 9/11 Commission stated that every policy decision we make needs to be seen through the lens of terrorist sanctuaries. My colleagues, I would ask if we are doing that. 
   And that report stated that if Iraq becomes a failed state, it will go to the top of the list of places that are breeding grounds for attacks against Americans abroad. 
   We saw what happened when Afghanistan descended into chaos. Al Qaeda emerged out of the ruin to strike America on 9/11. That is the type of threat we are facing today, which will be supercharged if Iraq fails. 
   We have to confront the potential disaster scenario in the region that U.S. failure in Iraq could bring, which would be worsening strife which could engulf the entire region, sparking a wider war in this resource-rich area. 
   Saudis have warned that they are prepared to aid Sunni militias. Jordan could move troops into Iraq's western desert to serve as a buffer. The Turks are increasingly worried about the independent Kurdish movement. Iran could move to secure the oil fields to the south. 
   In describing the consequences of continued decline in Iraq, the Iraq Study Group wrote, ``Such a broader sectarian conflict could open a Pandora's box of problems, including the radicalization of populations, mass movement of populations, and regime changes that might take decades to play out.'' 
   This is the powder keg that is Iraq today. The status quo is nasty. But the consequences of failure, while unpredictable, is far worse. 
   So to the second question: Is Iraq hopeless? I can understand why many Americans may feel that way. Every day there are horrific car bombings, the sectarian violence has intensified. We will hear many assessments that Iraq is hopeless in this debate. 
   No one is going to argue that success is guaranteed. But arguments that we have no chance of bringing stability on the ground in Iraq are also extreme arguments. 
   Are the forces of chaos so strong, and are the forces of stability and moderation so weak as to doom with certainty our efforts? 
   But I have spoken with too many people in the field, people with some optimism, that I am not ready to conclude that with certainty. And I don't think this House should reach that conclusion.     
   And that is my read of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group which, while recognizing the grave challenges, spoke of improving the process for success. The fact that the consequences of our defeat would be so great also leads me to persist. 
   Let's consider more about the implications of defeat. Look at neighboring Iran. Most Americans remember the 1979 Iranian takeover of our embassy in Tehran. That led to 444 days of captivity for our men and women. Unfortunately, relations with Iran have only worsened since. Iran today is a state sponsor of terrorism. It aids Hezbollah, and it backed this terrorist group's war on Israel this summer. With Iranian backing, Hezbollah is the A Team of terrorism, running highly sophisticated operatives worldwide, including here. 
   Some terrorism experts consider Hezbollah to be a more challenging foe than al Qaeda. Iran is backing the insurgents fighting our men and women in Iraq. Iran is also storming ahead with a nuclear weapons program. 
   The embassy takeover was a big morale boost for Islamist terrorists; some trace the beginning of Islamist terrorism to that embassy takeover. The shattering of the Iraqi state in our hands would be that 1979 morale boost magnified. It would also prove the way for tremendous Iranian influence in the region. 
   We must face our responsibility to the Iraqi people. Yes, we have given them 4 years to come together; it has been beyond frustration that they haven't. Tens of thousands of Iraqis have died during this time. What happens if we leave or operate without the manpower our military leadership says it needs? I don't think anyone believes that the carnage won't be several times what we have seen. 
   We often hear calls to intervene in countries for humanitarian reasons. Some would like our military to go to Darfur in Sudan. Maybe we should take decisive military actions to stop that genocide, but what about trying to finish a job where we have already made a huge military commitment, knowing full well that Iraq's withdrawal would lead to a brutal humanitarian crisis? 
   We also often hear from some about how unpopular our country is worldwide. This is said to greatly harm our influence and interest. And there is truth to that. Just wait if our withdrawal precipitates a horrific scale of ethnic cleansing. Is that the Iraqi legacy we want? I am not ready to concede the inevitability of this. 
   It is very important that our Nation be united. Our success depends upon it.  We need to be sowing discord among the enemy, not ourselves. We have had successes against Islamist terrorism worldwide. 
   This resolution states that Congress disapproves of the January decision of the President to deploy more troops to Iraq. The bipartisan Iraq Study Group panel, but one month earlier, said it could support a short-term redeployment of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad. This resolution goes in the opposite direction. 
   I have heard the argument about why this resolution isn't a retreat, but it is a nonbinding rebuke of the President's tactics, that it doesn't cut off funding. That may be the case on paper, but the symbolism is far greater. I don't see how opposing our professional military's call for more troops at this pivotal time is anything but a signal of permanent retreat. It is also congressional micromanagement. 
   The war is horrible. The easy thing would be to just say out. But we can't wish away the Islamist terrorists will take great strength from our defeat. That is what they are saying. These individuals in groups are as persistent as they are brutal. They must be fought and defeated. So let's not give these forces a win on the floor of the U.S. House. 
   I ask my colleagues to think through these implications and vote down this resolution

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, the point I want to make here is that the Republican bill, which has all of the above, sets aside $8.8 billion that would be taken from the profits of this oil leasing, and that money would be put into alternative and renewable energy. That money would go to the long-term solution, which is electric vehicles. Lithium-ion car batteries would eventually come on to the market. 
   But the reality is in the short-term we cannot afford to do what the Democrats want to do. In the last 2 years that they have run the Congress, they have doubled the price of gas by putting in place moratoriums, including one on oil shale development, a moratorium, by the way, that is on three States, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado. We lift that moratorium in our bill because of the reserves there. They do not. 
   We have a situation today where what we would do is allow offshore drilling. Gazprom, the Russian oil giant, is up in the Arctic drilling. No. They say no drilling in the Arctic. Off the coast of Florida, we watch as the Cubans drill. No, we are not going to be allowed to drill there. 
   They take 88 percent and take it off the table, and the other 12 percent, they say you have got to get the State to go along with. That means they just continue this moratorium. This is outrageous.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I just want to commend Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen's leadership on the issue. 
   This has been a long road. In the last Congress, I managed on the House floor approval of the Hyde Act, which was a legal framework for facilitating civil nuclear cooperation with India. And that was a tremendous foreign policy achievement of the last Congress. Failure by this Congress to push this agreement across the finish line, I'm afraid, would be foreign policy malpractice. 
   Indian officials have told me about their ambitious plans to expand nuclear power to fuel their growing economy with clean-burning energy through this source. And with this deal, the Indian nuclear industry will overcome international restrictions and they will reach their full potential to do this.  
   This deal, frankly, has consumed Indian politics. The far, far left in India sought to turn the nuclear deal into a referendum on India's relationship with the United States. They lost in that. Let's seal the deal today helping cement the new U.S.-India relationship. 
   And strictly speaking, this deal really isn't about the United States. The Nuclear Suppliers Group, an organization of 45 countries to control the spread of nuclear technology, okayed this agreement. That NSG decision represents the will of the international community to make the nuclear rules conform to the realities of India's energy situation. 
   Opponents are deriding the exception made for India as a blow to nonproliferation rules. But while this deal may not be a net gain for nonproliferation, neither is it a net loss because under the deal, India stays outside the NPT, but it separates its civil and military nuclear facilities, it gives the IAEA increased access to its nuclear facilities, and it continues its unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing. Indeed, Mohamed ElBaradei, the chief of the IAEA, supports the agreement. Sure it makes changes to the rules that were set down decades ago, but the world is not standing still. Critics can not ignore the security, political, economic, and environmental reasons, frankly, to support it. 
   Opposing this won't affect India. It will only hurt our relationship with India and U.S. interests. With the NSG agreement, other countries, notably France and Russia, can enter the Indian nuclear market--with a potential for up to $100 billion in investment. It has been reported that India will soon sign their own nuclear cooperation agreements with these countries. Now U.S. companies, however, would be blocked out of India until Congress finally approves this agreement. 
   Mr. Speaker, either we continue to try to box in India and hope for the best, or we act to make India a true partner. This agreement works through a difficult nonproliferation situation to strengthen a very important situation. 
   India will be a major power in the 21st century. Let's approve this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, and I rise in opposition to the financing of an affordable housing fund. 
   I don't believe that this fund should be included in legislation to update and improve the Federal Housing Administration. I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing the underlying bill if this provision is included in the legislation. 
   In 2005, I offered an amendment in the Committee on Financial Services to strike the creation of an affordable housing fund. Part of this is philosophical, but ideas have consequences and bad ideas have bad consequences in the long run. As I said 2 years ago, this fund is straight out of central planning 101. It should not be supported by this body. 
   I think by now we should be able to agree that government housing grants do little to increase homeownership levels in this country. If these funds must be derived, they should be geared towards ensuring that the FHA remains solvent rather than supporting an experiment in socialism here. 
   Furthermore, this fund could not be proposed at a worse time, as we see the current spike in foreclosures in the subprime mortgage market, many of which are backed by the Federal Housing Administration. Homeownership rates improve when real interest rates are low and when consumer incomes are rising, are going up. I believe free market policies are the most effective way to generate those results, creeping towards socialism will not. This fund will waste resources and provide false hope for those who wish to increase homeownership.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (GEORGIA AND UKRAINE NATO MEMBERSHIP -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Madam Speaker, I'd like to express reservations about H. Res. 997. 
   NATO expansion is not a casual affair. We're talking about adding countries whose  security we're committing American lives and treasure to defend. While this resolution only endorses the beginning of a membership process, it sets the stage for expanding vital American security concerns. At a time when some Americans are questioning our growing security commitments around the globe, should we be moving to ensure Ukraine and Georgia's security? 
   We must be realistic about the state of NATO. The organization is not well. In Afghanistan, most NATO member states haven't answered the call, choosing not to provide troops or to provide troops only for very limited missions. One observer noted that, ``The inability or unwillingness of certain nations to shoulder the burden of NATO's obligation in Afghanistan is ripping the heart out of the alliance .....'' I'm not convinced that adding new members, each with diverse interests, aids in rebuilding NATO's consensus. Expansion doesn't always mean strengthening. 
   Sure, these countries have committed troops in dangerous areas, for which they should be commended. But a hard headed analysis must ask whether those commitments would be maintained once NATO membership was achieved? 
   Expansion is divisive among some of the longest-standing NATO members. This week in Bucharest, Germany has objected to the process this resolution endorses, effectively stopping it. Chancellor Merkel's government cited concerns over political unrest in Georgia, and the lack of support for joining NATO among Ukrainians. Others ask, rightly, ``What's the rush?'' 
   First and foremost, we should ask ``What's in our national security interest?'' Secondarily, we should ask ``What's in the best interest of NATO?'' I am not convinced that expanding NATO to these two countries advances those causes. That's why I reluctantly oppose this resolution backed by my colleagues and friends.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (OVERSEAS PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Subcommittee Chairman SHERMAN for his work on this legislation. He worked this bill thoroughly, and while we disagree on OPIC's merits, he supported my text to reform its investment funds. 
   OPIC's investment funds, as some may remember, have a troubled history. In the 1990s, then-OPIC president Ruth Harkin said, ``If you're an investor in an OPIC-supported fund, the worst you can do is get your money back at the need of 10 years.'' That's not the free market OPIC professes to support and not surprisingly, these funds were subject to political cronyism. 
   There have been reforms to the funds of late, including competitively selecting fund managers, but we should mandate them. My language does this. 
   Fundamentally though, I remain unconvinced that OPIC is doing something worthwhile that the private sector wouldn't do. The burden of proof should be on OPIC, especially in times of accelerating change in financial markets. Several companies have jumped into the political risk insurance business, for example, offering increasingly sophisticated products, ..... so why are we reauthorizing government-backed OPIC to continue competing against them? 
   We have heard much on the floor trumpeting OPIC's supposed benefits. However, most economists believe that subsidizing investment--which is what OPIC does--merely shifts it around, often to lesser productive locations and uses. The Congressional Research Service has reported, ``From the point of view of the U.S. economy as a whole, there is little theoretical support or empirical evidence that supports claims that subsidizing exports or overseas investment offers a positive net gain in jobs to the U.S. economy.'' That's persuasive evidence against OPIC's claims, and its case for reauthorization. 
   OPIC makes much of the fact that it returns money to the U.S. Treasury. OK. But let's consider that this money is held against potential liabilities stemming from OPIC's activities. And give most anybody U.S. government-backing to trade on, and they'd turn a profit in financial markets. 
   One OPIC critic gave a useful description. Investment is like a rope. Less developed countries can only pull it in with good policies; efforts to push in investment, which is OPIC's mandate, are bound to be inefficient. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are some of the reasons I oppose this legislation reauthorizing OPIC.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (UNITED STATES-REPUBLIC OF KOREA DEFENSE COOPERATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, let me just start by thanking Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who's the ranking member, for her work and Chairman Berman's work in bringing this legislation to the floor. 
   I am in support, of course, of this bill. I authored this bill. But I wanted to share with you that today the House really has an opportunity to strengthen the relationship that we have had historically between the United States and Korea. That alliance is a very important one to us and to our soldiers. 
   The interoperability of U.S. and Korean soldiers in the Korean peninsula can be secured and, frankly, can be strengthened for years to come, and I think is important because our own Secretary of State, Condi Rice, wrote a letter recently to Chairman Berman, and she said in that letter that this ``will serve as an important symbol of the renewed strength of the U.S.-Korea alliance.'' 
   With this legislation in law, foreign military sales with Korea would be treated just as we treat those sales that we have today with NATO or what we call NATO+3, NATO plus Australia, New Zealand and Japan. So the NATO+3 list would become NATO+4. And the upgrade in South Korea's military procurement status would mean a streamlined process; the monetary thresholds that trigger congressional review would be raised and congressional review time would be reduced. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Republic of Korea, as we all know, is a vital, strategic, and enduring ally to this country; 29,000 U.S. troops stand side by side with the Korean Army, and they've helped keep the peace there in northeast Asia for nearly 60 years. 
   We had testimony to the United States Congress earlier this year. We had General Bell, a four-star general. He was commander of the U.S. Forces Korea, and he called it ``bizarre and strange'' that Korea did not have this status in U.S. law, and he urged the adoption of this very measure that we're discussing today.  
   Furthermore, the U.S.-South Korean alliance is distinct. With a mutual defense treaty dating back to 1953, Korea and the U.S. form perhaps the most integrated alliance of interoperable forces I think that exist in the world. On the Korean peninsula, interoperability is not just a buzz word. It is a real-life practice that passage of this legislation would help cement. U.S. and Korean soldiers need to be operating, frankly, on American equipment. 
   South Korea is a larger foreign military sales partner than any of the NATO+3 members. Last year, Seoul purchased $3.7 billion worth of American defense equipment, making it one of the largest partners in U.S. foreign military sales. And this has led South Korea to formally request this preferential status through its Foreign Ministry and its Defense Ministry. Indeed, South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak raised this legislation when he met with congressional leaders here last spring. 
   As our alliance has matured, the Koreans are rightly on the path towards assuming the lead for their own defense. With that, Korea plans to invest $290 billion in military hardware over the next dozen years. Without updating our laws to reflect the strategic nature of our relationship, we run the risk of South Korea looking to other suppliers as it continues its defense transformation, perhaps jeopardizing interoperability of our U.S. forces that work with the Korean forces. So today, we can help prevent that from happening, while at the same time benefiting the strength of this alliance. 
   I urge adoption of the legislation. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their support in bringing it to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I want to just begin by thanking Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, our distinguished ranking member on Foreign Affairs, for bringing this bill up before us. And, of course, this bill requires the State Department to provide detailed briefings to Congress on defense sales to the Government of Taiwan. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it's clear to us Taiwan and the U.S. have a long and valued partnership. Taiwan is one of the few, very vibrant democracies in the region, in Asia, and we continue to build on our already strong economic partnership that we have with that country. Taiwan is an important ally, and we have long considered its security a priority. We have commitments there with regard to that security. 
   That is why this administration's decision to sit on an arms package worth approximately $11 billion is of concern. Today, the People's Republic of China continues to expand its military capabilities, amassing hundreds of short-range missiles pointed across the strait. Now they're pointed at Taiwan. 
   Now some of us support arms sales to Taiwan. Others may not. But we can all agree, I think, that Congress should be involved in this process. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, legislation that governs U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, stipulates that both the President and Congress, this body, shall determine the nature and quantity of such defense articles. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Congress has been left out. This bill, however, helps right that wrong, and I commend its author, Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for bringing this bill before us today, and I urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to recognize my alma mater, California State University, Fullerton as it celebrates its 50th anniversary. In 1957, California State University, Fullerton was founded by an act of the California legislature. The enrollment at that time consisted of 452 students when those first classes were offered in leased quarters at Sunny Hills High School prior to the college moving to the temporary buildings that became a permanent site in 1960 in Fullerton. Half a century after its founding, more than 185,000 graduates have successfully developed careers in hundreds of industries. 
   Each year, more than 36,000 students attend classes at Cal State Fullerton, choosing from 105 different degree programs including 55 undergraduate, 49 graduate and a doctorate in education at eight distinct colleges: Arts, Business and Economics, Communications, Education, Engineering and Computer Science, Health and Human Development, Humanities and Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences and Mathematics, all of which provide an outstanding education to the students. 
   Its studies have led students to careers in teaching, nursing, business, the arts, communications, health care, engineering, sports, the sciences and more. Cal State Fullerton graduates have gone on to successful careers and their impact is felt not only in the State of California and the Nation but throughout the world. Among these graduates are Academy Award-winning actors and screenwriters, television news reporters, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists, successful novelists, doctors, lawyers, judges, teachers, professional athletes, entrepreneurs, scientists and business leaders and even a NASA astronaut who served on the crew of the Space Shuttle Endeavor that launched into space in August of 2007. 
   Cal State Fullerton's student body also reflects the diversity of the State of California. As one of the most diverse campuses in the State and in this Nation, the university welcomes students of different ethnic groups, cultures and religions. In fact, many of these students are the first in their families to earn a university diploma. 
   The university received full accreditation from the Western College Association in 1961 and Cal State Fullerton now holds 14 national accreditations and associations. In addition, ``Titan Pride'' has been the rallying cry for 12 national team championships in seven different sports. 
   Finally, Cal State Fullerton is known for its distinguished faculty, many of whom have garnered international and national reputations in their respective fields. 
   It is with great pride that I recognize Cal State Fullerton for 50 wonderful years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate the opportunity. 
   Madam Speaker, opening these historical records on the Holocaust at this time, I think, is absolutely vital for the debate that is going on in the world today, when, ironically, you have a head of a state like President Ahmadinejad in Iran who simultaneously manages to say that the Holocaust never occurred and that we should have another Holocaust and that the Jewish people should be erased, that Jerusalem and Israel should be erased from the map. When you have the kinds of assertions that we read about, it is vital that those records be discussed by scholars, be surveyed by the families of those who lost loved ones, and that the debate be reengaged. 
   And the reason I say this is this weekend at Chapman University they had a program with 280 Holocaust survivors who had been interviewed by students and we heard the students' words about what they had learned about the Holocaust. 
   My father was present at that program, and he was also present and took photographs at Dachau when that camp was liberated and has since that time had to repeatedly engage those who deny the evidence of those eye-witnesses to history who recorded what had happened there. The words that he has written about this and the speeches that he has given in debate record the four ovens with the bodies stacked like cordwood next to the ovens and in the ovens and the thousands of human beings packed into railcars where they were left to starve to death. The fact that people today still engage us in this argument is why these archives must be turned over to researchers. As he said, when his generation is dead, the last eye-witnesses to this inhumanity will be gone and the Ahmadinejads and those who deny what happened in history will have a chance to try to repeat history. 
   One other point: the evidence uncovered here, the evidence exposed here, will help us better defend the Jewish people and to explain to some of our colleagues and to the world why it is the United States understands why the threats from people like Ahmadinejad are so dangerous.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. I thank the gentleman, Madam Speaker. I rise also to support this resolution commemorating the 175th anniversary of the special relationship that we have with the Kingdom of Thailand. I am an original cosponsor of this resolution, but I think this resolution rightly points out the improving security relationship between our two countries. 
   What I would like to share with my colleagues here today is the growing cooperation in law enforcement that we are having with Thailand. 
   Madam Speaker, last week, Viktor Bout, the most notorious of international arms dealers, was brought into custody by Thai authorities. A criminal complaint was unsealed in New York detailing Viktor Bout's efforts to sell mass amounts of weapons to the FARC, a foreign terrorist organization that operates in Colombia. 
   He was arrested in the final stages of arranging a sale of millions of dollars of high-powered weapons, including 100 advanced shoulder-fired missiles capable of taking out airliners. With the cooperation of Thai authorities, the ``Merchant of Death,'' as Viktor Bout is known, is out of the game. He is being retired from the role he has played in the killings and maimings around the world. And this is good news to anyone who cares about checking strife in Africa, anyone who cares about stopping those who armed child soldiers, anyone who cares about checking support for transnational terrorists. 
   Because while many were attempting to stop conflicts across Africa, this is the individual who was pouring fuel on the fire. In U.N. report after U.N. report, Viktor Bout was cited as the chief sanctions buster, supplying arms to anyone who could pay. And I saw this up close when I chaired the Africa subcommittee and when I traveled across the continent. It is a bloody trail from Liberia and then across sub-Saharan Africa that he left. 
   Bout simultaneously, by the way, also managed to arm the Taliban while he was arming the Northern Alliance. As I said, he has had dealings with the FARC in Colombia, and he has been connected with Hezbollah. He is an international menace who needs to face justice, and we look forward to his expeditious extradition to the United States. And thank you to the Thai authorities, because they are the ones who took him into custody.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (CALLING FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO THE CURRENT ELECTORAL CRISIS IN KENYA -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. I would like to begin by commending the gentleman from New Jersey, Chairman Payne, of the Africa Subcommittee. I want to thank him for introducing this resolution that addresses the troublesome violence that is occurring today in Kenya, and I would like to recognize the good work of the subcommittee's ranking member, Mr. Smith, as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, the situation in Kenya has been described. Since the post-election violence erupted at the end of December, we know that now over 1,000 Kenyans have been killed. We know that a quarter million souls have been forced to flee from their homes. Many of these homes have been burned. Many individuals have been burned. As this resolution notes, international observers found the election to be seriously flawed, implicating the government. Today, as Kenya's politicians fight for power, its people suffer and some of those people are suffering terribly. 
   This resolution calls on President Mwai Kibaki and opposition candidate Raila Odinga to accept external assistance to find their way out of this. This has been occurring of late with the former U.N. Secretary General bringing about some progress. But without this, the factions seem incapable of moving ahead on their own. 
   The resolution also calls for holding accountable those responsible for violence. Widespread violence can almost always be traced back to ringleaders. That was the case in Rwanda, where a small band sparked a genocide. Kenyans don't want their country ripped apart, but a small number of recruiters, I suspect, are leading it in that way. We should do our best to let would-be killers, including government officials, know that the world is watching and they will face the consequences if they incite violence. 
   The State Department's top official charged with Africa recently called the violence ``ethnic cleansing.'' We cannot be complacent. The potential for violence spiraling upward should never be discounted. This is the reason, of course, that our Peace Corps is leaving Kenya. 
   Looking back a few months, the U.S. and the international community was complacent and somewhat naive about  the Kenyan elections. News reports and analysts expressed surprise over the election violence. I chaired the Africa Subcommittee for 8 years working with Chairman Payne. There is a tendency, an understandable one, to see African ``successes,'' and Kenya has been described as one. While many African countries have made progress, many African countries face fundamental and very difficult challenges that leave them very vulnerable. A better realization of that, a more realistic view, I think, would lead to a better Africa policy. 
   Kenya is a very important country. Its economy is key to East Africa. This violence has been economically devastating to many Kenyans. We have terrorism concerns in the region. So we have humanitarian and other reasons, other reasons besides just the question of the inhumanity here to help Kenyans move forward. It is Kenyans themselves who must look within to help get out of this crisis. But the U.S. and others should help, and this resolution calls for that help. I urge support for it, and I commend Chairman Payne for authoring it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 287 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the launch of Explorer I and the birth of an era of United States space exploration. 
   On January 31, 1958, the United States officially entered space as Explorer I successfully reached orbit. At a time when our Nation feared the worst from the Soviet Union, the successful launch of Sputnik supercharged anxiety. Our Nation responded, and responded quickly. 
   Explorer I, however, was more than just an emphatic response to Sputnik. It was achieved important scientific discoveries, as well. As mechanical engineer Carl Maggio noted, all involved ``liked the difference between our satellite and Sputnik,'' because ``ours flew science, the Van Allen experiment.'' Indeed, amongst the numerous discoveries made by Explorer I, one of the most important was the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belt, a discovery that would be considered as one of the most outstanding discoveries of the International Geophysical Year. 
   This past weekend, I had the opportunity to visit the home of Explorer I--Jet Propulsion Laboratories. Seeing this extraordinary accomplishment in person, I couldn't help but feel a swell of pride knowing that this satellite was the humble beginning of our Nation's esteemed space program. An old proverb holds that even the greatest of journeys begins with a single step. The launch of Explorer I was that first step, and it helped pave the way for a half-century of space exploration. Today, JPL missions have rovers on Mars, evaluating soil samples on a microscopic level. 
   To conclude, I would like to quote the NASA Chief historian Steven J. Dick, who observed that ``Like the railroad and the airplane, spaceflight has impacted society in ways even the visionaries could not have foreseen, and that we cannot fully fathom even today.'' Indeed, through the space program, we continue to make important discoveries whose benefits amaze generations to come.

   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to start off by thanking Mrs. BLACKBURN, Messrs. KING, HUNTER, FRANKS, BILBRAY, Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite, Mrs. Capito, and Mrs. Drake for all coming together and working towards this amendment. 
   This amendment will give badly needed funding to the border security fence as provided by the law in the Secure Fence Act. Congress authorized it last year, provided funding to get it started in the 2007 DHS spending bill. 
   The point I would like to make, although Congress mandated the construction of 847 miles of fencing, to date only 13.01 miles have been completed. And as you know, it is supposed to be a double-border fence, and only one-half of the 13.01 miles is completed in the sense it is only one side of the fence. 
   So the amendment being offered today takes funding made available in  the bill for border protection and directs it to the fencing. 
   This amendment will give the administration, I think, what it needs to construct the remaining portions of the border fence. It is vital to national security. I had a number of hearings down on the border when I was chairman of the Terrorism and Nonproliferation Subcommittee. But Border Patrol told me about the effectiveness of the fence. There are over 400 attacks on Border Patrol agents a year. They need this fence. They find it is a great force multiplier. It extends their capacity. It allows them the discretion to redeploy agents to areas where they are not vulnerable or at risk. 
   Frankly, I think we have a difference of opinion on how important it is to follow the law under the Secure Fence Act with the administration. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).

   I have talked to Border Patrol agents who have made apprehensions on that border, and I can tell you the San Diego fence has not only cut the crime rate by half in San Diego, but also on the Mexican side, and nobody has designed a way to get around the San Diego fence. This double-border fence works. It is what the Border Patrol has asked me for and testified up here for. 
   And 69 percent in the polling last night by Rasmussen, actually the polling was on the 12th, 69 percent of the public say they want, they favor an approach focusing on securing the border with this kind of approach.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am rising to oppose the rule. As I think you know, we are going to end up in a circumstance here, according to our Director of National Intelligence, where, for the first time, frankly, this refusal to protect our telecom companies, who face some 40 lawsuits and billions of dollars, our refusal to allow for the protection for them to defend themselves will end up stopping the intelligence professionals from conducting surveillance of foreign persons in foreign countries. It's really because they cannot read the minds of their terrorist targets and guarantee that they would not call the United States or one of their people in the United States. 
   Unfortunately, sometimes they do. Mahmood Karimi came into this country in the trunk of a car over the border of Mexico after paying $5,000. He was the brother, by the way, of the Hezbollah general in southern Lebanon who launched the attacks there. 
   I was in Haifa in August, and the Prime Minister of Israel, by the way, told me that one of his great concerns was the advantages that had been given up and the knowledge that had now become known to the terrorists. He said one of the reasons we are having such difficulty with Hezbollah is because they now know how the United States, how other countries were able to apprehend the information before these attacks came. 
   But in any event, the brother of the individual who was launching those attacks some years ago actually came into the United States. I am certain somehow he got phone calls out of Beirut, and I am sorry if we violated his constitutional rights. I know there is the assumption that once a foreign agent from a foreign country is in this country, we don't have the right to monitor and violate his civil rights. 
   Here is what I do know about this individual: I know that he did manage to get through our southern border in my State. I know that somehow we apprehended him up in Detroit. I know that  once we did, we found 50 of his cohorts who were part of the Hezbollah cell. 
   Now, I am not making the allegation that we used this kind of intelligence in order to apprehend him, because, frankly, I don't know how we apprehended him. I only give you that example to say these are the types of individuals who are operating. He was trained by Iran; he was trained by foreign intelligence. He was here in the United States, and I imagine in one case out of 1,000, when someone is trying to make a phone call from Beirut to their agent, let's say in Syria, occasionally that call might come into the United States because there might be a foreign agent here. 
   The point I want to make is that this is, frankly, more protection than Americans get under court-ordered warrants in Mob and other criminal cases. The issue we are debating, frankly, is pretty important. It's an issue of life and death, frankly, as far as I am concerned. 
   I serve as the ranking member of the Terrorism and Nonproliferation Subcommittee. That there have not been attacks on our soil since 9/11 is due to the improved surveillance in real-time that we are able to conduct against foreign terrorists. 
   Now, that good record in no way should lead us to discount the jihadists, because the image of Osama bin Laden's allies operating in some remote terrain somewhere may give the impression that our foes are isolated. I want to share with you, because of the Internet our foes are not isolated. We are confronting a virtual caliphate. Radical jihadists are physically disbursed, but they are united through the Internet. They use the tool there to recruit and plot their terrorist attacks. They use electronic communications for just such a purpose, and they are very sophisticated in that use. 
   How has the West attempted to confront that? Well, the British used Electronic surveillance in real-time and they used it last year to stop the attack on 10 transatlantic flights. They prevented that attack a year ago by wiretapping. The French authorities used wiretaps to lure jihadists basically into custody and prevented a bomb attack. 
   Given this threat, it is unfathomable that we would weaken our most effective preventive tool. That's exactly what this bill does, in the opinion of Admiral McConnell, whose job it is to protect our security. Admiral McConnell said that we are actually missing a significant portion of what we should be getting. Now, he has served both Democratic and Republican administrations with distinction. 
   I would ask those so distrustful, go ahead, discount his estimate, cut them in half, say we lose one-third of our intelligence as a result of this bill passing and the problems that we foment with telecom companies around the world. I would argue that is too much to give up. I don't want to lose a single percent of our intelligence on terrorist communications. With nuclear and biological material floating around the globe, we don't have that margin of error.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my opposition to H.R. 1427. 
   H.R. 1427 is supposed to be legislation to reform oversight of the Nation's 14 housing government-sponsored enterprises. That would be our two GSEs, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and 12 Federal Home Loan Banks. 
   Over the past number of years, I have worked very hard to reform legislation of these GSEs. I believe better oversight is needed to protect our Nation's housing sector from disruption should one of the GSEs face financial difficulty. 
   I am disappointed that I will not be able to support the bill authored by our committee's chairman. However, to be fair, I do acknowledge that the chairman has added a number of positive provisions to this year's bill. And I would also like to thank the chairman for his willingness to work on improving the section on receivership. 
   Improvements aside, I am deeply troubled that legislation intended to improve the safety and soundness of the GSEs has become a vehicle to redistribute wealth. The Affordable Housing Fund in this bill unnecessarily confiscates money from the mortgage market. I adamantly oppose the creation of an Affordable Housing Fund today, as I have since its inception. 
   In 2005, I was the first Member of Congress to offer an amendment in a Financial Services Committee to strike the reform from GSE legislation. Since then, I have continuously and consistently opposed the housing fund in any form, shape or size. As I said over 2 years ago, the creation of this fund is an experiment in socialism, and anyone supporting its adoption is attempting to countermand the basic principles of free markets and limited government. 
   With that expression, I will yield back to the ranking member.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (SENSE OF HOUSE THAT JAPAN SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR ITS IMPERIAL ARMED FORCE'S COERCION OF YOUNG WOMEN INTO SEXUAL SLAVERY -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 121, the Comfort Women Resolution--a resolution that I have supported since its initial introduction in the 109th Congress. 
   Beginning in the 1930s, the Imperial Government of Japan orchestrated the enslavement of up to 200,000 young Korean women. Many were abducted from their homes and sent to Japanese military brothels. Others were lured from their homes under the false pretense of employment. In what was one of the worst cases of human trafficking of the 20th century, the trauma that these women suffered drove many to conceal their past, either too embarrassed or scared to speak of it. The surviving victims deserve the recognition that they so desire. 
   To this day, Japan maintains that this issue is closed and the sufferings of individuals inflicted in the war have already been dealt by treaties normalizing its ties with other Asian countries. Some have pointed to Prime Minister Abe's April 27th statement as a formal apology, yet both the Prime Minister himself and Japan's Foreign Ministry went on record to disavow any alleged apology. It is important that the Japanese government confronts this dark part of Japanese history. 
   This resolution is as much about today as it is about yesterday. The world's strength to oppose killing today is made greater by accountability, for actions present, but also past. It's weakened by denial of accountability and obfuscation of past acts. History is a continuum that affects today and tomorrow. It's much harder to get tomorrow right if we get yesterday wrong. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (CONGRESSIONAL IMMIGRATION CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I would like to start by congratulating Congressman Bilbray for his position as head of the Immigration Caucus. I thank him, also, for taking on this tough, but very important, issue. 
   What I wanted to make as a point, Mr. Speaker, was that before 9/11 border security was not seen as a national security matter. But we, as an institution, asked the 9/11 Commission to give us direction, to look at how 9/11 occurred and to suggest steps that we should take. Today, thanks to the 9/11 Commission, we now know that national security must be the number one priority when it comes to border security policy. 
   The commission found that our immigration system has, in their words, ``the greatest potential to develop an expanded role in counterterrorism.'' And I think that still holds true today.  
   The challenge we face for national security in an age of terrorism is to prevent the very few people who pose overwhelming risks from entering or remaining in the United States undetected. And terrorists, unfortunately, have used evasive methods to enter and stay in our country, including specific travel methods and routes over the border, liaisons with corrupt government officials, human smuggling networks, and immigration and identity fraud. This needs to be addressed. It is elementary. It is imperative as well to border security to know who is coming into the country. I don't think anyone today can say with any certainty that we know who is crossing our borders. 
   When I was chairman of the Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation, I held field hearings on the border in San Diego and in Laredo, Texas. One thing that was expressed at these hearings is that the border fence that was built in San Diego is very effective. The double fence on that border, according to the Border Patrol that testified at these hearings about the effectiveness of the border fence, is, as they said, a great force multiplier. The reason they wanted to expand the fence and the reason we passed legislation to do that and included an appropriation of $1.2 billion to do it was partly because the Border Patrol told us that there were over 400 attacks on the Border Patrol and that if they could have that double border fence the way they had it in San Diego at other routes where the smugglers cross, that would help protect them. They said it expanded their enforcement capability; it has allowed them the discretion to redeploy agents to areas of vulnerability or risk. It is one component, they said, that certainly has been integral, in their words, to everything we have accomplished raising the level of our security in San Diego. What happened in San Diego? The crime rates on both sides of that border, which had been lawless, dropped by over 50 percent on the San Diego side and on the Tijuana side. 
   With the establishment of the border fence in San Diego, crime rates fell off dramatically, but also vehicle drive-thrus fell off. San Diego is no longer one of the most prolific drug smuggling corridors. It was cut by over 90 percent. 
   The bill that we passed last year puts a fence where it is needed most, in the areas that have the highest instances of drug smuggling, human trafficking, gang activity. All of the smugglers' routes, where there are roads, basically, through those areas, all of that will be fenced with a double border fence. It would allow the Border Patrol to better focus its resources and better protect our borders. 
   Now, we have some say that to finish that project would cost $3 billion. Well, $3 billion is less than the cost of the 250,000 inmates who have committed felonies, who are here illegally in the United States. The cost to the taxpayers in one year is more than the cost of building that double border fence. 
   But the focus I want to make here, the point I want to make, it is a matter of national security. We had Kris Kobach testify at my hearings. He was chief adviser on immigration law to former Attorney General John Ashcroft. And he spoke of concern about terrorists illegally crossing our borders into this country. I will just share with you a couple of cases he cited. 
   Mahmoud Kourani was one; he was indicted in 2004. He paid to be smuggled out of Beirut, Lebanon; paid $3,000 to the Mexican Consulate to be smuggled into Mexico. And at that point he paid a smuggling organization to bring him in the trunk of a car over to the United States. This is the brother of the Hezbollah general who was in charge of security in the southern sector of Lebanon at the time that the attacks occurred. He was involved in the attacks against Israel. I was there in Israel in August. I visited Rambam Hospital when the city was under rocket attack and saw some of the effects of Hezbollah there in that country, where there were 500 civilian victims in that hospital. 
   And I can just tell you that his brother pleaded guilty to providing material support to Hezbollah. He had been trained in Iran in every method of explosives, and he was sentenced to 5 years in our prison, along with some of his colleagues, who were also caught as a result of our operations.     
   Kobach went on to cite a second case involving Farida Ahmed, who was on a terrorist watch list. He was on that watch list because he was suspected of being an al Qaeda operative trying to get into the United States. Ahmed was caught in Texas at McAllen Miller International Airport on July 19, 2004. He was trying to get up to New York City. He produced a South African passport with pages torn out and with no U.S. entry stamps. He later confessed to entering the country illegally by crossing the Rio Grande River. 
   In 2005, 3,722 individuals from state sponsors of terrorism or countries with terrorist ties were caught trying to illegally enter the United States. I know some of the stories from border guards who have told me. One showed me his injuries that he sustained when he stopped an individual who originally was from Uzbekistan, had been trained, he said, in an Afghan training camp. This was the individual's second attempt to enter illegally into the United States. The first time he had tried to fly in through an airport and he was turned back. This time he came over the border. When he was caught, he was motivated enough, the individual, to bite the shoulder of the Border Patrol agent so severely that the Border Patrol agent had to be hospitalized. 
   The reality is that we have some very determined foes attempting to get into the United States and our experience with Hezbollah agents frankly should awaken us to the fact that we should take the advice of the Border Patrol when they say to us, give us that double border fence. We have had over 400 attacks in 1 year or instances of violence against our agents. Give us the double border fence we need. 
   Well, we have got the appropriation. We have got the authorization. The first appropriation for $1.2 billion. We need several billion more to finish the whole project. But we should take their advice. It's past time we strengthen operational control of our borders and ports through additional physical barriers and fencing and greater use of state-of-the-art technology and surveillance across our entire border. 
   The border fence is needed, it's needed now, so one of my goals, and I am sure the caucus's goals, is to ensure that the fence gets the funding it needs and that the entire 700 miles gets built as the act that was signed into law says it should be built. 
   I thank you again, Congressman Bilbray; Mr. Speaker, thank you, and I will yield back to Congressman BRIAN BILBRAY of San Diego.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. If the gentleman will yield, I was in your fine city and had an opportunity to go down to visit some of the Border Patrol agents that I talk with and work with. One of them showed me a station across from the Border Patrol station on the U.S. side, and he said that in that station, they had actually filmed work on a tunnel, it was actually on Mexico property, that one of the cartels was building, digging a tunnel, and they turned over, he said, to the Mexican government, and the Mexican equivalent of the FBI arrested two Border Patrol agents, customs agents on the Mexican side who were involved with the cartels in actually supervising the digging of that tunnel. 
   The point I am making is that there is a degree of corruption here in some of the institutions in Mexico which have unfortunately led to a lack of cooperation in enforcement of our borders. And because of that lack of cooperation, I think it is doubly important that not only we go forward with the effort to fill these tunnels, but let's again get the fence that the Border Patrol says it needs built.

   Mr. ROYCE. It is certainly true that the lack of border security leads to a criminal element controlling that border. In this case, it is the cartels. And it is important to remember again that the erection of the border fence in San Diego led not only to a reduction of crime on the U.S. side by more than 50 percent but again led to a reduction of crime on the Mexican side of the border and in Tijuana by more than 50 percent. Why? Because of the very point you have just made, the cartels lost control once the rule of law was applied to that sector of the border and law enforcement was able to get in control.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. While I support this legislation, we should be doing better, much better. And unfortunately, Madam Speaker, many in the majority are undermining our interests throughout the Andean region. 
   There is no excuse, in my view, for bottling up the Colombia TPA which should be on this floor. It is a much better proposal than what we are debating today. Without the Colombia TPA, we are denying American businesses and workers greater access to Colombia. 
   With this legislation today, American exporters will continue to pay tariffs to Colombia, 80 percent on beef, 15 percent on tractors. So unlike the Colombia TPA which slashes Colombian taxes on our exports, this bill does nothing to increase U.S. exports to Colombia or to the three other countries it includes. 
   It is ironic that many who routinely attack trade agreements are giving Colombia preferential treatment and getting little in return when there is so much opportunity. With the Colombia TPA, we could get on a two-way street, one that lifts American workers as well. We could also have a deal that is stronger on labor protections. But many in the majority are settling for less, and far less at that. 
   And then there are our strategic interests in Colombia. It is our closest partner in a very important region. Colombia is locked in a deadly struggle with well-financed forces, undemocratic, terrorist and drug trafficking forces. Its government has made great strides against the narcoterrorists and improved the economy for millions. It has significantly reduced violence against labor leaders. This is major progress for Colombia. 
   The Colombia TPA is the next step for our partnership. Instead, with our inaction we are kicking Colombia, jeopardizing our regional standing. This bill is a poor substitute for the Colombia TPA. I know the chairman would like to do more. Let's get to the real business of approving that important agreement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, let me just make the observation that today is Tax Day, and effectively what we are doing to the American taxpayers is making them jump through more hoops. Certainly if they have an HSA, and the costs of this program are projected to be about a half a billion dollars a year, what we are going to be doing, what we are doing in bringing this bill to the floor, is enacting burdensome bureaucratic regulations that are going to undermine those health savings accounts which have been proven successful at slowing the growth of health costs and cutting insurance premiums for millions of individuals and small businesses. And my colleague has just listed all the business groups that are opposed to this legislation. 
   The question I guess I have is in the last session, we had a largely bipartisan bill that the Republicans put forward, with Democratic support, 407-7 it passed. But now we have this provision dropped into this bill that cripples health savings accounts. Now I know we have a philosophical difference of opinion on whether we want to keep health care private and do it through the marketplace, or whether we want to have a government nationalization and takeover of health care. What I am sharing with you is if you cripple HSAs in this way, I guess you do build momentum for a government takeover of health care. But that is not going to make savings for the American consumers. 
   HSAs are effective in reducing costs for the consumer. And I have got to tell you, these new burdens are unnecessary. They are inefficient. They are inconsistent with the flexibility purposely afforded HSAs at their inception. These provisions undermine efforts by employers, individuals and insurers to reduce health care costs and improve health outcomes. 
   How is it possible that we are going to consider a program here where it will take longer to receive reimbursements and will require individuals to come up with money out of their own pocket, potentially hundreds of dollars, on occasion $1,000 or so, at one time under this new proposal? 
   I just think that this new step of independent substantiation frankly helps only one company, or a very limited number of companies who offer such bureaucratic systems and imposes costs on all of the rest. This is going to increase the costs for the banks, for the account administrators, and for the individual who uses them. And it is going to be passed on to the consumers. 
   So we do complain about the charges which banks and other commercial lending institutions pass on to their customers. But why have this provision that is going to increase those costs on the consumer? This does not make sense. Health savings accounts were created to reduce the growth of health care costs. And they have achieved some noteworthy successes. But this bill is going to lead to increased health care costs for individuals by crippling HSAs. Don't taxpayers have enough to worry about on Tax Day? 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule so we can fix this bill and provide a little relief to hardworking Americans on April 15.

   Mr. ROYCE. Madam Chairman, I serve as the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. What this underlying bill cuts is the funding for European missile defense that would be situated in Poland, which would catch an attack from Iran in the boost phase. 
   Now, the reason this is important, why are we worried about Iran in this, the IAEA inspectors, if you recall, this last weekend were shocked to find that Iran had made very fast progress on enrichment of uranium needed to make a nuclear bomb. They said this made it clear that technological advances in Iran are coming on very, very fast. 
   The proposed missile defense deployments in Poland and the Czech Republic that this amendment supports would thus help the United States and Europe. It's supported by Poland, the Czech Republic, the U.K., and frankly to cut it right now makes no sense. 
   Sixteen of the last 17 tests have been successful. This Congress, again, should not weaken our missile defense, especially at a time when we found North Korea transferring this missile technology to Iran. We can see this coming. Pass this amendment.

   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I am a coauthor also on this resolution, and I just want to say that this was the worst, most horrific bombing in the history of Argentina. 
   Their state prosecutor found that this attack was organized by the highest leaders of the government of Iran whom at the same time entrusted the execution of this operation to Hezbollah. 
   We have watched as Iran has empowered Hezbollah to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars and sent this organization out to establish contacts throughout Central America and throughout Latin America. I would remind my colleagues that it was Mahmoud Qomati, the brother of the Hezbollah general who carried out the attacks on Lebanon, the rocket attacks in 2006. That individual was caught in our own country. His brother  was caught in our own country, having been smuggled in in the trunk of a car across California and up to Detroit. And subsequently, he and 50 of his other associates in Hezbollah here in the United States were arrested and are now serving time. They were found to have received their training from the Iranian government. They had been trained in terror tactics. They had been trained in the ability to conduct attacks. 
   You know, the state prosecutor of Argentina stated that the government of Iran uses terrorism as a mechanism of its foreign policy. As he said, its final link is to export its radicalized vision of Islam and to eliminate the enemies of the regime. 
   Chairman Berman is right when he says there has to be justice. We have to capture and punish those responsible. This resolution is an attempt to do that. Along with Chairman Berman, one of the architects of this resolution, is the gentlelady from Florida.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (HONORING NELSON MANDELA ON HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The world recently celebrated Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday in London, and so much has been said about him. But in a world of division, a world of many deadly divisions, it's appropriate that Congress is once again making note of Mandela's legacy of unity. And I think Mr. Payne and the other authors of this resolution should be commended. 
   I should note also that I think Chairman Berman's legislation recently signed into law that took Mandela and other African National Congress members off the terrorism list is a move that was long, long overdue. 
   Nelson Mandela served 27 years in prison for opposing apartheid. At his trial, he stood in the face of the possible sentence of death. After being freed from captivity, which were very hard years on Robben Island, he easily could have let bitterness consume him. He could have sought revenge. Some predicted that South Africa would spiral into chaos suffering racial and tribal violence. So many other countries have. Many predicted a ruined economy. But fortunately for South Africans, it was Nelson Mandela who took the helm. 
   Mandela is a unifier. He is an exceptional unifier. Consider that he invited a former white jailer of his to attend his presidential inauguration as a guest. He invited the man who prosecuted him to a presidential lunch. He made it a point to learn the language of the Afrikaners, the architects of apartheid, and to embrace their beloved rugby, making it an obsession for the whole South African nation and signaling to all people that they had a place in the country. 
   With these and countless other acts of reconciliation, Nelson Mandela navigated a very treacherous transition for South Africa into majority rule. Nelson Mandela left power after serving only one term as his country's first president elected by universal suffrage. He was lionized. He could have served longer, but he stepped down. What a contrast, what a contrast to the petty tyrant to the north, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe who was a fellow liberation leader who instead of championing democracy as Nelson Mandela did, instead desperately clung to power bringing his country to ruin. Mandela walked away. And he hasn't meddled with his successor's presidency. And Nelson Mandela has spoken out about human rights around the world, including the tyranny of Zimbabwe. 
   I don't agree with every position that Nelson Mandela the politician took. He opposed America on some important issues. South Africa, in general, is too wedded to a nonaligned ideology. Yet this doesn't diminish this man's tremendous political accomplishment and his character defined by dignity, courage, warmth, humor, and so many other attributes, nor his positive impact worldwide. 
   South Africa isn't without many difficult challenges. The rule of law is coming under challenge because of rampant crime. Unemployment is high. Economic expectations are unrealistic. The U.S. has an interest in working with South Africa as we are to see that this young democracy meets these challenges. The future will tell. But what is certain is that South Africa would be in a far, far tougher spot were it not for the career of Nelson Mandela. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (NORTH KOREAN HUMAN RIGHTS REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise again in support of this North Korean Human Rights Act. 
   I think it's very difficult to communicate the conditions of North Korea to those who have not seen those who have survived the torture, have not seen the malnourished children from North Korea. But 2 weeks ago was North Korean Human Rights--North Korean Freedom Week is what we call it now, and I had the opportunity to meet with Shin Dong Hyuk, who was a North Korean defector. And this particular young man was actually born in the prison camp. He was raised in that prison camp. He talked about the torture that was done to him when his parents were executed for trying to escape. And he told me how, after he escaped from the North Korean gulag, he couldn't believe the colors of life outside the prison walls because people in North Korea actually had clothes that were colorful. That's something he had never seen throughout his life living in that gulag. 
   And that's some statement about the North Korean prison system considering what life itself in North Korea means. It is a total denial of political, civil and religious liberties; no dissent or criticism of Kim Jong-il. The media, of course, is tightly controlled by the regime. There is severe physical abuse dolled out to citizens who violate any restriction. There are, of course, food shortages as the regime distributes food based on perceived loyalty. And in the ``no go'' areas, they don't get the food. The food goes to the ruling elite and the military. 
   The North Korean Human Rights Act will be an important tool to bring about change in North Korea because this bill places an emphasis, among other things, on broadcasting into North Korea, setting forth a plan to bring 12 hours per day of broadcasting. And the reason I think, Mr. Speaker, that those broadcasts are going to be helpful, those expanded broadcasts, is because of the role they play in bringing objective news and the truth to a closed society. 
   Fifty years ago, we had the experience with RFE/RL starting its broadcast into the Eastern Bloc, presenting objective news and the democratic ideal over the airwaves. And today we have a situation where Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa both say that those radio broadcasts were essential to Poland and the Czech Republic's freedom struggle. 
   North Korea is the world's most secluded society, but this is changing. We do a little bit of broadcasting there now. And now, 30 percent of those who escape tell us they're listening to the broadcast; that includes civil servants and military officers. But there are also the cell phones and the DVDs that are making their way over from China. And these broadcasts will be key in shattering the state-sponsored lies that people are listening to. 
   Lastly, let me mention that we are in the midst of Six-Party Talks here with North Korea trying to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program. A key part of any agreement is verification. There are different standards of verification, and I'm concerned that the administration will settle, frankly, for a low standard. 
   In deciding what's acceptable in a deal, it's useful to understand the nature of the other party. And I'd just like to close with this thought: A regime that massively abuses its own people, as North Korea does, puts no value on paper agreements. Andrei Sakharov made this point some years ago about the nature of a regime and the way it treats its own citizens, and how, therefore, in dealing with that kind of a regime you better get verification. And we'd better understand that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   This measure before us addresses a number of objectives, I think all of them related to security assistance, and one of those is reform of the State Department's export control office. I think all of us know that it's been far too long that this office has been antiquated. It's been incapable of functioning well in a world of rapidly evolving technology, and what we need to do is a better job facilitating exports by focusing on those items that pose a true risk to our national security. This measure attempts to do that. It prevents those exports, while allowing U.S.-made exports to markets overseas. 
   I'd also like to thank Chairman Berman for including the key elements of H.R. 5443, which is the United States-Republic of Korea Defense Cooperation Improvement Act, in this underlying legislation. And this bill, which was authored by myself and Representative Tauscher, upgrades South Korea's military procurement status. It streamlines defense sales to South Korea. It puts Seoul basically on the same plane as members of NATO and Australia and New Zealand and Japan, and thus, it improves our defense cooperation. I think it's interesting that our top commander in Korea called it ``bizarre and strange'' to use his words that South Korea doesn't already enjoy this status. 
   Mr. Speaker, the U.S.-South Korean alliance I think is quite distinct. With a Mutual Defense Treaty that dates back to 1953, Korea and the U.S. form the most integrated alliance I think of interoperable forces. On the Korean Peninsula, interoperability by the way is not just a buzz word for the military forces there. It's a real life practice, and passage of this legislation would help cement that interoperability. 
   I'd also like to recognize the ranking member of the committee, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for the inclusion in this bill of important language regarding North Korea and its nuclear program. The language in the underlying bill smoothes the way for dismantlement activities in North Korea, but it makes it clear that Congress expects a complete declaration on North Korean activities. This includes not just its plutonium program but its uranium program as well and proliferation business as well as the uranium. The intelligence community assesses that this activity, by the way, continues to this day, and indeed, North Korea is helping to fuel an arms race in the Middle East. 
   So this bill includes important language on verification, which despite the rhetoric has not been taken seriously by the administration to date.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (ZIMBABWE -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, there is an issue of critical concern to the human rights movement around the world and a critical concern to the continent of Africa. And it is because tonight, I just want to report, that the country of Zimbabwe is in very, very grim and dire shape. President Robert Mugabe has plundered his country, driving it to ruin. And you know a little bit about the violence that you have seen on television over the last 72 hours. A once prosperous economy has been devastated by misrule; inflation is running at 200,000 percent per year, and life expectancy there has been driven down to a mere 34 years. 
   This was once a major agricultural exporter to the rest of Africa, but many Zimbabweans are now facing starvation because Mugabe has kicked productive farmers off his land. His regime has used food as a weapon; he rewards backers; he starves and punishes opponents. As Karl Marx said: Those who will not obey will not eat. 
   Today, after 28 years of misrule, Mugabe is trying to steal the election, cracking heads to extend his reign. Defeated at the ballot box, the regime has simply refused to release official election results. And, instead, what has it done? It has stepped up its violence against the people across the countryside. It has arrested and killed its political opponents. 3,000 families have been forced from their homes. The torture chambers are full. Human rights groups report on those dead and those tortured to death. Ominously, the regime has charged the opposition presidential candidate with treason, and we know what that means, a charge that could signal the beginning of massive violence against the majority that supported the movement for democratic change. 
   We should remember that this is the same Robert Mugabe that engineered a massacre in Southern Zimbabwe in Matabeleland in the early 1980s, and he used North Korean troops, North Korean trained troops. Those in the countryside can show you the wells, as they showed us, where those North Korean troops of the fifth brigade directed the local villagers be thrown down alive down those wells and be killed. And that spate of killing took thousands and thousands of lives across the country. So, this is an autocrat who has stopped at nothing. And he has allies. 
   As we speak, a Chinese freighter is adrift somewhere off the western coast of Africa looking for a friendly port to unload a shipment destined for Zimbabwe. And in the hull of that ship is 3 million rounds of AK-47 ammo, 1,500 rounds of 40 millimeter rockets, 2,703 rounds of 60 millimeter mortar bombs. This cargo could quickly turn Zimbabwe into a killing field. 
   China has played a similar role elsewhere, fueling other African violence, showing contempt for African lives. It provided the machetes to the Hutu militia to carry out its 1994 genocide. Beijing is arming the government in Sudan, which is committing genocide in Darfur with those weapons. It does this for political influence and Beijing does it for economic gain, especially oil and mineral wealth. China is currently Zimbabwe's largest investor and second largest trading partner, where it secures much needed natural resources for China. But it is also its armory. 
   But the thing I have to reported tonight is that China is running into roadblocks, because last week South African port and truck workers refused to move this 70-ton weapons shipment to Zimbabwe. They were made aware of it by an investigative journalist. Their strike was backed by the South African union movement which said: South Africa cannot be seen to be facilitating the flow of weapons into Zimbabwe at a time when there is a political dispute and a volatile situation. 
   The spokesman was being diplomatic. South African labor has been one of the few to pointedly and vocally criticize Mugabe's tyranny. They despise the tyrant to their north and they called for an international boycott of this ship. And this is an inspiring event. 
   In the early 1970s, a labor leader at a Polish port stood up as well. Lech Walesa faced off against Soviet tyranny, demanding democracy and freedom for his native Poland. 
   This week, South African port workers said they weren't going to play any role in Mugabe's next slaughter. Their action hasn't brought down a tyranny, but it may have been the beginning of one's fall. For years, Mr. Speaker, neighboring countries have set back applauding Mugabe despite the many Zimbabweans he has beaten and killed. The South African government has been an offender in this. It has even given Mugabe means of cover. President Thabo Mbeki recently called the election normal, and denied the crisis in Zimbabwe. His government would have allowed the Chinese armed shipment to transit South Africa, but China decided to avoid the hassle at South African ports. This diplomatic support from South Africa and others has bolstered Mugabe at home. But, in the meantime, the neighbors have taken their lead. Their opposition has snowballed: Mozambique has said no. Namibia has said no. We hope tomorrow Angola says no, and sends this ship laden with its weapons back to China.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO END ITS CRACKDOWN IN TIBET -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res.1077. 
   I would like to first commend the Speaker on her timely resolution that calls on the Government of the People's Republic of China to end its crackdown in Tibet and to open a dialogue with His Holiness the Dalai Lama. 
   Importantly, this resolution calls on the Chinese Government to release all Tibetan prisoners who were detained for their nonviolent expression of opposition to Chinese policy towards Tibet, something with which I very much agree.  
   In 2002, the Tibetan Policy Act was ushered through Congress under the leadership of former chairmen Lantos and Hyde, and signed into law. Amongst its components was a U.S. commitment to the economic and cultural preservation of Tibetans inside Tibet. I believe that this resolution reaffirms this commitment. 
   For decades, Beijing has oppressed the Tibetan people. As the State Department's most recent annual report on human rights found, tight control on religious expression and denial of other basic human rights are cause for serious concern. China's further crackdowns on peaceful protestors of the Olympic torch relay serve to further affirm the State Department's report. 
   At the center of international media coverage of China's crackdown on Tibetan Buddhism is Radio Free Asia, a non-profit broadcast corporation that provides alternative news sources in repressive countries. In addition to covering the abuses wrought against the Tibetans, Radio Free Asia has also documented the Chinese destruction of precious Tibetan religious relics and manuscripts. It is not just the ethnic discrimination against Tibetans that gives me pause, but also the efforts to erase their culture. 
   I commend Radio Free Asia on their tireless efforts to broadcast truth, and I commend you, Madam Speaker, on your work on this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding me this time. 
   I must confess, I do not understand the compulsion to integrate PSI into international law under the United Nations. I share my ranking member's concern with the fact that weakening the Proliferation Security Initiative is going to have grave consequences for the security of this country. And it is going to have grave consequences for the administration's ability to interdict weapons of mass destruction material. This needlessly empowers the United Nations to weaken our hand. 
   Right now the Proliferation Security Initiative is a Bush administration multilateral initiative aimed at stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, interdicting those weapons of mass destruction on cargo, whether on land or in the air or at sea. It has been around since 2003. It is an aggressive response crafted by then-Under Secretary of Arms Control John Bolton, and it checks increasingly sophisticated proliferators. 
   As the proliferation subcommittee I chaired in the last Congress heard in hearings, PSI has produced results. It has served as a strong deterrent to would-be proliferators, most recently conducting a joint exercise in the Persian Gulf where Iran menaces. PSI cooperation has stopped the transshipment of material and equipment bound for ballistic missile programs in countries of concern, including Iran. It has had a dozen successes, and it was critical in uncovering Libya's WMD program and the A.Q. Khan proliferation network in 2003 in Pakistan. 
   The key to PSI is its flexibility. The key is the ability to cooperate with other countries on a moment's notice. That is something that an organization like the United Nations inherently cannot do. Yet this bill before us instructs the President to pursue a U.N. Security Council resolution to authorize the PSI under international law. Putting a successful multilateral program up to a Chinese veto strikes me as weakening PSI rather than strengthening it, as is called for by the 9/11 Commission. 
   In 2005, then-Secretary Kofi Annan endorsed PSI as is, with no call for a Security Council resolution. By keeping PSI flexible, it avoids the lowest-common-denominator approach that U.N.-centered initiatives inevitably take. If the majority really wanted to bolster PSI, the other body should have kept its key champion, Ambassador Bolton, in place at the United Nations. 
   Now, as for the legislation to authorize the President to establish an International Arab and Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund to be located as a separate fund in Treasury or through the international organization or financial organization, naming UNESCO or the U.N. Development Program as possibilities, why would we locate this fund in UNESCO or UNDP, which would surely distort its goals and mismanage its resources? 
   The UNDP in 2005, as Israel was withdrawing from the Gaza Strip, financed the Palestinian Authority's production of propaganda materials, banners, bumper stickers and T-shirts bearing the slogan: ``Today Gaza, Tomorrow the West Bank and Jerusalem.'' This rightly led to protests from U.S. Representative John Bolton, who rightly called this funding inappropriate and unacceptable. 
   And then there is the UNDP's long record of hostility toward economic freedom. Has anyone thought through this fund? I do not think this fund was thought through, and I think a chance to go through the committee process would have allowed us the opportunity to raise these serious concerns. 
   Nor do I understand, frankly, the compulsion to give the United Nations this input and this ability to have the Security Council veto the authority we right now have in order to effectively use our Proliferation Security Initiative on the high seas.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (NATIONAL STALKING AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. I was the author of both the California law that first criminalized the act of stalking, first made it a felony, and then the Federal law some years later in 1996, which proceeded to do the same thing. 
   I thought I would share with the Members here some of the experiences of some of the victims that have gone through this particularly hellish nightmare of stalking. The case that I think carried the day in California in the State legislature was that of Kathleen Gallagher Baty, who was our witness, and she came back here and testified as well on behalf of this legislation. 
   Kathleen had been on the track team, I think it was UCLA at the time. She did not even know her stalker, but he became obsessed with this young woman. Throughout college, throughout her career, he managed to stalk and attempt to apprehend her. Time after time, there was nothing law enforcement could do except to really say, well, until he catches you, our hands are tied. 
   We had one period of time in 6 weeks when four different young women, all known to law enforcement, all believed to be in danger in Orange County, California, were all killed. In law enforcement, one of the officers told me, The worst thing for me personally that I have ever had to do with this job was to convey to her that our hands were tied until she was attacked. 
   He said, As a matter of fact, I was waiting to try to apprehend her stalker in the act of the attack, but, unfortunately, he killed her first, and then he killed himself when I tried to apprehend him. 
   Well, with Kathleen Gallagher's case, this finally ended. I had gotten a note from her father about what she had been through in her life. This finally ended on a porch in which he held her at knifepoint until she finally managed to get away. But because he hadn't drug her more than 800 feet, it was not an act of him trying to kidnap her under the law. 
   So looking at what had to be done, clearly, we had to take the action of stalking, define it as a crime in and of itself so that law enforcement could then intervene in these cases and tell a young man, Listen, these acts of threatening to kill your victim, telling her, if you can't have her, nobody can, threatening her in this way is now a felony. 
   That's what we did in California. Many other States picked this up. In 1996, I introduced the Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act here in Congress. We were able to get it through the House and the Senate, and it was signed by the President. 
   But what I wanted to share with the Members is that we have talked a little bit today about the 1.4 million victims every year. But this act is now law in countries, in Europe; it's now law in Japan. My office has been contacted over the years by many, many governments overseas, many legislators, parliamentarians who have said, We have this same phenomenon in our own country. If we gave law enforcement this ability to intercede in advance, we could protect the lives of many, many victims. 
   So I just wanted to share with the Members here a little bit of the history of the act. I would like to take this opportunity also to recognize Colleen Campbell, along with some of the other  Orange County victims' rights groups that worked over the years to get victims the rights they deserve. They worked on this particular act and also on proposition 115 out in California, the Crime Victims/Speedy Trial Initiative, which I cochaired and which was passed overwhelmingly by the voters in our State. 
   One of my hopes is that we can follow this up with Federal law at some point in time that does more than just put it in statute but that puts into the Constitution some of these basic rights. 
   But, in the meantime, the fact that we are establishing January as National Stalking Awareness Month gives us the opportunity to get the word out to young people, to those who are victims of obsessed stalkers, that there is a place they can turn to for help, and to remind law enforcement, and I wish we did more to train law enforcement in this particular area because I think there is a lot they can do to intercede, but to remind them of the ability to step in and remind those young, obsessed people who are threatening the life of someone, threatening someone with bodily harm, this is now a felony in the United States of America and you can serve 5 years in a Federal penitentiary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition as ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Terrorism Subcommittee. And I can share this: there has not been a terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11, and that is due in part to the improved surveillance in real-time that we are able to conduct against foreign terrorists. There is no disputing that. 
   I cannot help but feel that many of my colleagues have become so blinded by their hatred of this administration that they have put the threat from radical jihadists in the back of their mind. But given the threat, it is unfathomable that we would weaken our most effective preventive tool, and that is exactly what this bill does. 
   Before we unilaterally disarm, before we hobble our ability to listen in real-time to the very real terrorists who are plotting against our country around this globe, shouldn't we have something of an accounting of the supposed civil liberties price we are paying? 
   I asked the Congressional Research Service for such an accounting. They reported there is no available evidence of the type of privacy violations critics  are pointing at. The case can't be proven. 
   But under this bill, for the first time this bill would stop intelligence professionals from conducting surveillance of foreign persons in foreign countries unless they can read the mind of their terrorist targets and guarantee that they would not call into the United States, that they would not call one of their people here. 
   This is more protection than Americans get under court-ordered warrants in Mob and other criminal cases here in the United States that we are now granting these terrorists under this act. 
   We are, frankly, confronting a virtual caliphate. Radical jihadists are physically dispersed, but they are united through the Internet; and they use that tool to recruit and plot their terrorist attacks. They use electronic communications for just such a purpose. They are very sophisticated in that. 
   So how has the West attempted to confront that? Well, the British use electronic surveillance in real-time. They used it last year to stop the attack on 10 transatlantic flights, and they prevented that attack in August of last year by wiretapping. The French authorities used wiretaps to lure jihadists basically into custody; and, thereby, they prevented a bomb attack. 
   Given this threat, it is unfathomable that we would weakened our most effective preventive tool, and that is exactly what this bill does. 
   Before we passed the Protect America Act in August, the Director of National Intelligence told this Congress we are losing up to two-thirds of our intelligence on terrorist targets.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. I thank the gentleman. 
   I do rise in opposition to this bill and to explain a line of reasoning that the Wall Street Journal and other critics have pointed out on their editorial pages. This proposal, in fact, is a trial lawyer's dream. What this bill does is it, with very murky language, forbids banks for signing up borrowers for what is termed ``overly expensive loans.'' It requires banks to make sure that the consumer has a ``reasonable ability to repay the loan'' and insist that loans must be ``solely in the best interest of the consumer.'' This kind of murky language would invite litigation from every borrower who misses a payment. The Wall Street Journal says that if this bill becomes law, we can expect to read billboards reading, ``Behind on your mortgage? For relief, call 1-800 Sue-Your-Banker.'' 
   For the first time, under this act, banks that securitize mortgages would be made explicitly liable for violations of lending laws. This is a version of secondary liability that holds the bundlers and resellers of mortgages responsible for any mistakes of the original lenders. Now, the reselling of mortgages has been both a boon to the housing liquidity and risk diversification and, therefore, to lower interest rates for all of us that have taken out a loan. So to the extent that the bill adds a new risk element to securitizing subprime loans, and it surely will, the main loser will be the subprime borrower who will pay higher rates if he or she can get a loan at all. 
   Now, this debate is occurring during a challenging period for our mortgage market. What has transpired over the last few months has spread throughout our capital markets. It has the potential to slow the economy even further if we do this wrong. This bill is the wrong approach. 
   Now, we have had some signs of self-correction in the mortgage market. Lenders are underwriting mortgages  much more carefully as a result of market discipline. Products which have proven to be unfit for certain borrowers such low-doc loans, short-term hybrid ARMS, interest-only products, those are becoming increasingly hard to find. Those have been pushed out of the market. But the legislation before us today ignores such advances. Not only does this bill fail to account for the progress made in the market, it has the potential to seriously restrict access to credit for millions of Americans looking to purchase a home or refinance their mortgage. 
   In its present form, a borrower will have the ability to recover all of the principal and interest paid over the entire history of the loan as long as he can convince a court that he didn't have a reasonable ability to pay, as I said. At the time the loan was originated, again, it is not hard to imagine how language such as this is going to be abused and run up the costs of home mortgages for everyone.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (COMMENDING THE EFFORTS OF THOSE WHO SOUGHT TO BLOCK AN INTERNATIONAL ARMS TRANSFER DESTINED FOR ZIMBABWE -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, of which I am an original cosponsor. I worked on this draft. 
   And as we previously discussed during the debate of Mr. Payne's previous resolution, Zimbabwe is in very grim shape. We had a flawed election there in March, and Robert Mugabe launched a campaign of terror on his population as a consequence of that election going against him. 
   But Madam Speaker, this string of violence really could have turned into a blood bath were it not for the South African dock workers who stood up to say ``No.'' While post-election tensions there were very high, a Chinese ship pulled into the South African port of Durban to unload its cargo that was destined for Zimbabwe. On board were 3 million rounds of assault rifle ammunition, 3,000 mortar rounds, 1,500 rocket-propelled grenades. Left to the South African Government, whose President, Mbeki, has worked to protect Mugabe, the shipment would have no doubt been delivered. But fortunately the citizens of South Africa are ahead of their government in realizing the odious nature of the Zimbabwe regime and the members of that dock workers union stood upon and said ``No.'' A newspaper published the details of the shipment. The dock workers refused to unload it, public interest groups obtained a court order preventing the weapons transit. And denied access in South Africa, the ``ship of shame'' as South Africans began to call it, as African civil society dubbed it, went on to Mozambique, where it was turned away, went on to other ports in other countries where it was turned away, and it steamed back to China. 
   Africans stood up for fellow Africans; an inspiring event, indeed. And frankly, it reminded me in the early 1970s of when we saw a labor leader at a Polish port who stood up, and his name was Lech Walesa. And he faced off against Soviet tyranny and he demanded democracy and freedom for Poland. There were echoes of Lech Walesa in the South African port workers as they said they were not going to play a role in Mugabe's brutality. 
   Madam Speaker, the ``ship of shame'' also highlights the destructive role of China on the African continent, which has played the role of enabler in other African violence there. During the incident, a Chinese spokesman described the shipment as ``normal trade in military products,'' which speaks volumes about Beijing's policy of supplying weapons to regimes like Zimbabwe and Sudan. 
   China provided machetes to the Rwandan Government to carry out its 1994 genocide. It does this for political influence and for economic gain. And China is currently Zimbabwe's largest investor and second largest trading partner, where it secures much-needed natural resources. 
   China will, for the foreseeable future, continue to turn a blind eye to the conflicts that it helps ignite, all the while sticking to its so-called ``principle'' of ``noninterference.'' Clearly, this includes genocide and potential mass violence. 
   But this resolution is about Africans. We should give credit, as this resolution does, to those countries that have taken a strong stand, refusing to become complicit, no matter how small a role, in the fomentation of violence. And that is what these dock workers and others in civil society in Africa stood up and did. And I urge passage.

   Mr. ROYCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I'd also like to just take this opportunity to recognize Chairman Payne not just for this resolution but for all of his long years of work on engagement on the continent against human rights abuses, to end apartheid, to advance the cause of democracy, and I appreciate him introducing this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I would just like to also add my view that President Mugabe has destroyed the rule of law now in his country, in Zimbabwe, and 3 million people, as a result of the chaos, have fled. Life expectancy there is down to 34 years. 
   A bread basket has been turned into a basket case where there's little access for food and certainly no food available for those who are in areas where they're trying to support the Movement for Democratic Change. 
   It is becoming clear, I think, to many of us that President Mugabe will stop at nothing to prevent being voted out of office next week, and the run-off election comes after the March election in which the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, bested Robert Mugabe in that election, but because of the government's brutal machinations fell short of the 50 percent. 
   Since that time, what really concerns us as Members of the House is that Mugabe's agents, some of them trained by the North Koreans by the way, by North Korean troops, have been let loose in an effort to terrorize that country. There's an effort to force people to vote for President Mugabe, and we have read and seen the threats and the beatings, the abductions, the burnings of homes, the murders. 
   Opposition reports indicate that of the opposition of Mugabe, 60 members of the opposition have now been killed, including four who had their eyes and tongues cut out. 
   Food is being used to reward supporters and obviously punish opponents, and Mugabe's campaign for reelection, frankly, more closely now resembles a war against his own country. You see the attacks there on the human rights groups, the churches, the unions, the rural communities that supported the opposition, and those have been targets for repeated beatings and attacks. 
   Indeed, Mugabe has promised war, that's his word ``war,'' if his opponent triumphs in the election. So this is no environment right now for a fair and free election, but just as disturbing to me has been the reaction from the international community and the region.     
   The United Nations gave Robert Mugabe a stage to cynically mock his victims, participating in a food conference in Rome this month while at the same time he is withholding food at home. South African President Thabo Mbeki unfortunately has dedicated himself to shielding Mugabe from criticism. And shortly after the March election, Mbeki flew to Harare to meet with Robert Mugabe and declare ``there is no crisis.'' 
   I think the Washington Post got it right on their editorial page where they clarify Mbeki's role in the crisis very succinctly. And the Post said he shares ``the responsibility for the atrocities being committed in full view of the world because, like Mr. Mugabe, Mr. Mbeki deserves to be condemned and shunned by the democratic world.'' 
   This is the crisis that we face, the crisis in Zimbabwe, and it is a crisis largely of Mugabe's own making. So it is time to let the will of Zimbabweans be heard and end, frankly, what has become a reign of terror and of enormous human suffering. And again, I commend Chairman Payne for bringing this resolution forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (CREDIT UNION, BANK, AND THRIFT REGULATORY RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise also in support of this legislation. This is the Credit Union, Bank and Thrift Regulatory Relief Act that we have before us. 
   As our capital markets continue to change and continue to evolve, the regulatory model overseeing our financial institutions must adjust as well. This legislation today is a small example of this effort to improve the regulatory structure overseeing the banks and the credit unions and the thrifts. By reducing the regulatory burdens, H.R. 6312 allows credit unions and banks and thrifts to devote more resources toward better servicing their customers and toward better serving those who use these institutions. 
   Since the 108th Congress, as Mr. Kanjorski mentioned, he and I have coauthored the Credit Union Regulatory Improvements Act in an effort to modernize the regulatory model overseeing America's credit unions. We have made tremendous strides over the years. That bill, which is called CURIA now, has the support of 150 Members of this Chamber, and while today's legislation may not go as far as some would like, it is important that we not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The Credit Union, Bank and Thrift Regulatory Relief Act has several worthwhile provisions which deserve consideration. 
   Among other things, this measure clarifies the intent of the Credit Union Membership Access Act, which is that all federally chartered credit unions should be allowed to serve underserved areas around the country. By increasing the field of membership and by exempting member business loans made in these underserved areas, this provision will allow credit unions to extend credit to these areas. Following a hearing in the Financial Services Committee, this provision was adjusted to ensure those areas that benefit are, indeed, underserved. 
   Additionally, this bill would support the community development work of nonprofit religious institutions by excluding such loans from credit union business lending caps. I introduced legislation to do just this back in 2003 with the intent of closing a longstanding liquidity gap between creditors and nonprofit organizations. 
   I believe the other major provisions contained in CURIA and which are not in today's legislation are important, and I believe they should not be forgotten. In particular, I am going to continue to push to modernize the capital requirements for our credit unions because we must replace the current one-size-fits-all leverage capital requirement with a more rigorous, two-part, net worth structure that will more closely monitor actual asset risk. This will put credit unions' capital requirements on par with those of other FDIC-insured institutions. 
   One hundred fifty Members of this Congress have signed on to CURIA, and it will remain the ultimate objective for those of us trying to bring the regulatory structure of overseeing credit unions into the 21st century. 
   Today's legislation joins regulatory relief for credit unions with improvements geared towards thrifts and towards banks. Representative Moore's reg relief bill, much of which has been incorporated into this measure, will remove several unnecessary regulatory burdens faced by these financial institutions, allowing them to better serve their customers. 
   Among other things, the bill provides savings institutions with greater lending flexibility by removing limits on small business and on auto loans. The bill also increases the ability of savings associations to invest in small business investment companies and to make commercial real estate loans. Furthermore, this measure 6312 authorizes banks and thrifts to pay interest on business checking accounts for their customers. 
   Again, I would like to thank Chairman Kanjorski, and I would like to thank Representative Moore for their work on this legislation. This bill is an important step toward removing some of the unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on our Nation's financial institutions. 
   I have no further speakers on this side, and I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. ROYCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Korean American Day, which was held this past Sunday to honor the achievements, to honor the contributions of Korean Americans to our country. Back on January 13 of 1903, the first Korean immigrants came here to the United States; and since that time, Korean Americans have taken root and thrived in this country through their strong ties, their hard work, their commitment to their rich heritage and values, education, and entrepreneurship. 
   But, Madam Speaker, we have an ally and friend in South Korea, and they have been a friend for the decades. Over this time, South Korea has emerged as a major economic power, our seventh largest trading partner. It is vital that Congress take up and pass the Korean-U.S. trade agreement. 
   Let me tell you why: this particular agreement, the U.S. International Trade Commission, just released its report. They say this agreement can benefit the economy of the United States of America to the tune of over $10 billion, between $10 billion and $11.9 billion. 
   We stand to gain if this passes. It's vital that we continue to open up new markets for our goods and services. This agreement accomplishes that.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3773, RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I'm rising to oppose the rule. 
   For the first time, this bill would stop intelligence professionals from conducting surveillance of foreign persons in foreign countries unless they can read the mind of their terrorist targets and guarantee that they would not call the United States or one of their people in the United States. This is more protection than Americans get under court-ordered warrants in mob and other criminal cases. 
   So the issue we're debating today is very important. It is a matter of life and death essentially. 
   I serve as ranking member of the Terrorism and Nonproliferation Subcommittee. That there has not been a terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11 is due to the improved surveillance in real-time that we're able to conduct against foreign terrorists. 
   That good record, though, in no way should lead us to discount the jihadists, because the image of Osama bin Laden's allies operating in some remote terrain somewhere may give the impression that our foes are isolated. They are not isolated. 
   We are confronting a virtual caliphate. Radical jihadists are physically dispersed, but they're united through the Internet, and they use that tool to recruit and plot their terrorist attacks. They use electronic communications for just such a purpose, and they're very sophisticated in that use. 
   So how has the West attempted to confront that? Well, the British use electronic surveillance in real-time, and they used it last year to stop the attack on 10 transatlantic flights. They prevented that attack in August of last year by wiretapping. 
   The French authorities used wiretaps to lure jihadists basically into custody and prevented a bomb attack. 
   Given this threat, it is unfathomable that we'd weaken our most effective preventative tool, and that's exactly what this bill does. 
   Before we passed the Protect America Act in August, the Director of National Intelligence told Congress that we are losing up to two-thirds of our intelligence on terrorist targets. Admiral McConnell went on to testify, ``We're actually missing a significant portion of what we should be getting.'' 
   Though Admiral McConnell has served both Democrat and Republican administrations with distinction, now his credibility has been attacked. I'd ask those so distrustful: Go ahead, discount his estimate, cut them in half, say we'd lose one-third of our intelligence by passing this bill. Isn't that too much to give up? I don't want to lose a single percent of our intelligence on terrorist communications. With nuclear and biological material floating around this globe, we don't have that margin of error. 
   We've heard the ACLU concerns, but before we unilaterally disarm, before we hobble our ability to listen in real-time to the very real terrorists who are attacking our troops in Iraq every day, shouldn't we have something of an accounting of the supposed civil liberties price we're paying? Frankly, I don't see the troubling cases. 
   What I do see is the very misguided concern for the civil liberties of foreigners having conversations with terrorists. 
   This bill grants privacy protection to foreigners, those believed to be terrorists, by requiring the intelligence community to seek court orders to collect foreign intelligence on foreign targets.     
   This process in the past has clogged the FISA Court, it has wasted untold intelligence hours, it has pulled Arabic and Urdu and Farsi speakers off of listening to terrorist cases and put them on filing hundreds of pages of paperwork. FISA restrictions hindered the search for kidnapped Americans in Iraq. 
   My colleagues, it has come down to this: Are we interested in best protecting American lives, or giving away privacy rights to foreigners involved in conversations with terrorists?

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Madam Speaker, I rise to condemn the brutal murder of newspaper editor and leading figure in the Armenian genocide debate in Turkey, Hrant Dink. 
   Last Friday freedom of speech suffered a setback as Dink was shot three times in the head in broad daylight outside of his office. As a Turkish citizen of Armenian descent, he had gained notoriety in Turkish society for the court cases brought against him, in which he faced jail time for simply talking of that genocide. Nationalists see such statements, they say, as insults to the honor of Turks. 
   Well, Dink was mourned worldwide, and journalists like him and Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk continue to be persecuted by suppressive laws that seek to stifle discussion on matters that are claimed to be insulting to Turkish identity. 
   It is my sincere hope that the Turkish Government uses this tragedy to revisit its laws and open up to free speech. The laws themselves are a catalyst for this type of intolerance.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (HONORING THE LIFE OF SENIOR BORDER PATROL AGENT LUIS A. AGUILAR -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor senior Border Patrol Agent Luis Aguilar. He was killed 3 weeks ago on January 19. He was intentionally struck by the driver of a vehicle that he was attempting to stop. 
   And on that day, Border Patrol agents observed both a Ford pickup truck and a Hummer crossing illegally from Mexico into the United States. It was near Yuma, Arizona, and they began pursuit. The drivers of the two vehicles saw that the agents were following them, and they turned back toward the border. But as Agent Aguilar deployed spike strips, he was intentionally struck by the driver of that Hummer. 
   His death serves for us as another stark reminder of the dangerous environment our Border Patrol faces every day. Violence against Border Patrol agents, I sadly report, is increasing in  the United States. It has gone up 31 percent. Between 2006 and 2007, the number of incidents rose from 752 attacks to 987 against our Border Patrol agents. Agents are being assaulted with an arsenal of weaponry that includes bottles and knives, bats, ball bearings, steel pipes, cinder blocks, slingshots and vehicles. 
   When I was chairman of the Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation, I held hearings down on the border, both in Laredo, Texas, and in San Diego, and the focus was on border vulnerabilities and on international terrorism. At that time, there had been some reports of international terrorists trying to cross that border. 
   One thing the Border Patrol asked us for, and they said this would make an immediate impact on securing our borders and securing our Nation, they asked us for a double border fence, as was finally passed in the Secure Fence Act. Many Americans strongly supported that legislation to construct that fence to help slow illegal entry into the United States, and, quite frankly, they are baffled that Congress took such a step back from strengthening our border security, as we did with that omnibus spending bill earlier this year, because that omnibus spending bill gutted the Secure Fence Act. The Secure Fence Act required double fencing. It would put a fence where it was needed most, in areas that have the highest instances of drug smuggling, of human smuggling, and of gang activity. 
   The omnibus bill that we passed here, that I opposed, removed the two-tier requirement and the list of locations. It also put up numerous bureaucratic and legal hurdles to undermine the fence's completion. It's past time we strengthen operational control of our borders. We need to use every tool available to give the Border Patrol the support they need to help protect Border Patrol agents as they requested. 
   Again, I just want to recognize the service of Agent Luis Aguilar, killed in the line of duty.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Many have described the crisis: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria. These take countless lives every day, especially on the continent of Africa. These diseases devastate families, they devastate communities, and nations. This bill is titled the ``Leadership Act,'' and it is titled that way because it honors two former Foreign Affairs Committee chairmen who indeed did show leadership in forging this legislation 5 years ago. And, with this act, the United States will continue to lead in tackling these killer diseases. 
   As others have said, this legislation did not come together easily; and the reason it is difficult is because many people have strong views on how best to fight these diseases. This bill is a compromise. It would have been far easier to hold onto positions, probably, but that would have gotten no bill. But, instead, those working on it did the hard work to craft a policy that most everyone could support.     
   Frankly, had it not been done, it would have been a sharp rebuke to the work Chairman Hyde and Mr. Lantos did 5 years ago. Tens of millions of people around the world would have lost, and America would have lost. That we are in this position now, to continue these two men's legacy, is due to the dedication of Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen. I particularly appreciate their inclusion of a provision I had recommended prohibiting foreign countries, foreign governments, from taxing our aid, and I thank them for that provision. 
   While endorsing the policy, the bill's authorization level is a great concern, as others have expressed. I have conferred with enough people working in the field and been in enough African countries to doubt the ability to productively absorb this very large funding level, which is well over the administration's request. 
   And while these are devastating diseases, these countries face many other public challenges, some deadly, which may be shortchanged. Our country has many public health needs, too. That leads me to believe that this would be a better bill if it conformed more closely with the level the administration, which has gotten real results, thinks it could best spend. 
   I believe this bill's authorization level will be addressed in our recommittal motion which will be offered for a vote before this House. 
   So again, I thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   What I wanted to share with this body is that Ramzi Yousef used a stolen passport to carry out the murderous attack that was conducted on the World Trade Center back in 1993. He used that stolen passport to enter the United States and claim asylum and then carry out that attack. 
   Three years after the 9/11 Commission recommended that our border officers have access to Interpol's lost and stolen passport data as an automatic check at our ports of entry, we still do not have a situation where we are utilizing that data, and this amendment would change that. 
   Now, there are many, many examples in Europe where these stolen passports have created a crisis. Fraudulent passports were used in the 2004 Madrid bombing. In the 2005 London subway attacks, again, stolen passports were used, and as argued recently in congressional testimony by the Secretary General of Interpol, and I will quote from that testimony before the Senate, ``Terrorist use of fraudulent travel documents was one of the most dangerous gaps in global security back around the time of September 2001. Unfortunately, it still is today.'' 
   I can share with you as the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism Non-Proliferation and Trade, this remains a concern. 
   It has been a concern for Interpol since 2002. They started their stolen and lost travel document database at that time. There were several thousand passports that were stolen in blank form. This was a particular problem. They posed a severe threat, given that these can be easily made into bogus passports that are very, very easy to use and difficult for law enforcement to detect. A stolen blank passport from a visa waiver country raises the stakes, of course, because the holder is subject to considerably less scrutiny because it is a visa waiver country. So, if you look at the number of hits last year, 2,543, generated by Interpol's database, 62 percent were from visa waiver countries. 
   So the United States, we have some access to stolen passport information through our own systems and through bilateral agreements, but there is a gaping hole here. We need access to this system. There are 2 1/2 million stolen passports that are not on our radar screen. 
   This amendment then would ensure that DHS implement the Interpol stolen passport database at primary inspection points at U.S. ports of entry. The system developed by Interpol would enable U.S. border security officials to check the passport database at the port of entry. The same swipe of the passport would check the Interpol database with a simultaneous check of the appropriate U.S. database. That is going to enhance our security. 
   I will just share with the members of this body that the Swiss now use this; 20,000 Swiss officers conduct between 300,000 and 400,000 database searches every month, and every month they detect over 100 people attempting to enter their country with stolen passports. The French have the same experience. 
   It is very important that the U.S. access this database, and that is what this amendment will do. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ROYCE. Madam Chairman, if I could just sum up on my time, again, the 9/11 Commission recognized the importance of Interpol's database. Janice Kephart, who was a counsel to the 9/11 Commission, testified recently that U.S. support and engagement with Interpol is key to fully implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations on terrorist travel. 
   I would just also share with the body that yesterday we dodged a bullet. It is significant that there have been no terrorist attacks against our country since 9/11, but yesterday's disrupted plot shows there is much work left to be done. 
   Adoption of this database will help combat the threat of terrorists and criminals crossing our borders. I urge its adoption. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

As a Turkish citizen of Armenian descent, Dink had gained notoriety in Turkish society for the court cases brought against him in which he faced jail time for simply talking of the Armenian genocide. 
   While many will give speeches to remember Hrant Dink, the most meaningful tribute would be a rescinding of article 301 of the Turkish penal code that outlaws ``insults to Turkishness.'' 
   Under this law, journalists like Dink and Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk continue to be persecuted by draconian laws that seek to stifle debate or discussion on matters that could be seen as insulting to Turkish identity. It is my sincere hope that the Turkish government will use this occasion to reflect upon this restrictive article and rescind it before it does more harm.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (CALLING ON CHINA TO RESPECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF REFUGEES FROM NORTH KOREA -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I want to take a moment and thank Chairman JOHN TANNER, as well as of course Ranking Member ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN and Chairman Lantos for their support in bringing this bill to the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   I would also like to thank Congresswoman DIANE WATSON. She is the coauthor of this resolution, and in August Congresswoman Watson and myself traveled to South Korea as Chair and vice-Chair of the U.S.-Republic of Korea Interparliamentary Exchange. We also had an opportunity to go to North Korea at that time. In Seoul, South Korea, we held a day-long discussion with our counterparts in the National Assembly there in South Korea and took part in a forum of parliamentarians from across the globe. We had parliamentarians there from seven different countries to discuss the plight of North Korean refugees, and this resolution is a product of those discussions and what we learned from the defectors that we talked to, and we listened to the defectors during these hearings. 
   Mr. Speaker, we're all too familiar with the miserable human rights conditions in North Korea, and I would just remind the Members of this body of reports by the State Department and NGOs that paint a very grim picture. 
   There is a total denial of political, civil, and religious liberties. There is no dissent or criticism allowed of Kim Jong-Il. The media is tightly controlled there by the regime. 
   Severe, severe physical abuse is inflicted on any citizen who violates these laws and restrictions. NGOs describe a system of concentration camps. They say this is akin to the Soviet gulags, and they house somewhere up to 200,000 inmates. 
   Food shortages are a regular problem because the regime distributes food based on perceived loyalty and, of course, favors the ruling elite and the military. 
   This dismal state has led a large number of North Koreans, perhaps as many as 300,000, to cross into China. There they seek food, and they're looking for work, and hopefully from their standpoint, they're looking for resettlement in South Korea. It is thought that nearly 75 percent of these refugees are women, and according to the NGOs that study this problem, 90 percent of those women end up trafficked. 
   In northeast China, North Korean refugees live in constant fear of being rounded up by Chinese authorities, and this despite the international obligations that China is supposed to keep. 
   China forcibly repatriates these refugees; and for many of them, it's effectively a death sentence. Some are shot on the spot. Some go to these concentration camps or work camps. Many of them live out their lives in these concentration camps.     
   The Government of North Korea deems leaving their country a crime, in some cases a capital offense. If not that, the expense is the gulag. 
   China's mistreatment of these refugees is not new but has really intensified, according to the State Department, in the last couple of years. During 2006, several thousand North Koreans were forcibly detained and forcibly returned to North Korea, the State Department reports. 
   As part of its stepped-up campaign of repatriation, Chinese authorities reportedly also have established new detention centers along the border with North Korea to accommodate greater numbers of North Korean prisoners prior to the repatriation. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China, on which I serve, recently released its annual report finding that during the past 1 or 2 years the Chinese Government has intensified its efforts to forcibly repatriate North Korean refugees, in part as security preparation for the 2008 Olympic Games. 
   These refugees deserve better. Certainly, Kim Chun-hee did. Ms. Kim is a North Korean woman in her 30s who sought refuge at a school in Beijing in December of 2005, only to be repatriated, this despite attempts by the United States and others to raise her case to the Chinese Government to convince the Chinese Government not to do this. To this day it is not known whether she was executed or whether she is still alive. 
   There are thousands of similar stories. Those associated with humanitarian groups who assist North Korean refugees in northeast China are also targeted by Chinese officials, and this includes U.S. citizens. Last month, American businessman Steve Kim was released from a Chinese prison after serving 4 years. His supposed crime was helping North Korean refugees who had escaped their homeland and were hiding in China hoping to make their way to South Korea. 
   Mr. Kim, who recently spoke on Capitol Hill about his experiences, recounted, ``When I was in prison, I saw North Korean defectors who I shared the prison cell with beaten to a pulp by prison guards.'' Now, this is in China. This is before they are sent back to North Korea. We have documented the kind of treatment they get when they are sent back. 
   This resolution sends a strong message to Beijing. This practice must stop. Specifically, the resolution calls on China to honor its obligations under the 1951 U.N. convention relating to the status of refugees and its 1967 protocol, and to honor that by halting the forced repatriation of these refugees, terminating the practice of automatically classifying all North Korean border crossers as illegal economic migrants and granting the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees unfettered access to get into these areas to see these refugees. 
   China is signed up to respect refugees. It is past time for them to live up to the protocols they have signed to do this. The human rights situation in North Korea is a nightmare. These human rights abuses are worthy of this House's attention, because North Koreans are suffering. Two million were killed at the hands of this regime over this last decade. They also tell us something about the regime we are expecting to carry out commitments under the Six-Party Talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons program. It tells you something about this regime. 
   I will quote Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet dissident who once said, ``A country that does not respect the rights of its own people will not respect the rights of its neighbors.'' Teeing off that quote, Jay Lefkowitz, the State Department's Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea, wrote in The Wall Street Journal last year, ``North Korea is a prime example of a regime that doesn't respect either. It wouldn't have surprised Sakharov that a government that inflicts on its citizens repression reminiscent of the most cruel totalitarian rulers of the 20th century is today counterfeiting U.S. currency, trafficking in narcotics, building a nuclear arsenal, and threatening other nations.'' 
   In testimony last week before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Assistant Secretary Christopher Hill reported that he is moving the ball forward with North Korea in respect to disabling their nuclear program. I hope he is right. Part of the February agreement to do so involves a U.S. commitment to move toward full diplomatic relations with North Korea. 
   The administration insists that it still has a clear eye on the North Korea human rights situation. However, the Congressional Research Service reports that Ambassador Hill increasingly has linked normalization of U.S.-North Korean relations solely to a satisfactory settlement of the nuclear issue. This body must let it be known that relations with North Korea will be far from normal as long as North Korea continues to treat its people as we have heard about today.  
   I urge the passage of this important resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROYCE. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, today I've got to say, after spending a decade advocating for strong GSE reform, I am shocked to see this attempt to increase moral hazard and socialized risk that we're seeing on the floor today. We're going to reward some of the same institutions which have undermined sound economic principles, which have resisted the reforms that we've tried to push. 
   I believe good governance and protecting the American taxpayer has got to trump rewarding radical organizations and imprudent lenders and rewarding speculators. And unfortunately, that is what is done in this bill. 
   And for too long, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have reaped the rewards of the private sector, while enjoying the type of security known only to branches of the Federal Government. Their quasi-governmental status has created a level of moral hazard unseen anywhere else in our capital markets. 
   You know, in an effort to create a regulator with enough authority to restrain these institutions, in 2003 I introduced the first legislation which sought to put Fannie and Freddie and the Federal home loan bank system under one strong regulator within the Federal Government. 
   Additionally, in 2005, I offered an amendment on this floor to give the new regulator the authority to review and adjust the GSEs' portfolios to mitigate against a potential systemic shock. And the same groups and organizations that right now stand to benefit from this bill opposed those reforms at the time. 
   As the systemic risk posed by the GSEs grew, the need for a strong regulator, able to control their risk exposure and ensure they were adequately capitalized, became more and more critical, especially as the mortgage industry began to deteriorate over the last 18 months. 
   The failure of Congress to pass such critical legislation over the years could end up being one of Washington's greatest oversight mistakes in recent history, and worst yet, we're here today asking, as we do so often, the American taxpayer frankly to pay for the failure here. 
   Now, I'm angered that today's legislation has been loaded with handouts and improperly funded liabilities, the most obvious of which bails out speculators and investors that incorrectly gambled on the housing industry and the institutions that provided their loans. 
   The $300 billion plan would allow banks to dump their least appealing loans onto the Federal Housing Administration, and by taking on these mortgages, we are shifting the default risk. That default risk is currently held by institutions and investors around the world, and we're shifting it instead onto the backs of the American taxpayers. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a stunning 35 percent of all of the loans refinanced through mortgage bailouts may eventually default on the Federal Government. 
   And then we have the affordable housing fund, which would funnel as much as $600 million every year to activist organizations with a long history, frankly, of both voter fraud and anti-free market advocacy throughout the country. 
   And what is the funding mechanism to prevent taxpayers from footing the bill for these misguided programs? Well, it is a 4.2 basis points tax levied on the same struggling GSEs that this legislation is meant to strengthen. And whether this tax will be enough to cover the 10s of billions of potential losses remains to be seen. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing this legislation because of the unprecedented amount of taxpayer liabilities included in this package. This is an affront to good governance. It should be avoided at all costs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of the Vietnam Human Rights Act of 2007. 
   I join Congressman Smith, and the efforts made by others here that have been tireless, the strategy of trying to shine some light on Vietnam, trying to get the international community to look at what is happening there. 
   I've worked with Congressman Smith on this legislation since 2001, and I know the importance of having it passed, but also, I know the trouble that it has been met with in the other body. And if we can overcome the objections of a few in the other body, this bill will be an important tool in pressing Hanoi to end its wanton disregard for human rights. 
   I think the necessity of this legislation is because since early this year the crackdown has intensified in Hanoi, in Vietnam to such an extent that especially students, especially spokesmen for religious organizations there are receiving these one-hour show trials where afterwards they're being sent to a penitentiary, 8 years in the case of Father Ly. It was 14-some years ago when he was sent away the first time. And Mr. Speaker, I've had the opportunity there, in Vietnam, to meet with the venerable Thich Quang Do, when he was under house arrest, and Le Quang Liem and see the incredible repression that they face, and to  see what is really a slow strangulation of the culture and of the traditional religion as the state attempts to rewrite religion without the support of the religious leaders, and thus come down hard on those religious leaders and try to remove them from society and try to imprison them certainly when they speak out.     
   As Human Rights Watch said, this is the worst crackdown that we have seen in Vietnam in 20 years. In the past year, Vietnamese officials brought this harassment to religious leaders and political dissidents and student activists to these new draconian levels that, unfortunately, force us to act here. 
   This bill's focus on Vietnam suppression of the democratic movement and its tight control over the media will be an important component in bringing change. Why? Because with this legislation, Radio Free Asia will now better be able to bring objective news and to be a surrogate voice for opinions and news outside of the state-sponsored propaganda, so the Vietnamese people will hear of the spread of democratic values in Asia. 
   Frankly, the spread of democratic values in Asia is critical to U.S. security interests. It is important to note that Vietnam has recently ratcheted up its efforts to block radio broadcasts from Radio Free Asia. This tells me that not only are these broadcasts having a positive effect in combating state propaganda, but Hanoi is feeling increased political pressure. This bill provides the means to overcome radio jamming and the funds for continued broadcasts. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. I think it sends a firm message to Hanoi that abuse of this kind to nonviolent citizens in the country will not be met with silence, but, frankly, that we will take action not only in terms of the broadcasting, but this also authorizes our administration to provide U.S. assistance through appropriate nongovernmental organizations and the Human Rights Defenders Fund for the support of the individuals and organizations to promote human rights and to promote nonviolent democratic change inside the country. 
   So besides capping U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance, this other leverage will be very helpful in terms of trying to protect the human rights and dignity of the students and of the religious leaders right now that are facing such persecution inside Vietnam.
