<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (ENERGY DEVELOPMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman, and I'll try not to be long. But I do want to start by saying that I seek not to blame anyone, because one of the things that I'm the most turned off by in the modern era of American politics is that everybody wants to blame everybody. And Democrats always say Republicans are wrong. Republicans always say Democrats are wrong. The truth is, neither party has a whole lot to brag about, and more and more people are being frustrated or becoming frustrated with the two parties. 
   But I will say, on this particular issue of energy, it's important to realize that talk is cheap. Words are not worth much. And votes really do matter. And the positions you take really do have consequences, and we have to actually discuss that as we look at solutions, because what I want to talk about is solutions; not blame, but solutions to these major problems. 
   In my 14 years of service here, this issue now stings and hurts more than any issue that I've seen. And I've served through impeachment, through the Iraq war, through the awful response to Katrina, and I would say that more people are angry and upset and concerned about $4.05 gasoline than anything. 
   And it's easy to say, I told you so. The gentleman from Pennsylvania can definitely say I told you so because I've served with him for 12 years, and he's been talking about supply of oil and gas and the consequences of us not going after it and becoming more independent ourselves for the whole 12 years; a very powerful and effective voice. 
   I too have a long history of talking about the problems that are going to be associated with the energy 
   crunch and was very concerned following September the 11th that we would end up here tonight. I do think that the nexus between national security, energy and the environment is the most important challenge of our generation because they're all connected now inseparably. 
   It's ironic that the left wants to promote legislation and conversation about global warming and climate change because actually that will further restrict our access to energy, and everybody knows that. And it will raise prices. It will increase regulation. It will actually compound this problem. Yet they're promoting that agenda at the same time that they're retreating from energy capacity. And these votes really matter. 
   Now I come at this with 10 years of service on the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, 8 years of service as the cochairman of the Renewable Energy Caucus here in the House, which is a bipartisan thing; the Representative that represents the premier energy research facility in this country, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. And I want to start by saying that conservation is a very important piece of these solutions. 
   As a matter of fact, conservation is not for wimps, as some people would have you believe. Conservation is for warriors, in my opinion. Not everyone is going to put on the uniform of our Armed Forces. We should be grateful to everyone who does. But not everyone's going to do that. 
   But every person in this country can contribute to our national security by becoming more energy efficient, by conserving, by trying to be more efficient in their daily life, and there are a lot of ways to do that. 
   And I rolled out at the National Press Club, with some outside groups, some very effective outside groups, the Drive Smarter Challenge. You can go to drivesmarterchallenge.org, and you can save yourself hundreds of dollars by following simple instructions of how to conserve gasoline without cutting back on your travel. Obviously the speed limit and how much you travel would be a good step. But there a lot of other things you can do with your automobile, depending on how much gas it uses, to save and conserve, because even in small ways, if we reduce the demand, and the supply stays the same, the price will come down. Demand and supply are connected to each other. 
   I'm also very, very much about new technologies. As I talk about these solutions, understand that I'm here tonight, not because these solutions are all technology-driven or conservation-driven, but I'm here tonight because we have to go forward with an all-of-the-above strategy. We can't afford to leave anything off the table. We can't afford to pick winners and losers. 
   As a matter of fact, I can give you a good example of picking winners and losers in the energy sector because in California, they said, we're not going to use all of the resources for electricity production. We're going to mandate that a certain amount of our electricity has to be produced by these sources. They picked winners and losers. And guess what happened? The lights went out. They didn't have any electricity. 
   That's the problem with picking winners and losers. We have to have an all-of-the-above strategy.  
   I'm here tonight, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania laid out earlier, because we have to increase capacity. We have to go after these resources from the Outer Continental Shelf, from ANWR. 
   I've been in Congress 14 years. I've cast 24 votes to increase capacity for oil and gas in this country. Twenty-four votes. As has been said ad infinitum now, and I'm not a partisan guy--I don't want to blame anybody--but these votes matter. And almost every time the Republicans vote for new capacity, and almost every time the Democrats vote against it. Even today, it happened again. And 2 weeks ago it happened in the Senate again. 
   This is one of those issues that I don't want to be too partisan, but you can't deny there is a huge difference between increasing capacity. Frankly, even the wild-eyed environmentalist has to recognize that this is painful to regular people. And you've got to get off of your crusade to save every tree, you know, to save every form of wildlife at the expense of our human beings who can't pay their bills and they can't buy gas. 
   Be reasonable, people. That's not happening today. 
   But there's a tremendous amount of new technologies. I would argue that we can literally grow our economy, a manufacturing-driven, export robust U.S. economy, by being aggressive in this energy sector, because we have the innovation. 
   What does everyone around the world still emulate about our country? We would like to say it's our privilege to vote. That's important. But they don't all emulate that. We'd like to think that they all would freely worship as we do, and I cherish that. But they don't all emulate that. We would like to think we all have freedom of the press. 
   The one thing they emulate is our private sector, our capitalistic, free enterprise, innovative sector. We have that. 
   How did we balance the budget in the late nineties? I was here. Four straight years. People think, oh, you cut spending. No we didn't. We slowed the growth of spending, yes we did. We didn't cut spending. But revenues surpassed expenses principally because of one sector of our economy that roared, information technology. We led the world. Microsoft is an example. There are many others. We led the world. Revenues surpassed expenses. 
   That can happen again in this sector if we will lead and not be in retreat and not regulate, not limit, but expand, go after it, create new technologies, increase capacity. Be competitive. 
   As the gentleman from Pennsylvania said, it's important.     
   Now, I have had the editor of Automotive News say that we're going to be driving electric cars. That might be true. Ion lithium batteries have some potential. GM and Toyota say that next summer they're going to have plug-in hybrids. But I will also tell you that Volkswagon, which is a premier automotive interest in the world, can make a three-cylinder diesel engine, lightweight, gets 50 to 60 miles a gallon so biodiesel, biofuels, as long as they're cellulosic in nature and not corn based, are very important developments as well. 
   I will tell you what I don't think the Congress ought to do is pick winners and losers. I think we ought to have an all-of-the-above strategy. Let the market determine which one gets their best and first. Let consumers choose and promote them all. Let the marketplace decide. Let me say that if we do end up plugging our cars in, though, we don't have the electricity capacity to keep them running. We have to have nuclear energy. 
   The numbers--81 percent of France's electricity is generated by nuclear power. They have 53 reactors; we have roughly twice that many. They don't bury their waste, which we propose at Yucca Mountain. They reprocess their spent full turning most of the spent waste back into energy. Why don't we do that? Because we're still stuck in a Three Mile Island time warp mindset that it's somehow not safe, and it is. And there is no evidence that it is not. And we've not had any nuclear incidences. We have 53 nuclear reactors. It is emissionless. 
   You want to reduce the carbon footprint? Promote nuclear. If you want to reduce the carbon footprint in a meaningful way and you're against nuclear, you're disingenuous. I don't care what your name is. You're not living in the real world, or you're playing politics. We need nuclear. 
   Now, another new technology is the stationary solid oxide fuel cell. What is that? Well, it's developed out of Silicon Valley. Partnerships around the country. We have a 100-kilowatt system now being demonstrated in the Tennessee Valley. It looks like the HVAC system in your home, but here is the special element of a solid oxide fuel cell: It makes electricity, but it's not on a transmission grid. That's pretty cool in the world we live in today because without a transmission grid, you can't shut down the electricity through a terrorist incident because not everyone is connected to the grid. 
   And in this stationary solid oxide fuel cell, which is also emissionless, reducing the carbon footprint, it does have to be fueled in one feedstock. It's an HVAC system with fuel cells that creates 100 kilowatts of power which is roughly a 30,000 square foot building. Office building, commercial center, several houses. But you have to have a feedstock, but it will run on anything, just about. It will run on natural gas, it will run on solar in some places, ethanol, different feedstocks. 
   But that's an important development. It has got tremendous electricity potential especially if we start plugging in our cars and we need this new electricity capacity. 
   I believe we ought to look at a follow-up stimulus bill that directs resources to people that are stuck. And I'll tell you in the south, if you're on the lower income, you probably have a very inefficient vehicle and you probably drive a long way to work and you're stuck; and those are the people that our next economic stimulus ought to help. We ought to figure out a way in a bipartisan way to get them some resources to move to more efficient transportation, one way or another. Because people right now, they can't trade that big car. They can't get for it what it's worth, and then they don't have the money to go to a more efficient car. We should help them. 
   In closing, let me just say words are cheap and votes really do make a difference, and the votes for energy capacity have been really important in the past, and they're even more important today; and they're going to be even more important tomorrow. And this is where we have to bring this Congress together. 
   And the Democratic leadership in the House and Senate is way out of touch with reality unless they get serious immediately about increasing capacity because if we made moves that were published around the world that we're going back in the energy-production business, prices would come down overnight, not because the energy is there overnight, but because they know we're going in the right direction because right now we're going in the wrong direction. 
   We need help.

   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I don't want to get into the blame game because the American people are sick and tired of the blame game. I think the truth is, Republicans screwed up running this place, and now Democrats are screwing up running this place. So there's plenty of blame to go around. And they're sick and tired of this process debate because they don't understand how it affects them. 
   But let me say to the people who are talking process. If the Congress is not going to work together on matters of the military funding at a time of war, the Congress is never going to work together. And that is the underlying problem, and it does affect our lives.  
   I've got a nephew in Iraq right now. I've got another nephew on his way to Afghanistan and that affects our lives. 
   I am the ranking member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee. I heard my chairman, Mr. Edwards, whom I very much respect, go through 3 minutes of excellent reasons why to support this bill, but not one time did he talk about anybody on this side because we didn't have any voice in the process. He didn't compliment anything over here because we were not involved this time around. I think we should be. 
   And the way that they pay for the extras in this bill are with taxes. We don't want to raise your taxes. And I know that we're spending a lot of money in Iraq, but it's easy for everybody to forget, over half the Democrats in the United States Senate voted to remove Saddam Hussein by force. Almost half the Democrats in the House voted to remove Saddam Hussein by force.     
   The President of the United States acknowledged just a week ago that he never should have said ``Mission Accomplished,'' and he shouldn't have because it's not. We've got a long way to go. 
   This is the serious business of freedom, and it needs to be funded without all the extraneous stuff, and frankly, all the tricks associated with getting what they want in addition to what we need. And they're doing it with tax increases, and it's the wrong way. And I'm sorry, I'm not blaming anybody; we just need to do better.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 502, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Madam Speaker, I do rise as the ranking member of the subcommittee in reluctant opposition to the rule. I say that because I am very  grateful for the work that the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) have done on protecting the Appropriations Committee's prerogatives in this bill, particularly with, I think, the important recommendation to name the largest space in the new Capitol Visitors Center Emancipation Hall. We will talk more about that during general debate. 
   But I am in opposition because only three amendments were ruled in order; that is, three out of 23, which is 13 percent. Last year it was 100 percent; the year before last it was 45 percent. And that is not enough. Therefore, I am actually going to support the amendments that are offered. 
   But I am going to support the bill. We did work in a bipartisan manner. This is a good bill. I am going to support the bill, but the rule is just not quite enough, to be honest with you. We should have had these amendments ruled in order. I say that respectfully because I think it is important that we try to open this up as much as possible. 
   The structured rule is not a problem, but only three amendments being ruled in order is a problem. So I reluctantly rise in opposition to the rule. I look forward to the general debate. I look forward to the passage of the bill with the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).

   Mr. WAMP. Madam Chairman, with the understanding that the distinguished Chair from Florida will close, I would like to yield myself 1 minute before yielding the balance of our time to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston). 
   I congratulate our chairwoman for just working really hard, having a lot of hearings, digging in, learning a lot, and then finding a way to work together through the process, and I'm grateful. 
   Also, I want to say, with regard to the GAO issue and outside counsel, using outside counsel is actually commonplace; even the House itself has used it, the legislative branch agencies have used that. And then also to say about the greening of the Capitol issue, what we've heard today should remind us to use great caution because we are all for greening and environmental efficiency, but we need to be careful that the Congress itself is not a guinea pig to try a whole lot of things just to see how they work. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Georgia, the former chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Kingston.

   You know, when we were in the majority, we supported and accepted this approach. I believe this is part, or should be part, of the Speaker's Green the Capitol Initiative. This is a lot of trees. It is a space efficiency issue. They are storing all this paper. It is a government efficiency issue. 
   Why don't we, Madam Chair, just accept this amendment, as we have in previous years, address this issue in conference, move right along and get Members on their way this afternoon?

I wasn't going to say anything, but I just want to say that because we have not accepted commonsense amendments like the previous amendment, and because the Rules Committee only granted three amendments in order, we are losing a lot of support for this bill on this side of the aisle unnecessarily because I do think we worked hard to make it fiscally responsible. But they are making a strong case, and we have closed the process down instead of opening it up.

   Mr. WAMP. Madam Chair, I want to start by saying that it's an awesome feeling being in my 11th year as a member of the House Appropriations Committee to be standing here as the ranking member offering our first bill and to congratulate our chairwoman from Florida on her first product. It is a joyous occasion for each of us, and I am grateful for this opportunity. 
   Let me also say that while I do not support and we do not support the overall spending that the Appropriations Committee is recommending for the year, we certainly do support this bill. This bill is a fiscally responsible product. We did work in a bipartisan way. We kind of went through waves where we could do better at times, but towards the end we really came together, and especially on the critical issues, in a bipartisan way. I commend the gentlelady from Florida on that cooperative spirit. I think we both learned a lot along the way about how to work with each other and how to reach out to our members and we do have a good subcommittee on both sides of the aisle. 
   I too want to thank this outstanding staff: Jeff Shockey and Liz Dawson on the minority side; Tom Forhan, Chuck Turner and David Marroni on the majority; particularly Melissa Chapman and Amanda Schoch on my personal staff for all the work that they've done. We're new, we're learning, but we are working together and we're grateful for that. 
   I want to point out a few things in this bill that I think are very noteworthy. As the chairwoman said, the Inspector General of the Architect of the Capitol is a very important move. Former chairman and now ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Lewis, began this initiative in the '07 bill. For the chairwoman to go forward with it I think is incredibly important. We've learned a lot. Unfortunately, a lot of lessons learned from the CVC, but clearly they need the oversight of the Inspector General. 
   I also want to commend her on responding to the needs of the Capitol Police. If we are not state-of-the-art in communication on Capitol Hill, then in the whole country we've got a problem with security. They need the money for interoperable communications. It is now in this bill and we're grateful for that. 
   One caution, and we talked about it some during the rules debate, is this FDA building, the swing space, the whole issue of are we in the wake or behind the CVC going to go into another major capital improvement project and is that necessary or even wise at this time to go forward with that. We're going to talk more about that, but my view is we need sweeping procurement reforms in the way the AOC operates. I know that this is not necessarily an AOC directly driven project, but the whole supervision of how we procure capital improvements, renovations and do it is not efficient. 
   Frankly, we saw the Botanical Gardens a few years ago, we didn't learn enough lessons from that. We went into the CVC. It's gotten out of hand. We need reforms before we go forward. I look forward to discussing that more as the morning goes. 
   The Green the Capitol Initiative falls under the category of the prerogative of the majority but the responsibility of the minority to question, is this real substantive. I think there's widespread bipartisan support for environmental improvements on Capitol Hill and across the country. I'm the cochairman of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus. The gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the House Administration Committee, will speak in a few minutes with concerns about the Green the Capitol Initiative. He's one of the leaders, as am I, on renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies, but does this end up being somewhat window dressing, not as much substance as we would like. It's not a large budget issue, but we have the obligation to ask these questions. 
   One of the questions would be, we have an E-85 pump coming but we don't yet have these fleet vehicles or leased vehicles running off of E-85. So we've got to connect the dots and make this work, but we're respectfully asking these questions with the same desire as the majority, to green the Capitol and frankly be as environmentally responsible across the board as we can. 
   Let me also say another disappointing aspect is that we're still in my view not doing enough for the blind and physically handicapped. The digital talking books program does still receive a reduction even though we made some improvements at the full committee. I want to advocate for doing all we can along the way. 
   And then let me just say a word about something that's in this bill that thankfully the Rules Committee allowed to stay in this bill and it's the naming of the hall which some say that this subcommittee or even the full committee should not take action on, but I disagree. Because time is of the essence. This new Capitol Visitors Center is the 600-pound gorilla that we've been trying to get our arms around and frankly we've both taken a lot of ownership in this. We inherited this problem, as did the Acting Architect, Mr. Ayers, inherit the cost overruns in this very large project, which is unprecedented. We haven't done it in the history of the Capitol, something this large, 580,000 square feet, $592 million, over twice the original cost; but frankly the planning overlapped September 11. $170 million in cost overruns are for enhanced security improvements in the wake of September 11. But there is a 20,000 square foot space in the middle of this new Capitol Visitors Center, and it's going to be the largest congregate space in the Capitol. Unfortunately, through, I think bad communication, this hall was called the Great Hall, which is exactly the same name as the main hall in the Library of Congress for over 100 years. The Great Hall is this beautiful, ornate room at the Library of Congress. Early on, there was bipartisan agreement at our subcommittee that both of these halls on each end of a tunnel should not be called the Great Hall. 
   So we took action and I think carefully thought through and felt through some of the options, and the most glaring omission in the history of the Capitol is the irony that the people that built the Capitol were, in large part, slaves who never were honored in any way, shape or form for the work that they did building this Capitol. There were even periods of time where the people working on the dome were Union soldiers and slaves, at the same time, building the dome during the Civil War. What an unbelievably awesome thought that the people who were fighting for their freedom were working side by side with these slaves. 
   Listen, this is our opportunity to truly honor them in a way that transcends our service, our existence, individuals. And so the naming of this 20,000 square foot hall Emancipation Hall is something that is ripe with life and tradition and time-honored work for all of us. I'm pleased that it was left in the bill, and I'm pleased that our Senate counterparts took action on this yesterday by introducing legislation. 
   The power to convene is greater than the power to legislate. Sometimes we forget that things like this may seem to be symbolic, but it means so much more. I've taken 1,700 groups through the Capitol over the last 13 years. I give these tours and it inspires young people to a life of service. What greater way to honor freedom than to walk people through this new 20,000 square foot hall and say, this is Emancipation Hall, a great lesson of history.     
   We gained our national character by the mistakes that we learned from, never to repeat again. That's where we get our character. That's why this is so important. 
   Some people say we shouldn't spend the money to change the name of the signs. We should never have printed the signs. Let's not make another mistake by not rectifying this first mistake. 
   I really appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which we have worked on this particular issue.

   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding to me. 
   I came to the Capitol tonight to actually take the eighth-graders from Silverdale Baptist Church on a Capitol tour here, which I am going to do downstairs in a few minutes. But this is a very important issue that really strikes to the heart of what our priorities are in this country today. 
   My responsibilities here in Washington and in this Congress are, as the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, charged with resourcing the legislative branch. We ask Capitol Police officers and the Sergeant at Arms personnel to stand in harm's way on our behalf. I have got to tell you all across the country we are asking men and women of all ethnic backgrounds, all religions, all cultures who are proud to be called Americans to stand in harm's way on behalf of our civilian population and, in this case, our elected leadership in this country. And you can't ask them to do that and then send the wrong signals by not standing with them when they are doing their job. And I know that people are entitled to due process, but this is one of those obvious cases where the President needs to get involved and take decisive action. 
   My district director in Chattanooga's son works for Border Patrol on the southern border. It is a difficult job. These people are harassed. Their lives are on the line all the time. It is a tough, nasty business. It does not always go perfectly, but if we are ever going to recruit new people to serve and to stand in the gap on behalf of our country, we have to stand behind the people that do. I don't think we have done that. I do not think due process has, frankly, been served here. And I think the President should take action, and I was proud to join on the letters asking the President to do this. 
   Thoughtful people from all across the country are saying what in the world is going on? How could this happen? And I want that next generation of Border Patrol agents to be recruited and know that their country is not going to leave them hanging and leave them in Federal prison for doing their job. It is dangerous. Our country needs to stand behind them. And these are difficult days. Our generation is going to be called to enormous sacrifice. We have got to make difficult decisions on whether or not we are going to stick together, because if we do not hang together, we will indeed hang separately.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and everyone from Illinois and Indiana for bringing us to this moment. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to represent the State of Tennessee in coming to congratulate the Indianapolis Colts. Few people would know this, but last Thursday here in Washington was our annual prayer breakfast, where we bring people from all around the world for our prayer breakfast. And Dr. Francis Collins of the Human Genome Project was the speaker, and he just did an extraordinary job. 
   But what people wouldn't know was that before we invited Dr. Francis Collins, we actually extended an invitation to Tony Dungy. But Tony Dungy knew when we extended that invitation where he was going to be the following Sunday, and he told us. Sorry, I can't come speak at the National Prayer Breakfast because I will be preparing to play in the Super Bowl. And boy, was he preparing. 
   Many people know the connections to Tennessee here with this Super Bowl because of Peyton Manning, because he played his college football at the University of Tennessee. And I dare say, other than the State of Indiana, and maybe Mississippi, the State of Tennessee was cheering for the Indianapolis Colts in greater numbers than any State in the Union because of Peyton Manning, because he is our favorite son because of where he played his college football. 
   To this very day, he owns real estate in Chattanooga. He plays his golf in Chattanooga. We see him a lot. He is married to a Chattanooga girl. We are very proud of that. 
   You wouldn't know also that R.V. Brown, who was the chaplain for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is one of Coach Dungy's closest friends and the person to whom we extended the invitation. We are so very proud of these relationships. 
   What about Lovie Smith? He coached at the University of Tennessee as well. So all of these great players and coaches that really represented the goodness of America on Sunday and in the days leading into Sunday have some kind of Tennessee connections. 
   But I just want to close with this thought. Proverbs 16:15 says this: Good-tempered leaders invigorate lives. They are like spring rain and sunshine. 
   And I have got to tell you that Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith are good-tempered leaders straight from that scripture. They have invigorated lives, and they refresh and give life to this great Nation. We honor them today because of their leadership. We honor this team because of what they stood for. And we are grateful, frankly, that this brings the country together and lifts us to a new level. 
   Congratulations, Indianapolis Colts.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (CONDEMNING ASSASSINATION OF FORMER PAKISTANI PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO AND REAFFIRMING COMMITMENT OF UNITED STATES TO ASSIST PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Madam Speaker, I consider it a privilege to follow the distinguished Speaker of the House in recognizing our support for the people of Pakistan and our remorse that the world community of peacemakers has lost the great Benazir Bhutto. I, too, considered her a personal friend. I spent many hours with her, mostly associated with the National Prayer Breakfast here. 
   During the years she was in exile, she came many times to our National Prayer Breakfast, which is always the first Thursday in February. She was a proud participant in the Islamic tradition. However, she was always interested in the teachings of Jesus, and she was very much fascinated by the concepts of forgiveness and reconciliation,  and the principles that the last would be first and basically the way that the teachings of Jesus turned the world upside down. And we had coffee with her. We had lunches with her. My wife and I had dinner with her and her controversial husband and got to know him when he was here the last time she was here and visited with us. 
   She was truly a courageous human being, someone who understood the West, yet maintained her solid heartfelt conviction to her favorite country, Pakistan. She spent a lot of time with us, and she truly was a peacemaker. 
   I believe the greatest way to honor her courageous death would be for us to work tirelessly to empower the moderates within Islam to stand with us against radicalization, in any faith, frankly. But today, particularly in the Islamic faith, the radicals threaten the world. Yet 92 percent of people within Islam believe that terrorism is not an acceptable means to an end. And she was a leader among that 92 percent. 
   The problem is 8 percent of Islam is 130 million people who think that terrorism is acceptable, and those are the people that killed her. And they will kill anyone who threatens their ideology. And they killed her. 
   We need to empower all of the moderates within this very large religion to stand with us against the radicals, and then we can honor her courageous death. She will live on though, really through eternity, as one who, as MIKE PENCE said, was willing to lay down her life for a friend. 
   I will quote another Christian idea. It is in the Beatitudes. ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.'' Benazir Bhutto was a peacemaker. She gave her life for a cause, and the entire world should be grateful.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (WAR IS UGLY BUT TYRANNY IS UGLIER -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, tonight I come to the floor with several of my colleagues over the next hour to recognize that while even tonight we've heard these divisions on the floor from both parties and Members in each party that have differences of opinion about Iraq and the war, we come tonight to talk about the threats around the world that continue to emerge, that are real. 
   But before we get to the discussion about those threats and global security and the need for our country to be the leader of all of civilization, civilized countries versus, frankly, uncivilized, organizations, factions, even countries around the world who actually believe that blowing themselves up somehow is right or just. This is the struggle, and I do not think we can afford to deny the threats. I want to start first, though, by honoring the people who are volunteering to this very day to put themselves between the threat in our civilian population and serve in the uniform of our Armed Forces, first and foremost, the ones that have actually given their life for us. 
   Last week, over the Memorial Day district work period, I joined the families of two heroic East Tennesseans, one here in Washington at Arlington National Cemetery as I left. Sergeant First Class James David Tiger Connell, Jr., of Lake City, Tennessee, was laid to rest here in Arlington a week ago Friday for answering the Scriptural call that ``no greater love hath any man than to lay down his life for a friend.'' And then on Memorial Day, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, I joined the family of Private First Class Travis Haslip from Ooltewah, Tennessee, to lay his body to rest. Two great American heroes who joined six other heroes from my district who have given their life for us. And contrary to what some people say, they not only did not die in vain, they joined the ranks of the greatest Americans ever who were willing to give their life for the cause of freedom.     
   They were willing to lay it all on the line for the principles that this country holds so dear, knowing that every generation sooner or later has to face threats like this and somebody has to go and answer the call. 
   If you believe they died in vain, then many, many, many others through other wars throughout the history of our country also did, and I don't believe it for a second, because I know that it is those patriotic Americans that have paid the price. 
   I want to honor tonight Sergeant Paul Thompson III of Jefferson City, Tennessee; Sergeant First Class Stephen Curtis Kennedy of Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Sergeant David Thomas Weir of Cleveland, Tennessee, and I want to talk about his mom in a minute; Staff Sergeant Daniel M. Morris of Clinton, Tennessee; Sergeant John Michael Sullivan of Hixon, Tennessee; and Sergeant Terrance W. Prater of Speedwell, Tennessee. 
   I want to say that Jackie Weir, Sergeant David Weir's mom, wrote me a letter which I received over the Memorial Day weekend. This incredible mom has on the bottom of her letterhead a quote from General George S. Patton. It says, ``It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather, we should thank God that such men lived.'' This is on her letterhead. She gave her son for our country and its future. 
   This coming Monday, I will be privileged to join my nephew with the 181st Field Artillery Brigade as they deploy for Iraq from Chattanooga. Jeffrey Watts is my nephew, so a member of our family is going as well. May God be with all of them, protect them and strengthen them. 
   Because, as John Stuart Mill once said, ``War is an ugly thing, but it is not the ugliest of things.'' He said, ``The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.'' He said, ``A person who has nothing for which they are willing to fight, nothing they care more about than their own personal safety, is a miserable creature who has no chance of ever being free unless those very freedoms are made and kept by better persons than himself.'' 
   That is etched in my memory, because I don't believe everything John Stewart Miller ever wrote, but I agree with that, that the alternative to war sometimes is complete loss of freedom, and it is tyranny, and it is terror all the time, and it is oppression. Without the courage to fight and stand up, that is where we may end up. 
   It is easy to forget the timeline. I want to go through it. Then I want to recognize the gentleman from Michigan. The timeline though goes back a long time.

   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan, the Chairman of the Policy Committee here among Republican Members of the House, Thaddeus McCotter, an expert on these issues.

   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman. 
   We all desire a better course in Iraq. We all desire changes, not just General Petraeus' leadership and the increase in security forces from our country necessary to prevail in Iraq, but even more regional cooperation, and some of the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group so that people in this country will truly recognize, especially in the Congress, that this is not our President's war. This is our country's war. This is our country's fight. 
   Now a very prominent person from my State wrote a book called ``The Inconvenient Truth.'' He wrote it about the environment, but I have to say tonight on the floor of the House that a bigger inconvenient truth than the one he wrote about is the inconvenient truth that is lost around here a lot, that over half of the Democratic Members of the United States Senate and almost half of the United States House of Representatives voted to remove Saddam Hussein by force. Now, many people are running from that commitment and decision, but it is an inconvenient truth that they said it needed to be done and they committed us to doing it. And we went as a nation and there was not that much criticism as there is now, but it is convenient to blame or cast aspersions or to say that intelligence went wrong instead of accepting the responsibility that we removed a genocidal mass murderer from the world stage in an important time in the history of the Middle East and an important time in the history of the world. 
   I have two pages, and I am not going to go through these quotes like I did the time line, but two pages of quotes from the most prominent leaders in the Democratic Party in this country saying why Saddam Hussein had to be removed by force. 
   The quotes I will go through tonight, though, are from the terrorists themselves because I think they must be quoted so we understand what they are doing. 
   Zawahiri, al Qaeda's top leader in the region now, we don't know where Osama bin Laden is, but Zawahiri said, ``The jihad movement is growing and rising. It reached its peak with the two blessed raids on New York and Washington. And now it is waging a great heroic battle in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, and even the crusaders' own homes.'' 
   Al Manar said, ``Let the entire world hear me. Our hostility to the Great Satan, America, is absolute. Regardless of how the world has changed after September 11, death to America will remain our reverberating and powerful slogan: Death to America.'' 
   Zarqawi said, ``They are aware that if this Islamic giant wakes up, it will not be satisfied with less than the gates of Rome, Washington, Paris, and London.'' 
   Bin Laden's top lieutenant said, ``The fire has not and will not be put out, and our swords, which have been colored with your blood, are thirsty for more of your rotting heads.'' 
   The leader of Hezbollah said, ``We have discovered how to hit the Jews where they are most vulnerable. The Jews love life; so that is what we shall take from them. We are going to win because they love life and we love death.'' 
   Zawahiri said, ``Knights under the prophet's banner, al Qaeda's most important short-term strategic goal is to seize control of the state, or part of a state, somewhere in the Muslim world.'' He wrote, ``Confronting the enemies of Islam and launching jihad against them require a Muslim authority established on Muslim land. Without achieving this, our actions will mean nothing.'' 
   Osama bin Laden said, ``The whole world is watching this war and the two adversaries. It is either victory and glory or misery and humiliation.'' 
   Osama bin Laden has said, ``The most important and serious issue today for the world is this Third World War.'' That's what he said. ``It is raging in the land of the two rivers, Iraq. The world's millstone and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital of the caliphate.'' 
   These are the words of jihad. 
   Before yielding to the gentlewoman from North Carolina, I would like to encourage people to open a book called ``America Alone'' by Mark Steyn. The gentlewoman has just finished the book. It is on our reading list as we are trying to educate Members of the House on the threats. We all know you can't believe everything you read. But if you do your homework and you follow people who do their research, reading is the best way to understand this threat. 
   Let me say first, I am for pluralism. Every religious view is welcomed in this country, period. We are tolerant. It is a tenet of our foundation, religious pluralism is the American way. We do not believe in theocracy. It doesn't come with freedom, not our way. But let me say tonight, and this may not be popular in some quarters, that is not the Muslim way today. It is not. 
   The Islamists, the radicals, are insulated within Islam and they are not being challenged by the rest of Islam. And they call for a global sharia. That is Islamic rule. There were challenges all around the world right now about whether Islamic law, their law, a theocratic system, trumps the laws of any country, including this country. And if you don't think this is infiltrating most of the countries around the world, you are not paying any attention. This threat is growing and rising. 
   All you have to do is study the demographics that are articulated in this book and you realize that countries like our and Japan and Russia, they are actually declining in population. Our country is barely growing. The most rapid growth in the world is among the Muslim countries. Sheer demographics overtake us if the radicals continue to be insulated within Islam and not challenged because the numbers are exponential in terms of how many people are now willing to kill themselves for a cause. I could spend the rest of the night going through the latest statistics which ought to shock every American, that 26 or 30 percent, depending on two different questions, of Muslims in this country, many of whom are citizens, believe it is acceptable, this is scientific polling 2 weeks ago, it is acceptable to blow yourself up for a cause. That's a problem. I have to tell you, that is not acceptable in this country. 
   It is not acceptable that jihadism is fashionable or a way of life. How many people in the Muslim world now think that 9/11 was justified. I have to tell you, America is not perfect, we have made mistakes; but anybody in the world who apologizes for our country is wrong. 
   And these apologists who somehow blame us for what happened are wrong. Many others are here to speak. I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).

   Every Member of this body has an obligation to do their best to share their beliefs in what they think we face with the American people and their constituents. I believe that this problem in Iraq that we've got to do better with is not the end of this at all. 
   For some reason, God spared us again with the JFK plot and allowed us to actually interdict that before another September 11 or even worse happened. For some reason, He granted us grace, but it is a matter of time, given the conflicts that we face. 
   To the people, this Iraq conflict is a chapter in the war that is mounted against us, and it's not the end, anymore than the first bombing in 1993 of the World Trade Center was the end. We denied that it happened, but we weren't willing to address it, and September 11 happened. But Iraq is no different in the long-term conflict which is a generational struggle with radical Islam.

   Mr. WAMP. Madam Speaker, the nexus between national security, energy, and the environment is one of the most important issues of our time. And on energy, I'm an all-of-the-above Republican. It is wise to conserve, and we need to promote conservation. It is wise to advance energy efficiency technologies. We need to invest. But new capacity, new energy sources are also sorely lacking. We need new national gas supplies in this country. We need refinery capacity. We need our own oil, albeit limited. But we've got to, number one, grow our capability to create energy in our country to be energy independent. 
   I want to talk about nuclear energy because the cars of the future are going to run off of lithium batteries, some form of electric. We've got to have new capacity. We need nuclear energy in this country to be self-sufficient even on transportation. If we're going to reduce our carbon footprint, don't leave nuclear off the table. 
   This is a time to come together for new energy technologies, to promote an in-tech agenda, to actually balance the budget again with a robust manufacturing economy. It's pro-American.

   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support legislature, H.R. 1260, to designate the facility of the U.S. Postal Service, located at 6301 Highway 58 in Harrsison, TN, as the ``Claude Ramsey Post Office.'' This legislature would rename the City of Harrison Post Officer after one of Hamilton County's most notable leaders, Mayor Claude Ramsey. 
   As he serves his fourth term as County Mayor, Claude Ramsey continues to set a high standard as a dedicated manager and leader in the community. Prior to his term as County Mayor, he was the Assessor of Property, served on the Hamilton County Board of Commissioners, and was a member of the Tennessee State Legislature. Claude Ramsey's career as a public servant exemplifies diligence, hard work, and tremendous results for the people of Hamilton County. 
   During his tenure, Mayor Ramsey fought to strengthen public education in Hamilton County. He recently rallied the community to participate in an education summit to create solid initiatives to address the issues and challenges facing the public education system. Mayor Ramsey created six task forces and presented their findings and recommendations to the community. He then organized the introduction of eight key initiatives, including early education programs and a greater supply of laptop computers, to strengthen the public education system and increase graduation rates of students. 
   In addition, Mayor Ramsey has been a true leader in promoting economic development in Hamilton County. Mayor Ramsey's vision of creating more technology-based jobs in Hamilton County has shown strong results. His administration has secured Federal funding for the development of the Center for Entrepreneurial Growth, which provides local entrepreneurs assistance in developing new advanced-technology companies. Mayor Ramsey also secured over $2.8 million in grant funds for local businesses, which have helped create over 2,000 jobs, and played a vital role in the transfer of the 1200-acre Enterprise South Industrial Park property from the U.S. Army. 
   For his dedicated service and results, Mayor Ramsey was named ``Chattanooga Area Manager of the Year'' in 2003, which is the largest local awards program in the Nation. 
   Mayor Ramsey also has contributed to the community by serving on the boards of numerous agencies, including the Orange Grove Center, the Chattanooga Neighborhood Enterprise, the RiverCity Company, and the United Way. Claude Ramsey also served on the Board of Trustees at Erlanger Medical Center and was Chairman of the Board of Associates at Chattanooga State Technical Community College. 
   Most importantly, Claude Ramsey is a loving husband to his wife, Jan; a proud father to his son, Rich, and his daughter, Stacy; and a doting grandfather to his grandchildren Madison, Meredith, Macy, John Ross, and Claudia. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the passage of this legislation that honors Mayor Claude Ramsey for his commendable public service to the people of Hamilton County and the State of Tennessee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman. 
   I voted for this bill when it came to the floor earlier. I'm likely to vote for it again today. I'm concerned about speculation. I'm also concerned about price gouging in east Tennessee. Monday following Ike, gas was $4.99 a gallon. Over 500 complaints were filed with our State and the regulators there over price gouging allegations. I'm concerned about these issues as well. 
   But I've got to tell you, I'm a little puzzled why the quick rush to get to the floor on this bill again this week, less than 36 hours from the time that we saw an unbelievable event happen on the floor this week. And I'm not one in the last 14 years here to complain or to blame, but I've got to tell you what happened here was they convinced Members of their own party to vote against a bill that they had cosponsored to bring new oil and gas supplies on to our country in order to defeat any reasonable new capacity energy bill and immediately then went to change the subject, refocus the debate on speculation instead of oil and gas supplies, which will bring down prices. 
   It's frankly a diversion, it's a distraction, and I would have to wonder if it's intentional, listening to the rule debate over how this whole process came about. That's what I wonder is exactly what caused the rush to the floor. Was it AIG, so you want to focus back on the markets and Wall Street and speculation and these kind of issues? Or was it quickly change the subject away from the very unfortunate, very watered down, weak energy alternative that they jammed through the House without a lot of debate--well, there were 3 hours of debate--but without amendments, without alternatives, except for the one bipartisan bill that they then encouraged dozens of their own Members to vote against even though they were cosponsors and bragged about having written that bill? 
   Now that's wrong. That's wrong, and I come here today to say it and wonder just exactly why this has come up this quick again on the floor, change the subject and get out of town. I think that's what's going on. The American people shouldn't like it. They should demand better. We can do better. 
   We should be here debating. If you want to debate something in the markets in speculation today, how about the accounting rules that caused the AIG bailout? Maybe we could bring that up real quick so we can address some of these problems. That ought to be debated today instead of speculation, so you can change the subject away from oil and gas supplies because you really let the American people  down this week on the floor of the House. 
   Nothing's going to happen in terms of bringing down the cost of oil and gas before the election, and it could have.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Well, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I even come over to the Democratic side to begin my commentary tonight, because in my 14 years here, I have developed extraordinary relationships across the aisle. 
   I actually grew up a Democrat. Ronald Reagan made me and many people in my family members of the Republican Party. And I constantly say here that I don't think either party has an exclusive on integrity or either party has an exclusive on ideas, and at different times both parties have really let the American people down. But I think it is important right now to analyze where we are and what the important issues are that are not adequately being addressed here in the United States Congress at a real critical time for a whole lot of people. 
   This is not just talk. This is a fair assessment and analysis about where we are. As a matter of fact, National Public Radio interviewed me today and asked for my honest analysis about this new Democratic Congress that took over 2 years ago, because I was very blunt and candid and critical about the Republican majority of which I was a part over the last few years of our majority, because I felt like, and I stated it, that we were more interested in protecting ourselves for a period of time than the fundamental principles that brought us into a majority in 1994, and I knew we were sinking and I knew, frankly, we were going in the wrong direction. 
   Sure enough, we lost. The voters really didn't vote for the new Democratic majority as much as they voted against us. So I gave a fair assessment today of this new Democratic Congress that we have been under now for almost 2 years. 
   The success formula in life is sometimes defined as preparation and opportunity meeting each other. You hear a lot of other definitions of what success is. One definition of success in politics and public service might be to under-promise and over-deliver. And I have to tell you that what I really have seen here in the last 2 years is over-promising and under-delivery. 
   This new majority, and I am not a critic, I am rarely critical, and I am not a blamer, I rarely blame, but I have to tell you, it is unbelievable how bad things have gotten here in the Congress in the last several months. 
   The tradition of bringing the appropriations bills to the floor, taking them through the committee, having an opportunity to amend them, has basically just been thrown out the window. They came in ballyhooing that they were going to have the most ethical Congress in the history of the country; that no earmarks would ever be dropped in straight on the floor that weren't properly vetted and gone through the committee; that nothing would come to the floor straight from the Rules Committee under a closed rule that is not an open process where the people who are rightly elected would have access to offering substitutes; that they wouldn't strong-arm their own Members to vote against things that they had actually cosponsored. 
   I have to tell you, all of those things that I just said they had promised were violated, not just in the last 2 years, but this week. Every single thing that I just mentioned was violated by the majority this week, and it was an ugly week here in Congress when we finally got to the most important issue of the year, which is energy. 
   I want to tell a couple of stories. Three years ago, after Katrina hit, I was on two appropriations subcommittees that had jurisdiction to the aftermath of Katrina, the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   When Rita was bearing down, the second hurricane, on Galveston, they called an emergency meeting of our two subcommittees and called us into a room and they said, if Hurricane Rita continues on the track it is on and it hits Galveston head-on, we need to inform the committees that by next week we will not have gasoline across the eastern seaboard in some places. And it was an emergency crisis kind of a call. 
   I have to tell you that after Ike last week, in a small way, but in a very meaningful and unfortunate way, that happened in Tennessee. Prices spiked to $4.99 a gallon. In some stations there was no gas whatsoever. And that was from Ike, that did less damage than was feared, and it just proves how vulnerable we are as a nation because of energy. 
   This issue is now bringing us to our knees economically. So many people on fixed income are hurting so bad. And even the markets. You wonder about Wall Street and what has happened and the mortgage industry. 
   Listen, credit has been overextended, and those people ought to be held accountable and the government shouldn't come in and bail out the private sector. But I can tell you one reason why the credit is not being honored and the bills are not being paid, is because the cost of energy for American consumers has soared so much that they can't meet their obligations and people are being foreclosed on, credit is not being paid on time. And these big institutions like AIG and Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, they have all consolidated and they have overextended credit. But it is a huge problem, and most all of it is driven by energy. And if we don't diversity our supply, if we don't increase our domestic production, if we don't throw the ball deep on energy, we are going to continue to come to our knees economically. 
   Now, you might ask, why would the refineries not be able to give the output if one or two of them are down or if there is a hurricane that comes in? Let me just say that all of the new permit applications to explore for oil and gas or bring on new refineries face litigation from these extreme groups that are lined up with lawyers 10 deep to stop new oil and gas production in this country.     
   That's the truth. That's the truth. That is a special interest that has a foothold in the Congress with this new majority. That's the truth. They score their votes, they rate them, and this week they pressured them to vote against a new capacity bill that was bipartisan, created by dozens of Members from both parties and, frankly, they voted against the bill that they actually wrote. 
   Now, how can you get Members to do that unless those special interests, the radical environmental groups that file suit over all this new oil and gas supply that we have access to, but we have locked it up, and we want to unleash it, this is the critical issue of our time. Our way of life is at stake. 
   This is that important, and you are seeing a sinking of our economy, a loss of our competitiveness. Without natural gas resources, our manufacturing base is leaving this country, without the ability of our people to move around and make a living. Let me tell you, Dixie Produce, Lee Pittman, a small businessman and an excellent entrepreneur, pays his bills on time, works hard. He can't make a go of it because gasoline is too high for him to make a profit. He has nowhere to turn. 
   I feel for these people. I want this Congress to respond. I want us to throw the ball deep on energy. 
   Now the Democrats typically say all you all want to do is drill, and we want renewables. Listen, I am the cochairman of the Renewable Energy Caucus. I have been for 8 years. I have promoted more than anybody on our side, maybe ROSCOE BARTLETT and I, the expansion of tax credits and incentives for renewable investments, but they are not quite ready for the marketplace. 
   The total percentage of all energy is only 6 percent, and you can't increase it to 20 overnight. I would ask the new majority, if they really believe that much, why have they not extended the renewable tax energy credits and incentives all year long. We are still waiting for that. It's supposed to come up next week, they say. 
   Now today we hear they want to adjourn next Friday and put that off until after the election too. They are also talking about a new economic stimulus, which they say means unemployment compensation and other social-type programs. I know we have got  to help people that need relief, but the most important economic stimulus we can do is pass the American Energy Act, creating thousands and thousands of new production jobs in manufacturing and energy technologies for the whole world, for our country and the world. That's throwing it deep and going after it for all the right reasons. 
   Listen, this place is broken down to where for months now, this Democratic majority has been in retreat over this issue of energy because the radicals, the extremists, have basically convinced them that the higher the price of gas goes, the better off we are. People will quit driving and quit using fossil fuels if the prices go that high. 
   We don't believe that's in America's best interests. We believe we have got to build a bridge to the future by bringing on some new oil and gas supplies, diversifying our supply, go after the renewals in hydrogen and the new advancements and build nuclear plants, but we believe you have got to do it all. 
   This week they watered down a bill so bad that it has very, very little, if any, oil in it, even if you could do it. They passed it so the Members could go home and say we voted to drill. Please re-elect us and keep us there. 
   That's not really what the American people deserve or expect. I am not saying that Republicans are smart and Democrats are dumb, or we are good and they are bad. 
   I am saying that they are not doing a good job representing what our country needs. They are not bringing the legislation to the floor, and they are playing politics with this thing, and we have got to have a bill soon to the President, because we can't put this off for any longer time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (COMMENDING THE FIREFIGHTERS FROM CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES FOR THEIR COURAGEOUS ACTIONS AND SACRIFICES IN FIGHTING THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I especially thank the author of the resolution, Mr. Farr of California, for his leadership and insight here in the Congress. It's a privilege to serve alongside him. A very thoughtful man. 
   I want to join the chorus in praising these firefighters and encouraging others to answer this extraordinarily difficult call to public service every time that one of these fires encroaches on areas where people live and work. But I do find it ironic, having been here for 14 years, from time to time these issues cross over with each other because, frankly, the nexus between the environment, which is a part of these fires; energy, which is also a piece of this; and national security is the most important challenge of our generation, this nexus. And they are connected. 
   Over the last 14 years I have had the privilege, even with Mr. Farr, to travel to places like Yellowstone and Yosemite Valley and the Olympics in Washington State and actually see with the stewards of our public lands, which represent over one-third of the land mass of the continental United States, is government-owned land, and actually be there with the Forest Service, the Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management personnel, many of whom are registered foresters, who will say that one of the biggest problems with the creation of these fires is the dead and dying timber which we have refused to clean out in terms of our stewardship of the forest. You can't just leave this forest alone and let all of this timber become just a matchbox on the ground without huge problems with the fires. 
   So the mindset that says leave all forests alone and do not touch them, even to the point of not cleaning up the dead and dying timber, which creates with any kind of a spark these out-of-control fires that come into California into the areas where people live, the mindset that says, for whatever reason, do not touch these forests, is a flawed mindset that causes these fires. 
   The best thing we can do for the firefighters is to try to mitigate the fires with good forestry practices, good stewardship, and logical environmental response. I consider myself a very logical and rational lawmaker on issues of the environment. But that is the same mindset that says under no circumstance do you take a piece of land in the middle of the Arctic tundra and not explore for oil and gas there. 
   That is the same mindset. It's a flawed mindset. That is why we have the energy pinch. It's a mindset that says States cannot even go into the Outer Continental Shelf, if they want to, and explore oil and gas resources, when in fact we should leave that up to the States. 
   So here we are, kind of feeling the pinch and the adverse consequences of extremist environmental policy, whether it's fires, whether it's energy sources. We have to come back to a rational, logical modern approach. 
   Now I am very much part Cherokee Indian. The Cherokee National Forest is in my district. The Cherokee used to intentionally burn the forest. Why? Because it helped the nutrients in the ground. It became more robust. It's a natural cycle. They intentionally did it. 
   Speaking of good forestry practices, they were not only not afraid of fire, they used fire for the right purposes so that the forest wouldn't get out of control and just burn wildly. 
   It's that kind of thinking, long-term stewardship, that we need to get back to so that the political winds of the day do not stymie us on good management practices with our forests or good energy policy as a Nation so that everything is not off-limits to the point that the lights go out in California or we are paying $4.50 for a gallon of gas. 
   These are unacceptable outcomes when all we have to do is take a reasonable, responsible approach from the center of America, representing average people, and saying, We are all for stewardship, we are all for participating in global warming, but we don't want to do it at the expense of our future. Our economic future, our quality of life, all these issues come together. 
   So I would implore the leadership--I understand the Speaker of the House yesterday said in fact the SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, does need to be released so that we can increase some supply of oil. I am glad to  see these steps are taken finally to recognize that supply and demand are at stake here, they are at work here, and that we need to increase the supply of oil and gas in this country. Not that that is the cure-all, end-all, but it's one of many things that we need to do in an all-of-the-above approach to energy, which is connected to the environment and good long-term stewardship for our country. 
   I thank the gentleman for the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished ranking member. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to talk for a minute about process, because I have been on the Appropriations Committee 11 years and on this subcommittee for 9 years. I have served on half a dozen subcommittees of appropriations, and I have seen no subcommittees exert more or better oversight to the programs that they are responsible for than this committee. 
   First under Chairman Hobson, now under Chairman Visclosky, the two have worked as brothers very effectively to hold accountable these agencies. You heard them both express consternation with the Department of Energy. In my 12 1/2 years here, the first 6 years it was Democratic leadership of that Department, and now Republican leadership of that Department. Both could improve, and both must improve. But these gentlemen are trying to hold these programs accountable. 
   There are two issues here on responsibility. One is just holding the line on spending. The other is exerting the Congress' responsibility to make sure these programs work and that we get the bang for the buck, spend the money and get the return. Oftentimes, the bureaucracy and the waste and the mismanagement are more important than the dollars that are being spent. They are doing something about it, and doing it extremely well. 
   Now, I am also for holding the line on spending in a big way. But if you ask the American people right now which one of these appropriations bills should you be spending more money in, they would say energy independence first. It is the biggest national security issue we have now. It is the confluence of the natural environment, our energy independence, and national security. 
   So all I would say is, let's be careful we are not penny-wise and pound-foolish. We should be spending more money on renewables and energy efficiency and energy research. We should be trying to encourage biomass and new fuels and new vehicles. So let's be careful, okay? 
   I definitely want to hold the line on spending. There are going to be some vetoes, and rightly so. But I want to make sure that this particular bill at the end of the day better funds these programs that we are all for. 
   Remember, ``conservative'' means conserve energy, save energy, more efficient energy. These are important programs. They can be managed better. 
   This is also the bill that funds nuclear nonproliferation, a big issue right now. We have got weapons activities. Heather Wilson of New Mexico spoke at our conference this morning about things that actually are not in this bill and should be in this bill. 
   So this is the beginning of the process. I know Senator Domenici is going to weigh in. I love it, because these House leaders have given the House a better position to negotiate this bill from than we have ever had in my tenure here, because we need that leverage. Frankly, the Senate has rolled us on this bill for many years. Not any more. We get fair treatment. We can go in there and negotiate our priorities and come away with a good product. 
   So I am not going to say this bill is perfect, but I have to tell you, they have done a great job putting it together. We are going to end up with a great bill in the final analysis. Congratulations to all, and thanks to the staff.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Madam Speaker, nobody in east Tennessee hates the fact more than me that I'm going to vote ``yes'' today after voting ``no'' on Monday. Monday, I cast a blue collar vote for the American people, shook the foundations of Wall Street, demanding more accountability. But today, I'm going to cast a red, white and blue collar vote with my hand over my heart for this country because things are really bad and we don't have any choice. We're out of choices, our backs are up against the wall. 
   All week we fought for some improvements. And the increase in the FDIC limits from $100,000 to $250,000 is an improvement. The mark-to-market changes which will allow these mortgage-backed securities to move and free up liquidity will help a lot because small business people can't meet their payroll. This month, many of them in east Tennessee are not going to be able to meet their payroll. Pension funds in east Tennessee, thousands and tens of thousands of people I represent are upside down and it's happening fast. The cost of inaction is greater than the cost of this bill. 
   The $700 billion is a loan. Warren Buffet said Wednesday night it's a good business deal, he would take it, the government is going to get their money back. He knows more about this than anybody in this House, to be honest with you. He feels good about it. I don't like this at all. As a matter of fact, I hate it. It's disgusting that we would ever be brought to this floor to have to cast this vote, but we're out of options. We don't have a month to rewrite a new bill. 
   Things are critical. We don't even have gas at the stations in east Tennessee. Economic anxiety is hurting the families. I've been listening to small business people all week long and they said, thanks for voting ``no'' on Monday and thanks for standing up for us, but you've got to do something. 
   Congress has to act. We're out of options. Hold your hand over your heart and vote ``yes.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the tone and the statement of our colleague who just completed his hour and was talking about what our country can do when we pull together. Over the next hour, I believe that several Members of the Republican Conference here in the House of Representatives will come down and share their perspectives gained, many of them from physically going to Iraq or Afghanistan, or both, during the recent August district work period when Members were back in their district and allowed to travel to give firsthand accounts of what they learned and their meetings with General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker and others, and a real up-to-date report on the situation in Iraq. 
   But I do agree with the gentleman in his closing comments that we must as a Nation take ownership again of certain things not even in a bipartisan way but in a nonpartisan way because these are America's problems. They are not Republican or Democratic problems. And frankly, as much as some people would like to say it or believe it or use it for political purposes, this is not President Bush's war; this is America's fight. President Bush and Vice President Cheney will be gone in just a little over a year. The problems will not go away. The threats will still be here. The challenges of this generation to answer our patriotic call to this Nation, to answer our responsibility in sacrifice and service will continue, I believe, for some time. 
   I did not go to Iraq in August, but my nephew did. Specialist Jeffrey Watts is now serving his country as a soldier in Iraq for the next 15 months as part of the 1-181st Field Artillery Brigade. I heard the gentleman from Minnesota talk about the deployments. What I was fascinated by when I was with the 1-181st earlier this summer as they shipped out to Fort Bliss to train to go to Iraq, is how many members of the 1-181st, and this is a National Guard unit, also deployed with the 278th from our Tennessee National Guard a year and a half ago and came back and redeployed with the 1-181st. They didn't have to but did; and how many vice versa went before, many of them because they are volunteering to serve their country in harm's way. In harm's way, big harm's way, because they love the opportunity to serve their country. They are incredibly selfless patriots of the highest order, and I do think this House comes together in praise of these valiant Americans who understand that freedom is not free and that somebody has to stand between a real threat and our civilian population, and that is what they are doing.  
   General Petraeus will be here next Monday with Ambassador Crocker to give us an update. Everybody is anticipating that, and you have this review and that review and these stats and those stats. And even the Government Accountability Office is heavily involved, as if they somehow supervise the Pentagon. But I think it is important for us all to prepare to listen objectively next Monday because I think you are hearing in a bipartisan way, Members like the gentleman from Washington State from the Democratic side who recently came back and clearly said much progress has been made. This Petraeus plan is working. 
   The guy who understands this insurgency threat more than anyone in our military and therefore anyone in the world is leading a new approach in Iraq. And the report will come beginning next week. And if we are objective, I think we will support his recommendations. If we are not objective and we have a political bias or an agenda, we may reject it. 
   Some of his words in anticipation of next week are already out. He talks about the extraordinary progress in the Anbar Province. General Petraeus says that was the result not of military actions certainly alone, it was the result of really a political shift where the population, led by the sheikhs of major tribes, decided to reject al Qaeda and its Taliban-like ideological behavior and the extremist behavior that they have come to associate with it. 
   He said: ``That is what brought the level of violence down so dramatically, because al Qaeda no longer finds a hospitable place in the Euphrates River valley the way it certainly did in the past. We have been banging away at al Qaeda for years, but until we could hold them off with the help of the local population and local volunteers, those operations were never as meaningful as they have been in recent months. That is what we are trying to do in other locations in Iraq. That has also led to a rise in the detainee population over the last 6 months as more al Qaeda operatives have been caught. And while there is always a concern that they will gain strength, the pool of potential recruits has actually shrunk. Their sanctuaries have shrunk considerably so they don't have the ease of locations and movements where they are safe the way they were before. Clearly there is real progress being made. War is an ugly thing. It is always an ugly thing. It is not perfect, but great progress is being made.''

   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her service to the Commonwealth of Virginia and to this great Nation of ours on the Armed Services Committee and for going and bringing us that unique insight. 
   As I prepare to yield to the gentleman from Georgia, let me say I think part of the equation for the Congress in a responsible, objective way in the days ahead is to remember that this is not all about Iraq. It is about the bigger picture with the global threat of the jihadists, the most radical elements of Islam, and the way that they are spreading their influence around the world outside even of the Middle East. I think we have to really understand that to know what the stakes are associated with the precipitous withdrawal or anything that is perceived to be a retreat. 
   These are real problems. It's easy to say, oh, George Bush got us into this war with flawed intelligence. It's also easy to forget that over half of the Democrats in the United States Senate voted to remove Saddam Hussein by force and almost half the Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to remove Saddam Hussein by force based on the very same knowledge and understanding that the executive branch had about what the threats were, and we made that decision as Americans. 
   It is really unfortunate today that decisions and responsibility for those decisions now end up being peeled off as partisan issues instead of, we do these things together, we stand together, we stand behind our troops together, we stand behind their mission together. 
   We had Members like Ralph Hall of Texas come back and say to a person the men and women in uniform told him while he was there that we should stay and finish what we started and not leave until we can successfully complete this mission. And you say, well, what is that and when will we know? Objectively, you're getting that report and it's much more positive than it was, and the stakes for leaving are incredibly high. 
   If you don't believe the influence of the radical Islamists around the world, I would encourage you to read Mark Steyn's book, ``America Alone,'' where he lays out what's happened in Europe and the influence with the global sharia, which is a call to Islamic law, and the intimidation and the threat around the world, or even this new book called ``Alms for Jihad: Charity and Terrorism in the Islamic World,'' by J. Miller Burke. He wrote this book exposing the connection between the Saudi royal family and terrorism through these charities that they set up and funnel money. 
   It reminded me of the Oil-for-Food scandal at the United States where Saddam Hussein corrupted the United Nations.     
   All of the corruption that exists through this radical effort, because this book that lays all this out can't be bought today. It has vanished from all of the Amazons. It has vanished from the availability of Barnes & Noble to find the book. What happened to it? 
   Well, through intimidation and money, they have taken this information out of circulation so the people can't see these connections. 
   They literally tie him, this man, Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, to the charity that he set up to fund bin Laden with Saudi royal family money, and then when they published the book, it vanished. You can't get it. You can't go buy it. 
   Mark Steyn lays out, this is the kind of work that the radical Wahabi sect, the al Qaeda operatives, are doing in the world. They have infiltrated and corrupted, and we are like boiling frogs if we deny any longer how this threat is overtaking the free world. America Alone's premise is they've already got Europe and frankly Australia is really the only nation standing with us like they need to. 
   This is a growing global imminent threat. If we pull out, it will rapidly deteriorate in the world. Our credibility will be lost for generations. We may never regain it. Those are the stakes. That's bigger than Iraq. Iraq is one chapter in this long-term gener-ational struggle for our freedom. The sooner we realize it, the better we are. 
   I went and spoke to kids in schools in August, and they asked the question about, well, Afghanistan and the Taliban attacked us, but Saddam Hussein in Iraq didn't attack us. Why did we go there? 
   The lesson of history is Germany didn't attack us, either. Japan attacked us. Germany didn't attack us. But did we ignore the threat of Nazi Germany? No. Our men stormed the beaches of Omaha and liberated Normandy and Omaha Beach, and liberated Europe, so that our way of life could be preserved. Sometimes they forget that, but that's American leadership. This is very, very similar to that. 
   Are we going to exert it in a world in what this editorial calls the caldron, you know, of the worst political and religious pathology in the history of the world in the Middle East? This is the central stage. We cannot retreat from this without us really, really taking a global hit. 
   The next president is going to inherit the responsibility of doing this, of carrying this forward. 
   I want to yield to the statesman from Georgia, a physician, a healer, a man with a great heart but a strong back, also a member of the Armed Services Committee, Dr. Phil Gingrey.

   Mr. WAMP. That reminds me, today, yet another terrorist plot coming out of Germany, preparing to attack our Air Force base in Germany and soft targets of just public places in Germany where Americans are known to hang out was foiled, thankfully. The German authorities were on top of it. 
   That is a major, major terrorist attack again. We see this over and over again, thankfully, you know. God has spared us, our intelligence is working, we are listening. Because of FISA, we are able to listen to foreign terrorists talk to each other. We've taken the precautions. 
   Then I have this theory that they don't want to strike us right now because they don't want our country to pull back together again and be resolute against this threat, so that those things, combined, have kept our country secure and safe at home while we are fighting these insurgents and these terrorists in the Middle East. 
   We're going to be fighting them somewhere. If it's not in Iraq, it's going to be Somalia, Northern Africa. I can go through a list of the troubling places in the world where we're going to face these kinds of problems and activities, and there are 20 countries that are at risk around the world for big-time terrorist actions like the Taliban came out of Afghanistan, and we can either basically stand against this threat today or face it globally and more at home tomorrow. That's not a threat. It's reality. In Germany today it was proven again they are trying to hit our targets wherever they are.

   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman for that commentary, especially the update on the hearing today from the GAO and Mr. Walker. 
   I will be a little more pointed to tell you as the ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the GAO, and funds Mr. Walker's organization, that unfortunately many times, whether it is government spending or oversight in Iraq, a lot of what happens in his office revolves around him and not us.     
   It is all about him, and again today, it's all about him. He's the only one that somehow can be unbiased, and he's the only one that can do this. And there's a little kingdom over at the GAO and he's the king. And we need to remember that and put it in perspective this week before we hear from the absolute expert on counterinsurgency in modern world history, David Petraeus, the best we can put in charge. He's the best we can offer to this situation. And let's listen to him objectively and not get caught up in an ego matter, frankly, involving Mr. Walker.

   Let me say, before introducing the gentleman from Texas, one of the biggest changes that I see, not just in Iraq, but globally, is that finally moderate Muslims are standing up against the radicals. We're seeing that in country, we're seeing that in other parts of the world. Up until a few months ago when they saw American resolve coming forward, they literally were so afraid and intimidated and harassed, and the radicals were seizing the moment. 
   Now, finally, and let me tell you, because of the sheer numbers, if we're ever going to really permanently throw this threat back, the moderate people in Islam have to lead and help us, and that's beginning to happen.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Chairman, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. 
   I commend the gentleman from North Carolina for putting together a bill that meets the security needs of this country. As a former member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, I respect the enormous task the subcommittee has in providing oversight to a department that is still finding its way. 
   Of particular concern to me are the Department's Infrastructure Protection analysis centers, which provide basic analytic services to the Department of Homeland Security. PSAC, the Protective Security Analysis Center, is one such tool. PSAC is a collaborative effort between a number of Department of Energy national labs and industry partners which exist to collect, analyze and share infrastructure risk information within DHS, as well as with the communities in which the infrastructure is located. 
   PSAC integrates infrastructure information, risk analysis and data collection through assessment tools to support the process of risk-based decision-making. PSAC also hosts a number of DHS systems supporting chemical facility security and bombing prevention, as well as the National Asset Database, all of which are essential to accomplishing the DHS mission. 
   It is also important to note that DHS has made a $52 million investment in PSAC over the past 4 years to develop these capabilities and expertise. Without continued support, this significant investment would be lost and DHS would be left with numerous unfunded mission requirements. It is my understanding the committee has approved $78.9 million for identification and analysis. 
   Chairman Price, I ask if you will work with me, please, to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security provides adequate funding for these analysis centers, particularly the PSAC, in FY 08.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (EXPRESSING SYMPATHIES AND SUPPORT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS AFFECTED BY THE POWERFUL TORNADOS THAT STRUCK CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ON FEBRUARY 5, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I think Mahatma Gandhi once said that if all of the people who profess to be Christians would act like Jesus, the world would be at their feet. And I was reminded of that last week, because when we gathered Sunday morning for the Johnson Atchley Sunday School class at Red Bank Baptist Church where I go, ironically the lesson was on witnessing; and many times people consider ``witnessing'' as sharing the Gospel verbally. But we all know the most powerful witness that anybody can give of their faith and their commitment to the Lord is in what they do. And, man, did we ever see that again last week in Tennessee. 
   I have to tell of the people in Madison County who've been hit and hit and hit again over the last several years by tornados because one of the students at Union University, who was hurt very badly, is David Wilson, who happens to be a very, very close friend of my family. His parents are two of my wife's and my best friends, and he cotaught that Sunday school class with me at Red Bank Baptist Church for a number of years. His son was transported today from the hospital in Madison County across the street to Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga where he will be continuing in recovery. But he was hurt critically, and he was underneath the rubble for 4 hours with other students at Union University. 
   I have got to tell you, the experience that the family saw there was a witness of their faith and their goodness. They not only had the basics of water and food and shelter, they found a home and they took care of them, but they went and got him eyeglasses and met every single need, and they made sure he was flown back to the hospital at home today and met every single need. And that's how people express their love for God is by sharing what they have with others, especially in a time of need.  
   Tennesseans are good people. And, man, when folks are hurting, everybody comes to help. We saw it again in Madison County. And on behalf of the Wilson family, I want to say from the other end of the State, thank you to the good people of that entire area where the tornados hit yet again. Thank you to Union University for meeting every need. Thank God none of the students died. 
   David Wilson has got a long, long road back to stand and walk again. We pray for the Wilsons. We pray for David. We pray and thank God for all the people who helped at this time of need. Just appreciate the goodness of the people of Tennessee who came out and helped in so many ways and all of those professionals that were there, it has been said. 
   And thanks to this delegation for pulling together yet again. And for the people who were hurt in other States and affected and for loss of life, our prayers went up. This is really what it's all about is people being there, because that's really all we are here for is to love God and to serve others.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (THE COST OF ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Madam Speaker, over the last 14 years that I have had the privilege to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, I have tried not to be excessively partisan. Frankly, having grown up a Democrat and become a Republican during the Reagan movement in this country, I feel like neither party has an exclusive on integrity, neither party has an exclusive on ideas. 
   But I feel compelled, Madam Speaker, to come to the floor today to say that one issue right now is burning in the American public like no other issue, and that is the cost of energy. This morning, the economy is sliding rapidly downward, primarily because of energy. 
   Now there's talk in the House here and in the Congress of a second stimulus bill that includes a variety of things that the new majority, the Democrat majority, has cobbled together. But the most important thing we could do for the American economy is to pass the American Energy Act, which is the Republican bill that opens up all of our oil and gas resources in this country. That is the most important thing we could do for the economy. For jobs and productivity and exports and standing our country back up economically, it is the most important thing. 
   Yet today it's going to be suppressed again because the Democratic energy alternative is a very limited, watered-down effort, designed, honestly, to just give some of their members a vote so they can say, Oh, we voted to drill a little bit and go home to campaign. Yet their idea of economic stimulus is going to be more government, more spending, more borrowed money, and it's really unfortunate. 
   It's really unfortunate because the most important thing we could do is just pass this robust energy bill, and in our bill we share the revenues with the States that opt in, that want to have Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas exploration in the zone where the oil and gas is, in the Gulf or off the West Coast, this resource that's been locked up for a long period of time, that we now know has to be unlocked, and Hurricane Ike was another reminder over the weekend that we need to diversify our supply, increase our supply, and have a robust approach to this, and not a very limited approach. 
   I will tell you where the problem lies. The American people are really frustrated. I have local officials calling me every day, angry, because the people they represent don't have anywhere to turn. Gas in east Tennessee was $4.99 a gallon this weekend. People on fixed incomes are hurting and hurting and hurting and they wonder what the heck is going on in Congress and how is this happening. I have got to tell you, it's called extremism. 
   Now environmentalism is a good thing if it's a responsible, logical, commonsense resource management idea. It's a good thing. But extreme environmentalism is the problem. Extreme environmentalism has locked up our energy resources for a long period of time. And these Sierra Club types lobby the Congress and they score these Members and they say, If you don't vote with us all the time, you're somehow a radical person in the back pockets of oil and gas, and all this. Let me tell you, they're extreme. 
   On every new permit in this country, every single one for oil and gas exploration, they have immediately filed a lawsuit to tie it up in court, and they have got an unlimited supply of lawyers to sue to keep us from bringing any new oil and gas resources on the market. That is a huge problem. It's called extremism in the environmental community. 
   For years and years, they have been lobbying this place, and I have been here, and I have seen it. Now it's come home to roost. These are our problems. 
   Today, we need to give the Republicans a vote on the American Energy Act today in the House, and let's unleash the economy again and lower the cost of energy before it's too late, guys. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this is an important day. It's not about politics, it's about the people we represent and the fact they have nowhere else to turn. We need action. We need it today. This is not a partisan thing. There are really responsible people on both sides of the aisle that need to come together. And the liberals from San Francisco don't need to govern national policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and I commend him for his work on this important bill. 
   As you know, our Nation is facing a major health care crisis because of childhood obesity. Due to a significant decline in physical activity by our Nation's youth, a growing number of children are experiencing illnesses and the other health problems, such as Type II diabetes, hypertension and respiratory problems. The rise in obesity-related health conditions also has high economic costs and has greatly increased health care spending, both mandatory and discretionary.     
   As the social and economic costs of childhood obesity increase, the number of children engaging in physical activity is drastically decreasing and many schools are even cutting back on physical education programs because of budgetary concerns. It is critical that we focus our efforts on funding for physical activity at this time to fight this epidemic of childhood obesity and improve the health of our children. 
   Mr. Chairman, the National Youth Sports Program is a vital program that promotes physical activity and provides children with the leadership and academic skills to improve their well-being. Due to the elimination of funding for NYSP next fiscal year, many children in Tennessee and throughout the country will lose the opportunity to participate in this important program. I simply ask that you work with us to ensure that proper funds are allocated to NYSP and the promotion of physical activity as we go to conference.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member. 
   For 12 years I have come to the floor defending our free enterprise system and standing up for market forces in setting prices, costs, and wages. But I have to tell you, 9 years without a minimum wage increase is a problem, especially since, over those 9 years, corporate leadership has let us down in this country time and time again not honoring the traditions of responsibility to their workers and their stockholders. So, last year, I was one of the leaders asking us to increase the minimum wage but putting a very reasonable death tax exemption of $5 million on to the legislation, and it passed this House with a strong support and almost passed the Senate, missing by  two votes. That is the best way to raise minimum wage. 
   The second best way is to add associated health plans, to give benefits for small businesses increasing the minimum wage. 
   I am going to continue to argue that that is the best way, but let me surprise you and tell you that even if that doesn't pass today on final passage, I am going to vote to raise the minimum wage, because you can't defend not raising it for 9 years if we are going to have a minimum wage. That debate is for another day, whether you should set wages or not. But with a minimum wage, you can't defend not raising it. The President needs to sign and increase the minimum wage. 
   Let's do it the right way though. But if that fails, we will vote for this and send it to the President, and I will bet he signs it because it is time for workers to have an increase. But we need to recognize the free enterprise system is what everybody values about this country most of all. They are moving towards free markets. Let's not trample on the markets, but let's recognize that 9 years is long enough, and at the end of the day, we will increase the minimum wage and send it to the President. 
   Now, how is that for bipartisan, Mr. Miller?

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA AND THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA ON IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for yielding. 
   And I just want to open by saying how encouraging it is to see a Member like yourself take such a hands-on interest in the affairs of the Middle East, and I think anyone here tonight or watching these proceedings would understand your perspective and how informed it is. Plus you approach it from the purity of an Iowan. And I am very grateful for your due diligence and for the work that you have done and the way that you understand these threats. 
   I was reminded, as you were speaking, that just a couple of years ago you and I were in Africa together talking about these threats and how we were concerned that Africa was also at risk with some of the areas like Somalia, which is in the news again this week, where these international terrorist networks are, frankly, looking for another sovereign nation from which to  operate, as they had with Afghanistan, and how global this threat really is. 
   I did not come, Mr. Speaker, to the floor tonight to in any way alienate or accuse anyone here or the other party in this case, because if ever there was a time in my life where we need Democrats and Republicans to come together on an issue of national/international importance, it is this issue. This is where I hope that there are never partisan motives attached to anyone's position on matters of war and peace. 
   I want to go back to the very time when we voted in the House and the Senate to remove Saddam Hussein by force and remind everyone that over half of the Democrats in the Senate voted to do so and almost half of the Democrats in the House voted to do so. And they can say now, oh, but we didn't have good information or whatever their rationale is for wanting to pull out abruptly now, but the truth is we are where we are and this situation is as it is and we are in it together. And if ever there was a time where Americans need to meet again at the water's edge, it is now. 
   I don't want to preempt what the President says tonight. The President is in a very difficult place because the war has not gone well. We have made mistakes. We have not implemented certain policies to the best of our ability. And I think it is important for him to recognize those flaws and those shortcomings with the mission to this point because, in my opinion, all great leaders at some point say we are on the wrong road and we need to get to this road or we have made this mistake or that mistake and if you will join me, we can rectify this problem. Because the stakes are enormous, as you said. 
   The great football coach Vince Lombardi, and football is just meaningless compared to these matters of war and peace and life and death, but he said once that fatigue makes cowards of us all. We need to remember that as a people, as a Nation, because we are all tired of this. I mean, I am weary of attending funerals in my district. I attended one with my wife again Monday, another one of a young soldier who died in Iraq over the holidays. His son was born the day after he died. We are all sickened by this sacrifice and this loss. But I have got to tell you if that collectively causes us to lose our passion for freedom or our will to carry on our way of life, it will be a tragedy in American history, and these are the decisions of the moment. 
   Now I know that our friends from time to time quote people, but one of the people, ironically to me, that serves as kind of the conscience of some of these international issues is Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, who ran against, with my fellow Tennesseean Al Gore, the President and the Vice President. He just returned from this area and he came back in support of not only continuing our efforts until we can prevail in Iraq but, if necessary, and I am not endorsing increased troops tonight and I think the President is going to make his presentation and he has got a long way to go to convince the country and the Congress that this is necessary, so I am not endorsing that. But I am saying that Senator Lieberman came back and effectively endorsed, in order to control these areas of insecurity particularly within the 30-mile radius of Baghdad, increasing troop strength and he talked about ``greatly advancing the cause of moderation and freedom throughout the Middle East and protect our security at home.'' And I am very concerned that if we retreat into the 1990 style complacency that 9/11s will continue. 
   One of the problems is that we did not have enough troops on the ground, and one of the expressions I wish hadn't been uttered was ``Mission Accomplished'' because there were many difficult days ahead of us following that unfortunate time. We didn't have enough troops to secure the area in and around Baghdad, and that is where 80 percent of the violence is taking place.     
   Sending more troops to Iraq will not help unless it is coupled with a concrete and feasible plan and a new strategy that requires the active participation of the Iraqi government. And the goal should be clear, an Iraq run by, secured by and governed by the Iraqi people. 
   Frederick Kagan from the American Enterprise Institute wrote this week that, ``The real choice we face is this: Is it better to accept defeat than to endure the pain of trying to succeed.'' 
   I will say it again. ``The real choice we face is this: Is it better to accept defeat than endure the pain of trying to succeed.'' 
   I don't think we can accept defeat. I don't think we can be seen as in retreat, and I want to explain why. For one, all of those troops that have given their lives that I have been with the families of say to me, We must prevail. We must continue on. My son, my husband, my father, believed very much that this was a just cause and the right thing to do, and we must succeed. They have suffered great loss, and they believe that it is the right thing to do. 
   But I want to say this, this cannot be George W. Bush's war. This must be America's fight. We must see people in a bipartisan way come together around a plan. I don't know if 20,000 troops is the right number, or 5,000 or 100,000; but we need to come back together because we are where we are and it is what it is, and if we are ever going to bring troops home in victory in 18 months or 24 months, we may have to put our foot down in the short run. Senator Lieberman believes so. The President believes so. And I hope that the case is made clearly so that more and more Americans understand this. 
   Over the last few days, Zawahri, who is now the commander effectively of al Qaeda in the Middle East, has encouraged these terrorists to go to Somalia, as I said earlier, in northern Africa to fight the fight. The truth is this: If we were out of Iraq tomorrow, this threat continues. This threat did not just happen. September 11th was not the beginning of this. It was the culmination of them attacking us and our interests around the world and our sovereign land around the world, at our embassies. The same people, the jihadists, the extremists. 
   Read the book ``Hatred's Kingdom'' about wahabism, Qutubi and Azzam. In the 1950s, they began indoctrinating people on this unbelievably radical element in Islam to oppose anyone who did not believe as they believed, and that is the Hezbollah foundation out of Iran, as you say. 
   When people say these connections were not in place before September 11th, these connections with these terrorist elements have been in place for years. Don't deny that. You are burying your head in the sand. Read ``Londonistan'' and how they have infiltrated London. Read ``While Europe Slept'' and how they have infiltrated Europe. Read ``America Alone'' or ``Looming Towers'' and understand that these threats are our generation's call to courage, and we cannot grow weary such that we retreat. Too much is at stake. 
   The President is trying to get us back on the right road. One speech is not going to do it. Tonight is not going to do it. But I am hopeful for our country's sake, not my party's sake, not the Democrat's sake, but for our country's sake so we can find a path forward together. This cannot be the President's war. It has to be our country's fight against the jihadists wherever they go, and Iraq is one theater, and they want to fight us, and we need to defeat them. Let's meet together and send them back to their caves or into eternity so that our way of life is carried forward to the next generation. 
   This is a generational challenge. We can't deny from time to time in history you have to step up and these brave sons and daughters have done just that, and they have volunteered to serve. We honor their sacrifice, but please, House and Senate and country, come together and find a path forward as one Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentlelady for the time. 
   I just come today because we need to remember that our moral authority as a Nation in the world doesn't come from our extraordinary free enterprise system or our capital markets or our military strength, as important as that is. Frankly, our moral authority comes when we uphold the rights of every human being in the world given to them by God, their Creator, and not by the government. 
   Frankly, the decline in human rights in the world over the last 20 years is one of the greatest challenges that we face. The combination of human rights violations around the world, and the intolerance of religious views, and the lack of religious freedom, are creating such a divide in the world that if we're not careful, we face a Crusades-like event. And the two go together. This is so appropriate. 
   I want to thank people like Frank Wolf. I miss Mr. Hyde and Mr. Lantos. What a privilege to serve with people who are here because they care so much about the rights of individuals, not just in this country where it's guaranteed under our Constitution, but everywhere. 
   I am maybe one the younger Members, even though I'm 50 now, who has traveled the world and tried to be engaged on these issues, like Mr. Aderholt, Mr. Pitts and many others, Mr. Smith on our side. This is so fundamental to our way of life and our moral authority in the world and we lose that. Not everybody is worried about money. In the world they look to us because we're basically good and we uphold the right of the individual, and those are inherent human rights. 
   This Commission is the right approach. Otherwise, it just gets lost in the shuffle of this crisis and this bailout and this conflict. The world is really struggling, and our country needs to be a light and a beacon of hope.

   Mr. WAMP. We have to be that light, that shining city on a hill, and we have to uphold the rights of the individual. And we have to be engaged in the world in order for that to happen. We can't just pull in and hunker down and look at the world as if it's not our problem. It is, more so today than ever, because this is a global marketplace, and we are connected to the entire world. 
   And there are so many wrongs around the world. We can't be the world's police force. We can't solve every single problem. But if we uphold the right of the individual, and it's fundamental to what happens here on the floor of the greatest deliberative body in the history of mankind, we have a chance of standing for the rights of the individual. Human rights are fundamental to our way of life. 
   This Commission is so important. I commend those that have brought it to the floor today, and urge passage by every single Member of the House.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (SUPPORTING CHRISTIAN, JEWISH, MUSLIM INTERFAITH DIALOGUE -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, over the last 14 years that I have had the privilege to serve here in the House, many times I have come to the floor from the head. 
   Today, I totally come to the floor from the heart, and that was the initial motive that I had was from the heart. We can't really speak for each other because we are speaking from our faith perspectives, but I do think that our motives are all for peace, and that is the common denominator that brings us together today. It is historic in the sense that three principal sponsors here are a Muslim, a Jew and a Christian. I happen to be an evangelical. 
   But we are here in a country that is pluralistic, that separates us from the entire world in that we honor and respect everyone's religious views. We may have a foundation that's Judeo-Christian, but it's so important that we cling to this pluralistic approach. We are not theocratic, and we do not want the world to be divided over our religious beliefs. 
   The common denominator today is that we stand together against radicalism and violence and terrorism. I have seen polling data in the Islamic world that shows that 92 percent of Islam denounces and does not believe  that terrorism is an acceptable means to an end. That's the good news. 
   The bad news is that 8 percent is a very large number of people. But we want to encourage the moderates, the peace lovers in all of the Abrahamic faiths to stand together against radicalism and extremism and promote tolerance and a pluralistic view, as we have in this country, that is part of our foundation that says every one has the right to worship as they please and to believe as they please, even not to believe, if they please. That is part of our fabric. 
   The divisions over religion in the world create this danger of some kind of an event where, over religious intolerance and difference in the world, we can have a Crusades-like event. 
   Now Jesus to me is love. That's my belief. I come to the floor today to say I in no way want to water down anyone's faith or beliefs, but I do believe that Jesus taught us blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall inherit the kingdom of heaven, and I want that to be me. 
   I am speaking for that belief, and I believe there is a time for war. I believe when we are attacked, we have to defend ourselves and our freedom and our way of life. 
   But there is also a time for peace, and I hope and pray that is now. I think you have to risk peace from time to time, and that's what I am doing on the floor today. I think we must, as a Nation, risk peace. 
   I want to commend Tony Hall, who is part of the formation of the Council of Religious Institutions of the Holy Land, also known as the Jerusalem Council, where Mr. Berman, Mr. Ellison and I got together with the religious leaders from the Holy Land of all three Abrahamic faiths to promote peace. 
   Many times the state departments and the governments of these countries get together to talk peace, but then religious leaders are not there, engaged, buying into what the policies are that will maintain peace. We want the religious leaders to also come together and stand against radicalism and violence and division in the world. 
   I think the scope of these divisions are so great that this is the greatest pursuit we can engage in to lasting peace, is to stand together against radicalism and to respect each other's religious views. That's what I call risking peace. That's the common denominator. 
   I don't want to say that I know Mr. Ellison's motives or Mr. Berman's motives, but I know mine. I ask the House to come together and stand together, even if it's for this brief moment, respecting our traditions of pluralism, and the freedom of religion, but standing together united against radicalism and violence and terrorism and encouraging all in the Islamic world, and all in every faith, to stand together against violence and destruction and death so that we have the hope of a world that could exist together in peace, because blessed are those peacemakers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the distinguished ranking member. 
   Mr. Speaker, for over 12 years in this House and over 10 years on the Appropriations Committee, I have worked really hard to try to be fair, bipartisan, cooperative. 
   I have to say, though, here today that campaign rhetoric is one thing but when the rubber meets the road on this huge, important bill to have this kind of a process in this kind of a bill is not right. To have over $21 billion of extraneous spending added to this bill, under a closed rule, which is not the regular way here in the House, especially on appropriations, and, frankly, to then even violate your own budget rules is not right. 
   I have to say that first. It is kind of insider talk, but it is important to know that this is not the regular order and not the way this should be done. 
   Then I respect all the Members in this House that have served in the military, and I respect so much the gentleman from Pennsylvania and his expertise here. But I disagree that if you vote against this bill, you are not supporting the troops, and you are not supporting the veterans, because I am going to do both, and I always do both. 
   I do believe that this bill needs to be changed dramatically. I hope to serve on the conference committee, and I hope that the product that comes back from the conference committee is very different, that it is more about supporting the troops and not all these extra things, and that we don't micromanage the war through the appropriations process. 
   Now, let me also say this. When the President said mission accomplished, he was talking about removing Saddam Hussein. We agreed as a Congress, over half the Democrats in the Senate voted to do it, almost half the Democrats in the House voted to remove Saddam Hussein. I wish that wouldn't have sent the signal that it was accomplished because the mission wasn't accomplished. The mission is not accomplished, and the mission may not be accomplished in August of 2008. 
   As a matter of fact, this threat is not going away. One thing I know a lot about is this threat of jihadism. I have read 20 books. I have been to lectures. We cannot retreat from this threat. We must stand against this threat.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (BIPARTISAN EARMARK REFORM -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I thank Frank Wolf for a distinguished career of public service. We honored the life of Tom Lantos today here in Congress, but Frank Wolf is the same kind of person as Tom Lantos in terms of always caring about what is right, what is just, human rights anywhere and everywhere in the world that need our attention in the greatest Nation in the history of the world. Frank Wolf is one of the people here that I look to always for the integrity on decisions that are controversial, that are impassioned. He seems to have a level-headed approach that honors the Constitution, honors what is right. 
   So here we are again working together. Jack Kingston and Frank Wolf and I, as long-standing Members of the Appropriations Committee, know that this is a problem. This abuse of earmarks has created clearly the need for sweeping reforms of this process. But I think that we need to do it the right way instead of the wrong way. 
   One of the things I like about John McCain is that he doesn't pander to people based on whatever might be popular for the moment. The right approach to this particular problem with congressional earmarking in 2008 is to step back and establish a bipartisan, bicameral select committee to overhaul the process in its entirety. 
   I say that because any kind of a ban that is temporary or only for an individual is not lasting. So if you pledge to say no earmarks, well, for how long and who all is affected, and how about the Senate, how about the House, how about the executive branch, how about everybody else? Because unless it is a systemic change, it is not a permanent change; it is not a real change. It is a political posture. Therefore, we should be careful not to pander on this issue, but truly seek change. I think that is what this does. 
   This select committee, what is a select committee? Well, Congress has this provision so that that committee can rise above the other committees. It has subpoena power. It has tremendous authority. It is unusual. But it is a committee set up to reform a system like this. 
   Now, a lot of people don't realize that article I, section 9 of the United States Constitution clearly says that Congress shall appropriate the money. We need also look at history and realize over the last 40 years there is a continuing separation of powers under way where the executive branch pulls and pulls more and more authority from the legislative branch. 
   One of the things that this select committee would allow us to do is over a 6-month period of time, with five public hearings, have a national debate about what is the Congress' role, what is the executive branch's role, both under the Constitution and in reality. 
   Just 2 weeks ago, February 1, the President's budget request came over. Actually, it was February 4. But when it came over, it was full of specific requests for specific programs which are an earmark. They are earmarks. So one of the first things we need to do with this select committee is define what is an earmark, because right now it is not clear as to what is and is not an earmark. 
   For instance, is it an earmark for a Member of Congress to request an increase in a specific account at the National Institutes of Health? If it is the National Institutes of Health and you believe that it should be increased and you are a Member of the United States Congress, and under article I, section 9 you have the authority to appropriate money, that should not be an earmark. But I have got news for you. A lot of things right now classified as an earmark should not be an earmark. It should be programmatic in nature; it should be looked at in a different way. 
   So this whole system needs an overhaul, and that select committee can get to that without people claiming turf protection or feeling like you are stepping on their toes, and then they can come back with these recommendations that would have the force of law and truly change this whole process without the legislative branch retreating from its constitutional responsibility or just ceding more and more authority to the executive branch, many times to people at the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, that submits these budget requests, who are neither elected nor educated enough on these issues to actually make these recommendations. That why it is important for elected representatives to do this in a very responsible way. The select committee is exactly that approach, the responsible way to do this. 
   It is comprehensive in nature. As Representative Wolf said, it doesn't just apply to the Appropriations Committee. It applies to authorization committees, tax and trade and tariff bills, the executive branch requests, the whole gambit of direction of funding of appropriated dollars. And the whole thing needs to be reformed. 
   I will give you an example. The Bridge to Nowhere request is one of the most egregious earmarks that we can point to, and it did not come through the Appropriations Committee. It was in fact an authorization bill from the Transportation Committee. That is gas tax dollars that every 5 years the Congress directs to this projects or that projects or this priority or that priority, and in fact that Bridge to Nowhere was an authorization bill. So you can wipe out all the earmarks on appropriations; and if that is allowed to continue, the most egregious abuse we can point to continues. 
   You need a comprehensive and systemic approach to this, and that is why we have had consensus developing in our conference on the Republican side for basically a timeout, a moratorium: 6 months, no earmarks, hold up the trains, let's stop and do this right. But do it responsibly. Don't just willy-nilly say we are going to do this for political purposes or that for political purposes, or we are going to grandstand or pander. No, we are going to do this the way that people 50 years from now can look back and study the record and say, they put the institution and its congressional prerogatives and responsibilities above the passions of the moment, and they recognized that some people abused it and that needed to be cleaned up and reformed and changed, but they did not give the people down the street at the executive branch more and more authority and violate the separation of powers under the Constitution of the United States. 
   This is an important principle as we go forward on how to truly have a systemic approach to clean this mess up. But it needs change. Anybody who thinks that this system stands the ``smell test'' in America is wrong. It needs to change, and we are trying to change it from this place because that is the responsible thing to do. People have abused it. 
   I would argue that the last election in 2006 was lost by our party in large part because of these abuses of earmarks, on authorization, tax, trade, energy bills and appropriations, and we could use an overhaul, a statutory framework that the House and the Senate would both have to adhere to. The public is demanding it. 
   So some self-imposed thing is not going to bring about systemic change. Systemic change is what this institution needs, change that will still be here 10 years from now, not just for the next election. This shouldn't be political; it should be bipartisan. 
   Just this week, one of the leading Democrats here in the House basically called for the same thing. He said we ought to have a moratorium; we ought to have a timeout and we need to overhaul this practice. His name is HENRY WAXMAN. I talked to him today. I don't want to put words in his mouth. But I was encouraged that one of the leading Democrats said the same thing, basically: we need to have a comprehensive reform of this process known as earmarking. 
   But I believe step one is to define it, what is and what is not an earmark, and then go forward. Things that are  existing by law that have been around for a long period of time should not be an earmark. 
   Another thing we need to do is separate the ability of people to have a cottage industry through lobbying for earmarks. That, frankly, makes everybody in Washington look bad. It erodes the public trust over a period of time. 
   There are times where someone advocating for you for a specific cause in this country is necessary, and that is called lobbying. Today lobbying has a bad name. If I was a lobbyist I would want these reforms so that my reputation is not tarnished. Just like we appropriators, WOLF, KINGSTON, WAMP, KIRK, CULBERSON, WELDON, GOODE and others that have helped us with this cause, we don't want our integrity tarnished by the people who abused this prerogative under the Constitution. 
   They are the ones, just like the local law enforcement guy who takes a bribe, all police officers are not like that, and all Members of Congress are not going to do what these people did. Thankfully, the people that have violated our trust are either under investigation or they are already gone or some of them are in jail. But the system needs to be cleaned up so that they cannot do that again. That is what hasn't happened. Frankly, there are some people in this institution who are kind of arrogant about this, saying that it ought to continue and that there is no reason for reform. But that is not true either. 
   So we have got to meet in a rational, logical way. That is why the select committee approach is the right approach. I am very, very proud to stand with Representatives WOLF and KINGSTON and others in support of this approach, and we will have a moratorium on earmarks until we make the needed changes to begin to restore the public trust and uphold the honor and the dignity that should be associated with our fulfilling our responsibilities under the Constitution of the United States. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding time.

   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report, and I thank the leadership from Tennessee for the role they played in formulating this bill. The chairman of the Science Committee, Mr. Gordon, and Senator Lamar Alexander listened. 
   If being fiscally conservative means turning a deaf ear to the leaders of our extraordinary free enterprise system, like the Augustine participants who recommended these solutions, then we are being penny wise and pound foolish as fiscal conservatives. If we do not invest, you will not balance the budget again. 
   I was here in 1995 when the budget wasn't balanced, and then it became balanced. Not by cutting spending but by rightly slowing the growth of spending and restraining government spending. But we balanced the budget with a dynamic growth economy. 
   The chairman of the Science Committee pointed out that the Internet itself came out of a DARPA investment through programs like this, and it was telecommunications that gave the United States this dynamic global economy where revenues soared. If we want to lead the world in energy technologies, you had better invest now. 
   This is not a social program transferring wealth from one to the other. This is an investment in the next generation. This reaps the highest return of investments we make in the Federal Government, and this is an authorization. I am an appropriator. We might not be able to appropriate all this money, but the authorization allows us to try every year as the priorities come to the committee. 
   What is important? Is it important to invest in the next generation? You bet it is. Are we falling behind? You bet we are. Are we going to do something about it? We had better. And you can't vote ``no'' all the time. All year, I have come down here at the committee and on the floor and voted to restrain spending or even cut spending. Not now. Not on this. It is too important. This is a generational legacy. 
   I am proud of what we are doing in our national laboratories, and we need to stoke that fire and allow this country to be all that it can be. 
   Vote ``yes'' on this conference report in a bipartisan way and say to the next generation we are going to lead the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Madam Speaker, the reality of 2008 is that the nexus between national security, energy, and the environment is the most important public policy issue that we face in this country. The nexus has a lot of different angles to it, but these three issues together is the greatest policy challenge that we face. 
   The farm bill is now in a sense an energy bill. The national security challenges that we face are indeed tied to the cost of oil. Unfortunately, these are the realities of what we face today. 
   Tomorrow in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory which is one of the lead laboratories in our country on alternative fuels, biofuels, research, mostly looking at cellulosic ethanol research and how to best bring that about, tomorrow at that laboratory my senior Senator, Senator LAMAR ALEXANDER, will lay out a Manhattan Project style approach to energy. 
   I don't want to preempt what he is saying there tomorrow, but he is joined tomorrow by Congressman BART GORDON, a Democrat from our State who happens to be the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee here in the House on a Manhattan-style approach because of this nexus, because there is a lot of clamor about global warming and because people are looking to our country to take some leadership, and the President of the United States has said we do need to lead. I believe this is an opportunity for us. 
   But I will tell you what my position is on energy, and this is after 8 years as the Republican co-chairman of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus in the House of Representatives, which is over half of the House, it is about 60 percent Democratic members and 40 percent Republican members. I have chaired it for 8 years with MARK UDALL. I am the chairman of that, but my position on energy is an all-of-the-above position. It has to be an all-of-the-above position. We cannot pick winners and losers. They did that in California and the lights went out. You can't pick winners and losers, not when we have the capacity challenges that we have today. And we do have capacity challenges everywhere. 
   At $122 a barrel, this is a supply-and-demand problem. If the people who don't like us around the world that produce oil would increase the supply, the price would go down. Or if the demand would reduce by conservation and not so much growth in India and China, the price would go down. But this is a supply-and-demand problem. We have to have an all-of-the-above solution. 
   Let me talk about a few things because transportation is the big driver, and gasoline is the most painful thing for the average consumer. I would suggest to you today, and Members say this a lot, but I know a lot about this, alternative fuels are only a bridge to the future. They are not the end all. That is not where we are going to end up in terms of transportation. 
   We have such quick development in ion lithium batteries that the people in the auto industry will tell you that we will be plugging in our automobiles very, very soon at a cost-competitive price point, not like the hydrogen fuel cell which is a 25-year proposal because the cost is prohibitive today, we can't pay $300,000 for a car, so we can't have hydrogen fuel cell cars yet, but that technology is out there. And maybe it will work. 
   But I will tell you what will work right now in the marketplace is electric cars, and they are coming quick. Plug-in hybrids, GM and Toyota, the year after next, will be commercially viable at a price point such that consumers will use them. So fuels are important, but technology is going to develop. Transportation is two-thirds of our oil consumption, and we have to move quickly there because this is very, very painful. 
   But here is the technology opportunity for the United States of America, and I call this the in-tech agenda. How did the budget get balanced for 4 years here? I was here. I think SHIMKUS was here. Four years ago, LEE TERRY was here. For 4 years in a row it got balanced, not by cutting spending. We did slow the growth of spending below inflation for 4 years which was very admirable because that hadn't been done in 40 years. But what we did do is we  had such a robust, export-driven U.S. economy that revenues surpassed expenses. That's how the budget got balanced. 
   Now what drove the revenues up? Well, guess what, we led in an area of the economy, and it boomed with our leadership, called the information world. Bill Gates and people like him so led the world that if you wanted the best in software and computers, for a long period of time they were from this country. I grew up when you didn't want to drive an American-made car. You didn't want to have an American-made television; for a while it had to be Japanese. Cars had to be German. Things changed. We led in the information world, and revenues surpassed expenses. 
   Guess what can happen early in the 21st century if we get off our tails: we can lead in energy technologies. We can solve the world's problem by being proactive and not even beat a retreat on climate change. I don't want to argue about how much man contributes to climate change because, frankly, the science is not clear on that. But it is an opportunity for us because if we provide these technology solutions to the world, the budget will get balanced again with a robust manufacturing-driven U.S. economy. Part of an all of the above. 
   We should provide the nuclear solutions to the world and not be afraid of it because, like the speaker said, in France and Great Britain and the Netherlands and other countries, nuclear is very much a part of their portfolio because they have a balanced portfolio, because they know they need to do these things in order to reduce their emissions. 
   While we are going to vigorously debate next year this issue of global warming, anybody in this place who says they are for cleaning up the air globally and making progress on zero emissions and carbon sequestration and reducing the carbon footprint and they are not for nuclear, they are kidding themselves because it has got to be a part of the portfolio given the capacity demands of today and tomorrow. 
   And if we are going to plug our cars in, capacity has to increase on energy. It is an all-of-the-above strategy. 
   Just today in the House, Congressman STEVE BUYER, with me as an original co-sponsor, introduced the Main Street U.S.A. Energy Security Act. It opens the Outer Continental Shelf to responsible energy production. It allows energy development within the ANWR. It streamlines the refinery permitting process assisting new refineries to be built in the United States for the first time in 30 years. It supports the development of coal-to-liquid plants. It supports the building of more nuclear plants. It provides a 3-year production tax credit extension for wind, biomass, geothermal, and many of the renewable investments. It invests in research and development programs for the energy needs of tomorrow. 
   You say, What are you doing introducing that today? Well, that is just a package of things that we are reintroducing again that we voted on in this House over and over and over and over again in the last 14 years because I counted, and it is dozens and dozens of times that we have had these votes, and the people who were for more capacity lost. On the floor of this House, on the floor of the Senate, we lost. 
   Bill Clinton vetoed the bill to open up oil production in Alaska. I'm not picking on him. Maybe that is what people wanted then, but they sure don't now. Why are we not responding? Why is our head buried in the sand? We have to have an all-of-the-above policy to compete. And we can balance the budget again. It is good for us. The world sees us reducing our carbon footprint, leading with new energy technologies and solving the world's problems. 
   We sat on the couch from 1973 to 2008. Since the oil embargoes of 1973, we sat on the couch as Americans and didn't make the changes we needed to make. And now we are in a mess. A $122 a barrel mess. But we sat on the couch. Guess what happens when you sit on the couch and you don't exercise and you don't get ready; that's where we are. We have to change. 
   You cannot vote against energy capacity in any segment of our economy or energy production without ending up either the lights go out or the price is too high, access is not there, and people are hurting. That's where we are today. It is an all-of-the-above strategy. 
   Let me close on this note. I am a conservative, and conservation is a good thing. People can begin to reduce demand by conserving, and consumers can join us. We need to do better, and so does the consumer in this country. 
   Use less, be sensitive to lights, drive less, move to smaller vehicles; demand goes down and price goes down. We need to do that, and it is not wimpish to propose that. It is a good, solid, pro-American thing. Let's be more efficient, let's move to alternatives. But I'm saying an all-of-the-above strategy. Don't say we can do all of this with renewables. It is not there to meet tomorrow's demand. We have to have all of the above. Some things are long term and I know that, but right now we have to respond. This takes a balanced approach. 
   I thank Members from both sides who have that attitude, and I look forward to tomorrow at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (PEAK OIL -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank Mr. Bartlett for this lesson. I should say Dr. Bartlett. It is rare that a person has been in Congress for as long as you have. I first met you, Congressman Bartlett, when you and I were running for Congress in the 1992 cycle. I did not prevail, and you did, so you got a 2-year jump on me here. 
   And I've been here on the floor in the past when we talked about this challenge, and my only regret tonight is that all of the Members of the House were not here to hear again your comprehensive explanation of some of these problems and the solutions and the realities, and that everyone in our country could not understand as well as you understand the realities of what we are seeing today. 
   I want to begin elementally by saying that the nexus between energy and national security and our environment is the most important policy challenge of our time. And all of the conflicts of the world have some relation to those three challenges. There's obviously religious undertones and whatnot, but those have been around forever. These challenges now all kind of collide. That's this nexus that I am talking about. 
   On the national security front, you mentioned Thomas Friedman's column, and there is one quote in it that I wanted to point out where he says, `` `There are 23 countries in the world that derive at least 60 percent of their exports from oil and gas and not a single one is a real democracy. Russia, Venezuela, Iran, and Nigeria are the poster children' for this trend where leaders grab the oil tap to ensconce themselves in power.'' 
   That makes this peak oil challenge a critical national security problem for the United States of America. 
   When I talk about the environment, one of the most important issues now as we face the next Congress and the next administration after this fall's election will be the American response to this global warming challenge. And I would argue this: We can't deny the problem. We can't bury our head in the sand from the problem. We should not ignore it, but we better be very careful that we don't over-regulate our free society as we respond to it. 
   The world needs to see us proactively addressing this problem, but I would say the best way we can do it is deploy the technologies, use the innovation, parlay and capitalize on our free-enterprise system to solve these problems for the world, much in the same way that the information revolution in the last 30 years in this country was led by the United States of America and the likes of Microsoft; and in doing so, a robust U.S. economy erupted that led to a balanced budget in this modern era that was unprecedented where revenues actually surpassed expenses. 
   So we see energy and the environment and national security all come together. 
   Now, earlier tonight I talked about an all-of-the-above approach that I promote that we should promote because the capacity needs, both from transportation and fuels and electricity are so great, even today but even more so in the future, the capacity needs are so great with this demand that we have to not, in my view, leave anything off the table but have an all-of-the-above solution. 
   But I want to zero in, because you have rightly talked about these issues of conservation, efficiency, new technologies, renewables; and I want to highlight a few because I said earlier tonight on the floor, I'm a conservative. I think conservatives should promote conservation. That's a logical thing to say and to do. And that should be first and foremost, and it is not wimpish, as I said earlier, for us to promote conservation. It's smart. It reduces demand and lowers price. That's what we have to see. And it should be led by the top, and it should be a grassroots call for us to be as efficient as possible in all aspects of our life, frankly. 
   We have sat on the couch for a generation knowing these problems existed, and we haven't acted, and there's plenty of blame to go around. I don't want to come to the floor and blame everybody. There's a lot of that that goes on. Frankly, that's one reason people tune out Washington so much is there's too much of a blame game going on here. American people want these problems solved, but I really believe we should look at these incredible technologies that we have. 
   So let's talk a little bit about transportation because there's a Farm Bill coming. There's a lot of talk about alternative fuels. 
   I believe in the south that cellulosic ethanol will be part of the solution, but it's a bridge, in my view. Even at best, it's a bridge to the future. It's not the permanent solution. The fuel mix could certainly be improved, and cellulosic ethanol doesn't destroy our agriculture and our food capabilities and pricing like corn-based ethanol does, so that obviously has been a net loser for the environment; it has been a net loser for agriculture; it has been a net loser economically in some ways.  
   But cellulosic ethanol, say switchgrass that you don't eat, it could actually be productive in creating an alternative fuel. But that's a bridge to the future because if you ask the automotive industry leaders, they will tell you that in a couple of years, the price points on plug-in hybrids will be such that Toyota and General Motors in 2010 will have a cost-competitive plug-in hybrid. 
   So the vehicles of the future are going to run probably for a while on some form of electricity, some kind of a battery, an ion lithium battery. The technologies are developing very quickly. Imagine plugging your car in in your garage overnight and having it charged where you can take it 400 miles before recharging it and getting an equivalent horsepower of 260 to 280 horsepower. People would be excited about that if they could afford it. Right now the price point on a hydrogen fuel cell car is not cost effective. It's a couple hundred thousand dollars at best, which obviously is not ready for the marketplace. That may be 15 to 25 years from now. 
   And there is a silver lining in the cloud. You talked, Dr. Bartlett, about the silver lining during the Carter years, that it caused us to blunt the sharp increase in consumption. The silver lining today with these price points is that technologies are rapidly being deployed because the marketplace knows there's opportunity there. 
   And we were with the President of the United States yesterday discussing this, and he talked about that specifically that you're seeing the most rapid movement towards alternative transportation systems and technologies that we've seen in the modern era because people cannot afford gasoline today, and therefore, alternatives will hit the marketplace faster. And surely we could have done better in the past, but we've got to find these solutions so we're going to have some kind of electricity. 
   Now that brings all of the energy problems together when you're talking about electric cars because two-thirds of the oil consumption's in the transportation sector, and we've got some capacity problems in the electricity sector, and we are not bringing on nuclear plants at anywhere near the rate of European countries because we're still caught in this Three Mile Island time warp of safety and security. And the waste stream is such here that you can't permit a place to bury it, like Yucca Mountain, in a timely manner. 
   So we need to look at the proposition that they do in France of recycling the spent fuel back into energy. Reprocessing spent fuel. It's a closed-fuel cycle. We can do that. We should look at that. And we should bring nuclear up. 
   But I want to throw a new technology into the electricity production which could very well help us on transportation as we move towards battery-powered cars if they're cost effective. See, I believe the market will determine which ones come first and which one consumers will buy and which ones hit the price points quickest, and that's where people, I think, will buy. 
   So I think if electric cars or the plug-in hybrid is the first one there at $25,000, $35,000 for a new car, that's where consumers will go. But where is the electricity going to come from if we do this? We don't have the capacity right now to meet today's demand based on commerce and industry, let alone new transportation systems that need electricity. 
   And we are the most abundant source of coal. We're the Saudi Arabia of coal for the world. But we have got to, if we're going to take this leadership position on climate change and not bury our head in the sand, we've got to have clean coal technology, we've got to have carbon capture. We've got to invest there. We've got to still use coal, but it's also a finite resource, which you have identified. 
   Let me tell you about a new technology that's really got potential. It comes out of the Silicon Valley and the Tennessee Valley, interestingly enough, where I live. We're in a partnership with them. We have built a stationary solid oxide fuel cell system. It looks like the HVAC unit in your home. We now have a 100 kilowatt system, meaning it generates 100 kilowatts of electricity, and it runs off of one feedstock going in but no transmission system. So unlike the electricity that comes to your house, it is not connected on a grid somewhere to a power source. It's a standalone system for electricity production, but you do have to have a feedstock going in. 
   But this unit runs off of the feedstock as natural gas, can run off ethanol, it can run off of solar, it can run off of a variety of renewable sources; but it has to have a feedstock as you know--are you a physicist?

   Mr. WAMP. Physiologist. As you know it has to have a feedstock, but it has tremendous potential. 
   And just recently here in the House, I have promoted, and much to his credit, Dan Beard, the chief operating officer of the House, has been and viewed these systems as has the chairwoman of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, been in consultation with us about the notion that in just a couple of years, we could take an entire House office building in Washington, D.C. and take it off of the fossil-fired powerhouse here on Capitol Hill, take it off of that coal powerhouse and put it on a solid oxide stationary fuel cell to demonstrate to the country that emissionless, completely emissionless, not nuclear, but through a new technology called a stationary solid oxide fuel cell, you could completely power and cool and heat and cool the water in a huge House office building or a 100,000 square foot commercial center with this new technology. Tremendous. 
   You would think every utility in the country would be interested in that because there is no transmission grid. It makes us more terrorist-proof because you can't shut down the transmission grid because everybody's got their own electricity source. And if transportation is moving towards electricity, it has tremendous potential. 
   I would just say that your energy efficiency, renewable energy, conservation programs should be at the forefront followed by a real understanding that we have capacity needs in this country. I, too, was in China in January. I have a great concern because what I heard and saw in China about their attitudes towards the environment is that this is indeed their industrial revolution and they're entitled to it. 
   The problem with them having an industrial revolution in 2008 is they're almost one-fourth of the world's population, and if they have an industrial revolution without environmental responsibility at the same time the rest of the world is being called on to reduce carbon and their carbon footprint, it's a regulatory burden to the industrialized world and it lets these developing nations, including China, off without those regulations. 
   That levelizes the world at our expense. That's a dangerous notion. 
   So back to the nexus. This is critical. You're taking excellent leadership. I want to thank you for that, and I want to thank you for the time tonight.

   Mr. WAMP. Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young and their staff for their help. I'd also like to thank all 21 cosponsors for their involvement and especially Congressman Heath Shuler, who helped me champion this very worthy initiative. Most of all, I would like to thank Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, Chad Smith and Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee, Michell Hicks, as well as the National and State Trail of Tears Associations. 
   I am very proud of H.R. 5335, the Trail of Tears Documentation Act and count it as a great privilege to be the lead sponsor. When I was a little boy, my mother told me of my own Cherokee heritage. Her grandfather, Luna Meadows was half Cherokee. His mother, Little Flower, was a full-blooded Cherokee midwife. So completing the story of the Cherokee Removal is personal for me and very important for our country as the Trail of Tears and the forced removal is one of the seminal injustices in American history. It must be told accurately, honestly and completely. I urge passage of this bill and enactment of the legislation. 
   This bill is the subsequent measure to H.R. 3085, the Trail of Tears Study Act which was signed into law in December 2006. H.R. 3085 directed the National Park Service to complete a study on expanding the current Trail of Tears National Historic Trail to include previously omitted components. In 1987 when the original Trail was designated, the historical documentation available for these known passages was sparse and ambiguous. Since that time however, significant research on the proposed additions has been documented by National Park Service historians through military journals, newspaper accounts and vouchers--compelling us to reconsider these passages. In fact, the NPS has noted that now these proposed trails are better documented than the primary routes that currently make up the Trail of Tears. 
   The Cherokee removal is only one tribe's story of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, but it is the most visible in American history. It is not just an Arkansas and Oklahoma story; it started in North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama. These distinct routes and campgrounds proposed in the Trail of Tears Documentation Act more fully reflect this tragic saga of a proud people's forced removal. The story is not yet complete until we commemorate the full experience. 
   The arteries I want to highlight are the detachments led by John Benge that traveled 734 miles starting at Fort Payne, Alabama continuing through Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma. And the Treaty Party Group led by John Bell which traveled 765 miles starting at Charleston, Tennessee crossing west over Moccasin Bend and traveling through Arkansas. It was the only one of the 17 detachments that did not disband in Oklahoma. 
   Also included are 29 forts and the emigration depots concentrated around Fort Payne, Alabama; Ross's Landing--present day Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Fort Cass--present day Charleston, Tennessee where the Cherokee initially were taken after being rounded up from their homes for the long journey west. 
   The National Park Service has demonstrated strong partnerships geared toward respecting the private property of citizens in its administering of the current Trail of Tears National Historic Trail and will continue to do so upon the addition of the Benge, Bell Routes and associated components. In fact, as the NPS traveled throughout the U.S. conducting public hearings on the proposal in the designated areas, the support and belief in this initiative were overwhelming. 
   The designation and interpretation of the additional sites and trails associated with the Cherokee Removal will enhance public understanding of American history. Our greatness as a nation is our ability to look at our own history objectively and in proper perspective, being mindful of the errors of the past in order  not to repeat them. Through this legislation we will honor the historic footsteps taken by the Cherokee and celebrate our future as we remember the past. 
   Finally, because of historical significance, H.R. 5335 enjoys broad support not only within Congress, but also with the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee and associated trail organizations. The legislation is a good example of how Congress can better understand a national event through an accurate portrayal of the people, the places and the actions involved. We can learn a lot from history and in this case, ensure that it will never be repeated.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' CARE, KATRINA RECOVERY, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 110-31) -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I want to make five points. 
   First, we need to realize that this threat is real. And I say to the members of the Get Out of Iraq Caucus that if we were not in Iraq tomorrow, this threat is not going away. We don't spend enough time focusing on this fact that the jihadists within Islam are insulated within the Islamists and the moderates, and there is not enough confrontation from them to each other. This threat is mounting globally. It is spreading. Europe is basically lost. And I don't want America to end up alone, but this threat is not going away, and we need to know it. 
   Former Senator Fred Thompson said here 2 weeks ago, and he is right, that when we do leave Iraq, it is either going to be a dangerous world or a more dangerous world, and it depends on what we do in Iraq as to whether it is dangerous or more dangerous, and this legislation is at the heart of that challenge. 
   Number two, words matter. The majority leader of the United States Senate saying that the war is lost was on the front page of al-Jazeera in Arabic. That is not good for our country, not in this conflict or the future. Words matter. 
   Number three, this legislation was flawed. We said it early on. You shouldn't have this kind of micromanagement, tying the hands of the generals, telegraphing retreat, and then adding a bunch of extraneous matters to this legislation that should go through the regular order and the regular appropriations process. It was a bad bill. You porked it up and slowed it down. 
   Number four, the veto was the right thing to do. The President is not popular. We all know that. But isn't it refreshing that the President is doing the right thing even though it is unpopular because he is putting the interest of our country above that of his party or even this moment doing the right thing? That is leadership. 
   Our distinguished Speaker came and said a few minutes ago that she was substituting the President's judgment for her judgment. And I say respectfully to our Speaker, I have served under three Speakers. She has her constitutional role, and it is not the Commander in Chief. She is the Speaker, not the Commander in Chief. She is also not General Petraeus, and this is a wrong-headed approach. We can do better. 
   Lastly, the solution is for the leadership to go and sit down with the President of the United States and put our troops above our parties. Clearly ask: What do you require?     
   The President should clearly ask what can I do for the Congress, and let's not go through this again. 
   My nephew is on his way to Iraq, as many Members of this House know. Let's make sure they have what they need. Let's not give up here. We don't need another Somalia. We don't need another Beirut. We don't need to lose this war. We need to stay and improve and do better and come out with our head up.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, the first 100 hours is over. That was the easy part; softballs, for the most part, that you campaigned on and that many of us joined you on. But this is where the tough work of governing begins, really, and I don't want to join in the blame game because there is plenty to go around from last year and the Senate Republicans and this year in this bill. 
   But as a 10-year member of the Appropriations Committee, I would ask the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee to bring this legislation to the committee. Don't bring it straight to the floor. $463 billion worth of spending, and it is not a CR. It is not a clean CR. A lot of bells and whistles here. 
   As a matter of fact, the distinguished chairman is known for carrying pencils in his coat pocket, and I wonder how many of those pencils he burned up putting this together. It was a lot of work. I commend you for this work. But it is a huge shift in priorities and it didn't come to the committee. So that is what I would ask is you go through the regular order and let's not do this again. 
   And then let me ask you specifically about the legislative branch portion of this bill. Page 137, because our chief administrative officer, I understand, will have money in this CR to stand up a committee which is controversial, even on your own side, this proposed Select Committee for Climate Change. And I would yield the balance of my time to you, Mr. Chairman, to ask, is there money in the legislative branch portion of this bill to fund what is not an authorized committee yet, but the proposed committee, Select Committee for Climate Change? 
   I yield to the chairman.

   Mr. WAMP. And reclaiming my time, the Katrina Select Committee on our side was roughly a $400,000 committee. My understanding, the authority under this bill for the Select Committee on Climate Change would be about three times that amount, $1.2 million. I think we need to go through the regular order there as well.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I want to start by saying I have been here in the House for 14 years, and I do not believe that either party has an exclusive on integrity or ideas. I think that both parties have plenty to improve on, but I wanted to come tonight to say that not a single issue in many months, if not years, has so divided the two parties down the lines of what is best for America and what's best for the special interests in this issue of energy, because I really believe that extremism is what is causing the majority party to be in retreat from serving the needs and meeting the needs of the American people. 
   I'm talking about environmental extremists, and I say this with great respect because I think conservation and preservation and environmental responsibility are very important. And I have an excellent record of 
   supporting all of the alternatives on energy as the cochairman of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus here in the House for 8 years. I have helped lead the tax incentives for renewable and energy efficiency programs, helped put it in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, one of the most significant developments in the history of our country for these alternatives, and I believe in these programs. 
   But I have to tell you, when it comes time now at this critical moment in American history for new energy capacity and new production at a time where the prices for consumers are unsustainable, environmental extremism, which is a special interest--when you look at the Environmental Defense Fund and Sierra Club and all of these entities that are filing suit to keep our country from going after new supplies, which does directly bring prices down for regular people who are hurting badly, then extremism and special interests are trumping the will of the American people. 
   And that's where, frankly, a very liberal mindset from places like California should not dictate national policy that impacts consumers in Tennessee. And that is happening today. 
   Monday, the price of gasoline in Knoxville, Tennessee, was $4.99 a gallon. Let me tell you that is $2.50 above sustainability based on market conditions and our economy. And something has to give. And the American people are on our side. And what happened here last night was extremism and radicalism trumped mainstream values and positions for the American people. 
   Then I was asked today on National Public Radio why then would the majority party tomorrow bring up this issue of speculation in the marketplace again on energy when we've already voted on that earlier in the year. And the reason is they are reeling over what happened last night where, as Members are going to tell you and even call people by name, dozens of Democrats that cosponsored a reasonable compromise bill that we offered last night in the only option we had to offer an alternative, cosponsored this mainstream, compromise, middle-ground bill and then voted against it so that they could protect the liberal, California-driven, no-energy bill, which is the equivalent of drinking out of a straw when our country needs a fire hose right now. Right now. 
   And these hurricanes prove again any refinery capacity lost, any natural disaster, any disruption can cripple our country overnight. 
   We need to diversify our supply, increase our supply, have a robust, manufactured-driven economy where we are solving our own energy problems and providing these solutions to the world. We can do it. I have got to tell you we have candidates at the Presidential level, here in the Congress, that are willing to do this. But last night we were stymied by a majority that's in the back pocket of the extremists. And that's the truth. 
   Now I am about as nonpartisan as anybody can be in this body and be in one party or the other, but that is now happening, and it's very frustrating because people are calling me from all across my district saying, ``Why are you not doing something about it?'' And we are trying. 
   Last night was a closed rule. No options, no alternatives except the one alternative, which was a bill sponsored by Members of both parties, written by Members of both parties. And the very people that sponsored it in the majority party voted against it so that they could protect themselves. 
   And then tomorrow they're going to then change the subject to try to get the message back on Wall Street in a week where Wall Street, obviously, is suffering more and more losses, and I will guarantee you the conservatives in this body, people like me and the people on the floor tonight, are not supporting bailouts and not supporting propping up corporations that lent more credit than they should have. We're not for bailing out anybody, and they're going to try tomorrow to convince the American people that this is still all about Wall Street investors running up the price of oil instead of the radical groups keeping us from going after energy supplies in our country. 
   We need the alternatives, we need the investment; but what are we going to do in the meantime while we're bringing those to the marketplace? I'm not talking about months; I'm talking about years before we have those alternatives ready for the market. And what do we do as a transition, a bridge to get there? Increase capacity. Prices will come down as we increase the capacity. The energy that we have at our disposal--and we need all of it, all across the Outer Continental Shelf, not 50 miles offshore. It limits it to just a little bitty amount, and then the lawsuits just will be filed. Four hundred and eighty-seven Outer Continental Shelf permits are under litigation, immediately sued by these radical groups. 
   So to the average American, understand: extremism on policies like this, locking up our energy resources, have brought us to our knees and we actually have to have some kind of explosion here on the floor of the House for the majority to let us unleash this and send a bill to this President who will sign it. And they knew that last night if they would have allowed their own Members who cosponsored this bill to vote for it, we would have something working through the Senate, the President would sign it, and we would begin production. And as soon as we go after this new energy, the prices will come down.     
   Now, that's where we're at. 
   And I hate to just be that critical of the other side, and I rarely am, but tonight, this is the moment. And we've got to keep this issue out there because they're looking for ways to cover it up and go home. And tomorrow, it's change the subject. It's about speculation, or then it's going to be about price gouging, or all of these diversionary tactics to keep the American people thinking that it's something other than production. 
   And right now it is production. We need to go after it. The American people get it, but we need to let them know exactly what happened here this week in the House of Representatives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Again, I am not critical most of the time of either party here in the House, but this is an inconvenient truth that I need to share as well. Because it's easy to forget now in September, but I've been on the Appropriations Committee for 12 years. Every year, by June, the Appropriations bills are moving through the House. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. The end of the fiscal year is 13 days from now, and one bill has been off this House floor. 
   But here's what happened, beginning in June, is we started debating at the committee this issue of energy--because virtually every bill has a component of energy, whether it's the defense bill, where there is a huge energy consumption piece of all of our defense activities. And when we started debating energy at these bills, they stopped the process.     
   And we don't have the appropriations bills at all, and the fiscal year ends in 13 days. 
   Now, here is the problem with it because it gets really ugly. Even under a stopgap funding bill, like a continuing resolution which we're now expecting to carry us several months into the fiscal year, you won't believe the waste associated with the budgets of all of these agencies because they don't know what they're going to get. They may be laying people off now. We're already hearing about this because they don't have certainty in their budgets because the people running the House stopped the trains, stopped the process, stopped the bills over this issue of energy. They're in retreat on this issue of energy. 
   A lot of people criticize our party as the party of ``all about drilling.'' It's not just the drilling. What about nuclear energy? The very chairman of their new global warming committee, the gentleman from Massachusetts, is the most anti-nuclear activist who I know of in the country, let alone in the House. They're standing against nuclear and against a host of other alternatives, not just oil and gas. 
   It's the idea of, if you don't use coal and you don't use nuclear and you don't use oil, the alternatives will somehow surface, but I've got to tell you, when you limit your supplies, the lights go out, and the gas prices go up, and the availability of energy goes down. Consumers are hurting, and that's why we have got to get over this. 
   These, again, are special interests that have taken control through these people being elevated to power, and they just punt the process. We are not moving appropriations bills. The global warming committee now is kind of in the driver's seat. Let's just shut it all down, and we will reduce the carbon footprint, but at what cost--American competitiveness? American prices? Our ability to even survive? What about bankruptcies? What about the people? What about the common man who now doesn't even have a voice in this place because they're shutting down the process? 
   Now I've got to tell you that I haven't complained in 14 years, but it's time to complain. It's actually time to be righteously indignant about this and force them to stay here until we get something done, something real for the consumer. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. WAMP. Actually, our leadership raised that, and they just tabled it. They just quash it and go on. These are air-dropped. Again, this didn't go through the committee process. 
   Listen, if the Congress is going to exert its constitutional right to direct funding, there's a provision that you have to go through--the subcommittee, the full committee. It has to be vetted. It has to be filed. It has to be before the House, and people have to have the right to offer amendments to strike it. Did that happen yesterday? No, not at all. 
   Once again, these are the things that the American people are so angry about, and I've got to tell you that it's time for reform, but if anybody thinks reform is going to come from this new majority, they'd better think twice.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. One final point. I was here in the late nineties when we balanced the Federal budget, and about 5 years ago I gave a speech at the National Press Club talking about how the budget got balanced. Because while a lot of people would like to believe that we somehow cut spending to balance the budget, that didn't happen. We slowed the growth of spending below inflation for the first time in a generation. But why the budget got balanced was because revenues surpassed expenses with a robust U.S. economy, driven principally by the information sector, the likes of Bill Gates and Microsoft and us leading the world. So the speech I gave was we could do the same thing again with energy technology, with new energy solutions. 
   I have got to tell you now, before we leave there is going to be another push by the new majority for a second stimulus bill, and their idea of an economic stimulus is to extend unemployment benefits and to give some assistance for low income energy, which is going to be needed because this winter home heating fuel is going to be through the roof, even worse than it was last year. 
   But I will tell you, the most important thing we could do for the economy, again, is throw the ball deep, pass the American Energy Act, go after all the energy sources we can, create many manufacturing jobs, lead the world with our innovation with our manufacturing, with our technology deployment, throw it deep, and we could balance the budget again with a robust U.S. economy. 
   But as it sputters, the worst thing we can do is lock our energy resources and kind of cower down and say how can we borrow our way into prosperity? How can we bail out into prosperity? How can we just give people money? 
   No, we need to invest in these energy resources we have and the new technologies and all the new ideas. And nuclear, we ought to lead the world in nuclear production and not be caught in a Three Mile Island time warp of 30 years ago. Gracious, what do we have to be afraid of, our own energy and our own country? This is asinine. And we need to do that for the economy right now. 
   Governor Sarah Palin is saying it tonight. We ought to be saying it and doing it. We have got it in Alaska. We have it off the coast. We have got nuclear. We have the capability. 
   Energy, national security and the environment are together the most important challenges we face. So this is not process. This is not just a debate on the floor. This is our future, and this is whether or not our way of life is extended to the next generation. That is how important energy is tonight. We have got to stay and we have to fight for the American people here, because, frankly, they are being stymied on the floor of the House of Representatives.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I want to first say, since I am coming at this point in this time, that I am a Republican who opposes this resolution. Most importantly, because this resolution is nonbinding, I am one of the ranking members on the Appropriations Committee who will fight to make sure that, no matter what, funds are not restricted or reduced or cut from the men and women in harm's way on behalf of this country in the future days, regardless of what is said on this floor. 
   I want to make some general observations. First, the war on terror is the worst-named war in the history of our country. We are at war with Islamic jihadists, fundamentalists, radicals. We need to be more clear as to who we are fighting. Frankly, my view is that this is a religious conflict. People may ask in Tennessee or Texas, why are we involved? 
   Well, for the first 1,350 years of this religious conflict we were not involved. But history shows that a man named Qutb, the Wahhabi leader, a radical, over 40 years ago, came to this country, was educated, went back and indoctrinated a man named Azzam and taught a man named bin Laden that Western liberalism, freedom, self-government would actually bring about apostasy or ungodliness. 
   That is the truth. He indoctrinated the Sunni radicals that your way of life, self-determination, would create ungodliness, and that it must be stopped, and at that point we were brought into this religious conflict, the split there in the Arab and Persian world created by the 1970s, organizations in Iran that overthrew the Shah,  and it gave them the first Islamic state when Ayatollah Khomeini was brought back in 1978, and, unfortunately, our leaders in the country helped bring that about in the late 1970s. 
   Khomeini took over, and within a few months they took our hostages in Tehran. That was a low point in this country's history and my life, and from 1978 forward 30 times our interests have been attacked around the world, and twice they have been attacked domestically in the United States. 
   It is important to remember this. We are at war with Islamic jihadists. Al-Zarqawi and Zawahiri were talking while al-Zarqawi was still alive, and he said we need to expand the caliphate from Indonesia to Morocco. They believe they can go north to Europe and all the way to the former Soviet Union. This is where the Arabs have had influence, this is their agenda. 
   It is interesting to me that this only became very difficult in the last 12 months in Iraq. This week was the 1-year anniversary of the Samara mosque bombing. That is when the sectarian violence broke out. They are attacking each other. Moqtada al-Sadr's uncle is buried at that mosque. He was killed by Saddam Hussein. 
   One year ago, they blew up that mosque in sectarian violence. What is Moqtada al-Sadr doing today? He is fleeing. Why? Because he hears that we are going to increase security, put more boots on the ground in Baghdad. He is fleeing to Iran. 
   What does that say about all of this? Well, it says to me that we are beginning to do the right thing. The region's leaders told us this week partition of Iraq is not acceptable in the Arab world or the Persian world or the region. A partition will not work. It will make things worse. They also said ``a precipitous withdrawal will be catastrophic.'' 
   I remind my colleagues and the American people, we were not in Iraq before September 11. We were not in Afghanistan before September 11. This problem is not going to go away if we leave Iraq. This is a generational challenge. 
   As a matter of fact, I will say this, and this may be the most dramatic thing said on this floor, and I am briefed at a pretty high level. I believe we haven't been attacked domestically since September 11 for two reasons. One, we are better than we have ever been at intelligence again, and I am glad. 
   Two, they don't want to see us united like they saw us after September 11. Our enemies love the dissent and the division. They do not want to see us come together again, because when we do we are the best in the world. 
   Five points, Iraqi troops are showing up, progress is being made. This morning, a story out, several Iraqi battalions now exceed the 75 percent measurement on participation. For them that is very good. 
   Two, reinforcement is what this is. It is not a surge. The spread on how many troops we have had over the last several years is from 136,000 to 160,000. We are down to the lower level. This is going to bring us back to the upper level, about what we had when the elections were held. It is not a surge, it is reinforcement. 
   Three, the commanders tell us that reinforcement will, quote, will save lives and reduce violence. Reinforcements militarily, always there is a grid that shows that reinforcements save lives and reduce violence. 
   Four, there are two tracks here. One is troop strength and security. The other is diplomacy. You will see in the coming days diplomacy break out in the region. I say to all my colleagues who have great concern, that are afraid we are not talking to Iran and Syria, just stay with us. I believe you will see dialogues at every level take place in the region in the coming weeks, and I have been meeting with some of the administration officials. 
   Then let me say this, and I know what the distinguished majority leader said, and I respect him, and I believe many, many people, if not everyone in this House, have good intentions. If this resolution is followed by a funding cut, more Americans will die, and the sacrifices to date will be lost. We must do better, but we better not retreat in Iraq. 
   Too much is at stake. Our problems are not going away. Let's not be foolish. Let's not retreat from this challenge. Let's stand together and unite for the fight of our lives. It is a generational struggle, and we must pull together and meet in defense of liberty and our way of life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   All I want to do is rise to raise some concerns, because I think this is a case where clearly these motives of this legislation are meritorious, worthy. But at the Commerce Committee, when this bill was reported out, some concerns were raised, and I want to reraise those concerns on the floor of the House today because I think everything that has been said is accurate, but I think the likely place that this mercury is going to come is to my district, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Everybody within DOE and the NNSA, the National Nuclear Security Administration, expects this mercury to come to the Y-12 National Security Complex. 
   We are in the middle of modernization, sweeping modernization, new facilities, because we are the Fort Knox for highly enriched uranium for our country, and we basically received a mandate from the Congress to more properly secure this material. We've got a new design basis threat. We have new security challenges. This is about a $42 million price tag. I understand there are ways to pay for it, but it's going to go somewhere, and when you push on one side of the balloon, out pops the other. We just want to raise the concern because probably no place in America wants to be the place that this mercury comes to. 
   You've raised the concerns about mercury. We can safely store it and we do. We have got an excellent record and reputation. But we want to make sure that this is done properly. And I am not going to speak in opposition to the legislation because I think that the merits of the legislation are justified, but I am raising these concerns because we need to address this. 
   The administration has issued a SAP, Statement of Administration Policy, today against this bill. So we need to solve some of these problems as we go forward. 
   With that I applaud your efforts, the work that you've done, raise these concerns because we are probably going to end up with this stuff, and I thank you for your work. And with that, I am not going to object; I am just going to raise these concerns.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the distinguished ranking member and the chairwoman and Mr. Jackson. 
   I love this Capitol. I love every square inch of it. I have spent many, many hours walking people through this Capitol and talking about the extraordinary history of this place. About 1,700 times I have taken groups through the Capitol over the last 13 years. 
   Some of the stories that I have learned about as I share them just send chills up and down my spine. To think that there were 4,000 Union troops during the Civil War stationed on Capitol Hill, that 4,000 troops were here at the Capitol during the Civil War.  
   And when you go up inside of the Dome, the magnificent Dome, which around the world is the beacon of freedom, the symbol of hope, recognizable everywhere in this world, you go up inside of it, and you ask what the little hooks are hanging there, and they will tell you that is where they hung the lanterns when Union soldiers would work side by side with slaves to build that Rotunda in the depths of the Civil War. 
   That is a fact that few people know because, as Ms. Norton said, the story was never told. It was never archived, the incredible commitment and the irony of the people fighting for the slaves' freedom were working side by side during the Civil War to build this temple of freedom. All the history books point out that that is one great and grave omission in the Capitol history. 
   A guy named Oz Guiness once told me that the power to convene is greater than the power to legislate. And we convene here in the Capitol, people from all over the world, for good causes. The floor space of the Rotunda, which is the most prominent room in Capitol, is about 7,500 square feet. As Ms. Norton said, the floor space of this new hall, which has been called the great hall, is almost three times that size. It's a magnificent space designed to bring all of the visitors there to convene them before they enter this temple of freedom. 
   I want to answer the question why not the Great Hall, because it has been referred to as the great hall. But the Great Hall for over 100 years is the foyer, the Great Hall, at the Library of Congress in the Jefferson building. It is one of the most ornate spaces in the United States of America. I think it is the most beautiful room in Washington, D.C. And it is called the Great Hall. The Librarian of Congress told us, as soon a I became the ranking member of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee in January, that this was a conflict because the CVC construction adds a tunnel between the Great Hall and the great hall. On two sides of the tunnel is going to be two great halls. Are you kidding me? How did we do that? That's confusing. That's problematic. That diminishes the name and the history for over a century of the Great Hall of the Library of Congress, which everyone in this city, Presidents, Vice Presidents, Speakers of the House, know as the Great Hall. So you can't call this the great hall. So what shall it be called? 
   Emancipation brings us all together at a time in this country where we need things to bring us together. This is a way to honor this incredible process that led to an event that liberated all people in this country under our Constitution, not just some. And it was Abraham Lincoln who was the great emancipator. 
   So our parties come together today, and I ask the House to join us in this most important naming. It is important what you name things. It's important what we name each other. It's important what we call things. It's important what we call each other. Words matter. 
   Emancipation liberates us today, the thought of Emancipation Hall, the largest and most prominent room in this 580,000-square-foot addition to the Capitol. 
   Come together, House of Representatives. Come together, United States Senate. Let us send the message to all who come to this temple of freedom that emancipation lives on. And with such an important moment in the learning process of this experiment in freedom and democracy known as the American Republic, let's come together today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I just wanted to make our colleagues aware that besides the Smith bill, which I'm pleased to hear the Rules Committee will take time to hear, there is another bipartisan alternative that Mr. Hill of Indiana and myself have offered as well where there is substantial bipartisan support for a third alternative that's not a Democratic or Republican bill, but when we are considering matters of the House, it is truly a bipartisan compromise. And the gentleman is on his feet from Indiana as well, and I thank you for the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, oftentimes in life it's more important what you do with your second chances than what you do the first time around. Neither Chairman Edwards, who spoke so eloquently in a comprehensive way about this bill and his commitment to our veterans, our men and women in harm's way and their families--neither he nor I took advantage in our younger years of serving in the uniform of our Armed Forces. However, fate has it that we would have a second opportunity to serve by serving those who are serving us, past and present, through this bill; making sure that those great American patriots, past and present, have what they need--and are entitled to and deserve because of their commitment to this great Nation. 
   It is the highest compliment of my professional life to serve as the ranking member of this subcommittee. I want to thank Chairman Lewis--former Chairman Lewis, now Ranking Member Lewis--for this privilege because without him and his support I wouldn't be here. I want to thank Mr. Wicker, who was the ranking member of this subcommittee last year, and I want to thank whoever helped him become a Senator to open up this subcommittee opportunity for me, and for Chairman Edwards, who, as you just saw on the House floor, is a class act, with a true commitment to the men and women in uniform and a determination to do whatever is necessary to honor their commitment. 
   And I can report today, as I did at the full committee, that when I go home and people ask me in 2008, in my new position, are we honoring our Nation's veterans and the men and women in uniform serving in an asymmetrical war on two fronts in Iraq and Afghanistan, with head trauma and IED injuries and amputations--double, triple, extraordinary injuries--stress from unfair deployments, unsustainable deployments, stress on the family, are we honoring our commitment to them? And I don't think a few years ago, regardless of party, that the answer to that question was yes. We had problems at Walter Reed, we had problems at Fort Stewart, we had problems across the board. 
   We still have many challenges. The deployment ratios have got to continue to improve. But I can tell you in this bill there is a bipartisan commitment to honor their commitment. And I believe we are making great progress at ensuring our men and women in uniform and their families have what they need and deserve, and when they come home as veterans, that we take adequate care of them--not adequate, but responsible care of them. And I think we're making great progress. 
   I want to thank the majority for doing something that people in the hinterland wouldn't even understand, but they put the Military Construction bill back in with the Veterans bill where it belongs. When I served on the subcommittee 10 years ago, this was not the case. 
   But when the Military Construction bill funds quality of life needs and child care centers and polytrauma centers and housing needs, the veterans piece being in with it in the same bill allows the continuum of care to come together so that we can look at the whole picture from today's men and women in harm's way and what their quality of life needs are--which is number one for us--all the way through the end of their life as a veteran with our VA system. It needs to all be together. 
   That was an amazing success, bringing Military Construction and Veteran's Care back together--my hat's off to the Speaker for doing that, first and foremost, for Chairman Edwards for his leadership, and for Chairman Obey for his commitment. 
   I do agree that over the 100 hearing hours Chairman Edwards and I had a hands-on with these amazing Americans, we produced a work product, this bill--at roughly $48 billion for the VA and $25 billion for the military construction needs around the world--that is very strong, and an encouragement to all those in harm's way today and those that have been in harm's way in the past. 
   I will say that the President's budget request for veterans was a record level. Now, the chairman said that it wasn't enough, and I agree with that. And we did increase it by $3 billion, but it was at a record level. So today there is an encouraging bipartisan proliferation to see who can do more for our Nation's veterans. And that's a good thing for our Nation's veterans, that we're in competition to see who can do more for the men and women coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan and those that have served in the past. 
   But I was blown away over the last few months with the quality of the servicemembers and veterans. First, we hear from the chiefs of the respective services, the top enlisted personnel, the commanders from around the world, like the Commander of CENTCOM, who is now General Petraeus, with two wars under his command in Iraq and Afghanistan, we hear from all these leaders about the needs on the ground and what investments they need the Congress to make for them to do their job successfully. And then from the military families, that talk about the stress felt when we had a 15-month in, 1 year out deployment, now it's back to 1-1, it's going to 2-1. We need to get to 3-1 to make it sustainable, meaning 1 year in theater fighting, 3 years back in a noncombat station. This is so important that we work towards these objectives and that we honor this commitment. 
   Now, on the subcommittee, we've got extraordinary support. Former chairman of the full committee, who will speak in a minute, Bill Young from Florida, sits with us every hearing, hands on, fully engaged. Ander Crenshaw from Jacksonville, Florida, who will also speak, John Carter, from Texas, Kay Granger from Texas on the Republican side. I want to compliment not just Chairman Edwards, but Sam Farr, the vice chairman; who was really engaged, and a man who understands the world; he does an outstanding job. 
   You mentioned all the staff, I won't repeat their names, but both sides of  the aisle, just outstanding work. Members of the subcommittee--Mr. Mollohan, Mr. Boyd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bishop--everyone's engaged on your side; and contributed to great bipartisan cooperation. And the quality of these people that are serving in uniform and their families is just extraordinary. 
   What we heard this year is that the value of the dollar is really hurting us around the world. Our money that we're investing won't buy what it used to buy all over the world, and that's a big problem. And we've known that it was getting worse, but it's really causing a budget pinch for our military construction around the world. 
   We heard, as we've continued to hear--which has held up the appropriation process--that energy costs are unsustainable. That's a huge burden on this budget. We're trying to help with those needs. 
   Most importantly, though, we heard about the stress of the deployments from the families, that they're unsustainable, that they put a huge burden on the servicemembers and families. That's why these child care centers and these housing issues are so important and we have prioritized in this bill. 
   I want to say one word of caution, because whether it's a $3 billion increase in VA or $13 billion increase in VA, the Veterans Administration is a long-standing bureaucracy. It is very large. And I have traveled, I've been to the sites, I've worked with the VA for a number of years, and they're not as efficient as they can be or must be. Money is not the only issue. I'm grateful that we came together to give them more money, but I want to make sure, and so does Chairman Edwards, that each and every year we hold them more accountable, and the subcommittee takes a greater hands-on role at looking for efficiencies. We worked with Ranking Member Buyer this year on the Authorization Committee on ways for the VA to recapture more third-party payments that they're entitled to to help with their bottom line; things like that we must do because the VA has to be more efficient and more accountable because they are a government bureaucracy. So it's not just money, it's oversight. And I believe we share that commitment. 
   I think Secretary Peake is doing a very good job as the Secretary. Sometimes these positions are political; I don't think he is, I think he's hands on. He understands the VA system from a health care perspective, which is possibly the most important piece of it. I just want to thank everyone. Again, the staff has really produced a great bill. 
   Member projects in this bill mirror those included in the House Armed Services Committee's bill. The projects all are authorized. We married them up, so there's no Member-advanced initiatives here that don't meet all the tests of authorization. That's important. So that makes this bill special. 
   It is special, too; we're the only Appropriations bill that's going to move off the House floor before we go home. I wish they all would have. But we're closing on a positive note because this bill is positive for our men and women in uniform. And they're out there facing the threats that are out there. And it's like never before. It's asymmetrical. 
   I don't know what's next, but I hope and pray we can bring them all home very soon. But as long as they're in harm's way and as long as they're willing to volunteer to serve, Chairman Edwards, you and I are going to work together, in this second chance of ours, to serve those who serve us. And we're going to honor their commitment fully. That's what this bill is about. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purpose to close briefly by saying that Chairman Obey said something at the full committee that I want to paraphrase and restate in the context that we all know that those who do not learn from history, are destined to repeat it. 
   One of the lessons of Vietnam is that regardless of how you feel, especially as a policymaker, but even as a citizen, about the war in Iraq or the war in Afghanistan, or any war, it's so important to appreciate fully the men and women who are engaged in that war on our behalf. Regardless of how you feel about the mission, it is so important for our Nation to appreciate and support and fund and resource the needs of our men and women in uniform and our veterans. 
   I want to say tonight I grew up a Democrat. I am a Republican today. But we should, and are, meeting at the water's edge on this issue of resourcing the men and women in harm's way and supporting the veterans when they come home for the balance of their life. 
   This is a lesson of history, of modern history. We saw it and we are making that right. So even though many of them do not support what we are doing in Iraq, or maybe even Afghanistan, this bill supports those who are fighting, and their families. And that is important. 
   In closing, I do want to recognize by name again the extraordinary staff. They call these people the front office staff. Rob Nabors and Jeff Shockey at the highest level. This committee staff is bipartisan. There happens to be a majority staff, Carol Murphy, Donna Shahbaz, Walter Hearne; the minority staff, Martin Delgado, Liz Dawson, and Kelly Shea. Mr. Edwards has John Conger, I have Amanda Schoch. They have done a remarkable job day in day in day out to bring us to this today because this is a great work product. Not all bills that come to this floor are, but this is. And it's right. I urge its passage. 
   I thank you for the time on the general debate. We have got 37 amendments. The hour is getting late. Let's get on with it. 
   I yield back the balance of our time.

As the gentleman has seen firsthand, dealing with this multiyear, multibillion-dollar BRAC process, some of the business plans that were initially adopted have changed. He is doing everything he can to make sure that the Department of Defense sticks as close as possible to those plans. I join Chairman Edwards and commit to working to ensure that we conduct proper oversight of the BRAC process. 
   I want to thank the chairman for this commitment to fully fund the BRAC process, which was a major point of discussion throughout our 100 hours and 19 hearings this year, to make sure BRAC is fully funded on time.

   The reading was an accidental reading, not that someone wasn't here ready to offer the amendments. Mr. Burgess was sitting right here. And points of order are going to be raised against both. So, with all due respect, Mr. Chairman, if we can get on with it, we will dispose of it quickly.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding. I will be back later today to manage the time during general debate and consideration of amendments as the ranking member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. But I come today to speak briefly on the rule for my only negative comments today because it is ironic that on the same day, at the same time that the House joins in a bipartisan way with a record commitment to our veterans and our military construction and installation needs around the world, that we also are making history by the consideration of this rule, which is unfortunate. 
   I even know that there are members of the majority who think that it is unfortunate that we are here very late in July, basically clamping down on the process in order to achieve an objective. I understand why, but I regret it, and I know certain members of the majority regret it as well. 
   The main thing though is I come in opposition to the rule but in tremendous support of the bill. My hat is off to Chairman Edwards, my subcommittee chairman, who has been an excellent partner. I will come back to this later in the day. And Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis, who  have worked on this bill very, very well, because the House will sometime today or tomorrow make a historic commitment to every man and woman in uniform, those serving now and those that have served in the past. I think that is great for the United States of America at a time where we have a war on two fronts. 
   I just shook Holly Petraeus' hand here in the Capitol today, the spouse of General Petraeus, David Petraeus, perhaps the greatest military general in the modern era of the United States of America. 
   These threats are real, the enemy is vicious. Our challenges are many. And we do come together today on this bill. I am grateful for that. I wish it was being considered in another way because this rule is not in keeping with the traditions and the history of this committee and the House.

   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning as the co-chair of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus in the House of Representatives, representing well over half of the full House, to praise today's 11th annual Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Expo being held all day long in the Cannon Caucus Room. 
   Republicans and Democrats will join in support of these most important investments in renewable energy: wind, solar, biomass, geothermal. We have an abundance of these opportunities. We need to grow this from 6 percent of our electricity utilization to much, much higher. 
   We believe that Members should lead, encouraging weatherization of your homes, new appliances in your homes, ways to conserve. Conservation is not for wimps. It's for warriors. Not every American will wear the uniform of our Armed Forces, but every American can help our country reduce the demand and lower the cost for energy. 
   It's a critical issue. Our all-of-the-above strategy includes a tremendous focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy conservation. 
   We encourage all Members to come to Cannon Caucus at any time today and join us in this most important bipartisan effort.

   Mr. WAMP. I do want to point out, in follow-up support to the gentleman's amendment, about how important it is for us to advance alternative sources just across the board throughout the military. The Military Construction bill is kind of a small piece, frankly, of the energy utilization across the entire Department of Defense, but it is something that we clearly should come together on.  
   The military is a tremendous user of energy, we all know that. There is no question that we can do better there. And this was an excellent amendment offered by a gentleman who's got just tremendous history here with the Veterans Committee and a great patriot. So I think we want to encourage all of those type uses as we move forward. 
   We're coming together here on the bill tonight, I think we're making great progress. Over the next 2 to 3 hours I think we can get through the rest of the sections of this bill. Certain Members are working out agreements as I speak right now, and so we're trying to draft this language. And I'm kind of keeping the ball rolling now, as you can tell, so that we can get this language drafted. I think we're making the progress that we need tonight.

But I would point out that had we not had the preprinting requirement that was talked about earlier that we're living under, the fluidity of modifying amendments or amounts on the floor is part of the way that the appropriations process works. 
   We do have a great bill. But the neat thing about appropriations is when you bring a great bill to the floor, the Members of the House, all of them, do have the ability to make changes or make improvements or make suggestions, and, frankly, that is what the gentleman is trying to do. So I want to make that point, and to say that it's not late. We can start talking about how late it is, but this bill has been ready for the floor for 35 days. So as far as I'm concerned, we are not late tonight. We have got plenty of time to debate these things. So I don't want to--especially these gentlemen, the chairman and ranking member from the Veterans Affairs Committee who want to bring these ideas to the floor on an appropriation bill, that's kind of the nature of an appropriations process. It is an open process. We do have a great bill. I don't think it's a perfect bill not subject to amendment by the Members of the House.

   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief. 
   My amendment is very simple. It says that the VA can not modify current standards that are used to make special monthly benefit payments and therefore protects that benefit payment for U.S. veterans who are eligible for it. 
   Earlier tonight the chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee offered and withdrew two amendments that would have decimated the information technology budget at the VA to fund a new entitlement program for Filipino veterans. Had those amendments passed, it would have stopped key VA initiatives dead in their tracks. 
   We're trying to get the VA to streamline operations, reduce the time it takes to process claims, and increase interoperability between VA and DOD medical records, not to mention that the VA is going to need all of the $2.4 billion that the President requested to help it roll out or new GI Bill. 
   Earlier in the year the chairman of the authorizing committee tried to pay for this bill by proposing to cut special monthly pension benefits to U.S. veterans currently receiving these benefits. Now, let's be clear here. We support those Filipino veterans who fell alongside U.S. forces in World War II. But to provide them with a new benefit to be paid for out of an account that our veterans will immediately feel the impact of is wrong. 
   An ``aye'' vote on my amendment will tell our veterans that their benefits will not be cut and let them know we are trying to do everything we can to get their claims processed as quickly as possible. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. WAMP. I, too, rise in opposition to this amendment. And Mr. Chairman, now it is late. It's 12:30, we've got two more amendments. I will speak, and then I assume Mr. Hensarling will speak. 
   But let me say briefly why three senior members of the Appropriations Committee from our side--Mr. Wolf, Mr. Kingston and myself, people I believe have very high integrity--offered a proposal to have a 6-month moratorium, no earmarks from either side, while we establish a select committee to reform the way that earmarks are carried out because the earmark system is broken, and there have been abuses on both sides. And I do think that job one is to define what is an earmark. Because under article I, section 9 of the United States Constitution, the Congress does have the authority and the responsibility to direct the funding on behalf of the taxpayers, not the unelected bureaucrats in the executive branch. And this is now way out of kilter, but there have been abuses and it needs to be cleaned up. So we said we should have a time out, let's redo this. 
   I'm hopeful that this still happens because both major Presidential candidates have indicated they would like to see sweeping reforms in this process. But you've got to define what is it and then go from there, and then change the rules for everybody--authorization committee, tax, trade, earmarks from the executive branch, anywhere would all come under the same rules, both bodies, bicameral, sweeping reforms. Let's start over and define what is a congressional direction that's acceptable.     
   But I think these gentlemen tonight have picked the wrong bill to come and attack on earmarks. Let me tell you why. One of the problems with earmarks out there is there's a cottage industry of lobbyists bringing requests to the Congress on behalf of clients. Are there lobbyists on MilCon earmarks? There is no lobbyist for a National Guard or a Reserve or a military base asking for money from the Congress. Are there campaign contributions flowing based on earmark requests from the National Guard, the Reserve, or military bases? No. 
   Now, I don't know where you get your numbers, but let me tell you that there's not a request in this bill in my district, but there's one in my State, and it's in a Democratic Member's district, Mr. Davis. He may be on that vulnerable list, but he ain't vulnerable. I would say at 9 percent approval we are all vulnerable. What kind of a rating is that, vulnerable? 
   Now, my name was also on that request because it was my State and protocol is we put our names on it. But it's not in my district. So facts are whatever you present them to be, but the military construction bill is a perfect example of where the Congress has the right and the responsibility to say this needs to be done. 
   We are the ones who had the 19 hearings about quality of life in child care centers, not the executive branch. They don't have any hearings. Why do we even exist to have hearings if we're not going to say these need to be funded? 
   Let me tell you I was born at Fort Benning. My dad was on active duty. They needed a new hospital. Mr. Bishop is going to get nailed for getting an earmark because he represents Fort Benning, and he probably went to this subcommittee of Appropriations because he represented Fort Benning, Mr. Flake. Duh. That's how the numbers work that way. Good gracious. 
   Defeat this, but then reform the process. Clean up the mess. But coming through here with a chainsaw on everything, treating them all like they're the same thing is no way to run a train. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his continued leadership. 
   It is not just General Petraeus that moveon.org attacks. One of the distinguished, I think very reasonable members of the Democratic Caucus here in the house, Brian Baird of Washington State, also has been protested by moveon.org in his office since he returned from Iraq in August and basically told what he saw. He came back and just said, this is what I saw: There is progress, and we shouldn't leave precipitously because there will be major consequences. 
   He told the truth. He is an honorable guy. He serves here in the House. I respect him. He is a Democrat, and moveon sends hundreds of people to protest at his office. It is a political agenda, and it is unfortunate. 
   I grew up a Democrat. The first half of my life I was a Democrat; the second half I was a Republican. I don't think either party has an exclusive on integrity or ideas, but I think this is so far over the top. 
   There used to be things that we did in this country as Americans, not as Democrats and Republicans. This should not be about winning the next election or the last election. Wars should not divide us along Democrat and Republican lines, and everything should not be seen through that prism, and moveon.org is shameless to do this. It is shameless, this advertisement in The New York Times, and, as the gentleman from Georgia said, everyone in this body should condemn  what they are doing to try to win elections over our men and women in uniform in Iraq. 
   My nephew is serving there in Iraq right now. I hate it that he would turn around and see this in a full page ad in a major newspaper against the most equipped leader to lead our forces in Iraq that our country has to offer, period, is who this is. 
   For them to slander him in this way for political gain is un-American. What they have done is un-American. They have the right under the Constitution to say it, and we have the right as Americans to reject it, and everybody in this House should do that. 
   Three main things, while I have an opportunity to speak tonight. 
   The mission is just. We lose sight of that sometimes, that our men and women in uniform are doing and carrying out what is right for our country at this very volatile time in world history. 
   It is also easy to forget that over half the Democrats in the United States Senate and almost half the Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives voted to remove Saddam Hussein by force. And others will come and say, oh, George Bush sold us a bunch of bad information. 
   Listen, if there was any bad information, everyone had the same information, and many of us voted, from both sides of the aisle, to remove Saddam Hussein by force. It is just very convenient now to say, oh, that was them and not me. 
   It is hard to take responsibility for your actions. It is hard to stand before the American people and say we need to work through this together. We need to stand behind our troops until they prevail, until we have victory and not retreat in Iraq, instead of saying this is all about them. It used to be in this country about us. We did things like this together, and we didn't retreat so the world would see us walk away from our commitments. This mission is just, number one. 
   Number two, the military has been extraordinary. They have been great. You heard General Petraeus say that today. What the Marines have done in Anbar, the progress that has been made there, it wasn't even hardly covered by the GAO report. They didn't even talk about the extraordinary success, civilian casualties way down, 80 percent success in the Anbar Province. 
   The moderates are even siding up with us and saying ``We don't like al Qaeda. They are cutting off our people's fingers. They are killing our children. We want to fight with the Americans against these insurgents.'' 
   That is not the way it was before we strengthened our forces and had this success in Anbar. The military is performing in an extraordinary way and the tribal governments are now siding with us. That is progress by any definition. 
   The military is succeeding in Iraq. You may not want to hear it, because, as one of your distinguished leaders said, you are in trouble politically if we succeed as a Nation in Iraq. That is what he said. I hated that he said it. That is terrible. That is an indictment on politics in America. We all win if we beat these terrorists in Iraq. Everyone in this country wins. The military is succeeding. 
   Number three, the political progress in Iraq is not happening. That is true. We need to be honest about it. I wish personally we could get rid of the Maliki government because I think it is deplorable. But we promoted free elections and that is what we got, and we can't very well turn around now and say, oh, we didn't like who you elected. Get rid of him. They have got to do that. That is the tough work of freedom. They have got to do that. I hope they do. But that is up to them. Politically, we are not succeeding the way we need to succeed in Iraq, and all of us in this House have an obligation to come together and see that through to completion. 
   Let me just close with this: I have worked for 13 years in a bipartisan way. I have scars on my back to prove it. I have made people on my side of the aisle livid with some of the positions that I have taken working with the other side. But I will not----

   Mr. WAMP. You didn't have to say ``amen.'' 
   But I will not cooperate with anyone for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines to walk away in defeat or to leave prematurely before we can hold our head up and say ``America has succeeded with this just mission in Iraq.'' 
   I don't want to stay for 5 years or 10 years. I think it is a matter of months before we can see real, live redeployments. But the military leaders need to do that. It doesn't need to happen on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. We can't micromanage this war, and we sure as heck shouldn't be sending signals that we are going to pull them out, because that is the worst thing we can do for the long-term interests of our country. 
   The Middle East is in chaos. The Wall Street Journal said it well last week. The worst religious and political pathology in the history of the world is in the Middle East, and now you add to that nuclear weapons, terrorism, IEDs and control of the world's oil supplies, there is a lot at stake. 
   This is not Vietnam. Nothing like it. Nothing like it. It is a whole lot worse, the stakes of losing in Iraq. I believe that deep in my soul, and I am going to continue to say that on the floor of this House. We need to stand together as a Nation and stand together behind our men and women in uniform until we can leave in 
   victory and drive back this terrorist threat at this point we are fighting in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. It's a privilege and an honor to come back down to the floor tonight. I want to talk on two fronts, really. The one is about Iraq and the other is the threat of radical Islam, Islamofascism, as some people call it; but I think it's important here right on the cusp of the sixth anniversary, tomorrow of 9/11, to remind our colleagues and our fellow countrymen that we are not only not out of the woods, but that these threats are grave. They are grave this week. 
   It's easy for everyone in this country to get lulled back into complacency or look for the comforts of our living room and shopping malls, but we face a huge growing and imminent threat from the terror itself here on our homeland. 
   We come, as members of the Republican Policy Committee tonight, we just left a briefing downstairs from a Lebanese Christian named Brigette Gabriel, who wrote a book called ``Why They Hate Us.'' Some would ignore her, but, frankly, coming from that world and able to go on Internet chat rooms and read Arabic and know what's going on out there, we should listen. We should listen very carefully to what's happening in the world of radical Islam.     
   I think it is very ironic that some of the very people who may have said a few months ago, ooh, let's embrace the Iraq Study Group's recommendations today would say, no, too late. We even heard that today from distinguished Democrats, some of them, too late. Too late. Too late for what? 
   Let me tell you, this is not good news. We're at war. There is no good news. But this is positive news from the battlefield. And I think it's very ironic that in Anbar, and now spreading from Anbar originally out through the tribal groups and the provinces, where we're making real progress is among the moderates, which is kind of  the Iraq Study Group's recommendation, is convert the moderates to allies. Work to get them to stand against the radicals; work to get the tribal leaders to say, al Qaeda is the enemy and we're now with the Americans and our allied forces. That's happening. But I'll bet you some people don't want to hear that positive news. That's the reality on the ground. That's important. 
   I would also say, though, in a macroscale, where some of the Iraq Study Group's recommendations can be very instructive today for all of us is we need to engage moderate Islam, not just in country, in Iraq, but throughout the world, because just the sheer numbers of growth within Islam, if you read the demographics, for instance, in Mark Steyn's book, ``America Alone'' it's overwhelming; 5 years out, 10 years out, they swamp us in population. If you think Americans or Europeans are growing as a population, we're shrinking. We are shrinking. There's fewer and fewer of us every decade and millions and millions more Muslims. 
   And if the moderates within Islam won't stand against the radicals, that's why I reach out to the gentleman from Minnesota here in the House. Man, if there are freedom-loving people within Islam, where are they? They need to speak out. They need to be aggressive, and more and more of them in Iraq are because their relatives have been killed by al Qaeda. And once they kill your relative, maybe you're going to speak out. But they're intimidated; they're squashed. 
   Let me give you an example. Mark Steyn just tells us recently of a book that was published called ``Alms for Jihad; Charity and Terrorism in the Islamic World.'' A guy named Jay Millard Burr wrote it. Great research in Saudi Arabia where all this oil money, and we heard this downstairs from Brigette as well, using the Saudi Arabian oil money to promote terrorists around the world, period. It's happening. This documents, ``Alms for Jihad,'' how they're funneling through charities. A man named Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz heads it up. The charity is called the Khalid bin Mahfouz or Blessed Relief Foundation. Millions of Saudi oil dollars into this charity that funds al Qaeda directly. This book exposes the whole thing. So you need to go to Amazon.com or Barnes and Noble to get the book. But guess what? You can't get it. It vanished. It was bought up, taken out of circulation, financially, they took the book off the market. 
   Let me tell you, folks, in this country, from Dearborn, Michigan to right here in Virginia, Falls Church, Virginia, oil money from the wahabis in Saudi Arabia training up young people in this country, under a global Shari'ah, Islamic law, bringing them up against America in this country today. 
   Listen, this, to me, at the sixth anniversary of 9/11, is a call to action for Americans who've been lulled into complacency thinking that somehow this conflict is about Iraq. If we would just leave Iraq, all of our problems go away. 
   I'll say to you tonight, Mr. Speaker, this is not about Iraq. Iraq is the venue, it's the theater, it's where al Sadr is, it's where the Iranians and the Syrians have come, it's where they've recruited, it's where the fight is, but it's not about Iraq. It's about us and radical Islam at war. That's the theater. But let me tell you, it could just as easily be here tomorrow. God forbid it, but it could be just as easily here. 
   They have virtually taken some parts of Europe in terms of public opinion. They've challenged laws of countries and states in their courts, challenging Islamic law should take precedence, and that's what they would like to see here. 
   You may say, oh, he's wild; he's off the reservation. Not true. This is the way it is. They're using our very porous borders to come at us. And we're not secure. We're ignoring the threat. 
   Let me tell you what the Wall Street Journal editorial said last week. It said, the world's most political and religious pathologies, combine with oil and gas, terrorism and nuclear ambitions. In short, unlike yesterday's Vietnam, the greater Middle East, including Turkey, is the central strategic arena of the 21st century as Europe was in the 20th century. This is where three continents, Europe, Asia and Africa, are joined. 
   He goes on to say, so let's take a moment to think about what would happen if the last Black Hawk helicopter took off from Baghdad International. And he goes on to talk about Iran's influence in Iraq, emboldening Iran. 
   Clearly, Ahmadinejad said less than 2 weeks ago he can feel the United States in retreat in Iraq, and we've lost our will. And that when we leave because they force us out, Iran is prepared to fill the vacuum. That's what he said 2 weeks ago. We can ignore it if we want to. But let me tell you, a precipitous withdrawal that the left in this country is asking for, a forced withdrawal from Iraq today, will lead to the most destabilization in the world that we have seen. 
   And let me tell you, this threat we face, nobody wants to hear this, is greater than the threat of Nazi Germany. And if people say we had no business in Iraq, then we had no business storming the beaches of Normandy because the Germans didn't attack us. But we knew it was our obligation, as the leader of freedom in the world, to go and save Europe from Nazi Germany. We did that. We're doing it again, and it's uncomfortable. 
   As I said in the previous hour, my nephew's over there. Specialist Jeffrey Watts is fighting in Iraq for us tonight. I'd love for my nephew to come home, but not until we can leave in victory; not until we leave an Iraq and a Middle East that's more secure than they were yesterday; not until we can assure the American people that Iran is not going to rise up and seize control with nuclear weapons in the Middle East, unless you want to accept Armageddon. 
   I actually know how the story ends. I know the Bible from cover to cover, and I'm prepared to go on across that river at any time. But I've got to tell you, unless you're willing to just accept those ramifications, that's how high the stakes are in Iraq. 
   This is not George Bush's war. This is America's fight. We committed it together. Some people would like to blame it on others now and not accept the responsibility. But this is America's fight against radical Islam, and it will go on for years to come, even when Iraq is over. And there'll be a time where Iraq is not the central theater. I'm concerned we're going to be fighting radical Islam all the days of my life. 
   The question is, are we going to stand up, as generations before us have, and defend freedom. Are people like my nephew going to be willing to go and stand between a real threat in our civilian population, because that's what this is. And don't think for a second that it's all about Iraq. Some people dressed in pink would have you believe that. It's not true. And I'll tell you, what some of them are doing is downright un-American, and 50 years ago they'd have run them out of here on a rail. 
   I'd be happy to yield back to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for this moment for us to come and celebrate the Lady Vols' victory of the national championship. 
   Mr. Speaker, two of my favorite things in life, as people know who know me, are the game of basketball and the Tennessee Volunteers. In 3 months, I will have a son who is a junior at the University of Tennessee, and a daughter who is a freshman, as my son has been there for 2 years, and Kim and I are about to have both of our children as students at the University of Tennessee, and we very much love the school. 
   I want to speak a moment about the school, because with the HOPE scholarship and the tremendous influx in new students at the University of Tennessee, standards and scores continue to go up. With each and every freshman class, the University of Tennessee becomes a much better, even better institution of higher learning. The quality is very much on the rise, and we are very proud of our school. 
   But one of the aspects of the University of Tennessee that is so unique is the quality of student athletes that we see there at the University of Tennessee across the spectrum, and then the quality of the athletics that go with those student athletes, from sports like basketball and football, which are nationally well known, but across the spectrum to baseball and swimming and other athletic endeavors. And we are glad that Bruce Pearl is there now as well, and the men's team is sweet 16 and very, very strong. But we are known for ladies' basketball. 
   The Lady Vols are the best organization in the country for years and years. I won't go back through all the numbers. But, to me, the student athletes represent the very best of the University of Tennessee. We are very, very proud of them. As a Volunteer dad, I am especially proud and look forward to many successful years in the future and a great future for the University of Tennessee. 
   And I, too, want to pay tribute to Rutgers, a lot of attention, but incredible young women that I have seen on television articulating who they are and how proud they are of who they are, an outstanding coach. And so today we, frankly, come in joint recognition of two great teams, two great schools with great traditions. And you have got to feel good about the future of our country by looking at the Lady Vols and the Scarlet Knights. So congratulations to all.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the gentleman. 
   I just want to say as I begin that the gentlelady from Texas said that this money goes to the White House. Thankfully, this money goes to the men and women in the uniform of our Armed Forces who volunteered to stand between a threat and our civilian population. 
   And I want to commend everyone in the House for bringing us to this moment, because the traditions of this great country and this Congress are to meet at the water's edge at a time of war. And we have learned the lessons of history. And we know that it's important to fund the men and women who are in harm's way with the resources they need. 
   The particular piece that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards) and I have worked together on are the issues of quality of life. And let me tell you that this supplemental appropriations bill meets those quality of life needs on military housing, the child development centers for the families that are so critical, the medical treatment at places like Walter Reed that we have read and heard so much about and polytrauma rehabilitation centers. 
   We know that asymmetrical warfare has caused critical problems that must be addressed. People ask me and Mr. Edwards often, are we doing what's right for our men and women in uniform? This bill helps us to do that in a significant way and meet the needs of our veteran population. It meets the needs of barracks that we know and have heard about. And it fully funds what we need to on the Base Realignment and Closure Commission so they can meet their schedule which we were not meeting. This is so important. 
   And then this issue of GI benefits for education. Of course the men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve this benefit. For weeks we've all been writing about how this is so appropriate. And today we come together. So I applaud everyone, most of all those volunteers in our military, who have agreed to answer our country's call and stand in harm's way. My nephew, who just got back from Iraq, and my other nephew who is a marine on his way to Afghanistan, and all of the other brave Americans, we're answering their call today. They answered our call. 
   We meet together to do what is right for our country thanks to the leadership in the majority and the minority for finally coming together and doing what is right. This is a good bill. Let's move it forward. And let's honor our commitment to our men and women in uniform.

   Mr. WAMP. Madam Speaker, as I closed the rally today with 400 veterans in support of our troops and their mission in Iraq and Afghanistan, I quoted John Stuart Mill, who said, ``War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral unpatriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. A person who has nothing for which they are willing to fight, nothing they care more about than their own personal safety, is a miserable creature who has no chance of ever being free unless those very freedoms are made and kept by better persons than themselves.'' 
   Those better persons are our Nation's veterans, the men and women in uniform, and today may God almighty, Jehovah God, bless and keep those brave Americans in harm's way on our behalf.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (SALUTING JORDAN LEEN, NATIONAL CHAMPION -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight because every now and then a person's story will so inspire us that the example is set for all young people to look up to, to follow in their footsteps. And that happened 9 days ago to a young man from East Tennessee whom so many people are so very proud of today. 
   His name is Jordan Leen. And 9 days ago, in the 157 pound weight class at Cornell University, Jordan Leen achieved his life's ambition of becoming a national champion. Among all universities from sea to shining sea, against some very difficult odds, this young man became a national champion. 
   He has moved up weight classes in his last couple of years at Cornell until he got comfortable and didn't have to lose weight to wrestle. So this is probably about his natural weight. He's what my son would call a ``beast.'' I've seen him in all ways of his life. 
   He beat the number one seed, even though he was seeded eighth going into the tournament in the quarter finals, and he beat the number two seed in the finals just 3-2 in the most hard-fought match you've ever seen. And it was glorious. It was electric. He was distinguished through his high school career. And I want to focus on three things that made Jordan Leen a champion so others can look up to him and know that these are some of the ingredients for success. 
   One is family. His father, Mark; his mother, Tammy; his sisters, Andrea and Tara, they're a unit. The scriptural principle is that a cord of three strands is not easily broken; and with the Leens, a cord of five strands is not broken. They're a unit. They're a team. I know this because this young champion grew up across the street from me. He and my son, Weston, are best friends. This was a glorious moment not just in my family's life but in all of these Tennesseeans' because this family was represented on the mat in front of the national ESPN audience a week ago Saturday, and we all took joy in this accomplishment from this fighter. He had been sick the week of the national championship, but he battled through that to become a national champion. 
   Ingredient number two, a foundation. He got it at the Baylor School with an outstanding wrestling program, an incredible tradition, and the foundation was there for him to become a collegiate athlete and a scholar athlete. He was the greatest wrestler in the history of the State of Tennessee by anyone's standard: a 4-year State champion; 215 victories; 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th State champion all the way through high school at the Baylor School. He had the foundation from the program, and Baylor School is proud. 
   And, third, faithfulness. He was faithful through the years. He had a goal and he stuck with it. His work ethic was greater than anyone's. He worked out harder. He fought harder. He suffered more through injuries. He was faithful all the way through. His father in the account said that that whole week of the championship he knew something was different because Jordan had turned the week over to the Lord. He was faithful. He gave it to God and said, I'm here to do my best. I'm sick, but I am here to do my best. And he was honored. And he was faithful. 
   He's an incredible young man. He's an inspiration to all. He's an excellent student, making a 3.3 at Cornell in pre-med, and a national collegiate champion in the 157 pound weight class. 
   Jordan Leen, East Tennessee salutes you. You're one of the greatest athletes in the history of our region. You have reached the climax, but you're still the same guy. And we love you for the example you have set for young people. 
   Young people, if you want to be a student athlete, follow Jordan Leen. Follow Jordan Leen. 
   Thank you, Jordan. Your family loves you, and we salute you on the floor of the House tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (IMMIGRATION REFORM AND OTHER ISSUES OF THE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And I did not know he was coming to the floor tonight on this topic, but when I heard that he was here, I wanted to come and join him. I thank him very much once again for bringing this important issue to the American people. And I just want to touch on a couple of points tonight, as the gentleman from Iowa yields to me, about this bill. 
   Many people out there may say how is the Congress responding in this kind of a way to this problem? And I just want to say, having served over 12 years in this body, that I compare the U.S. House of Representatives especially to a very large church-building committee, well-intended people who have the ability to get together and make colossal mistakes, because everyone here wants to try to do a better job of fixing the problem than the person beside them. And it is almost a proliferation of do-gooders that get together and make colossal mistakes even though their intentions are good. And as physicians have to swear an oath that, above all else, do no harm, we need to remember that as lawmakers, when we look at the problems that our country faces, that we need to ensure that the solutions that we propose do not cause more problems than the current challenges that we face. And that is exactly the devil in the details of this so-called comprehensive immigration reform proposal that the Senate is moving this week. 
   The most problematic element of this whole bill to me is Title VI. It is the Z visa path to citizenship. It is amnesty. No matter how they package it, how they spin it, how they explain it, it is amnesty. It is something that, at 4 years at a time, can be extended all the way through that illegal alien's life. They can stay here. It's just that simple, and that is amnesty. 
   Z-1 is the illegal alien themselves. Z-2 is their spouse or their parents. Z-3 visa is their children, which basically means all of these people are given permanent residency, a path to citizenship in this country. And as the gentleman pointed out so well, it flies in the face of the rule of law. And how much can you water down the rule of law than not having the rule of law in this country? 
   And I want to point out two things that I see are very problematic in this kind of a solution where the Congress gets together trying to solve a problem, and the Senate product actually creates a whole lot more problems. 
   The provisions in this bill are not practical or workable, and you almost have to be, sometimes in our position, handling casework for people in your district that come to your office and say, we have someone working in our company that are trying to become United States citizens, or they have a family member that right now is going through the process of being cleared or checked through a background check or an FBI investigation. I have got one in my district. I can't disclose the names or the details, but it has been pending for over 2 years. Yet in this bill they somehow think that magically we are going to be able to, this government, approve these people quickly and do background checks. 
   That will not happen. The backlog will be enormous, given what we have seen with the rise of immigration into this country in recent years. And 20 years ago was Simpson-Mazzoli with 2 1/2 million illegals. They came up with a solution that was very similar at that time to what the Senate is proposing today, and it was a catastrophic failure in the sense that we did not enforce the provisions in that law, and 2 1/2 million illegals became 12 million illegals over 20 years. Why would we think that doing the same thing again will produce different results? 
   I will guarantee you this legislation will not be enforceable. It will be a colossal mess. If you thought at the Medicare prescription drug bill that this Congress passed without my voting for it, I voted against it, but if you thought it was problematic in its implementation, wait until this bill becomes law and they try to implement all of these details associated with this legislation. It will be ridiculous and absurd, their trying to actually bring this about. 
   And then I want to close with this: These individuals are not like traditional immigrants. My family has German roots. Those relatives on my father's side of the family, they wanted to come to this country and be American citizens. They came here throwing it all into this country. The people we are talking about here are here for one reason and one reason only, and that is money, so that they can make money. Because of cell phones and Western Union, this money and this support goes back to where they are from, and they are here simply to make money. They are not here to assimilate. As a matter of fact, a lot of them proudly carry the flag of their country of origin around with them, not wanting to be Americans and carry our flag, but actually carry the flag of the country they came from. They are even protesting in the streets that they should be able to stay here illegally and, frankly, defy the rule of law. So these people are not trying to assimilate to become citizens, or, as what former Senator Phil Gramm used to say, they don't want to pull the wagon; they want to ride in the wagon.     
   And we have all the documentation showing that they are a huge drain on the U.S. taxpayer. Respectfully, most of them do not have a high school equivalency, and therefore they will actually draw three times as much out of the Treasury as they will contribute to the Treasury. So just do the math, and we are talking a multi trillion dollar burden on the U.S. taxpayer over time by opening up the country to more and more immigration at this level. We are not talking about an H1B Visa increase for high-skilled technical workers who actually contribute more to the U.S. economy than they take from it. We're talking about the people that come in and take more from the government than they contribute. That's not the American way. They don't want to assimilate. They don't want to dedicate themselves to our country's principles. They're here for money. 
   So many people in the Immigration Reform Caucus might disagree with me, but a limited Guest Worker Program that says, on a temporary basis, you can work here is fine with me; we can do that. But let me tell you, this solution goes so far beyond trying to  regulate the workers that we need here that it should be rejected wholesale. They should go back and start over. 
   The border security is necessary. In the last 2 years, we have made great strides to secure the southern border. Actually, Secretary Chertoff hasn't received the credit that he is due, or this administration, on the steps that we have taken to secure the southern border. We no longer have Catch and Release, which was a policy that evolved, or devolved, from the 1986 legislation, where for years, if you were caught coming across our southern border, you were released into our country on your own recognizance pending your court date. And we all know they didn't show up for court, and 2.5 million illegals became 12 million illegals. We no longer do Catch and Release. It's Catch and Return; 99 percent of the people coming across the southern border that are apprehended today are returned to their country of origin, and we detain them. We consolidated the prison space. We have detained them; all of this has happened in the last 24 months. So great strides are being made. 
   But job one here is, secure the southern border. For national security reasons, to restrict this illegal immigration problem, the enforcement of our existing laws, the workplace enforcement, these things need to be done. But to go into this title 6Z Visa Path to Citizenship, my goodness, that's going to cause more problems than we have today. It's going to cause more immigration than we have today. It's going to cause more stress on the Federal budget than we have today. And the thought that these individuals would draw from our Social Security system and our Medicare system, or walk in our fee-for-service hospitals that guarantee emergency room care. And they're there; you go to any one of the 100 safety net hospitals in this country on a Friday and Saturday night and you will see these people getting health care at the most expensive point of service, which is the emergency room, because it is guaranteed to people in this country. 
   We can't afford this legislation. We can't afford this response to this problem. This is a large church building committee gone amuck; well-intended people who are getting together and making a bad situation even worse. So we need to reject it and start over. And if ever there was a time for restraint in the United States Congress, it is on this immigration bill. Because they call it ``comprehensive,'' and it goes so far beyond the cure that is necessary that it should be rejected. Go back, get to the bare bones minimum of enforce the law in the workplace, internally in this country, with law enforcement, secure the southern border, restrict illegal immigration, and then manage the people that are here. 
   You're right. You're right. It's possible to round up 12 million illegals and deport them, but it is not practical at all. Let's manage the ones we have, but let's stop 12 million illegals at 12 million illegals. And let's give them a way, with a counter-proof card, you can't counter-proof the card, for a Guest Worker Program. They've got to rotate in and out of this country. That is the only solution we need; not comprehensive, no Path to Citizenship, no amnesty. Reject it. 
   And as the Democratic leadership sent word to the President of the United States it was going to take 70 Republicans in the House of Representatives to send this legislation to the President so that he can sign it, I hope and pray that there is at least 70 of us that will stand against this legislation so that they will be forced to go back and just do what is necessary, not all of this extra stuff, like a Path to Citizenship, which is bad for the rule of law and bad for this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING A NATIONAL DYSPHAGIA AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Con. Res. 195, a resolution designating June 2008 as National Dysphagia Awareness Month. First, I would like to thank my colleague, Congressman GENE GREEN, for being the lead cosponsor of this resolution and for his efforts in helping move this resolution forward. Congressman GREEN is a strong advocate on healthcare issues in Congress and I am pleased to have the opportunity to work with him on the vital issue of raising awareness about dysphagia. In addition, I would like to thank the Dysphagia Awareness Society, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, and the American Occupational Therapy Association for their grassroots efforts in building support for the resolution. It truly has been a collaborative effort for an important cause. 
   Dysphagia is a medical condition incorporating any difficulty with swallowing and affects as many as 15 million Americans. Dysphagia can be caused by any condition weakening or damaging the muscles and nerves used for swallowing, including strokes, nervous system complications, and head injuries. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that 1 million people in the United States annually are diagnosed with dysphagia. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an estimated 60,000 Americans die annually from complications associated with dysphagia. 
   Dysphagia awareness is particularly important to my home state of Tennessee, where stroke incident rates are relatively high. Dysphagia affects a significant percentage of stroke survivors due to weakness in the muscles of the throat and mouth traditionally caused by strokes. Dysphagia can cause additional life-threatening complications for these stroke survivors, such as pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydration, and airway obstruction. 
   In addition, complications due to dysphagia increase health care costs by resultant hospital readmissions, emergency room visits, extended hospital stays, the necessity for long-term institutional care, and the need for expensive respiratory and nutritional support. Including money spent in hospitals, the total cost of dysphagia to the health care system is well over $1 billion annually. 
   Unfortunately, the condition of dysphagia is vastly underreported and not widely understood by the general public. Observing June 2008 as National Dysphagia Awareness Month would raise public awareness about dysphagia and the need for early detection and treatment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the passage of this important resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, if I may, let me tell the Members that for 37 years we've had this tradition in a bipartisan way of Members and former Members getting together, but this is the first year that we brought in this extraordinary charity, the Disabled Sports Foundation. And these wounded warriors, mostly amputees, that got joy out of playing golf with us on Monday, we raised a lot of money for them. This was so important. 
   We took the venue to Army-Navy Golf Club, where they are under construction with renovations. The PGA of America cosponsored it with us. The co-chairmen from the former Members were Ken Kramer and Dennis Hertel. We had 33 Republican Members and only eight Democratic Members--that's one reason the trophy is back over here this year--but y'all had a conflict, so you do have an excuse this year. But next year we should really bring people together to help these wounded warriors. 
   I want to say STEVE BUYER was the low gross on the Republican side for the whole House, and GENE GREEN from the Democratic side was the low net. Republicans reclaimed the trophy. 
   The big winners are these disabled athletes who are great American patriots. We honor them. We had fellowship. We came together. And the full House joins us in our salute to all these men and women in uniform that are disabled.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Colonel, it is an honor to join you tonight and my colleagues on the floor. Anytime I have the privilege to stand and honor our men and women in uniform, I try to begin with what John Stuart Mill said about war. He said, ``War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which they are willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and who has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.'' 
   Those better persons that Stuart Mill referred to are the people we rise tonight to honor, the men and women in uniform of our Armed Forces. 
   They understand from time to time it is necessary for people to put themselves between a threat and our civilian population, and they know that freedom, every time it has been extended from one generation to the next, it has been by those people who have been willing to put themselves and their lives, everything they have, their whole measure, between the threat and our civilian population. 
   Tonight, Colonel, I come to the floor to talk briefly about this threat because, unfortunately, the conversation revolves around one theater in this war and that is Iraq. We know mistakes have been made. We know it has not gone as well as we would have liked. Wars are that way. Stuart Mill said it is an ugly thing. 
   I don't know of a war that has been perfectly executed. I know that the march to Baghdad was perfectly executed, but I know that intentionally the insurgents have wreaked havoc wherever they could, from bombing the Samarra mosque which initiated the last 16 months of internal strife within Iraq, by design, knowing that that would test our will to see if we were a ``paper tiger'' or if we were the strong and determined United States of America. 
   I think a lot of people forget who it is that threatens freedom-loving people all around the world. They are called the jihadists, the Islamists, the radicals within Islam. The problem here is this is not just a religious issue, it is a political agenda. The call is for a Shariah, global Islamic rule. That's the truth. Read. I would encourage people to read ``Hatred's Kingdom.'' Read ``America Alone.'' Read ``Looming Towers.'' Read ``While Europe Slept.''  Read ``Londonistan.'' Read ``Epicenter.'' Read ``Knowing the Enemy.'' You will understand the history of how we got where we are. 
   One slice, the Wahhabi movement, the most radical out of the Saudi Arabia Sunni sect. A man named Sayyid Qutb came to the United States about the time I was born in the late 1950s, was educated at Northern Colorado State University, and went back and began to indoctrinate the Wahhabi sect that western liberalism, self-determination, freedom, would create apostasy and ungodliness and it must be stopped. 
   One of his lieutenants was Osama bin Laden. One of the people that he taught at university was Osama bin Laden. These things didn't happen by accident. For years this has been brewing. It is a real threat. 
   Unfortunately, the left has a propaganda campaign in this country to cause people to believe this is all just Iraq, if we would just leave Iraq, if we had never gone we wouldn't have a problem, or that life would just return to normal or that everything would just be okay. It is just simply not the case. We were not in Iraq before September 11. We weren't in Iraq before 1993. They hit us over 40 times since 1979. You have to study the history of it all. 
   When the Wahhabis took Mecca in the late seventies, the Saudi Arabia Kingdom made a deal with them that they would start spending money in this country.

   Mr. WAMP. The words we hear in Washington run almost in denial of the words of our enemy, of Zarqawi when he was still alive, of Zawahiri about expanding the caliphate, reestablishing the caliphate, from Morocco to Indonesia, this huge part of the world, to come back with Islamic rule. And this is dangerous because they don't believe in a theocracy as we do. They don't believe in pluralism. They don't believe in the freedom of religion. We believe everyone should have the right to worship as they please. This is a Shariah. This is Islamic law they are calling for. This is Islamic rule they are calling for, and this is where politics, the military and religion all come together. And we didn't do that, they are doing it. That's the truth. 
   Frankly, the left has misled and twisted and distorted and run a PR campaign that is driven by politics, denying even the weapons of mass destruction realities. Hans Blitz said, Where did the 8,500 liters of anthrax that we knew were in Iraq go? Two tractor-trailer loads. Probably Syria. 
   I have news for you, those are weapons of mass destruction. For people to say over and over again there weren't weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is one of the greatest lies ever told in this country. 
   He gassed his own people. They came running out with their eyes bleeding out of their face. Weapons of mass destruction were in Iraq. The threats were real. Over half the Democrats of the United States Senate voted to remove Saddam Hussein by force, almost half the Democrats in the House voted, and now it is convenient to say we should retreat, we never should have gone. This was a misguided war. 
   These men and women in uniform, they know that these threats are real and we have to stand up and face these threats. I pay tribute tonight to the Guard and Reserve from my State, the 181st where my nephew is at Fort Bliss training to go to Iraq right now. And the 278th that just came back, the might battery of the Marine Corps Reserve; Colonel Brett Hale who just commanded the Dragonslayers in Iraq for a year, my constituent, my patriot, my hero, who says in the public square in Chattanooga, Tennessee: I have been there and I have seen what we are doing. I know that it is important. 
   These are the people who have been. These are not the people at home saying things about the ones who have gone. 
   Eight brave men from my district have given their life in defense of our freedom; and when some people say they have died in vain, it makes me angry because they didn't die in vain, nor has any patriot who has ever given their life in defense of freedom for this country died in vain. Freedom comes with a huge price, and these men and women are willing to put their life on the line for us, and we come to the floor tonight to honor them so they know we stand behind them. 
   And there is widespread bipartisan support for our troops. But our troops are in harm's way on our behalf. You can't say they shouldn't be there, we are not for them; and then say, oh, we are for them. It is a paradox. It is just wrong-headed sometimes for the leader of the United States Senate to say the war is lost while they are in harm's way fighting for what they believe in. They know these threats are real. 
   We can leave Iraq tomorrow and this threat is not going away. This threat is a greater threat to freedom in the world than Nazi Germany ever was. It is growing all over the world. Read these books. If you haven't read to understand the threat, there is no way you could be there to know what is happening in Europe and all across the country. The radical elements of Islam have infiltrated through the mosque and trained people up all over the world. That is the truth. And they are in this country. Nobody wants to hear it because it is not politically correct, but that is the truth. I hope, I hope that God showers us with his grace so we don't get hit hard again like we did on September 11, but the threats are real. 
   I come to the floor tonight and say ``thank you'' to the men and women in uniform on our behalf. All of them. We came to honor General Pace tonight, but every one of those Guardsmen and Reservists whose families didn't know that they were going to have one or two or even three deployments, thank you families for allowing your son or daughter or husband to go, or wife to go, on our behalf.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (HONORING CORPORAL JASON DANE HOVATER -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Mr. Speaker, tonight I come to the floor to honor a great American hero, Corporal Jason Dane Hovater, who gave his life 10 days ago in defense of the United States of America in Afghanistan. Corporal Hovater was killed when 200 militants with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars attacked his outpost. Thankfully, they were beaten back after a fierce firefight that lasted hours. But nine American soldiers lost their lives. 
   Besides Corporal Hovater, First Lieutenant Jonathan Brostrom of Hawaii; Sergeant Israel Garcia of California; Corporal Jonathan Ayers of Snellville, Georgia; Corporal Jason Bogar of Seattle, Washington; Corporal Matthew Phillips of Jasper, Georgia; Corporal Pruitt Rainey of Haw River, North Carolina; Corporal Gunnar Zwilling of Florissant, Missouri; and Private Sergio Abad of Kentucky, with the C Company, 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, these nine patriots gave it all they had. And they laid down their life for our Nation. 
   Yesterday morning, I had the privilege of being with Corporal Hovater's family at the Holly Gamble funeral home in Lake City, Tennessee. 
   I was with Jeanna, his wife of only 19 months. They only had 6 weeks together before he went to train, before he spent 16 months on the ground in Afghanistan. He was set to come home 1 week after his death. 
   I met his mother, Kathy; his father, Gerald; his sister, Jessica; his brothers, Joe and Jesse Darrin; Sean and David. They're very active at the Lake City Christian Fellowship where the memorial service was held Monday night. It was a praise service. You see, he was a worship leader. His family is very involved in this ministry. When I met his family, it was like no other time that I have spent with a family of a wounded or slain soldier. Unfortunately, he was the ninth soldier from Tennessee's Third Congressional District, and every time we've lost one in the last 4 years, I have had the privilege of being with the family and presenting them a Bible engraved in their memory. But this was unusual. In this family's eyes, all of them, all of them, was the love of their Lord. 
   The humility, the genuine appreciation of our Nation, they honored their son. They believed deep in their soul that God was with him when he was conceived, throughout his life, God was with him when he died on this Earth, and he is with God today. They believe deeply that this is what God ordained for him, to lay his life down voluntarily for our country. I had the privilege to say to them, thank you from a grateful Nation, from every one in the Congress and the executive branch, to thank this family for this extraordinary sacrifice and to share with them that every time freedom has been handed from one generation to the next, it has been by the blood of these American patriots who are willing to stand between a threat and our civilian population and pay the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf. 
   Corporal Jason Dane Hovater is an American hero in every sense, and we thank him so much for his sacrifice. And we thank this extraordinary family for their witness and their testimony and their faith and their goodness and their trust in God Almighty that Jason is in his arms and they will see him again. I felt it. We love him, and we are so grateful in east Tennessee that they gave their husband, their son, their brother, for all of us. And with his eight comrades, we honor you on the floor of the House tonight and we thank you for standing up for us and giving us, as Abraham Lincoln once said, ``your last full measure.'' 
   We honor you, Corporal Hovater, as a great American patriot and hero. We will always remember, and we will never forget.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (AMERICAN ENERGY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. Well, I thank Dr. Gingrey, and I thank Mr. Hall for his unique insight. 
   It is a privilege to come tonight. I think Mr. Hall is right. There are a lot of people of good will in this body that really want to do something about this. As a matter of fact, the heat is on. 
   I had a Democratic colleague tell me recently that he was on an airplane and a guy came up to him and said bring down gas prices. And the guy was pretty upset, as we see often now at home. And the Democratic Member said, don't you think if we could do something quickly we would? And that really is the response that a lot of Members give. 
   And politics sometimes gets in the way of progress. But I have got to tell you that it is important the votes you cast, and it is important when you try to push a legislative initiative, and when things are vetoed and do not go forward, there are consequences. And we find ourselves in that mess today. 
   I don't come to the floor to blame anybody. Frankly, I come to the floor to offer solutions. And I think the blame game has got a lot of people really dissatisfied with the Congress to begin with. But these solutions really need to be debated and voted on. That is what we are really trying to press is for more legislative activity around new energy sources for Americans. 
   Now, for the last 8 years, I have had the privilege of co-chairing a large bipartisan group in the Congress called the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus. It is well over half the House. I know both these men, I think, are on the caucus. But it is about 60 percent Democratic Members, 40 percent Republican Members. 
   And I have to tell you, from our perspective, conservation is kind of job one. I say conservation is not for wimps; it is for warriors. Not everybody is going to put the uniform of our Armed Forces on, but everybody can help our country in a mighty way by increasing efficiency and conserving as they can. They can weatherize their home and save electricity. They can cut back, and they can go to a more efficient vehicle, and they can be smart about how they consume energy. And as we reduce demand prices will come down, and every American has a patriotic obligation to push for efficiencies and conservation, and that really ought to be job one. And we all need to say more about that because it is real. 
   The number one energy source over the last generation in this country, is conservation, if you just calculate all of the energy and how much we have saved since the 1970s when we conserve and create efficiencies. That is important. 
   Now, there is an irony here, and that is the Energy Policy Act that was signed into law almost 3 years ago this week, EPAct, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, was a Republican bill with a Republican Congress signed by a Republican president. 
   And everybody trashes the President and the Vice President for knowing a lot about the oil and gas industry. But the truth is, and I was there and wrote what was called the Energy Efficiency  Cornerstone Act with some industry groups for the renewable and energy efficiency organizations. That was rolled in. And if you were in the wind, solar, biomass, geothermal or renewable energy sector, you loved that bill, and you said, this is the best bill that has been signed into law for us in a long, long time. 
   But as Dr. Gingrey said, those tax credits to incentivize the investments in those new technologies have expired. Some of them may still be going on, but most of them have already expired. They were 2 years. 
   Now, if you are in the majority in the Congress today, you have a majority in the House and the Senate, and you believe in those things, why in the world have you not not only extended them for another 2 years, but extended them for 5 years or 10 years? 
   There is an article today that the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee is frustrated that he can't get the votes in the Senate to bring this up. 
   You talked about Congressman Bartlett from Maryland. I am the original cosponsor with him of the extenders for these tax incentives for renewables and efficiencies without any tax increases. Just extend them. If you believe in them, extend them. Don't worry about the budget consequences because it will stimulate. And right now the cost of energy is so heavy we can't afford not to. As a matter of fact, we can't afford to do a lot of things now because of the cost of energy. We really can't afford any more time delays, any more recesses, as Dr. Gingrey says. And these investment tax credits are important. 
   The industry groups will tell you give us a 5-year investment tax credit and you will see major investments. If you really believe in those things, to the new majority, and I am not blaming, I am just saying, let's get on with it. Bring it up now. Time is of the essence. 
   The gentleman talked about nuclear. And yes, Yucca Mountain is out there, and yes, you can take the spent fuel from nuclear and you can bury it, but that is a long now protracted process that is involved in a legal dispute. 
   What does France do? Because they get 81 percent of their electricity from nuclear they reprocess the spent fuel. They are not as afraid of it as we are. Now, listen, the French have not been accused of being overly courageous here of late. Yet, here, they have more courage than we do. Actually they are smarter than we are on energy utilization. They go 81 percent nuclear, and they reprocess the spent fuel and turn most of it back into energy. And they have half as many nuclear reactors as we do. We are at about 105 reactors. They are at about 53 reactors. They have one reprocessing facility, therefore, we would need two. We have the technology to do it. I represent the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We can demonstrate for the country right now, and TVA is prepared to show we can reprocess the spent fuel and stand up nuclear. 
   And the gentleman is right. It is 8-12 percent right now, reactors on-line of our total electricity capacity. It needs to be at least 1/4 nuclear.     
   Now they're going to come up, the Democrats, in a few minutes and talk about Boone Pickens. Okay. He's an oilman who now says 25 percent wind. Great. He shows us where they can be put. Great. What they're not going to tell you, as he also says, is go after all of the oil and gas capacity in this country that you can because we have to have new energy, okay? We can go in all of these renewable and efficiency areas, but it's still not enough given the demand. The demand is way up. 
   We've had a robust economy for 15 years in this country. I know it has sputtered of late, but because of that dynamic economy and because of the demand in India and in China and in other parts of the world, the demand exceeds the supply globally, and the price points are now unacceptable and unsustainable. We have got to have some new capacity as well. The Outer Continental Shelf, way out in the ocean where you cannot see it, should be a no-brainer for people if the State says ``okay.'' 
   So that's what Senator McCain has proposed is let the States decide. That's a good idea. If South Carolina wants to do it, let them do it. If Florida doesn't want to do it, don't let them do it, but get out of the way with the global moratorium. 
   The President released the executive moratorium on Outer Continental Shelf exploration. Now the Congress should do it. That's another thing that the Speaker ought to bring to the floor. Let's lift the moratorium. Things have changed. 
   When President Clinton vetoed ANWR in 1996, 70 percent of the American people thought that we should preserve all of that Alaska wilderness and not drill. Today, it's the other way around. Seventy percent of Americans say let's get on with it because we can't afford gas. We need help. 
   Senator Obama says it's going to be 7 years before you can pull any of it out. How much worse off are we going to be in 7 years if we don't get started now? We need all of the above. 
   Let me tell you that I know a lot of Democrats want to go ahead and start drilling. They want the votes, but they won't let us have the votes. Today, here at the Capitol, in Washington, there were dozens of protesters who were holding up signs, saying, ``Do not drill. Protect our coastlines. Protect our wildlife area regions.'' I've got to tell you that they are now in the minority in this country. The American people don't want them up here protesting our going after American energy for American citizens. We have to do all of the above. 
   I just want to close on a couple of new technologies that have great potential out of the Silicon Valley, which has, frankly, led the world now for a long time on things like information technology and which has really helped the U.S. economy and our exports. 
   There is a company called Bloom Energy, and they've developed a solid-oxide stationary fuel cell. It looks like the HVAC system in your home, and without a transmission system at all, it creates electricity. Now, it obviously has to have some feedstock going in, but it can run off a host of feedstocks. It can run off natural gas. It can run off of ethanol. It can run off of solar in some applications. This is a unique, new technology. 
   We're trying to demonstrate that solid-oxide stationary fuel cell here at the Capitol because all of these lights are on today as a result of a fossil-fired, dirty powerhouse here in Washington where we actually pollute in Washington about as bad as anywhere in the country. There's not much efficiency here. The lights stay on all the time. It's really ridiculous. The Democrats have a greening initiative for the Capitol, but it mostly involves light bulbs. We really need to get serious about it and take some of these buildings off that fossil powerhouse and move into solid-oxide stationary fuel cell-type technology. 
   Plug-in hybrids, we need them. Get them to the marketplace. Biodiesel, ethanol, new fuel mixes, get on with it. Wind technologies have tremendous potential in the Northern and Central United States. 
   As the gentleman from Georgia says, the right approach is everything. Don't pick winners and losers. Don't leave anything off the table. They did that in California with electricity, and the lights went out. You can't regulate yourself into a solution here. You can't tax your way into a solution here. We have to have a robust agenda, and it is time for Democrats and Republicans to come together and get this done. 
   I thank the gentleman for coming again tonight, for giving us the opportunity to talk about what the solutions are, and then let's get on with it. The American people are tired of waiting. 
   I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAMP. (CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAMP. I thank the distinguished ranking member for the time and for the courtesies and instruction and help along the way that he has given me. 
   It is an honor to follow the majority leader. I know that he and the Speaker of the House, having both served on the Appropriations Committee, are frustrated, as we are, that we're only this far along on the appropriations process, with three of the 12 bills here as the fiscal year ends next week. 
   Having said that, I want to say that it is really awesome to be on the floor today participating in the discussion around the three bills that are included in this package because of the quality of the people involved in these three bills. The new majority, obviously, is punting on nine bills, but they're rightly bringing the three security-related bills to the floor before the fiscal year starts next week. 
   And the people involved here on our committee, when I think of the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Obey, and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Lewis of California, and Chairman Murtha on the Defense Committee, and former Chairman Young, the ranking member of the Defense Committee, and I think of David Price and Hal Rogers on Homeland Security, Chet Edwards, the chairman of the committee that I'm the ranking member on, to be included with these people, from both parties, is a real awesome honor for me because this is my first time at this level of being involved in this process. 
   But I've got to tell you that a far greater honor than being associated with any of you is this greatest honor of my adult life, outside of my family, in my professional life for sure, is to be the ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee that serves the people who serve us in uniform, past and present. What an unbelievable honor. What an emotional year Chairman Edwards and I had, hearing from the commands around the world and their military construction needs and the quality of life issues for every single man and woman in uniform, hearing from the families, the enlisted personnel, the officers. 
   And former Chairman Young is on our subcommittee, giving us great senior counsel. And then for our veteran communities to come before us and see us come together at record levels of funding for our men and women in uniform, both past and present, this is important. This is incredibly important. It is the highest honor I've had in my professional life to be associated with this responsibility. 
   But I am frustrated, as I know many are from both sides of the aisle, that the other nine bills effectively are kicked over 5 months into the next fiscal year at flat funding, level funding. And I do know that a fair assessment as the issue of energy became involved in this process, mid summer, one party advancing on the issue of energy, frankly, the other party in retreat on the issue of energy, and it definitely compounded this process because every one of these bills involves energy because energy is everything right now in this country. It's critically tied to the economic condition that we are in. 
   All I would say, in closing, is I appreciate the work at bringing these important security-related bills to the floor. I'm frustrated that the others are not here and that the entire process broke down. I mean, I could almost say, tongue in cheek, I'm so glad to be here because I have been on the Appropriations Committee for 12 years and I was beginning to wonder if we had an Appropriations Committee anymore, because we haven't met a whole lot lately. We haven't met enough lately. 
   I hope that the 111th Congress next year brings the committee to the regular order all the way through the process, because I really like that. I like it when we have a conference and we go in with the Senate and we sit  across the table and we hammer out a compromise and we fight for the priorities that we believe in versus what they believe in. 
   Let me also say, once again, it doesn't matter who's in the majority; the folks on the other side of the dome in the United States Senate are always a problem. They didn't move any of the bills in a timely manner. At least we were trying. And that's a problem. But I don't want to let everybody off the hook. It's up to the majorities in both bodies to move this in regular order. I know Chairman Obey is an institutionalist and would like to do that. Next year we better do it. No matter who wins the election, we better do it for the good of the taxpayer and for the good of the committee, the tradition. It's important that we reshape the priorities. We're the ones that have the hearings. Mr. Edwards and I spent over 100 hours together this year. I enjoyed every minute. I'm grateful.
