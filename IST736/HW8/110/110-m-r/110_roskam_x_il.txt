<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (HONORING CHARLES HOOKER--WINNER OF CHARACTER COUNTS CONTEST IN ELMHURST, ILLINOIS -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, I don't know about you, but sitting here and listening to these speeches, I'm ready for some good news. And the good news is we are joined today by a constituent of mine named Charles Hooker, who is a young boy who wrote an essay. It's short, it's sweet, it's succinct, and I'm going to read it to you. It is a result of him winning the Character Counts Contest in Elmhurst, Illinois. This is what young Charles says to us. 
   ``If I were Mayor of Elmhurst, I would be fair to everyone by treating everyone the way I would like to be treated. I would listen to the requests of the young and old equally, because they both matter. I would be honest, be fair, and most importantly give credit to anyone who helped make things possible. I would also make sure I communicated well to show I'm trustful and responsible in all things. I am a Christian, and I would represent God in anything I do.'' 
   Madam Speaker, as we listen to these challenges that have been outlined today, I think that's a good word for us all, and I offer great congratulations to young Charles.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (REPUBLICAN FRESHMEN THIRD QUARTERLY REPORT TO THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate Congressman McCarthy's leadership this afternoon and this evening, this opportunity to have a conversation and really to reflect on what it is that we have been sent here to do. I know that I and my colleagues that join me here on the floor, Mr. Speaker, are people that came here as problem solvers. We didn't come here to fight partisan fights. We didn't come here to have sharp elbows. We didn't come here to call people names. But we came here to try to get something done. 
   We represent districts that are really commonsense districts, that have a high expectation of this process. I know that all of us who are on the floor today, we 
   don't celebrate in the very low view that the American public has  of the Congress under this current leadership. We don't celebrate in that at all. In fact, we mourn that in many ways, because there has been a real lack of leadership and a lack of an opportunity. 
   I think whenever you have conversations about how you are doing so far, and this is our third quarterly report that the Republican freshmen are participating in, it is always in the context of looking at what the expectations were as the 2006 elections came about. What was it that people said, that the American people trusted in, that the American people believed in, that the American people cast their votes for? What was it, that rhetoric that called people forth? 
   I think we don't have to go very far to really look at the rhetoric from the 2006 campaign and look at the comparison to the accomplishments in 2007, and you can see why 89 percent of the American public says, ``that's not what I voted for.'' So let's kind of refresh our memories. 
   First off was that we were going to be a very hard-working Congress. The 109th Congress, we were told, was essentially lazy and wasn't accomplishing anything. That was the characterization of the previous Congress under the previous leadership. In fact, we were told that during the next year, Members of the House will be expected in the Capitol for votes each week by 6:30 p.m., and will finish their business by about 2 p.m. on Fridays, we were told by then Minority Whip HOYER.  
   Well, as it has come into fruition, here we are, it is 5:40 p.m. in Washington, D.C. There is plenty of time for us to be doing substantive work, amending bills, debating bills, considering things. We could all be in committees. And yet the House is quiet today, and here we have this time to be reflecting on what the performance has been. 
   I regret that. My sense is that we are here to work, and we are willing to work, and we are anxious to work. Yet the way that the majority has structured the calendar, there is simply too much time. Of the 21 weeks in session, only six have included five full days of work. That is according to the official website of the Clerk of the House of Representatives. 
   Or, we were told that the Members of the House would have at least 24 hours to examine a bill and a conference report text prior to floor consideration. That is what the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Pelosi, said in her publication, ``A New Direction For America.'' She also said, and it was reported in the Washington Post, that she would insist that bills be made available to the public at least 24 hours before they would be voted on by the full House. Yet the reality, Mr. Speaker, is far different than that. 
   You know, it is one thing to not make a big deal about something in a campaign and then follow through and you keep things the way they are. But it is an entirely different situation to create this overarching sense of expectation, to create this sort of nirvana invitation, to come to this new 110th Congress where everything is fantastic, and you are just going to love serving here. 
   Yet the harsh reality is this: The following bills did not enjoy that generous 24 hours notice: The following bills are H.R. 1, the very first bill of this new Congress. H.R. 1 did not enjoy a 24 hour notice period. 
   Now, let's think about it. Is 24 hour notice the biggest deal in the world? No, frankly, it is not. It is not the biggest deal in the world. There is a little bit of process argument to it and there is a little bit of inside baseball feel to it.     
   But the point is the current majority leadership created the expectation that 24-hour notice was going to be the standard. So here are just a few things: H.R. 1, H.R. 2, H.R. 3, H.R. 4, all of the first bills, no 24-hour notice. H. Res. 35, the intelligence oversight authority, not the ability to have 24-hour notice. H. Res. 296, H. Con. Res. 63, and on and on and on, no 24-hour notice. 
   Or we were told by Mrs. PELOSI in the last election cycle, she is quoted as saying, ``Rules governing floor debate must be reported before 10 p.m. for a bill to be considered the following day.'' That sounds great. But the problem, you see, is that the Democrat majority leadership hasn't followed through on that. 
   According to this report which was put together fairly quickly, nine bills with the twinkling of an aye haven't enjoyed that notice. 
   As we are moving forward and considering this, my district is sort of interested in the process, Mr. Speaker, but they are really interested in the substance of this Congress. This is a group that is now in the leadership and now in the majority that made very clear promises about what, fiscal discipline and fiscal responsibility. And those are things that deeply resonate in the district I represent. 
   This is what Mrs. PELOSI said. She said, ``Democrats are committed to ending years of irresponsible budget policies that have produced historic benefits.'' 
   Additionally, she said, ``We will work to lead the House of Representatives with a commitment to integrity, to civility, and to fiscal responsibility.'' That sounds fantastic. 
   You go door to door in the Sixth Congressional District in Illinois, you go door to door in Mrs. Bachmann's district, you go door to door in Mr. McCarthy's district in California, and you say I am going to stand for fiscal responsibility, and they say, hip hip hurray, go to Congress. You go do the right thing. 
   But where the breakdown has happened or the disconnect has happened is when people say, hey, I voted for fiscal responsibility. I voted for fiscal discipline. That's how I cast my vote last November. And now they come into the third quarter of this year and all of a sudden they realize that is not happening. That is not even close to happening. Oh, they are spending money like there is no tomorrow. That is how this majority has approached the budget situation. 
   Do you remember the conversation we had on the earmark process on this House floor, Mr. Speaker? Earmarks are those abilities to sort of put a little Post-it note in an appropriations bill, and the note says this money is going to be spent on this particular program in this particular way. 
   There are some people who say all earmarks are bad. I don't necessarily think that is true, but I think all earmarks should be transparent. People should have the ability to look at the Federal budget, people should have the ability to look at the appropriations bills and look at the work of Congress and say, who is behind that spending item, what is motivating that person, and where is it going. 
   Well, what we were told is that these earmarks would be transparent. In fact, we were told throughout the course of the 2006 campaign what the Democratic leadership wanted to do was completely transcend the earmark process and open it up to sunshine and goodness and light. But the reality was much different than that. 
   The reality was it was the Republican minority in this Chamber that had to fight tooth and nail on this floor to drive the appropriations process open so that earmarks were transparent because the way it was originally set up was that we were told that all we could do was simply write a letter if we had an objection to an earmark to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. That is simply not good enough. 
   So as we are reflecting today and looking about at what is it, how is it that an institution that is to be celebrated, an institution that is to be admired, an institution that is to be respected, is now down at an approval rating at an all-time low? I regret that. I am sad about that. I don't celebrate in that. 
   I think what has happened is the American people have come to the conclusion that the rhetoric of the Democrat majority, the rhetoric of the leadership of the Democratic Party, the rhetoric of the last campaign simply doesn't match with the reality of what they are seeing in Congress. And so the promise to make this the most ethical group in history hasn't come to fruition. The promise to be fiscally disciplined has not come to fruition. The promise to make this process open and accessible to all hasn't come to fruition. 
   I think that, Mr. Speaker, in large part is why we are now at this historic low of 11 percent. I think we can do better. I think there are some of us  who are on the floor this afternoon and evening who want to be problem solvers. There are some of us who want to get things done. There are some of us who understand that living within our means means making fundamental choices and decisions. 
   We were elected as leaders, and yet sometimes there is a temptation, which I sense on the majority side that they simply want to kick the can down the lane and have another Congress make the tough decisions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was sent here to make tough choices and I stand ready with these good colleagues. We are here calling balls and strikes. We don't come in as harsh critics of everything. We are not simply here about donkeys and elephants necessarily, but we are here talking about those things that ought to bring us together as Americans, and that is the ability to work together towards solutions, to make the tough choices now and not defer them to future generations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I think one of the things that is upon us is this time, Mr. Speaker, that we are in as a country right now and we are really in, essentially, a time of choosing. And there are great weighty issues that are before us as a Nation. There are great challenges that we face today, and yet this Congress is not taking up those challenges. Let me give you an example. 
   Today, we have the free market. That is something to be celebrated and something to be heralded and something to be defended, because the free market has brought about more prosperity for this country, for more people than the world has ever known. Yet, in many ways, the free market is under attack. And so this Congress, if it chose to, could stand up and defend the free market and celebrate the free market and say we are going to stand by the free market. But, no, actually there has been an attitude that has crept into this Congress that says, no, no, no, the free market is something that brings people down. The free market is something that is to bring suspicion on people and ought not to be celebrated. 
   Or, that other thing that we are dealing with, and that is that notion of energy independence. This Congress, if it chose to, could come together in a bipartisan way and create the environment where we strive towards energy independence, where we are not dependent on a complicated and difficult part of the world, Mr. Speaker, and that is the Middle East; where we are not dependent on them for our economic vitality and, ironically, for our national security; where we are not funding in many ways indirectly the very people that do us harm. This is the time of choosing. 
   I think that the reason that we are seeing that this leadership is at an 11 percent figure, and that is almost hard to do if you think about it, to have almost 9 out of 10 people disapproving of you, is because they have squandered this opportunity to deal seriously with these issues.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentlelady for yielding and for the time. 
   One of the underlying issues as it relates to this bill is I think the way in which it was contemplated. I'm not making a process argument, but what I am making is an argument that suggests there's a very serious oversight. 
   And the oversight was the committee's rejection of the McHenry amendment. The McHenry amendment basically said, look, if you're going to have these grants and loans and there's going to be properties that are going to be purchased, there should be an open process, there should be a bidding process, and it should be something that everybody has access to. And I think the failure of the majority in this case was to dismiss that and put it aside. 
   I've heard cities tonight described as victims. The chairman a minute ago said he has great confidence, and I'm paraphrasing, but great confidence that cities are going to use the money judiciously and wisely. Well, my congressional district falls in the shadow of a city with a different reputation that doesn't have a judicious and wise reputation always. Let me read you just a couple of headlines within the past couple of weeks about some of the schemes that have happened from a corruption point of view about the very people that you're contemplating entrusting $15 billion to. 
   Here's one this month: ``Witness Details Pay-To-Play Schemes'' or ``Ex-Illinois Official Pleads Guilty to Lying'' or ``Corruption Firmly Entrenched in State'' or ``Illinois: Corruption on Parade'' or ``Top Aide to Illinois Governor Is Indicted in Kickback Inquiry.'' 
   We have got deep troubles in northern Illinois, and what is conspicuously absent in this bill, and I've read it, I've looked at it all, within this bill there is no requirement of any kind of disclosure, no requirement of any kind of notice, no requirement of anything whatsoever. So, in other words, if you're a corrupt official working for an agency that has been entrusted with this $15 billion, there's absolutely nothing, nothing that prohibits you from selling this to a friend for whatever you want to sell it for. The bill is absolutely silent. 
   Now, is the majority trying to be complicit in a nefarious scheme? Of course not. But was it a gross oversight on the part of the majority in the committee to reject the McHenry amendment? I think so, and I think for that fundamental flaw alone, notwithstanding all the underlying policy questions, that fundamental flaw alone brings a great deal of skepticism to voters in my congressional district. And for that reason, I urge a ``no'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   And in response to the chairman's question, yeah, no question about it. There's a plan requirement on page 3, section 4 of the bill, but the plan requirement doesn't prohibit the type of conduct that I just described, a plan as it relates to goals for the sale to different groups, accessibility to different groups, but the plan is silent as it relates to this potentially corrupt practice. 
   I think it's a flaw and I don't think it's a flaw that can't be redeemed. It can be very easily corrected. It doesn't help the underlying policy objections to the bill. 
   But $15 billion put out there without any requirement whatsoever as it relates to a prohibition against self-dealing, a member of the housing development authority of a particular municipality calling up a cousin and saying, hey, come on by here, we just purchased this foreclosed property for $100,000, I'll sell it to you for $75,000, there's nothing in here. Notwithstanding the plan language, notwithstanding any other declaration of the majority, it is silent, and we can do much, much better.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON S. 2062, NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, in the interest of full disclosure, my side of the aisle is looking at every conceivable opportunity under the House rules and in any reasonable parlance of conversation to talk about energy. 
   So when we're beginning this conversation today, follow me along, because we're going to start about Native American housing, but eventually, the conversation is going to turn to energy. And why is that? 
   It's true, Mr. Speaker, because that's what the entire country is talking about, and that's what the entire country, I would submit, wants the House to focus its, no pun intended, energy on. So follow me, if you will. 
   When the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 was passed, it reorganized housing assistance for Native Americans by eliminating several disparate Federal assistance programs and replacing them with the Indian Housing Block Grant program. 
   In the underlying statute, section 202 specifies eligible affordable housing activities for the block grant program, with the goal of developing, operating, maintaining, or supporting affordable housing or homeownership. 
   Further, section 202(2)(A) of S. 2062 amends current law and expands the eligible affordable housing activities under the statute. The language of the aforementioned bill would give tribes more flexibility under the Act by allowing a recipient to utilize funds not only for the acquisition and new construction of affordable housing, but it would also allow tribes to utilize block grant funds for the development and rehabilitation of utilities and necessary infrastructure to achieve greater energy efficiency. 
   Native Americans in this country are facing serious housing problems. Last Congress, the Financial Services Committee held several hearings to investigate the housing situation in Indian lands, which are the result of widespread poverty, high unemployment, homelessness, and a lack of affordable housing on Native American lands. In addition to reorganizing the program, the statute sought to provide Native Americans the right to self-determination and self-governance by allowing tribes to have greater freedom over their tribal housing. Reauthorization is an important step in addressing many of these issues. 
   Like every American today, Mr. Speaker, Native Americans are struggling with the high cost of energy. Whether on tribal lands or in suburban America, families are grappling with the escalating cost of energy in today's economy and the effect it has on maintaining housing affordability. Rising energy costs associated with renting or owning a home and the transportation cost of traveling back and forth from home to work are having a devastating impact on everyone's budget, including families in Indian country. 
   So the conversation then surrounds itself around greater flexibility and enhancing, literally, the opportunity for Native Americans to pursue energy solutions, particularly as it relates to utilities. And why is this important? 
   This is important, Mr. Speaker, because we need to take a holistic approach. We need to pursue every conceivable, reasonable energy alternative, Mr. Speaker. We've got to make sure that we don't leave any solutions on the table and we pursue everything. 
   So, for example, yesterday we had a hearing in the Financial Services Committee where the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Bernanke, came in and commented on a wide range of elements of the economy. But what was particularly interesting, I found, among other things, was the assertion that he made when he said this: that if we increase production of oil by 1 percent, he anticipates a 10 percent drop in price. Let me say that again. I'm going to say that two more times, it's so unbelievable. A 1 percent increase in production, according to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who we defer on many things in our economy, he said would create a 10 percent decrease in price. A 1 percent increase in production would create a 10 percent decrease in price. 
   That is a staggering assertion from the person that both sides of the aisle give a great deal of deference to, both sides of the aisle listen to and consult with and are very interested in his comments. And he says, again, a 1 percent increase in production creates a 10 percent decrease in price. 
   So how does the motion to instruct weave into this? The motion to instruct is part of a broader conversation on energy, and I think what my side of the aisle is trying to assert in this and in other bills obviously that have come before the floor in the past several days, Mr. Speaker, is that when it comes to energy and when it comes to solutions, we need a holistic approach, and not to allow ourselves to be hidebound by an orthodoxy that has developed among some elements that are driving the other side of the aisle, to say, well, we're not going to pursue those things, those are not on the table, we're not going to pursue enhanced production, we're not going to pursue clean coal technologies, we're not going to pursue some of these other technologies that are so dynamic and are so vibrant. 
   So I have done my best, Mr. Speaker, to weave the energy debate into this motion to instruct. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the chairman's encouragement on this motion and the clarity with which he spoke and articulated the need for it, and I think I want to follow up on a couple of the things that he highlighted, and I think they're important, and I think they're a first step. 
   But I would encourage all Members to take that first step and not stop walking, and I think the first step that the chairman talked about--and he mentioned the gentleman from Colorado and his efforts as it relates to energy efficiency and creating incentives, Mr. Speaker, in the Federal housing market, a tremendous goal, no question about it, pursuing efficiency, pursuing conservation efforts. 
   This whole energy debate that we're having, it seems to me, is a time at which there should be a sense of unanimity within our country about moving forward. We should be now a Congress that is listening to the overwhelming majority of Americans that are just hamstrung by the high price of energy. It's having a disproportionate impact on the poor, who are very concerned about it. It's having a disproportionate impact, creating a disadvantage for American businesses as they're struggling to compete overseas. 
   This should be the one issue that is able to transcend sort of regionalism. It should transcend other past alliances, frankly, because the crisis is so great. 
   In past national crises, what happens is that legislative bodies tend to get over themselves, and rather than looking inwardly, they look outside of the walls of the legislative body and say we've got a responsibility here; 435 people, we can do this, we can move forward. 
   Part of what the gentleman from Massachusetts talked about is part of that equation, that is, conservation, that is, energy efficiencies. But that's not enough. 
   Part of what the gentleman from Colorado mentioned a couple of minutes ago in renewables in his 1-minute speech is part of the equation, too, but you know what, that's not enough.     
   If we choose to go to the Financial Services Committee hearing and we choose selectively to listen to what the Chairman of the Fed says, then I think we're deluding ourselves and we're not serving the public well. What we've got to do is listen to when the Chairman of the Federal Reserve comments about energy production and the de minimis amount of production that has to be created and its impact on price. It was a staggering, staggering figure; 1 percent in increased production yields a 10 percent decrease in price. That is a bargain any day of the week. And the idea that this Congress, that somehow 435 people can't come together and come up with a plan to increase oil production by 1 percent, that's just ridiculous that we can't meet that challenge. One percent increase in production, a 10 percent decrease in price. 
   And so what you're seeing manifested here today, I think, is part of the conversation that this side of the aisle wants to have--wants to have on almost every conceivable bill--because what we're hearing back in our districts is I think what everybody's hearing back in their districts, and that is, the crushing weight of energy. 
   When there is that much pressure, we've got to make sure that we are not the generation of a Congress that simply chooses to kick the can down the lane. As Americans, we have a history of doing this, don't we, Mr. Speaker? We have a history. When we got the wake-up call in the mid-1970s that our energy policy at that point was dysfunctional and we had a real vulnerability as it relates to manipulations by actors overseas who have a low view of us and want to put foreign policy pressure on us--that is, the OPEC oil embargo--rather than dealing with that, what did we do as a country in the mid-seventies? We kicked the can down the lane. Prices sort of receded a little bit, the lines for gasoline went away and shortened, and rather than dealing with it, we kicked the can down the lane. So here we are, decades later, not only in the same place, but, in fact, at a more vulnerable place. 
   And so I sense that the country is hungry, Mr. Speaker, for this Congress to act, for this Congress to come together and say, you know what? There is not one side of the aisle that's got all the answers on this. You've got to completely move the ball. And I know it was sort of a foolish throw-away line that was quoted in the press by a Democrat staffer a couple weeks ago, but when he said the strategy is drive small cars and wait for the wind, I hope that that is not speaking for the majority. 
   And I hope that the majority is willing to say, you know what? When the Chairman of the Federal Reserve comes in and makes an assertion of the relationship between production and price, we need to listen to that. We need to pivot off of the past orthodoxy that has said we're not going to allow new production, we're simply going to close our ears and not allow the conversation to shift to new production. 
   There are some that say we're not going to drill our way out of this. Well, that's a thought. But certainly, responsible exploration has to be a part of this equation, Mr. Speaker, it has to be a part of this equation. 
   Some of our colleagues, as the gentleman from Colorado mentioned a couple minutes ago, they're going to go to Colorado and look at essentially the next generation of technology that is  clearly part of this. But they're also going to go up to ANWR and begin to really see what that's all about. Had we not been in the situation where the ANWR bill was vetoed in the mid-nineties, it would be, by conservative estimates, now pumping and producing at least a million barrels a day. Can you imagine what that does to the price equation? 
   Ultimately, what our job is, as Members of Congress, if we are united in our desire to get off of foreign oil, then what we've got to do is come up with 9 million barrels a day, or the equivalent, in terms of energy, or savings and conservation, efficiency and so forth. Nine million barrels a day. We can do this. We can absolutely do this. Far greater challenges have been laid out that our country has looked in the eye and has risen to, as the United States of America, and taken on that challenge. 
   I think that we cannot let this Congress adjourn, we can't go home for the August recess until we wholeheartedly take this challenge on. And if it means discharge petitions, if it means all kinds of procedural things to continue to drive the debate, I think we really have no other choice. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   In response to the gentleman from Colorado, a slight word of caution. I think it was maybe an overstatement to say that the National Renewable Energy Lab didn't enjoy any support from this side of the aisle until now. I find that difficult to believe. I don't have any roll calls in my presence, but  my hunch is that a program that big and that expansive didn't just get that way because of support from one side of the aisle. 
   But be that as it may, I think there is an opportunity here, because the opportunity is a recognition of all Members of Congress that we are at a pivotal point as it relates to energy policy. And the pivotal point is one that should bring us together. 
   Regardless of what one's motivation is, there is a desire to have a long-term energy solution. And part of that has to be an increase in our supply, Mr. Speaker; part of it has to be an increase in renewables. It has to be pushing new technologies, as the gentleman from Colorado talked about, conservation and efficiency measures. 
   There is a whole host of bills that, unfortunately, the Speaker is not allowing to come to the floor. For the life of me I don't understand it when, at the beginning of her assuming the office of Speaker, she talked about really having a desire for a bipartisan solution to most problems. She was going to change the tone. Unfortunately, we just haven't seen that. 
   Let me go through a couple of these bills that are literally pending that are bottled up in committee that the majority party, and its leadership, I sense--and I don't want to speak for the rank-and-file, but I do know several rank-and-file members of the majority that are terribly frustrated right now and have a desire to have some bills voted on that are sensible and that the overwhelming majority of the American public says would be a good idea.     
   For example, H.R. 3089, the No More Excuses Energy Act of 2007. Here is what it does. It reduces the price of gasoline by opening new oil refineries. That's something we haven't talked about this afternoon or this morning. We've not had a new oil refinery put in place in the United States in 30 years. Investing in clean energy sources such as wind, nuclear and captured carbon dioxide and making available more homegrown energy through environmentally sensitive exploration of the Arctic Energy Slope and America's deep-sea energy reserves, that's one bill. 
   Why isn't that bill on the floor in an open rule with amendments and with the ability to have a conversation about it? Well, unfortunately, the New York Times today gives us part of the answer, and the answer is not really a pretty one. 
   According to today's New York Times, in a report, it says: ``Ms. Pelosi, who is now House Speaker, can prevent a vote on expanded drilling from reaching the floor.'' Further quoting: ``She and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, appear intent on holding the line against calls to approve drilling in areas now off limits.'' Then further--and this is actually, I think, the darkest part of this report--``In a private meeting last week, according to some in attendance, Ms. Pelosi told members of her leadership team that a decision to relent on the drilling ban would amount to capitulation to Republicans in the White House and that she was having none of it.'' 
   Is that what this has come down to? Is that what this has come down to? Depending on how you're calculating, 70-plus percent of the American public says, ``Give us more energy. Please, put these tools on the table.'' Then we have a meeting that this is about ``capitulation'' and not wanting to give someone a political advantage. Is that what this has come down to? 
   I can't even tell you, Mr. Speaker, how incredibly disappointing that is to me that someone would say that it is a matter of political pride that's going to keep an idea off the table. Why can't we have the bill on the floor that I just mentioned? 
   How about this, H.R. 2279, to Expand American Refining Capacity on Closed Military Installations. That is nothing but a good idea. We've got distressed military installations. They're not well utilized. Let's use them. It reduces the price of gasoline by streamlining the refinery application process and by requiring the President to open at least three closed military installations for the purpose of siting new and reliable American refineries. We have not had a new refinery for 30 years in this country, and this is our opportunity to change that dynamic. 
   There is H.R. 5656, to Repeal the Ban on Acquiring Alternative Fuels. It reduces the price of gasoline by allowing the Federal Government to procure advanced alternative fuels derived from diverse sources such as oil shale, tar sands and coal-to-liquid technology. 
   In my State and in your State, Mr. Speaker, in southern Illinois, there are more British Thermal Units of energy in the coalfields of southern Illinois, in those gigantic fields, than in the entire Saudi oil fields. Imagine that. There are more BTUs of energy, more energy in southern Illinois, than in all of the oil fields of Saudi Arabia. Yet it is largely untapped. 
   Why is it untapped? Well, it's untapped, in part, because it's high sulfur coal, and it's pretty nasty stuff to burn and to have emitted. 
   I have referred to this word ``orthodoxy.'' There has developed this thinking that has become so hidebound that, regardless of the facts that are around, it eventually says we don't even want to have a conversation about coal. We don't even want to contemplate coal because certain interest groups have told us that all coal is always bad all the time. Well, maybe not so. 
   Maybe this Congress should be part of the solution. This Congress could be part of the conversation that says no, no, no, that we're not going to listen to the bumper stickers. We're going to be policymakers, and we're going to unleash the potential to begin to transform a region. 
   Mr. Speaker, you and I represent Illinois. You know southern Illinois, and you know how challenged that area is. Can you imagine if in this country we began to unleash resources and, with that, the type of dynamic social and economic change that could come about in an incredibly challenged rural area? It begins to transform everything. As a State legislature, we struggled constantly with diverting State money to those areas, to diverting Medicaid money to those areas. Why? Because they were devastated from an economic point of view. 
   What do we have here? What is the opportunity here? The opportunity here is not only to create more energy but ultimately to transform regions to make them prosperous and to make them environmentally sensitive. Absolutely. It is to get them to the point where they're producing and where they're on their own two feet. We ought not to squander that opportunity. 
   There is H.R. 2208, the Coal Liquid Fuel Act, which reduces the price of gasoline by encouraging the use of clean coal-to-liquid technology, authorizing the Secretary of Energy to enter into loan agreements with coal-to-liquid projects that produce innovative transportation fuels. 
   These are all bills where there are discharged motions either pending or coming. A ``discharge motion'' is where 218 of us come together, where 218 of us come together and say: You know what? We're not going to be limited. We're not going to be limited to secret meetings where this is about capitulation and political agendas. We're not going to be limited to that. We're going to break free of that. Two hundred eighteen of us are all it takes for us to sign those discharge petitions. Whether one is a Republican or a Democrat, it doesn't matter. All that has to happen is that 218 Members go down to the well and sign their names. Then you know what? The bills are on the floor. Then we can talk about them, and we don't have to whisper about them in the corridors. We don't have to be held hostage to secret meetings where agendas are about--and this is the characterization--capitulation. I mean I can't even begin to tell you how disappointing that is. 
   There is H.R. 2493, the Fuel Mandate Reduction Act of 2007. It reduces the price of gasoline by removing fuel blend requirements and onerous government mandates if they contribute to unaffordable gas prices. 
   Mr. Speaker, our constituents are in crisis. They are crying out to us. They want us to lead. They want us to get over past grievances. They are tired of this place. Haven't we all seen the polls? Haven't we all seen the low view that they have of the United States Congress? Why? Because of meetings like this that characterize solutions as capitulations. We can do much better than that.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I want to join everybody that has joined in this debate today. It has been robust and transparent. But I think there have been some false choices placed out here, and I want to clear that up. 
   I think I am speaking for a majority on this side of the aisle that says, Let's do it all. Let's have an all-of-the-above approach. 
   Our side has not come to the conclusion that simply enhanced production is going to get out us of this because it is not going to. But enhanced production has got to be part of the solution. So you would find a great deal of support, Mr. Speaker, for conservation efforts on this side of the aisle, at least from this Member, for increased efficiency efforts, and for renewable efforts. But all of those things by themselves don't do American consumers any good really in the short run. 
   Even the call by the Speaker of the House to release part of the strategic oil reserves, that only amounts to, one suggestion is selling 75 million barrels out of the strategic oil reserve, about 10 percent of the reserve, so about a 3-day supply of oil. That doesn't do much for anybody. So let's not fall into that trap; although it is an admonition on the Speaker's part, ironically, that supply does affect price. 
   But here is the real point. The other side of the aisle has controlled 30 minutes this morning, and did you notice something? Did you notice that there was no answer to what the Chairman of the Federal Reserve said yesterday? The Chairman of the Federal Reserve--and this is now the fourth or fifth time that I have put this out on the House  floor today--said simply by increasing production by 1 percent, Mr. Speaker, that has an impact of dropping the price by 10 percent. 
   We have heard some of the best and the brightest, absolutely the A team, some of the folks who came through in the 2006 election, we have heard from the best and the brightest, and yet no answer. They didn't even pick it up. This is not some fact that I trotted out 2 minutes ago, this is a fact that I put out two or three or four times, and yet the silence on the other side of the aisle has been absolutely deafening. Why, because it doesn't fit into the orthodoxy that has absolutely bound this leadership and has taken this debate from what should be a national security debate, what should be a transition time in our public life, what should bring us all together, Mr. Speaker, and has devolved into simple pettiness and capitulation. We can do better. We know what we need to do. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut. I, like many of us, come to the floor and want to congratulate Mr. Klein for his leadership on this issue and bringing us together actually in an area that I think most folks, if you reflect back, you can think of a favorite teacher. Let me tell you a little bit about one of my favorite teachers. 
   My fourth grade teacher was Lillian Anderson. Lillian Anderson was 65 years old and I was in the last class. Maybe I caused her to retire, but I was the last class that Ms. Anderson had. Ms. Anderson was one of those people at Ben Franklin School in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, that began to open up our eyes, myself and my classmates, to the State of Illinois, and that's a tradition that we have in Illinois. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a fine product of the public schools in Illinois, you know that fourth graders in Illinois begin to learn about the State. We learn the State flower, the violet. We learn the State song, which I will not sing for you. We learn the State bird, the cardinal, and all of these things. 
   And what happened to me was in Ms. Anderson's class, beginning to learn about the three branches of government, in all of those things, suddenly this was a whole new area that was revealed to me. 
   I grew up in a family that wasn't active when it came to politics. My mom and dad would vote, but that was pretty much it. So here I was a young student, a young boy in Ms. Anderson's class, and a seed was planted by that dear woman. The seed was later watered for me when I was in eighth grade and took the Constitution test, and I was one of those kids in eighth grade that couldn't get enough of it, absolutely loved it. 
   My point is that there were teachers along the way that encouraged and nurtured me, and I have a strong suspicion that, as we reflect, every one of us can point to somebody along the way, in addition to those people in our immediate families, but somebody along the way that encouraged us, that saw a little something in us, moved us along, took the time to pull us aside and give us an important word. I think that that legacy is the great benefit of the teaching profession today because they don't know all of the ways in which they've influenced people. 
   So I want to thank Mr. Klein. I want to thank him for bringing this resolution to the floor, for having the Congress today pause and to reflect on those people who were influential in bringing us here today, and I know he's worked very hard to reach out to folks on both sides of the aisle. 
   I want to thank my friend from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I came down a couple of minutes ago and listened to the opening comments of the distinguished gentleman from Florida as he went through the litany of successes of the space program in the past, and it was a good recitation and a good reflection  on those things that we can really be proud of as Americans that the space program has accomplished. I jotted down a couple of notes, the pacemaker, solar energy, environmental control systems, MRIs, microwaves, wireless technology and so forth and so on. 
   I am here as a supporter of the space program and as someone who wants to see that innovation and that creativity deployed in a way that not only has an impact on these types of things, but also has an impact on the great struggle that we are facing as a country and that my district and many, many other districts around the country are facing, and that is the cost of aviation fuel. I had an amendment that I offered to the Rules Committee that unfortunately was just swatted away in a partisan fashion, and I was very disappointed in that. Not a single Democrat was willing to vote for it, and I was just disappointed. 
   My sense is let's take the NASA program and develop that talent and tilt that talent that the gentleman from Florida cited so eloquently a few minutes ago, and let's get it working on alternative fuels as it relates to aviation. Because, you see, I represent O'Hare Airport in the Chicago metropolitan area. I represent thousands and thousands of passengers, thousands of airline employees. 
   The airline industry is now under the crushing weight of excessive costs of aviation fuel. Fuel is up 40 percent to the point of a ticket price, 40 percent now is that of the ticket price, of the ticket on an airplane, up from only 15 percent back in the year 2000. American Airlines spent $61 billion this year in fuel, whereas last year they spent only $41 billion. 
   My amendment simply said this, to direct NASA, to say, look, don't allocate resources at this time when we can't afford it, to the Deep Space Climate Observatory. Instead, direct those resources to alternative fuels for commercial aviation with a three-prong test, the need to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy, the need to develop a fuel that will provide greater stability for the airline industry and also that will reduce the emissions. 
   I think that's an area where the entire Congress can come together. For the life of me, I don't understand why it was swatted away in such a partisan fashion, and I hope that on future evaluations by the Rules Committee that they will have a little bit of an open mind.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HOMEOWNERSHIP MONTH -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 477 and am pleased to join with my friend from Indiana and am delighted that we are taking time on the floor today to commemorate homeownership in America. 
   Recognizing the many benefits of owning a home, the President designated June as National Homeownership Month as he has done for the past 6 years. To complement this designation, H. Res. 477 was introduced by the gentleman from California (Gary G. Miller) to recognize that designation and the importance of homeownership in the United States. 
   Owning a home is a fundamental part of the American Dream, with economic security and hard work being rewarded. Homeownership is much more than knowing that one has a roof and four walls to shelter one's family. It is the symbol of the American Dream, and it forms the bedrock of our communities. 
   Many of my colleagues celebrate the designation of this month as National Homeownership Month because in America every citizen, regardless of race, creed, color, or place of birth has the opportunity to own a home of their own. 
   Today, the national homeownership rate in the United States has reached a record high, about 70 percent; and more than half of all minority families are homeowners. While many gains have been made, minority homeownership rates still lag. With minority households expected to account for two-thirds of household growth over the coming decade, improving the ability of such households to make a transition to homeownership will be an important test of our Nation's capacity to create economic opportunities for minorities and immigrants and to build strong, stable communities. 
   Buying a home is the largest personal investment most families will ever make. For the vast majority of families, the purchase of a home represents the path to prosperity. A home is a tangible asset that builds equity, good credit, borrowing power, and overall wealth. Not only does homeownership provide economic security for building wealth over time; it also strengthens and builds communities. Homeownership creates community stakeholders and inspires civic responsibility. People who own a home tend to be more active in charities, churches, neighborhood activities and more likely to vote and get involved with their community's growth, safety and development. 
   Further, families owning a home offer children a stable living environment, influencing their personal development in many positive, measurable ways both at home and in school. 
   Without homeowners, neighborhoods, schools and local businesses suffer. Homeownership helps fuel the economy. This happens mostly through people who spend money for home improvements. 
   I hope Congress will continue to explore new ways to put people on the path to homeownership so more Americans can realize its benefits. 
   In closing, it is apparent that the Federal Government, consumers and the housing industry are linked by our mutual goal of creating housing opportunities for more Americans. And although significant strides have been made, we still have much more work to do to achieve together for the American people, and our best hope of being successful is to work in close concert with each other. 
   As Congress considers future action to make homeownership more secure and available, we need to take care not to hamper the market's ability to provide opportunities for homeownership, and that way we can continue to open our communities and neighborhoods to new opportunities for growth and prosperity. 
   The resolution before us, H. Res. 477, recognizes the importance of homeownership in America and dedicates the House of Representatives to fostering an atmosphere conducive to community development and increased homeownership opportunities. Congress has a real opportunity here to forge a better America, an America where homeownership and security abounds. I know we all look forward to continue to work to further the American Dream, and I hope my colleagues will join with me and my colleague, Mr. Donnelly, and join in supporting this important resolution that does just that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (HIRE A VETERAN WEEK -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 5, which we have heard spoken about frequently in the past few minutes; but it is deeply personal to me. 
   My life was influenced greatly, Madam Speaker, in 1944, and it was actually 17 years before I was born. A fellow named George Jenkins took the beach at Normandy and was killed there. He was an Iowan. And his mother and dad, Roy and Ella Jenkins, decided to do something with his life insurance money. They took it and they chose a young man, who happened to be my father, V.R. Roskam from Iowa, and they plucked him out of adversity and plucked him out of a bad situation. And they paid his tuition, room, board, books, fees, spending money; and they even bought him this class ring that I have on my hand today.     
   Madam Speaker, it was the generosity of the Jenkins family in honoring a veteran that literally changed my life and the trajectory of our family, even before I was born, even before I was thought of. And so I rise in proud support today of this notion of singling out veterans. 
   It is an area where so many times in our public life today there is a great deal of strife, it seems, among us. But it is this group of people that we can universally come together and honor and celebrate and hold up high. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, when you come here and represent the Great Lakes and you meet Representatives from all across the country, you meet folks from the east coast and the west coast, you begin having conversations about the water that surrounds their districts. I talk to Californians and people from Oregon and South Carolina, and they are very proud of their coastlines, as they should be. And as a Member who represents a Western district, you try and describe the Great Lakes to them, and it is really difficult to describe. And then you have someone come and visit and they look at Lake Michigan and they look at Lake Superior and Huron and Ontario and Lake Erie, and it takes their breath away because these are beautiful bodies of water. 
   Lake Michigan is so big and so significant that my almost entire congressional district gets its drinking water from Lake Michigan. So you can imagine the sense of pause and outrage and deep concern that many of us felt when we heard of this plan that BP had that was approved by the State of Indiana to move forward and dump these pollutants into Lake Michigan. 
   Madam Speaker, my district counts on the fact that drinking water is going to be as pure and clear as this cup when they open up the tap, and I think it is incumbent upon us on both sides of the aisle to stand today and to say this will not stand. 
   Madam Speaker, my predecessor, Congressman Hyde, had a great line. He said there is one thing worse than gridlock when it comes to government, and that is the greased chute of decision-making. Our role in Congress today is to stand up and to suggest and demand of the Environmental Protection Agency and demand of the State of Indiana that they rescind this order. With that, I am pleased to support the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, have you ever walked by a construction site? When they are putting up big buildings, it is really a sight to behold. And you look down at the foundation upon which they are building. If they are building the house right, they are putting it on a foundation of absolute bedrock. As you are watching them put it together, they are bringing in large pieces of concrete and steel. They are putting it down  ever so slowly, ever so slowly, because when they finally put it down on the foundation, it is not going to move again. That is why they are very, very careful. 
   I think today we are missing an opportunity to build on a solid foundation. We have an opportunity to fix a failed and struggling program, and that is the National Flood Insurance Program. That is not bedrock. It is peat moss. It is very, very soft stuff. It has an $18 billion liability right now. 
   Unfortunately, rather than dealing with the flood component, what is happening is that an additional liability is being placed on a program that doesn't have a solid foundation. We are giving additional responsibility in this bill to FEMA without any substantive reforms of FEMA. I know that over the past years, FEMA has been subject to and receives a great deal of criticism with the way in which it conducted itself following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.     
   I think that the lost opportunity here is a sad thing. The vast majority, not the overwhelming majority, but the vast majority of claims have been settled in the previous conflict, and now here we have got the chance to fix the flood program. My district wants a flood program that is dynamic and vibrant and solvent and based on a good foundation. 
   As was previously mentioned, the GAO has put the NFIP on a watch list, and yet we are entrusting the NFIP with the new responsibility. That we ought not do.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I find it ironic, actually, that this amendment, which has its merits, is being advanced, but that other amendments that are sort of similarly situated weren't placed in order. For example, this amendment says that in 9 months the GAO is going to be charged with the responsibility, essentially, of looking back for the past 9 months and looking at the impact on State insurance programs. Great. Really no argument there. 
   But if looking back is a good idea, isn't looking forward a good idea too? Isn't a prospective look forward at the possibility something that we ought to be doing? 
   I just find it concerning that we're willing to put a potential program, put the brakes on a potential program and be reflective, when we, at this very moment in time, as we sit here today, as we stand here today, we have the opportunity to accomplish this task by asking the GAO to look forward and look at the impact of this. This is part of the amendments that were, unfortunately, ruled out of order and were not allowed to be brought to the House and we're going to be denied an opportunity to have an up or down vote on the wind program, as Mr. Hensarling had suggested in his amendment. And yet we're being told, well, you know what, take a glance back after 9 months and let's sort of see how we're doing. And, oh, by the way, we tend to ignore what the GAO says anyway since they've put the National Flood Insurance Program on a high-risk watch list, essentially; and without any managerial changes we're entrusting that group that is on a watch with this great responsibility. 
   And I think this amendment really brings that real concern to mind, that those of us on this side of the aisle were not being given the opportunity to really debate this in totality.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   The other day, Mr. Chairman, when we originally debated the bill, the chairman of the committee gently admonished one of the other speakers, one of the gentlemen from California, for selectively quoting a particular article. 
   We all do that, though, don't we? He was making the point Wednesday, when we discussed this bill, about this particular issue, and the chairman, in sort of a gentle nudge, teased him a little bit, but sort of called him out and said, you know, read the entire article. 
   It seems to me that the chairman of the committee may be falling into that same trap a little bit. Because coming to this floor now and having a conversation of the range of the Securities and Exchange Commission and sort of, by implication, giving the imprimatur of approval on rules that the SEC promulgated is not a great celebration necessarily of the entire framework of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   It is not as if we have a choice today. We are in the minority. We don't get to set the debate. It is not as if we get to take the Etch-A-Sketch of Securities and Exchange law and go and shake it today and come up and create a new thing. 
   Now, if the gentleman from Georgia says, well, within the context of this, there is something that is decent that is happening here that the SEC has done, then so be it. But that is not an imprimatur of everything----

   Mr. Chairman, I think in response to the chairman's observations about the gentleman from Florida's amendment, I do take the chairman at face value that what you are trying to do and the way you are looking at it is trying to create a neutral framework by which these matters are determined. No question about that. But it seems to me that the beauty of this amendment is that it really does seem to get at the heart of the matter that is really prompting this sort of national conversation. 
   In other words, I think the gentleman from Florida has come up with a more surgical way to accomplish the very task that the chairman of the committee is trying to do. So while the chairman's bill in and of itself is a bit of a blunt instrument, I think that the gentleman from Florida's amendment sharpens that blunt instrument and helps to really cut to the cause and the issue that is before the Congress, and I urge its passage.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is interesting, the majority has now slipped into I think the same arguable bad habit that the chairman accused us of, because now the SEC has been criticized as Presidential appointees lacking the wisdom that Congress has. 
   Let's just discuss this amendment for a minute, because I really do think it is a good amendment. It gets to the heart of this matter. And it basically, for purposes of our discussion today, Mr. Chairman, it accepts, I think, the premise of the chairman. It says, here we go. Let's go back to the underlying bill and just focus our conversation for a minute. The underlying bill says, let's put a nonbinding referendum on the ballot. The chairman has made a number of arguments in favor of it. But the gentleman from Georgia, essentially says, in this amendment, okay, let's do that, but first, just hit the pause button. Just put the pause button on just for a bit and let the Securities and Exchange Commission, who, over the past day or so of debate, have risen to the point of almost Superman status, they have been so widely complimented and called wise and so forth by the other side of the aisle. Let's ask that commission what their opinion is. Let's study it. Let's look at it. And if, if, if, they say no problem, then there is no problem. No harm, no foul.     
   The bill is put into place and on we go. But if the Securities and Exchange Commission says that public companies enter into a competitive disadvantage because of this, then ought we not consider that? Shouldn't we then hit the stop button? Because we have heard the other side get up on the floor today and over the past few days and talk about the free market and how they are in favor of capitalism, and we have heard the gentleman from Oregon a couple of minutes ago telling us that the reason that companies are going to Europe is somehow because they don't have shareholder rights, and the logic was so dizzying, I couldn't even follow it. 
   But accepting everything that the other side says for the sake of argument is then implicit in accepting this amendment. Because all this amendment says, and let's be very clear about it, is it simply says hit the pause button for 90 days. Just wait 90 days. So let's assume for the sake of argument that this blows through the Senate. Let's assume for the sake of argument that it is signed into law on June 1. I would submit to you between June 1 and September 1 we can wait to take the temperature to find out if this is a good idea or if somehow this hinders us competitively.

So even if the SEC comes up and sends a signal flair and says, hey, this is going to be a train wreck, this is going to be a real problem; and we're going to see more and more companies either going private, unwilling to go public, which is sort of the subtext of a lot of what's going on, or ultimately going to Europe, my point is that this will not stop.

Many of us in this Chamber came just in January, took the oath of office, and now what we find is that every week is a new week, all new process we are learning. 
   So we come in, those of us who are not appropriators, we come into our conference, and we hear this is the appropriations week. Wow, sit down with our staff, staff gets us up to speed, and we hear about earmarks, heard about them a lot in the campaign, and start to get the staff briefing on what are the tools that we have in earmarks. 
   I heard a lot about them. If you talked to people in Illinois' Sixth Congressional District tonight, and they are awake, and you asked them about earmarks, you would get their attention. They would focus. It was a symbol of an abuse of the process. 
   So when you sit down as a freshman and your staff comes in, they say, Congressman, this is what you do. You can offer amendments. You can argue with these things. You can challenge them on the floor. As iron sharpens iron, so one makes another better. 
   So that process, that winnowing process, is what this is all about. That's what every Member has the right to do, except now, because now what ends up happening is our staff tells us, oh, no, but there is this new process, Congressman. 
   What you get to do is you get to write a letter. Oh, yes, you get to write a letter to the chairman of the committee; and the chairman of the committee is going to open up that letter, and he's going to make a decision about the merits of you, an independent elected Member of Congress. That is who you get to talk to. 
   You don't get to argue on the House floor. You don't get to light up 435 people. You don't get to talk to millions of people. You get to write one letter. That's where you get to go. 
   You know, if you think about that, that's absurd. There are all kinds of great things in this bill. No doubt about it. My prior colleague from the State of Illinois articulated many good things in this bill. It's my hope that we can come together and drive towards those things. 
   But to act as if the earmark process is insignificant is really patronizing. It's patting people on the head and saying, off with you, be lively, you get to write your letter to the chairman, and the chairman will make a declaration on whether it's a good idea or a bad idea. 
   Well, one of our colleagues on the Internet recently said this. He said, to his constituents, he said, I will remain no one's Congressman but yours. Doesn't that sound great? I mean, that's great stuff, that's rich. You know, that is rich in the Chamber of Commerce meetings; that's rich in front of the Rotary groups; that's rich in front of the coffee groups. And you go door to door, I'm going to be your Congressman. 
   But you know what? You end up ceding that responsibility. You end up ceding that opportunity to one person, and that's only if you are lucky enough that he reads your mail. 
   Well, I say ``no'' to that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (AMERICAN VETERANS DISABLED FOR LIFE COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 634, the American Veterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act introduced by Mr. Moore and by my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Kirk). 
   Madam Speaker, occasionally we disagree on the floor of this great Chamber, and we heard some of those disagreements aired a couple of minutes ago, but now there can be no disagreement about the goals of this legislation, honoring the heroes who have been grievously injured in the defense of this country, in defense of liberty, in defense of democracy. 
   There are plenty of monuments, as well there ought to be, for those who gave their lives for those causes, but I know of no monument to those who lived, but whose lives were drastically altered, whose bodies were broken, but whose spirits are still strong. But now they will have their own monument, and it is only right, Madam Speaker. 
   This memorial will be for the World War II vet who came back without a hand, the Korean War vet who uses a wheelchair, the Vietnam vet who uses the white cane of the blind, and for the veterans of the conflicts in the gulf, who came back to us forever changed. 
   In 2000, Congress approved the building of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. It will be a $65 million privately funded memorial just west of the Rayburn Building, across from the Botanic Garden and in full view of the Capitol. The Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission approved the conceptual design in 2004 and reaffirmed it in 2006. 
   The memorial will express our Nation's gratitude to those who paid the terrible cost of defending freedom. It represents the values of duty, of courage and of sacrifice that are the lifeblood of American democracy. 
   I urge Members, staff and the rest of the country to look at the Web site of the memorial at avdlm.org. 
   About half of the money for construction already has been raised, and this legislation, through surcharges on the sale of silver one-dollar coins to be issued by the U.S. Mint in 2010, could raise another $3.5 million to be used for construction or to maintain the dramatic memorial. 
   Madam Speaker, I am glad to be one of more than 300 Members of Congress who have cosponsored this bill, which is supported by the VFW, the American Legion, the DAV, and thousands of veterans and veteran organizations across the Nation who have contributed to the memorial's creation. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask for the immediate passage of H.R. 634 and urge all Members to support it.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an outstanding program in my congressional district, the Sixth District of Illinois. It is the Mayor for a Day Essay Contest hosted and sponsored by the Character Counts in Elmhurst Coalition in Elmhurst, Illinois. 
   This year's winner, a winner from among 1,000 entries of first through eighth graders, is Katie Knopf. When asked the question, what should a person living in Elmhurst do and what should their responsibility be, she said to work as much as she possibly can on her schoolwork, to do volunteer work to contribute to the community. ``It is my responsibility,'' she said, ``to set a good example for the younger children in my neighborhood. All in all, I need to be a good and caring person.'' 
   Indeed, Katie. Well done. Good advice for us all.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today and urge my colleagues to join with me and our colleague Mr. Kirk in cosponsoring H.R. 3901, the Emerald Ash Borer Municipality Assistance Act. 
   What is an emerald ash borer, you may ask. Well, it is a nasty little bug that has found its way on to our shores, which has a very aggressive disposition towards ash trees in particular. It is a native of China, and there are no known natural predators here in the United States. 
   If you think of the districts that we all represent, many of them have beautiful canopies of trees that line our streets and create wonderful natural ways all throughout our districts. Yet this bug has shown up in Illinois, my State; Indiana; Michigan; Ohio; Pennsylvania; Maryland and West Virginia. 
   As one researcher of the Morton Arboretum, which I represent, said, ``The emerald ash borer doesn't just kill a majority of the ash trees it encounters; it seems to kill them all.'' 
   This legislation creates a revolving loan fund whereby municipalities have access to those moneys, and they use it in order to take on this scourge.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE JERRY WELLER AND THE HONORABLE RAY LAHOOD -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, it is a real honor for me to be here with my colleagues from Illinois to honor two men who have really served admirably and have brought great pride to the Land of Lincoln. 
   The first is Congressman Jerry Weller who I got to know in the Illinois House of Representatives, and I served for one term with Congressman Weller. When he was in the State House of Representatives, he had a reputation of somebody who knew how to come back. 
   And he got involved in a tough election, and I won't drag you all through the weeds of that tough election, but he got dealt a tough blow in that many people thought he fairly won that election, but for a whole host of political reasons, he wasn't seated in that election. Do you know what? Rather than going home and say, oh, woe is me, Jerry Weller came back and he went out and he campaigned, and he earned the confidence of the voters of that district. He earned the confidence of his neighbors in Morris, Illinois, and he came back, and he was there to greet me when I first went to the House of Representatives in 1992. 
   Then Jerry Weller was a part of the historic class of 1994 that came in, and as has been previously mentioned by Mr. Manzullo and Mr. Shimkus, he was the person who focused in on repealing that marriage penalty, and I remember him talking about that to me. I remember him focusing on that. I remember reading about Jerry Weller pursuing that and pursuing that and pursuing that, and as we all know, it is a very difficult thing to pass a major piece of landmark legislation like that. There's a lot of exit  ramps around here for good ideas. There's a lot of trap doors for good ideas. But Jerry Weller was tenacious and he was able to put together the coalitions. He was focused and he got that done, and today, millions of Americans have fundamentally benefited because of his tenacity and the political savvy with which he moved that through the House and ultimately through the Congress. 
   He had other successes as well, and that was the transformation of the Joliet arsenal in Illinois, and that was property that had not it been for his leadership in his district, it could have essentially gone by the wayside. But because he was tenacious and he was focused, it's been turned into a good thing. 
   So Jerry Weller, we are going to miss you, and it is with regret that we're here tonight. But it is with a great deal of hope and optimism that we'll see you and your tenacity and the glint in your eye. 
   The other person that we're here to honor is also another member of that class, and that is Congressman Ray LaHood. Congressman LaHood has been described by Mr. Shimkus as a man of the House, and I kind of feel like he has the demeanor of sort of Dad coming home. When he would be in the Chair and the House would be raucous and a little bit spunky, he would gavel that down, and he was entrusted with the gavel during some of the most historic times. 
   And he is a man of history because he serves in the same seat that Abraham Lincoln served in. He's from the same hometown as another Illinois great, that is, Everett Dirksen. He served also at the side of Bob Michel, and these are great Illinoisans. 
   I'm pleased that now the Easter Seals of Peoria, Illinois, has chosen to honor Congressman LaHood and his bride by setting up the Ray and Kathy LaHood House for Children with Special Needs. 
   I think it's indicative of the type of person that he is, the type of integrity, the directness with which he interacts with his colleagues, and I know that that's great encouragement not only to me but I know it's great encouragement and a great example for all Americans. 
   So for these two men who have chosen to sacrifice so greatly and serve our State so well, I can tell you, Madam Speaker, that it is with a great deal of pride that I say it's been an honor to serve with Congressman Weller. It's been an honor to serve with Congressman LaHood, and I look forward to our paths crossing many, many times in the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (ENERGY CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Thank you for the time. 
   I am absolutely convinced, Mr. Speaker, that this is a pivotal time in our public life and it's a pivotal time that doesn't come along very often, the sense of clarity that has emerged across the country when gasoline is now knocking on the door of $4.50 a gallon all across the country. Today as I left Wheaton, Illinois, $4.17 a gallon. As I'm out in town hall meetings, as I'm literally walking in the parades over the 4th of July, everybody is coming together and saying, look, let's do something about this. And rather than having this whole opportunity just be squandered away, we have got an opportunity to move forward. And, unfortunately, the orthodoxy that is developed on the other side of the aisle is what my predecessor, Henry Hyde, used to call ``government by bumper sticker.'' ``Government by bumper sticker'' says put cute little phrases on the backs of cars and that's the policy that is going to drive our country. Well, that's great. Bumper stickers are nice and cute when it's at $2.50 a gallon. But in my district you know what people are saying? Rip the bumper stickers off and let's get serious about bringing a national policy as it relates to energy independence for the United States of America so that we're not creating the same elements of great risk where right now, as you know, we are funding both sides of the war on terror. When we go to the gas pump and the money that we are putting in and the taxes that we are paying, yes, we're protecting ourselves from terrorism. We are protecting ourselves with homeland security and domestic security efforts and our whole military infrastructure. But we are also putting money in the hands of regimes that are hostile, that are exporting terrorism and are being very provocative on the world stage. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we have got a chance today in this Congress to bring together a wide-ranging coalition that has an interest and a desire to move forward on energy independence, and I think that the time is now. Part of it has to be exploring and continuing to unlock American resources. Part of it has to be that. You can't do the math. You can't ultimately come up with the types of solutions that are going to satisfy our energy needs and simply ignore the resources that are available in the Arctic, the resources that are available in the Outer Continental Shelf. So that has got to be part of it. 
   Part of it is we have got to put nuclear power back into this mix. We have had great obstacles in the past as it relates to nuclear energy. Look at France. They have done a tremendous job harnessing that energy, moving it in ways that don't have the same types of emissions problems that other elements do. Nuclear energy has to be a part of it. 
   The types of funding resources that would be available if we were to unlock those American resources that I talked about a minute ago could fund many of the R and D types of projects. Let me tell you about one in my district. I represent an institution called the Gas Technology Institute, GTI, in Des Plaines, Illinois. It's a wonderful program, a public/private partnership. They are the types of folks that are doing the R and D that looks into emerging technologies, and then they help hand that off to industry and applied science. They have got a technology that they are on the verge of that is an anti-idling technology. So here's what happens: If you're a commercial truck, if you're a commercial bus, they waste tremendous energy as they are idling, as they are at stoplights and moving and not moving in traffic. Well, the technology that GTI is developing moves this so that in a nutshell it's a solid-fuel oxide that literally saves us in terms of the amount of energy that's used, the emissions that are emitted. It's that type of R and D that can undergird the types of things that the gentleman from Georgia has been talking about, Mr. Speaker. 
   There is a whole host of opportunities here, and it's dynamic. The public knows it. The public is crying out for what? The public is crying out for this body to act, for this body to get over the nonsense of ``government by bumper sticker,'' and to say, look, we can all come together. And we can get 218 Members, a majority of this House, to come together around commonsense ideas that strive for American energy independence. The gentleman from Illinois my colleague Mr. Shimkus has been a table pounder for clean coal technology. That can transform not only our region of the country in being an exporter, but it can literally transform how the United States begins to look in the future. So the opportunities are there. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding. I'm very hopeful about what can come out of this. But it only comes out if there is a political will that develops that says we are going to put 218 votes up on that board and we're going to move the ball for the American public.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I offer this motion to recommit with instructions, and it surrounds the general topic of student loan forgiveness. As we know, student loan forgiveness programs seek to help students with the cost of college or encourage them to enter a particular occupation or field. 
   This was first put in place back in 1958 in the National Defense Education Act, and it was reenacted and made part of the Perkins loan program, and it provides forgiveness largely for borrowers who are employed in a specific public service job, including teachers, but over the years has added others as well. 
   I would like to read a short list of those who are currently eligible under various programs for student loan forgiveness. They include: Public school teachers; Head Start staff, whether teachers or not; special education teachers; military members in combat areas; volunteers in the Peace Corps; law enforcement officers; correction officers; teachers in specific areas who are teaching in math, science, foreign language or bilingual education; nurses; medical technicians; child care providers; family service agency workers; researchers at NIH; health professionals in the National Health Service Corps; AmeriCorp volunteers; National Civilian Corps volunteers; and VISTA volunteers. 
   These loan forgiveness programs are so popular, in fact, that 43 States currently have them. Congressional Research Service not long ago surveyed a whole host of financial aid officials across the country and came to the conclusion that these are very effective programs in meeting students' financial needs and particular workforce needs. 
   Earlier this year, the House took on the challenge to expand loan forgiveness for prosecutors and public defenders, and clearly there is a good public purpose behind that. 
   But now under the bill, Mr. Speaker, basically anyone who works for the government or a nonprofit organization would be eligible for loan forgiveness. I repeat that. Basically anyone who works for the government or a nonprofit organization would be eligible for loan forgiveness. So what does that mean? Does that mean that Members of Congress would be eligible for loan forgiveness? I don't know about you, Mr. Speaker, but nobody sent me here to expand loan forgiveness eligibility for Members of Congress. And, in fact, Members of Congress are eligible under this bill. 
   Are members of State legislatures eligible for loan forgiveness under this bill? Yes. 
   Are registered lobbyists who work for nonprofit organizations, are they eligible? Yes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like us to look at some of the CEOs of nonprofit organizations and reflect on their compensation and how that would play into this eligibility question. According to the Charity Navigator, the former head of Planned Parenthood Federation of America made over half a million dollars, $500,000, and would that person be eligible? Yes, as would John Adams, the president of the Natural Resources Defense Counsel who makes almost $300,000 a year. The National Journal reported in 2004 that the median compensation for think tanks was $264,000 a year. Or how about this, $227,000 for education, government and welfare organizations. 
   Does anybody really believe that these individuals need this kind of support from the taxpayers? My point is that this new blanket program for nonprofit organizations will give a number of well-to-do individuals a government handout that they don't need and our constituents should not have to fund. 
   So the real question is whether this is the highest and best use of taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, I would submit that it is not, so this motion to recommit is very simple. It would prohibit a borrower who is an elected full-time public official and is paid for that position, as well as a paid registered lobbyist at either the State or Federal level, from receiving any of the loan forgiveness available under this act, period. Very simple, very clear. 
   I think we should speak clearly to the American taxpayers that we as elected officials are not trying to create some unfair advantage for ourselves, that we are not trying to reward ourselves, or our elected colleagues, nor any registered lobbyist, by giving away their hard-earned taxpayer dollars to pay off student debts. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment or to at least set some parameters of this big government program under this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, I rise this morning to address a new development surrounding our Nation's airports. I represent Illinois' Sixth Congressional District, which is the home of Chicago O'Hare International Airport. O'Hare is the world's second busiest airport, and a week ago agents from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Unit, a division of Homeland Security known as ICE, as well as Cook County sheriffs deputies, raided warehouses and secured areas at O'Hare, arresting over 27 alleged illegal aliens who had received fraudulent identification badges from a local employment agency. These illegal individuals had access to the tarmac, to cargo, as well as other secure areas putting them in direct contact with aircraft. 
   That is why I am an original cosponsor of legislation introduced by my friend and colleague, Mr. Kirk from Illinois. 
   It gives authority for any airport Federal security director to designate airport areas that he or she certifies as a critical area for transportation security as a special security zone. Once an  area at an airport is declared a security zone, it is off-limits to illegal aliens.  
   Once an area at an airport is declared a ``special security zone'' only the airport's Federal Security Director can issue security badges to these zones. 
   This legislation also states that only U.S. Nationals who have been cleared by Basic Pilot Program verification system can be given security access badges to these zones. 
   We must be tough when it comes to airport security because it is our first line in defense here at home against terrorists who want to kill more Americans. 
   I ask my fellow colleague in the House to join me in securing our airports and cosponsor this vital piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (PUBLIC HOUSING ASSET MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3521, the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007. The bill makes several changes to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Public Housing Agency Asset Management Final Rule. And what I'd like to do, rather than reading a lengthy statement, is just sort of summarize some of my concerns in a nutshell. 
   Without question, there's been a great deal of good work and good faith that's been put in on this bill, but I think that there's a couple of key points that just fall a little bit short, and I think we can do better. 
   The first is, the exemption of so many public housing authorities from the asset management mandate. And that's something that's a good thing, on balance. Asset management says that if you've got unit A and unit B and unit C of public ho using, then we're going to determine the cost of unit A, the cost of unit B, and the cost of unit C, and that we're not going to mix all these things up together and act as if each individual one isn't responsible for an individual cost. Asset management is a good business practice that makes all kinds of sense. And if the bill, as amended, is ultimately passed by this House, 88 percent of public housing authorities in the United States would be exempt. That's a bad idea. 
   The second thing that is actual ly a bigger concern to me, is section 2 of the bill, and it relates to management and related fees. Let me just read part of the language that this House is being asked to vote on. It says, ``The Secretary shall not impose any,'' and that's the operative word, Mr. Chairman, ``any restriction or limitation on the amount of management and related fees with respect to a public housing project if the fee is determined to be reasonable by the Public Housing Agency unless,'' and then there's a couple of limitatio ns that have to do with timing. The Secretary shall not impose any restriction or limitation. Any restriction? Any limitation? And who is it that's going to determine whether a fee is reasonable?  
   Well, under this bill, as amended, under this bill, it's going to be the very entity that's going to be the beneficiary of that fee. So we're essentially saying to the fox, Why don't you guard the henhouse? Why don't you decide what your fee is going to be, and you simply send the bill to the taxpayer, a nd that's the bill that's going to be paid? I think that's unreasonable. I think that common sense says, no, no, no. Common sense says, there's going to be someone else that determines reasonableness of fees before a bill is going to be paid. And what this does is it says, and it's a curious thing to me. I can't figure out for the life of me why. It says that the determination of reasonableness and the renegotiation of reasonableness can't be brought up for another year. This can't even be the subject of a conversation, a substantive negotiation, until April 1 of 2009. And then, even if something is negotiated then, it can't be imposed until 2011, 3 years away. I just think that's unreasonable, and I think it is a financial control that's in place that is being put adrift, and we're not going to be able to get it back for 3 years. Costs are going to go up. Mark my words. 
   Finally, this allows for the diversion of capital funds, Mr. Chairman. You know, there's always a natural tension, right, between capita l funds and operating funds, and we hear that all the time. There is no shortage of national attention and national conversation and national concern about the atrophying of our capital, the atrophying of our infrastructure. And what we ought not be doing is creating more fungibility, in other words, more pressure to take money and divert precious capital money from capital expenditures, which are the traditional bricks and mortars of public housing to go into the operating side. And for those reasons, I ri se in opposition. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (PUBLIC HOUSING ASSET MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the tone of the discussion this afternoon very, ver y much. I just want to point out and really ask the House if you notice something, and at the beginning of my remarks, I put out, essentially as a challenge, this concern that I have of this language: the secretary shall not impose any restriction or limitation on the amount of management and related fees. Nothing: no restrictions, no authority, completely stripped so that there is nobody that has the ability that can come in and say this invoice for management, this amount of money for management, are you kidding me? That's outrageous. Nobody has the authority to do that. They do now, they do currently have that ability, but under this bill, Mr. Chairman, that authority goes away. 
   Now, the gentleman from New Jersey, the previous speaker, mentioned the fungibility argument. I accept that as an argument. I just don't think it is a good idea. I don't think that something that's in an appropriations bill, just because it's a bad idea, that it needs the House's imprimatur once again. That's going to expire at the end of the year, and I think we can do better. 
   So just in summary, what we are being asked to do today is essentially to limit down the amount of public housing authorities that would be under asset management to only 12 percent of the public housing authorities in the United States. Only 12 percent of them would be subject to asset management if this bill is enacted. 
   So I think those are sufficient numbers to say, you know what, I think we can do better. Those are sufficient reasons, sufficien t arguments that would suggest that we can do better. This should go back to the drawing board. And I urge a ``no'' vote. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, have I ever told you about my dog, Max? I don't think I have. Let me just take a minute and tell you about Max. 
   Like a lot of us who are fathers of younger children, I have four children, who approached me, Mr. Speaker, and begged me and begged me and begged me to get them a dog. And for years I was able to avoid eye contact and was able to keep an animal out of my house. But, finally, in a moment of weakness, I said yes. 
   And a friend of mine, Mr. Speaker, realized what was happening, and he pulled me aside and he said, ``Look, if you're going to get a dog, realize this: You get what you pet.'' You get what you pet. So if a dog comes in and it's disobedient and you pet that dog and give it all kinds of affirmation, then guess what. It's going to keep being disobedient. And not being very wise, we started to do that, and so now we've got a slightly out-of-control dog. 
   Now, why do I mention Max? We're on the verge of doing that same type of conduct exactly to people who have fundamentally made some bad decisions. Let's take the borrowers aside, and I realize the chairman has worked hard, but let's take the borrowers aside and just put them in a different category because what we're going to be doing today, in addition to helping borrowers, is really bailing out lenders. And I don't think that's an overcharacterization. I don't think that's an unfair way of looking at this. We are being told that lenders who were in this, who are great advocates of the free market when they're making money, they love the free market when they're making money, and now all of a sudden, they are coming to the Federal taxpayer and saying this has gotten a little bit more complicated than we thought, and now we want the taxpayers to come in and take care of this from here out. It's voluntary on the part of the lenders, and think about how voluntary that would be. What a great invitation. These lenders go and they say here's our pile of bad debt. Let's take a haircut, 85 percent of the value, shove that off to the FHA, which is pretty ill equipped, I might add, to take on this obligation--let's shove that off to the taxpayer, and instead of getting our heads chopped off as lenders, we're just going to get a haircut. 
   I think we can do a lot better, I think, over a period of time.     
   There is a great willingness, Mr. Speaker, on this side of the aisle to try and work creatively and to try and work substantively on solutions. But I think as we reflect back on this, in the  chairman's own words, it is going to cost $5,000 for every defaulted mortgage that is assumed by the FHA, times a half million. That gets us to the $2.5 billion figure that makes many of us cringe. 
   And I don't think that those types of numbers should be allocated to lenders and bailing out lenders who made bad decisions.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise, Mr. Chairman, in opposition to H.R. 1257. But first of all, I want to compliment the chairman and the ranking member who ran a very good process, had fruitful hearings, but nevertheless I think came up with a faulty product.     
   We all tend to sometimes argue in the alternative, picking and choosing those things that we want to focus on, and I find it ironic that the chairman has, in one way, this very, very high view of the marketplace and, in another way, demonstrates a fairly low view of the marketplace. 
   This is all about the level, Mr. Chairman, at which we choose to intervene. We saw the marketplace respond positively just a couple of weeks ago. Morgan Stanley, at their annual meeting, those shareholders decided not to take up this question of executive compensation. The same thing happened, Mr. Chairman, at the Bank of New York recently. 
   So what is the question before the House today? The question before the House is, when there is a difficult situation that comes forward, admittedly a difficult situation that the chairman recently called a fact of nature, and that is overly compensated executive employees, what does the House do? Does the House rush in? 
   I would suggest that the bill as presented currently is an overreaction. It is reaching in, and if we are going to be dabbling in this notion of executive compensation, Mr. Chairman, then I would suggest that we need to go all the way and try and take on other highly compensated employees. 
   What we will hear, I think, from the various speakers on our side of the aisle is trying to lay out a rationale, trying to lay out how we ought best to do this because I will tell you this. I think the great challenge before us as Members of the House is, how do we create the environment where people want to invest in our country, how do we create the environment where the best and the brightest among us want to go into public companies because I will suggest, Mr. Chairman, that the reaction of the past Congress or two on some of these things has unfortunately created an environment that is regulatorily very, very difficult, and it now creates among us the problem of people who say, look, it is simply not worth my time to go into a public company. I am one of the sharp ones; I am going to go into the private equities and so forth. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, just a couple of observations before I yield to my distinguished colleague. 
   You know, the gentleman from Georgia said that one of the goals of this legislation is that there be transparency and accountability. I would submit, I think there is a transparency and accountability in the current state of the law. The transparency comes in the disclosure of executive compensation, and the accountability comes in the ability to sell shares if you don't like it. That is a very, very, very powerful tool. 
   My friend from Missouri, the distinguished gentleman who spoke recently kind of criticized a number of individual CEOs. I'm not going to rise to their defense, and I don't think they really deserve defense. But it is an old adage of the law that if what we are doing is creating a statute toward an exception, we tend to make bad statutes. 
   What I would say is, look at the totality of what executive leadership has brought us. From 2002 to 2006, the market capitalization of American companies has risen to $8 trillion. That is something to celebrate and not something to criticize. 
   I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Paul).

   Just kind of a point of interest, and that is, in response to Chairman Frank  calling, observing Mr. Castle's quotation.

One of those that he didn't find attractive apparently is a loser-pay litigation system which would also maybe drive part of that debate.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I have offered this amendment to clarify some possibly misleading language in H.R. 1257, and it simply strikes ``or other meeting of the shareholders'' and inserts ``meeting of the shareholders or a special meeting in lieu of the annual meeting,'' at page 4, line 14 and page 5, line 7. The bill would allow, as we have discussed, a separate, nonbinding shareholder vote to approve the compensation of executives for any proxy, consent or authorization for an annual meeting. As currently drafted, the language in the bill asserts that this would be an annual meeting or other meeting of the shareholders. This language could potentially lead to allowing multiple nonbinding shareholder votes throughout the year instead of just at the annual or special meeting in lieu of the annual meeting, and, therefore, clarification of this language is needed. Hence, the reason for the amendment. 
   My concern is that if the current language were to be placed into law, that multiple votes would be forced to be taken throughout the year which would distract the board and the executives from their primary responsibility, that is, ensuring that they put in place good business practices that benefit the shareholders' investment instead of being distracted multiple times by a whole host of votes. 
   The greater concern would be that these potential multiple votes would ensure fiscal and business priorities are not in the forefront of the board members' minds, ultimately having the ill effect on global competitiveness of American business. I spoke to the chairman earlier, and I believe that it's a noncontroversial request to clarify language. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise to point out that there is some dizzying logic going on. Basically, we are being told, here is a piece of legislation, and if you are clever enough to come up with a germane amendment, we will sort of humor you and listen to you. But if there is a larger suggestion, then it is very difficult to move forward. 
   I would just suggest to the chairman of the committee that the perfect is the enemy of the good. It strikes me that the gentleman from Massachusetts is an incrementalist. Those who survive most in this arena are incrementalists, and he has survived for a long, long time, Mr. Chairman, and flourished and been very successful as a legislator. 
   But it just seems that this is a good faith effort on the part of the gentleman from North Carolina to put forward something substantively. Is it the totality of making every problem go away? No. There is no way to do that.     
   And it is a little bit of a procedural Catch-22 that he is in.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would take the conversation this evening in a little bit of a different direction. It simply would postpone the diversion of funds to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund that is created in this bill until such time as Congress stops raiding the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for unrelated government programs. 
   This year, the majority proposed and passed a budget that assumes it will raid the entire Social Security surplus, an estimated $190 billion, to spend on other government programs, and that amount will increase to $203 billion for the year 2008. 
   During the course of many of our journeys to this office in this last election cycle, we stood up in senior centers and in conversations and in coffee and corner conversations, and we said, ``We will stand firmly with the seniors on behalf of Social Security.'' 
   The chairman of the Financial Services Committee has sort of quietly admonished the Republicans on this side of the aisle who were here in the year 2005 for voting on a past bill and so forth. But there are 54 new Members of the House of Representatives, and we all took the oath of office. I took it right over there where Congressman  Feeney is sitting, took my oath; my wife was in the audience, my children were by my side, my mom and dad were here. Fifty-four of us all came in, 13 on our side, 41 on the other side, and we took that oath of office. We were not part of the conversation in the year 2005, but many of us campaigned on the integrity of the Social Security system. 
   Mr. Chairman, I don't know what the parliamentary rule is on referring to quotes and so forth, and I know that it is not what in our family is called cool, so I am not going to name names. But a quick Google search of the new Members of Congress who joined me in this class, the class of 110th, criticized opponents that they defeated for voting to rob the Social Security Trust Fund and spend it on other programs. 
   ``Those were documented votes. Those are budget votes, and they used the Social Security Trust Fund to mask the overall Federal deficit.'' 
   Someone else said, ``We are going to make sure we have real substantive programs about how we make sure Social Security is secure.'' 
   Or, Mr. Chairman, how about this. Another new Member said in their campaign that they would ``fight for Social Security for seniors.'' 
   Or how about this language. That they would ``stop the raids on the Social Security Trust Fund that are used to help cover our Nation's huge Federal budget deficits.'' 
   You get the point. 
   You know, life is choices. And I respect the chairman and his passion on this bill and the intellectual honesty with which he has approached this. When I saw the chairman, who was injured, I sort of thought that he might have tripped and fell over one of those Blue Dog signs that are littered all over the Cannon Building in my office. They are everywhere. Mr. Chairman, I have a copy of one of the Blue Dog signs that says, ``The Blue Dog Coalition. The national debt is $8.8 trillion, and your share of the national debt is $29,000.'' 
   You know what? Those signs are getting a little bit faded. There is not quite so much interest in that issue right now on the part of the Blue Dogs, it seems to me. 
   I think we have choices to make, and I would submit that the choice that we have to make is a choice of priorities. And voting ``yes'' on this amendment says our highest priority in this conversation that we are having is to ensure the integrity of the Social Security system. It simply says, it transcends this last hour or two of debate. It doesn't get into the profitability and loss, the shareholders, and so forth. It admits, okay, great idea. But put it on pause, and take the money that the chairman has found, take the money and put it into the Social Security Trust Fund. That is what this amendment says. It says put it on pause, and use it to fund our obligations. 
   Look, we have got a lot of moving parts in terms of problems in this country. We have got the national debt, we have got veterans obligations, we have got pension obligations. We have got to lower gas prices. You name it. There is one thing after another that we need to do. And all this bill does is it says, great idea, terrific idea even; wrong time. 
   So I think the majority owes a great debt of gratitude to the chairman of the committee, because he has come up with $3 billion that can be enacted in one rollcall this evening to make the Blue Dog Coalition promise come true.

   Mr. Chairman, I think it is important within this context to realize who has the gavel and who has the majority. 
   Mr. Chairman, you have the majority. You have the ability to direct vast sums of money. And what I am suggesting is that in your earlier conversation regarding those that were a part of the 2005 vote that you sort of felt like was somehow binding into perpetuity, 54 of us, Mr. Chairman, were not part of that conversation, and 54 of us didn't really find it informative. 
   There are 54 of us that came in this Congress totally new, fresh. We are the Etch-A-Sketch that is clean; 41 on your side of the aisle and 13 of us. 
   And so what I am suggesting is in the course of the campaigns that brought us here, many, many of us, and I Googled and searched several of yours and I didn't want to string them out by naming names and so forth. But many of your new freshmen said they were champions of Social Security. Well, you know what? They have got an opportunity to vote in favor of this bill.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Let me make my point, and I will reciprocate. But, like you do, you tend to finish your point.     
   Mr. Chairman, we have to make priorities. 
   You know, I come from the O'Hare Airport area. O'Hare is in my district. And you know, the biggest challenge in O'Hare and why everybody hates flying through it is because there are so many planes in the air. This puts another plane in the air when nationally, you know what, we've got so many things circling, we've got one obligation after another that we're not doing well. 
   I commend the chairman. Look, you found $3 billion. The Democrats should give you a legislative, well, I was going to say something that was a little over top. They should congratulate you for finding that type of, those type of resources. And what I'm suggesting, Mr. Chairman, is that we put this on pause. I'm not getting involved in the debate earlier about whether it's a good idea or a bad idea. Say, for the sake of argument, it's fabulous. Say, for the sake of argument, western civilization won't process forward without it. I still say that there are higher priorities. And I named any number of them. 
   And what you have done, Mr. Chairman, in your advocacy and the way that you have asked us to, I would characterize it as trust you on how this is going to be articulated and distributed in the future based on legislation that you will have a profound influence on. And I would also say that we've got the ability, it's a two-step process.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman from New Jersey will continue to yield, we can have a wonderful conversation about germaneness. But getting back to the chairman's point earlier about what I characterize as a ``trust in me'' argument. No, you didn't use the ``words trust in me,'' but I think it is important that the body not be left confused about the implication at least that we took about a verbal interchange that the chairman had with the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) when she asked, and I am quoting from the committee transcript: ``I know we have discussed the fact that there might be other ways to do this, but it seems if it is the chairman's plan to reconsider the details of the housing fund in the future, why not just take the fund out of here and then have the hearings and then make the decision.'' 
   And at that point Mrs. Biggert continued: ``I cannot remember a time where we put something in and said maybe we will do this in this way but then we might do it another way and then we will go back and re-do it.'' 
   And then she yielded to the chairman, who then said: ``The reason I do not want to leave it out now is I am very strongly committed to it, perhaps more than some other members. It is, I think, a rational part of this bill. It is a part of, frankly, an agreement. 
   ``Let me be very clear. I believe that there is a great deal of interest on the part of the administration and some others in having a greatly increased regulatory structure for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   ``Not everybody who wants an increased regulatory structure for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is committed to that Affordable Housing Fund. If the Affordable Housing Fund was not established in this bill and was a stand-alone bill, it might get vetoed. 
   ``I think it is less likely to cause vetoing of the whole bill. I like very much the idea of the Affordable Housing Fund. I do not believe it could stand on its own necessarily, and that is the reason for including it in this bill.''  
   Now, I took from that, and I think it is a very reasonable inference, Mr. Chairman, the ``trust in me'' argument, and I think that that is a consistent argument.

In 1940, FDR designated the last Sunday in September as Gold Star Mothers Day to commemorate the tremendous sacrifice these courageous mothers have endured on behalf of our Nation. 
   This year Gold Star Mothers Day will be held on September 30. This brave group of women have turned their personal tragedy into patriotism and caring service.

   Phil believed that the best way to keep America safe was to take the fight to the terrorists. And the last time he saw his mom he said, ``Be strong, Mom. No matter what happens, you be strong.'' That's exactly what Georgette has done. 
   Phil and his family represent the best and the bravest that our country  has to offer. Many other courageous families have paid this ultimate sacrifice, one we cannot ignore. Please join me in thanking Georgette and all the Gold Star Mothers by cosponsoring this important resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3505, the Securities Law Technical Corrections Act of 2007, a measure to make technical corrections to the various securities laws, and I thank Mr. Scott for his support for this measure and also Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for advocating that this come to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression, Congress enacted the Federal securities laws of the 1930s and the 1940s. Over many years, Congress has amended these laws to adopt innovation and growth in the securities industry. Securities laws have become incredibly complex and technical due to the intricate and global markets we have today. 
   The goal of these laws is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets, and to facilitate capital formation and promote competition. These laws range from governing over the initial issuance and registration of securities to the oversight of financial reporting and registration of people involved in the sale of securities. The laws also regulate the purchase and sale of securities, securities brokerage firms and securities exchanges, and they also have been responsible for the rules of the creation and operation of mutual funds and those laws governing the operation of investment advisors, all good things. 
   As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to review laws that we pass to ensure that they are current and that they are up to date. Most importantly, Congress needs to clarify that these laws are well-crafted so that agencies who administer and enforce them are able to do so without causing unnecessary confusion to investors, to market participants and the courts. 
   Keeping the security laws current is a worthwhile undertaking. One such example where there is need to update our securities laws which are included in this legislation is to address the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. It was repealed, as Mr. Scott mentioned, in the 2005 energy bill because it was no longer necessary. 
   But it was originally adopted to deal with circumstances that existed in the 1930s and 1940s when the commission was restructuring the utility industry. At that point, a number of holding companies would have owned minority stakes in utilities and other holding companies and they may have held substantial equity assets that caused them to meet the investment company definition at that time. 
   Today, virtually all utility holding companies operate throughout wholly owned subsidiaries and, thus, do not have investment company status issues any different from any other type of holding company. So utility holding companies no longer need to be treated differently than any other type of company for purposes of determining whether they meet the definition of investment company. 
   H.R. 3505 makes almost 50 technical changes to the Federal securities laws. Mr. Speaker, I want to note that the Securities and Exchange Commission supports these changes. 
   Once again I want to thank my colleague Mr. Scott, along with Ranking Member Bachus and our chairman, Chairman Frank, for their support of this legislation, and I urge all of our colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   You know, the gentleman from Rhode Island said he was astounded, and he was bemoaning, and wondering who people like me represent. 
   Well, folks that I represent have a very high expectation of this Congress, and the expectation is that it's a Congress that is going to live up to and match the rhetoric of the campaign of 2006. The campaign of 2006, you recall, was a campaign that seemed to focus on living within our means. 
   I didn't hear, as one speaker on the other side of the aisle, the hue and cry of the American people to come up with a new program. I heard the hue and cry of people within my district to live within the means of government. 
   I am informed that right now the budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development is on the order of $35 billion. When I go back to the Sixth District of Illinois, they are not bemoaning, they are not astounded. They have an expectation that we are going to live within our means, that within $35 billion, not $5 billion, not 10, not 15, not 20, not 25, not 30, but $35 billion, that the taxpayers have entrusted to us, that somehow that's not enough, and that the only way that this problem can get solved is by going to create another fund, another fund that somehow isn't going to have new Federal employees, somehow is going to be cut out of whole cloth and, counterintuitively, from my point of view, is going to create a higher cost of housing borrowing on the very people that we are trying to help. Well, the district that I represent has the expectation that we will do the right thing, that we won't get caught up in a demagogy and sound bites and so forth, but that we will look clearly at the bills that are before us. 
   In this case, with all due respect to the well-intentioned sponsors, this bill falls short, and we can do better.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, a special word of thanks to the majority leader, who worked hard to get this resolution on the floor, and to him I'm deeply grateful. 
   You know, there's been a lot said about Henry Hyde over the past several weeks, particularly since his passing and in the weeks prior to that when he received the Medal of Freedom from President Bush in a White House ceremony that he was unable to attend due to his illness. 
   And we've often focused in those comments on his conduct here in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, but I would like to give just a little bit of a glimpse of what he was like back at home, because the same shadow that was cast here in the Capitol was similarly cast in the Sixth District of Illinois, which is the west and northwest suburbs of Chicago. There, he was Henry Hyde who would be routinely introduced at various gatherings, and in partisan gatherings he would oftentimes get a standing ovation from a very grateful group of Republicans. But all across the aisle, both sides of the aisle, people were able to approach him, and they would often think of him, really, as an alderman for that area, or almost a city councilman. And by that I don't mean anything to negate his status, but simply, his accessibility as a Member of Congress, which was something really to behold. You could routinely find him in his district. He would fly back and forth every week into O'Hare Airport, which was right in the middle of his Sixth District of Illinois. 
   And I think that he was one of those people that, when you think about Congressmen, you think about the very best and the very brightest. And I would submit that when, from 1974 all the way up through his retirement, when people contemplated Henry Hyde, he was contemplated in a way that was a positive reflection on this institution. When people thought of him, they thought, You know what? That's the way a congressman is supposed to be. That's the way a congressman is supposed to handle himself. That's the way a congressman is supposed to interact with people on his own side of the aisle and, even more importantly, with people on the other side of the aisle. 
   His legacy is one, and his name will inextricably be linked with the pro-life movement. He was a passionate advocate, as we all know, for the unborn. 
   He did his duty in the impeachment of President Clinton. But those things, while they're formative, and they're very interesting, and they are who he was, sort of the lead gets buried if you stop the Henry Hyde story there, because he was someone who was also very active and a partner in trying to reach out to come up with the funds and the support to take on HIV/AIDS globally. 
   And he was far ahead of his time. He was one who broke from his ranks and voted in favor of the Family and Medical Leave Act, much to the chagrin, at the time, of many in his party who subsequently have come to see the light of that courage of his convictions. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, in closing, this is a time of reflection and it's a time of honoring the legacy of a great man. And I think the words of Paul Johnson, a great British historian, come to mind when he wrote a history of the American people. And the British historian Johnson said, to paraphrase, he said this: All kinds of factors go into how history comes out. Just all kinds of things. But without question, the single most important factor are the people who are in charge at the time. 
   And I think all of us today rise and acknowledge that Henry J. Hyde and the oath that he took and the way in which he carried himself in office was a great credit, not only to this institution, but a great credit to our country.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness of the imminent need for Congress to extend and make permanent the research and development tax credit. The R&D tax credit is set to expire at the end of this year. At a time of increasing globalization, America's prosperity depends more than ever on its capacity to  innovate. For decades, our Nation's leadership in research has led to discoveries that have dramatically improved living standards around the world and given rise to new industries that have in turn created millions of new jobs. 
   Other countries are well aware of the significant economic benefits that flow from R&D activities, and many have created strong tax incentives designed to attract R&D investment around the world. In fact, 10,000 American companies will be able to take advantage of the permanency of the R&D tax credit. In my district alone, small and medium manufacturers, technology companies and leading research institutions will greatly benefit from this tax credit. 
   Let's not play politics with the lifeblood of our economy. Let's join together, both sides of the aisle, to extend the R&D tax credit.

   I was surprised, Mr. Speaker, that the Rules Committee chose to reject an amendment that I offered that was an attempt to bring some clarity and light to this debate, particularly as it relates to energy needs. 
   I represent a district, Mr. Speaker, in the Chicago area which the Chicago Tribune this week has reported has the highest gas prices in the Nation. So in an attempt to try to take that on, I offered an amendment that I thought was a very straightforward thing, not meant to be controversial, not meant to be overly partisan, just a good commonsense idea that unfortunately the majority on the Rules Committee rejected. That was a simple thing, and that would create a tax credit, Mr. Speaker, a tax credit for biofuel vehicles. 
   Right now we have got a tax credit for alternative fuel vehicles, and that is great. But you have got a lot of municipalities in my district that are really suffering under the weight of these high gas prices, and they are looking for alternatives and a biofuel vehicle is just one of those things. So, in other words, oftentimes these vehicles can start up using gasoline, and then it can be transferred and powered on compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied propane, or hydrogen, all things that if municipalities are using will take pressure off gas prices. 
   Now think about it. This is an opportunity for Congress to do something to help to create a market for other vehicles. Right now sometimes the private marketplace isn't able to come up as quickly as we want it, so we have got local units of government that are saying we want to use these types of vehicles; and this Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker, has denied the tax credit that would empower that kind of thing. It makes no sense to me. I am just deeply disappointed that folks on the Rules Committee who are in the majority just rejected this idea. It is not a partisan idea. It is what is called a good idea that we need to move forward.  
   In 1968, Richard Nixon campaigned for the Presidency claiming he had a secret plan to end the war. He went all over the country and said: I have got a secret plan to end the war. If you elect me President of the United States, my secret plan to end the war will win it all and will bring it all home. 
   Well, we all know there was no secret plan. His Secretary of Defense said so, everyone has declared so, and history shows it. But there are eerie similarities between that declaration of Richard Nixon in 1968 and the words of now Speaker Pelosi when she was the minority leader: She had a plan to bring gas prices down. 
   Well, if what the majority is doing on the Rules Committee is rejecting commonsense ideas like tax credits for biofuel vehicles that help suburban communities in my district, I am very interested for when this secret plan that the Speaker has alluded to is going to be coming forward. I don't think there is a secret plan, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Like many others, I very much appreciate the tone and the effort of the chairman and the ranking member to come to terms with a very difficult problem that is facing our country, and that is the subprime mortgage crisis and the ripple effect, the profound ripple effect it is having throughout the economy. 
   My sense, though, is that while there are some very good elements in the bill, I appreciate the fact that it is prospective, I appreciate the fact that it is not a bailout, and I appreciate the fact that its focus is limited to subprime mortgages and not prime mortgages, there is an element that is of enough concern to me to come to the floor and bring it to the House's attention. 
   I am not unique in bringing it to the House's attention, but I urge a real sense of caution, and I think we can do slightly better, and that is the ambiguity of some of the phrases and definitions in the bill. The gentleman from Georgia referenced these in his remarks. 
   But when regulatory language, as this is, has words like ``appropriate'' without further definition; ``ability to repay'' without further definition; and ``net tangible benefit'' without further definition, I think it is a weakness in the bill, and I think it is a fatal flaw in the bill. 
   My hope is that these ambiguities will be cleaned up. I am not one that says we necessarily need to yield this turf to the regulators. I think we as Members of Congress have that ability and that responsibility to define these terms. Because if we don't, I think what will happen is that capital that is currently available to subprime borrowers will become unavailable to some subprime borrowers. 
   There is language that creates the purported safe harbor in the bill, but it is a safe harbor that does not end with a period at the end of the sentence, essentially. It is a safe harbor that has a comma at the end and is simply a rebuttable presumption. So safe harbors are mostly safe, but not entirely safe. 
   I think Americans like to be governed with a light touch and not a heavy hand, and I hope that we can revisit this bill when it may come back from the other body.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I want to commend our colleagues on the other side of the aisle from Florida as good advocates for their districts in recognizing that Florida has a serious problem. I think that if everybody had that same confidence that Federal taxpayers weren't going to be involved and that this ultimately was an insurance program that was going to be completely clearly funded, the money was going to come in, it was actuarially sound, and it was going to go out, a lot of us would say ``no harm, no foul, great.'' 
   But a lot of us have a real sense of concern because what we have done is we have looked at Florida, and my conclusion is that part of the problem of Florida and the difficulty that they are facing is because of governmental intervention in the insurance marketplace. It seems to me that the State of Florida came in and began to manipulate the marketplace insofar as other companies then ultimately made decisions, ``look, this is too high maintenance, this is too complicated, we are not able to price this appropriately, we are out of here.'' 
   We heard testimony during the Financial Services Committee from folks who said the depth and breadth of building in Florida, in many cases, is simply inappropriate, building in very risky areas. Now, the bill speaks to some to mitigation, but I think we can do much better. And over the course of this afternoon, in a series of amendments that we intend to offer, some of them on the manager's amendment and some of them specific roll calls that we will be seeking, we are going to try and drive the conversation toward market solutions to this problem. 
   We are told time and again, I have heard both speakers this afternoon on the other side talk about an opt-in, talk as if this is a voluntary program. Well, I will tell you what; it is not a voluntary program for the Federal taxpayers that I represent. Federal taxpayers that I represent, I believe, are ultimately going to be on the hook for the liabilities and the commitments that are made either explicitly or implicitly through the language of this bill. 
   I urge a great sense of caution not to get caught up in the emotion of this, but to be clear-eyed and clear-thinking in how we debate this, and ultimately to oppose this bill in its current form.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I had previously presented or put at the desk 11 amendments to the manager's amendment that I am not going to be offering this afternoon. Instead, and in the interest of time, since I wasn't seeking roll calls on them, anyway, I just raise a series of questions that I am putting forward in good faith. They have been brought to my attention by our staff. Some you may have answers for; some you may have contemplated. Others you may say, let's think through that a little further, because my sense is, while the House is about to act, this is still very much a work in progress on Capitol Hill when it goes to the other Chamber. 
   The first question I had is the term ``capital liquidity shortage.'' It is a term that is used exclusively in the text of the bill itself, but it is not defined anywhere else. It is not a legal term of art that I am aware of. We have done some Google searches on the Internet, and it is a phrase that is unique to this bill. It is not defined. 
   My concern is that it could create, really, the maximum liability that could be incurred at any time. I am wondering if the gentleman from Florida is open to further defining ``capital liquidity shortage''? 
   And I will be happy to yield.

   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentleman. 
   Another term is the term ``commercially reasonable rate.'' It is also not defined anywhere, and I would just submit that is another area that we ought to be looking at. 
   The other notion is that State programs should be required to charge actuarially sound rates and build up reserves based on a 1-in-200 year standard used elsewhere in the manager's amendment. My concern is we run into a situation like we have with the flood insurance program. We should learn from that mistake. 
   The weakness of the flood insurance program was that it contemplated simply anticipating the actual output, as it were, the actual claims, rather than thinking from an actuarial point of view where you contemplate the unanticipated. The way we have to do this, the way this process has to be set up, is it has to literally anticipate the unanticipated. And the way the manager's amendment is currently crafted, it doesn't do that. In other words, it doesn't allow the building up of reserves over a period of time so that the fund itself is actuarially sound and that it can sustain an unexpected loss, the massive storm, the unbelievable event that is literally not contemplated. 
   There are two things that are inconsistent within the bill, it seems to me. There is this lower view of contemplation of what you can build up. But it also says you have to pass on the savings to the consumer. So, literally, the fund is not able to build up the reserves that are necessary in anticipation of what can't be anticipated. 
   With that, I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Finally, I would also like to draw attention to the notion of, sort of what I am characterizing in my fear as that repayment is a myth fear. 
   Under the manager's amendment, if a State program is somehow going to incur losses that exceeds its maximum liabilities, shouldn't it have to show how it is going to prevent that in the future? And there is no point in the manager's amendment where there is that reporting requirement. Again, I don't think that is onerous. I don't think it is difficult, but I think it would be a good idea to require a State before they make a claim or before they default to come forward and say, look, this is how we are going to avoid this in the future. I think it is a de minimis reporting requirement. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Florida.

   Another observation is that States should pay the cost of the consortium. Now, as drafted, the cost of the consortium is by Federal taxpayers. There is no payment mechanism in the manager's amendment for the consortium to be funded by the States. I think that is an oversight and it should be revisited. 
   The manager's amendment sets up $120 million over 6 years, I think, but I think there should be a way for the States to pony up. At least theoretically you can contemplate where the Federal Government would create this consortium, and maybe nobody's in. At that point it would be a foolish enterprise. I think there has to be a way. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Finally, on the basis of time, and I will be happy to continue the conversation with you and the chairman, in my view, I think the grace period for States is too long for their mitigation efforts. For those States currently with a program in place, the manager's amendment says all of these mitigation components are excellent, but we are going to give you 5 years to get your act together. 
   My suggestion would be let's shorten that up. Let's make it 2 years, and I think that is still very gracious, to follow on the word of grace. But 5 years is almost the length of the entire program that is being proposed. That is a suggestion regarding a way that I think the bill can be improve. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Today I offer an amendment essential to stopping this Congress from running down a road that I've expressed caution about earlier today, and that is causing further government involvement in self-sufficient, available, and reliable private markets. 
   Congress recently passed the National Flood Insurance Reform; and while I didn't agree with the wind provision inclusion, it made crucial strides in reducing damage from flooding and storms, especially in areas suffering repeat events. However, H.R. 3355 does not specifically prescribe mitigation guidelines. In title II, it merely alludes to Treasury providing a general directive; and, in my view, that's not good enough. 
   Currently, H.R. 3355 only requires the reinsurance fund receiving the loan to provide coverage for properties that adhere to applicable State building codes, leaving open the possibility that States with substandard codes, or even lacking codes, can still access the loans. 
   Instead, Treasury should be required to certify that the State has implemented best practices building codes for the applicable exposures, taking into account the State's geography, catastrophe risk and building patterns, which is what my amendment does here today. 
   This would not be a national building code, but rather, a regionally specific criteria for program participation. 
   The language in my amendment also gives broad flexibility to the Treasury to certify whether State building codes are appropriate for the types of risks they face. It doesn't apply specific, bureaucratic and unreachable one-size-fits-all standards for the Treasury to abide by. 
   The language is necessary because the current language in the bill would create an implicit guarantee that would result in an inequitable Federal subsidy for certain State insurance programs and policyholders, thus creating no need for local municipalities and developers to stop development in risk-prone areas. This was made very clear during the testimony that we heard in the hearings several weeks ago. 
   The further subsidization of rates would undermine economic incentives to mitigate risks. Individuals facing subsidized rates would be encouraged to take on risks that are inappropriate, specifically putting themselves in harm's way because they don't bear the full weight of the potential damages. 
   Now, I represent citizens from Illinois, and we would never choose to participate in this program. And let me tell you, the view from Lombard, Illinois, is very different from Key West, and God bless the folks that live in Key West, but I don't think that the residents I represent should be in a position to subsidize someone else's view. 
   Why should Illinois bail out States that can't address their own problems? While I'm sensitive and I admire my colleagues from Florida, I do believe that some of this is simply an exacerbation of government programs that have completely failed. Many other States have taken into account and addressed market issues based on increasing private market participation. 
   South Carolina introduced policyholder or catastrophe savings accounts to assist consumers and address cost issues. Louisiana and South Carolina addressed rating and regulatory matters by encouraging greater competition among insurers rather than rate controls that discourage private market competition. Louisiana has committed financial incentives for insurers to underwrite or take policies from the residual market and write-in coastal areas. Several States have also improved building codes and their enforcement as part of the long-term solution to catastrophic risk. 
   Floods are the majority of disasters that my congressional district faces, and we haven't sat by and waited for the government to help. The State of Illinois has one of the strongest floodplain management programs in the country. Illinois leads all Midwest States for the number of NFIP-participating communities, flood insurance policies, and flood insurance claims. Illinois outpaces the other States in local floodplain assistance, mitigation activities, and flood control projects. 
   Specifically, two cities in my district, Des Plaines and Mt. Prospect, were badly hurt by floods in August of this year. But they didn't suffer as much as they could have, because they are moving forward on major flood mitigation efforts by building levees on the Des Plaines River. This project will move hundreds of homes and businesses out of the floodplain, thus reducing the amount of damage during flood season and lowering insurance rates for homeowners. 
   There's been an unprecedented population growth and significant development in coastal and disaster-prone areas in recent decades, and total property exposures have increased dramatically.  
   We certainly cannot anticipate what storms will be like in the future, but we can and should take steps to reduce and lessen these risks. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, this is what I characterize as the skin-in-the-game amendment. 
   The bill currently has no retained loss requirement for participating State reinsurance funds before they can get a catastrophic loan from the Treasury. Once the trigger is met, a fund may qualify for a loan without having any skin in the game. 
   To improve fiscal accountability, States should be required to first sustain a loss before receiving a loan from Treasury, similar to paying deductible in an insurance policy. The loans could be better put to use helping States manage their losses above the retained loss requirement. 
   This amendment says that before a State insurance fund can access one of the loans created in the bill, it must first retain sufficient losses amounting to a 1-in-100-year event with respect to State catastrophe perils. This amendment will encourage State funds to handle a predictable level of loss before putting Federal taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars in catastrophic loans. 
   With no retained loss requirements, State insurance funds will have no incentives to price their risk with a catastrophe factor but, instead, rely on post-event debt financing from the Federal Government and Federal taxpayers. Adding the retained loss requirement in this bill will also encourage States to utilize the global reinsurance market instead of turning directly to the Federal Government to capitalize their funds. 
   Currently, Florida is the only State with a reinsurance fund that would qualify under this bill. The bill would undoubtedly spur the creation of other State funds, and requiring States to have skin in the game will encourage these new funds to properly capitalize instead of taking out a huge loan from the Feds after every natural catastrophe. 
   Without loss requirements, State insurance funds will have no incentives to actuarially price their risk since they will be getting cheap loans to assist them in paying their claims. 
   I urge the adoption of the amendment and yield to the gentleman from Louisiana.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (COIN MODERNIZATION AND TAXPAYER SAVINGS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 5512, the Coin Modernization and Taxpayer Savings Act of 2008. 
   First, I would like to thank Chairman Frank, Chairman Gutierrez and my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Space) for bringing this important bill to the floor. And I would also like to thank Ranking Member Bachus for his support of my own coin content bill, H.R. 4036, the Cents and Sensibility Act, which I introduced with Mr. Castle of Delaware. 
   Madam Speaker, last year, I took my son to visit the Denver Mint in Colorado, and there we discovered during our tour that the cost of a penny was--actually what the gentleman from Illinois just referred to--1.7 cents, the cost to the government to make each single penny. And that's obviously more than it's worth. At current production rates, the Federal Government spends more than $134 million to produce eight billion pennies annually at a loss of $54 million to the taxpayer. It makes no sense. 
   Two years ago last Thursday, when I was not yet a Member of this body, the U.S. Mint sent to Congress a letter stating what my son and I discovered on our trip. And since then, a whole lot of nothing has happened. And I think, frankly, the Mint has been a little bit remiss in not bringing up a thoughtful suggestion on cost cutting. This bill will address the short-term problem of the costly penny and I believe the longer term issues of what circulating coins should be made of. 
   I've got to say I'm flattered in a way in that there are elements of this bill that have taken some of the elements of the bill that I introduced. So when H.R. 5512 was introduced, this bill, in other words, it was done so with some of the provisions that I was pleased to offer. The most important point is to immediately change the composition of the penny from copper-coated zinc to copper-coated steel. This change would slash the cost to make the penny. 
   For several years, Canada, our neighbors to the north, have been saving money producing its one cent coin, which is essentially identical to the U.S. penny, out of steel in this manner, originally in the same Tennessee plant in which our penny blanks are made. This provision blends an enormous cost-saving opportunity with ensuring that the content of the penny remains metal and securing American jobs that currently produce the penny. 
   Two other provisions from my bill are included in H.R. 5512, that is, the provision giving the Mint explicit authority to do research and development with outside firms on potential coin content, an authority that the Mint says now is ambiguous, and this bill takes away that ambiguity. And secondly, requiring regular reports from the Mint to the Congress on production cost trends and strategies to reduce costs, Madam Speaker, either with different content or different production techniques, either one. 
   These two provisions will ensure that the Mint is performing its due diligence in a timely manner and keeping the cost of production of all circulating coins down while maintaining communication with those who currently are involved in the industry on the production, supply and research sides. 
   Madam Speaker, without wanting to be overly critical of the Mint, let me just point out that I think that they have not done exactly as I think would be wise as it relates to solving this cost production problem. It sent legislation here proposing to transfer power from Congress to the Mint on the authority to decide what coins should be made of, what they would weigh, authority explicitly held by Congress since the founding of this country. 
   More recently, the Mint has criticized the bill before us because it would force the Mint to continue making coins out of metal. I don't know about your constituents, Madam Speaker, but I can guess, along with mine, that they're not interested in having coins made out of plastic, and even less enthusiastic if they found out that the decision to switch had been made by a few unelected bureaucrats in a gray building somewhere in Washington, DC. This is our responsibility to make these decisions. And worse, if such a switch were made the wrong way, it could force billions in conversion costs onto coin handlers, vending machines and banks, that would eventually be passed onto customers. 
   As a Member representing the Land of Lincoln, Madam Speaker, I'm pleased that H.R. 5512 satisfies the need to reduce the cost to taxpayers, retains American jobs, all the while preserving the small one cent coin that has been the foundation of our economic system since its inception. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. First of all, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership and for his willingness to listen and for his thoughtful approach on this and for how he has brought, really, a bipartisan group together in trying to drive towards a solution. 
   Since coming to Congress, I've noticed that, many times, what we need to do is to spend time bringing statutes up to date, and this is just one of those examples. We've been struggling over these past several days with the financial markets and, in many cases, with a regulatory environment that isn't regulating properly. Well, here is an  opportunity for us to be proactive and to bring a regulation up to date to really deal with current needs. Giving the Surface Transportation Board the authority to consider a couple of things, I think, is very thoughtful and very wise and very measured. This is what this bill is about. 
   It says that the Surface Transportation Board in these transactions has to consider a couple of things. It has to consider the impact on safety and the environment. It has to consider the impact of grade crossings, of HAZMAT, of emergency response time, and of noise. In my view, those are not unreasonable requests. It doesn't predetermine an outcome. It doesn't say what they need to do with that information, but it says, as a matter of record, that they have to consider that. 
   Now a word about Canadian National: Whether or not Canadian National decided to show up at a hearing is really their prerogative. I just confirmed with the chairman that they were welcomed to show up. This is a pattern, frankly, that we've seen with Canadian National in our community where we were told they would show up at any time and at any place to talk to anyone, but when a forum was created, they waived off of that. 
   Now let's just set that aside. Here we have a chance to create a statute that says, if you're going to increase rail traffic through a community, you've got to consider the cost, and you've got to consider the cost on the community. 
   The gentlelady from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) spoke a couple of minutes ago about the cost of one of these rail crossings and of the cost of a grade separation. They are a thing to behold, and they are incredibly expensive. The fact that Canadian National in this particular case has several tens of millions of dollars on the table doesn't anywhere near answer the cost to local taxpayers who would be asked to bear the burden with very little benefit. 
   So I think the chairman's approach on this--the way he has brought a bipartisan group together around it and the thoughtfulness of it and, really, the holistic way that this would be evaluated--is a very light touch, in fact, and he is not coming down with a heavy hand. I am strongly supportive of it.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2358, the Native American $1 Coin Act, and urge its immediate passage. 
   The legislation before us is essentially identical to a bill that passed the House in June by a voice vote, with minor changes made by the other body. H.R. 2358 complements the Presidential $1 Coin Act that passed in the last Congress thanks to the hard work and leadership of the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney). Like that program and the very popular 50-State quarter program, it will provide an enormous educational opportunity for parents and teachers, while also recognizing the immense and important contributions of Native Americans to the history of the United States. Passage of this legislation also could save taxpayers more than half a billion dollars over the next decade. 
   When Congress passed the Presidential $1 Coin Act in December of 2005, it contained a requirement that a third of all dollar coins minted each year bear the design of the Sacagawea coin that first was issued in 2000. The requirement was intended to keep the image and the memory of Sacagawea in people's minds while the mint issues presidential dollars. 
   Unfortunately, through no fault of the design or its subject, there is no real demand for the dollar coin with an unchanging design. At the current rate of issue of presidential coins, the mint would have to make 300 to 350 million of the current design Sacagawea dollars every year, resulting in some $60 million of material and labor costs per year, not counting storage for the unused coins. 
   Under H.R. 2358, the current Sacagawea design would appear on the front of 20 percent of all dollar coins. Similar to the changing design of quarters and presidential dollars, the reverse of the Sacagawea coin would be different each year, honoring such contributions to American history as the Iroquois Confederacy, the Cherokee written language, the code talkers who served the U.S. Army so heroically in both world wars, and individuals such as Olympian Jim Thorpe. 
   Let me close by congratulating the lead sponsor of the legislation, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) and by thanking Chairman Frank for bringing the bill to the floor today. I urge passage of H.R. 2358, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his leadership on this issue.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise today in strong support of House Resolution 552, a measure calling on the government of the People's Republic of China to remove barriers to the United States financial service firms doing business in China. And I'm pleased to partner with Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Marshall) on what I think is a really important initiative. 
   Some of my prepared remarks, Mr. Speaker, would be cumulative in light of the gentleman's remarks, but let me just kind of fill in some other aspects and highlight a couple of the points that he made. 
   First of all, these are all commitments that the Chinese Government has made. This is not negotiating a new set of agreements. This is not contemplating something that hasn't literally been agreed to before. All we're doing in this resolution is putting the Chinese Government on notice, A, that we're watching; and, B, that we have expectation that they're going to do exactly what they committed themselves to do. 
   Secondly, you know, if you look at what the gentleman from Georgia described, that is, the Chinese economy, there are some that suggest that of 1.3 billion individuals, Mr. Speaker, only 1 million Chinese individuals currently have use of credit cards in China, compared to 480 million people who have access to cell phones. 
   Now, if you begin to think about where this can go, right now the Chinese economy is somewhat held back in a way, because the Chinese consumers and the Chinese financial markets don't have these kinds of tools, and they have a savings rate that almost takes our breath away. About a third of the savings, you know, they're saving at about 33 percent, which, what does that mean? That means that those dollars or that currency is not available to purchase things, particularly from the United States, which, as the gentleman pointed out, creates a very difficult situation in terms of our trade deficit. 
   I view the Chinese economy almost like a potted plant, Mr. Speaker; a plant that, at first glance, may look to be flourishing, but over a period of time, as that plant matures, and as it develops, it reaches a point at which the roots need to go deeper. And I think that this is the point in the Chinese economic growth where China's roots need to go deeper. They need to go deeper into the ground. And our financial services sector, Mr. Speaker, is robust and dynamic, and offers something that I think is a great opportunity. 
   But the unnatural truncating, the unnatural prohibition of the Chinese Government of prohibiting American firms to come in, I think, ultimately has a negative impact on our economy, has a negative impact on our growth, and certainly has a negative impact on the 700 million people who are in China and who are still living in poverty. 
   And I just want to highlight an aspect of this that has an impact on my district, because I represent a district outside of Chicago that employs about 68,000 individuals, about 1,100 manufacturing firms, who are really suffering and struggling based on the currency manipulation issue that the gentleman outlined. This is a way out. This is a way to move forward. And I think it is incumbent upon us, and I very much appreciate the gentleman's work on this in a bipartisan way. It is incumbent upon us to move forward and to urge and cajole and push and give a sharp word to the Chinese Government that they need to make these reforms and do these things to which they've previously committed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO UNITED STATES FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I don't have any additional speakers. Let me just yield myself another minute or two just to say this in closing. 
   We have before us, really, two competing economic systems that are playing out essentially. We have our system, which has a very high view of the individual, free people making free decisions within a free market. That is the great strength of the American system. We show great deference and great respect to the free market on balance. 
   China, however, is in some sort of transition right now, where they've not had that high view of the individual. They've not had that high view of the free market, and they're beginning this process of more or less dabbling in it. This is the call for them to stop the dabbling, as it relates to the financial services sector, and to fully embrace those things, those concepts that they propound around the world.     
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (ADVANCED FUELS INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, like so many others who have come to the floor today, I rise in support of the underlying bill, H.R. 547. The underlying measure, without question, is one that is worthy of our support.  
   All of us, many of us in the course of our journeys to come here, gained the confidence of the electorate by talking about alternative energies and alternative fuel sources. I come from Illinois, which ranks second in corn production and is one of the leading producers of ethanol. In my district, I have over 140,000 residents who are directly employed in manufacturing, and they would greatly benefit from having clean fuels, that is, moving products around. 
   But as I was evaluating and meeting with my staff to talk about the underlying bill, there was a word that kept popping up in the analysis and that was a key word, new, N-E-W. 
   I know that in the course of my journey to come here, one of the things that I heard consistently throughout the course of the campaigning was that my constituents, Mr. Chairman, wanted us to live within our means. And so the amendment that I have offered is very, very simple. It directs the EPA that $10 million authorized for these three new programs that don't currently exist, created under the bill, would have to come from funds that are already appropriated. It is the simple measure of pay-as-you-go. You see, we don't get it both ways. We don't get to act as if we are fiscally disciplined, and yet at the first opportunity, not act fiscally disciplined. 
   My dad has a phrase that he communicated to me over and over and over when I was growing up and that was this. He said, ``Life is choices,'' and I think we have a choice today to make. This is our first opportunity, with this open rule, to amend a new program that we have seen created in the 110th Congress. We didn't have that opportunity in other bills that have come along. But this is our first opportunity. 
   A $10 million appropriation, Mr. Chairman, or a $10 million authorization, is comparatively small, if you compare it to the overall EPA budget of $7.7 billion. It is less than one-tenth of 1 percent. But my argument is simple: that we need to show the American taxpayers that they can have confidence in us in these comparatively small programs, so that as we move in and continue through this Congress, as new programs are considered, that they are within the context of fiscal discipline. 
   Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment today to focus the House's attention on it and to bring the attention of the Nation to it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   It strikes me that everything the gentleman has said is actually consistent with the underlying amendment. 
   The amendment that is before the House simply says that it needs to make priorities and make those priorities clear. I take the gentleman at face value that the underlying program and the underlying $10 million is worthy of investment. But we don't get to have it both ways, it seems to me.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) with his passion and his clarity really, but really want to urge a little bit of caution. And I think the reason for caution was on display today in the House Financial Services Committee on a different issue. We had some hearings on some oversight as it relates to the $700 billion bailout. And it was really, in my hearing, and during the time that I was there and watching on television also, it was really overwhelming to watch Members of Congress talking to members of the administration and almost talking past one another, you know, interpreting things differently, and I don't think that's what the legislation meant and so forth and so on. And so here we are $700 billion later, and administration and Capitol Hill talking past one another. And I think we're on the verge of doing that same thing here if we're not careful, because I represent a district, the western suburbs of Chicago, with a lot of auto supply manufacturers. But there's no guarantee that that money that we're contemplating tonight is going to get to the folks in my district. There's no guarantee that the type of pressure that has been put on the auto manufacturers is going to come to fruition and actually come up with something good. 
   What happened to the December 2 deadline? What happened to the December 2 moratorium by which there was going to be a new declaration and a new plan? And it has now been postponed now to the end of the first quarter. 
   So clearly, there is an urgency here to work. Clearly, there is an urgency to get something done. But heaven help us if we pass the same type of statute that was enacted with such urgency only 2 months ago.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, we are here to debate a House Concurrent Resolution, and the root verb of ``resolution'' is resolute. I just want to challenge the House today to consider the resolution of our enemies. I would like to read three quotes to you. 
   Resolved, by Samba bin Laden. The whole world is watching this war, and the two adversaries, the Islamic nation on the one hand and the United States and its allies on the other. It is either victory and glory or misery and humiliation. 
   Or how about this? Resolved, in the al Agenda charter: There will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in Allah. We will not meet the enemy halfway, and there will be no room for dialogue with them. 
   Or how about this, and I am paraphrasing: Resolved, from Samba bin Ladens deputy, who said that the plan is to extend the jihad wave; to expel the Americans from Iraq and extend the jihad wave to secular countries neighboring Iraq, clash with Israel and establish an Islamic authority. 
   Is there anybody among us who doubts the resolve and clarity with which our opponents are speaking? I don't. 
   I think what is lacking today in our conversation is the consequences of failure. The previous speaker used the words ``victory'' and ``success.'' He had a very low view of them, and I understand his characterization of those words. He said we have heard those words before. That is what the gentleman from New Jersey said. 
   But, do you know what? We will hear the word ``failure'' when it is used in the context of this challenge that is before us. 
   There is no question that there has been great difficulty that has gone before us in this fight. There is no question that there have been great mistakes that have been made, and I am wholeheartedly in favor of us acting as a coequal branch of government and calling for benchmarks and demarcation and holding the administration accountable for its decisions. 
   But if we fail in this, if we pull out, if we retreat, if we yield, what will happen? Is there anybody really who thinks that Iran, for example, will be less provocative? Is there anybody who thinks that al Agenda will be less provocative? 
   If we fail, extremism in this world, will it be ascendant or will it be descendant? 
   Madam Speaker, I close with a simple question, and that is, we need to ask, What is it about this resolution that will do one of two things? Does this encourage our troops, or does this discourage our enemies? I would suggest that this resolution, while it is serious, oh, it is very serious, it is not substantive. This is the ultimate expression of legislative passive aggression. It offers no substantive alternative. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition, and ask my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSKAM. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSKAM. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, listening to the debate, I appreciate the tone and even the urgency with which Congress is wrestling with this, and there is no question as you look into this bill there are some good elements to it. But there are some substantive reforms to GSEs that I think we can all come around. There are some elements that are very distasteful, from my point of view, and they have been articulated well. And as the chairman has said, there is even a time to put aside some of that and to all come together. 
   But there is, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker, an element to this bill that isn't just slightly distasteful but it's a deal breaker. And that's the blank check within this bill. When the Secretary of the Treasury came in and briefed a number of us, he said that they wanted this authority to move forward, an unprecedented amount of authority, and then almost in the next breath--I don't want to overly characterize what he said--but almost in the next breath he said, ``But don't worry. We'll never use it.'' 
   Well, I think that should give us all a reason to pause. The notion of giving a blank check to anyone for any circumstance is an idea that I think is a deal breaker, and we will rue the day that we gave that kind of authority away. I find it ironic that the other side of the aisle that has pounded on this President for the past 7 years as being an almost imperial President is willing to yield this type of authority to him and literally give him or anyone a blank check. 
   My predecessor, Henry Hyde, urged a great deal of caution at what he characterized as the greased chute of government. And this is the greased chute of government moving very, very quickly. 
   I urge us to pause. I urge us not to give a blank check to anyone. We can do much better than this.
