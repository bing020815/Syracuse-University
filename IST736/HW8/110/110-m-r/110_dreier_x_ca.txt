<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (RELATING TO THE HOUSE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN SECTION 803 OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Let me begin by expressing my appreciation to my good friend, my Rules Committee colleague from Fort Lauderdale, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. And I have to say that I rise in strongest possible opposition to this rule. Only under this new majority, Mr. Speaker, could an attempt to ensure fiscal responsibility be described as nothing more than a procedural gimmick, and only under this new majority, Mr. Speaker, can we once again be taking action that totally subverts what we're all about here, and that is an open and fair debate. 
   At issue today is a provision enacted by Republicans to ensure that Medicare is administered in an effective and a responsible way. When we created the prescription drug benefits for seniors, we included a provision to require regular reports on how Medicare is funded. We wanted to know, is the Medicare trust fund sufficient to cover the costs? Or are we drawing from the general Treasury to pay for it? And if we are, how much? If two consecutive reports indicated that over 45 percent of Medicare's costs would come from the general Treasury over the next 7 years, Congress would have to act. We did not mandate what steps Congress would have to take. We simply required that solutions be examined, debated and brought to a vote, something that seems to be anathema to this new majority. 
   We believed this provision was critically important because we, as Republicans, have two very important goals for Medicare.     
   First, it must effectively provide health care coverage for our seniors. Second, Mr. Speaker, it must be run efficiently and responsibly. 
   Today we are confronting exactly the scenario that concerned us and led to this point. We have had two consecutive reports indicating that Medicare will exceed the cost threshold for years to come. In accordance with the law, the President submitted a proposal to restore fiscal discipline while ensuring that seniors continue to receive high quality care. Under the rules of the House, we are approaching the deadline to consider the proposal. But this new majority leadership, unable or unwilling to address runaway costs, simply wants to make this attempt at good governance go away, completely vanish. The rule before us today would quash the provision requiring us to consider a legislative fix. It allows runaway entitlement spending to continue unabated. 
   Naturally, our good friends on the other side of the aisle are going to try to distract us from the facts today. 
   They are going to rail against the circumstances, as we have already heard from my friend from Fort Lauderdale surrounding the original prescription drug vote in an attempt to obscure the real issue. This is a favorite trick of theirs, Mr. Speaker. The Democratic majority leadership cannot defend their own actions, so they stir up fights about Republicans. They can thunder away about 5-year-old fights all they want, but it won't absolve them of the actions that they are trying to take here today. Today they are in charge. They are responsible for their actions as the majority. They cannot distract the American people from the fact when they were presented with a proposal for reforming the cost of Medicare, they decided to change the rules and ignore the problem. That's exactly what is happening here. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a legislative fix that was submitted by the President of the United States and introduced by the majority and the minority leaders as required by the fiscal discipline procedures put into place by Republicans in this important bill. It recommends two steps to rein in skyrocketing costs. One, it lowers the government subsidy for prescription drug coverage for high-income seniors to save $3.2 billion over 5 years. Second, it reforms the medical liability system and puts patients before trial lawyers, saving nearly $4 billion. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I don't know that that is the panacea, but those are a good start and those are the proposals that the majority leader and the minority leader introduced as required under this law. 
   I know some people may not like those savings. Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle are enamored with the present liability system and believe that we need more litigation, not less. Others may feel that everyone, regardless of income, should get the full prescription drug subsidy. 
   There may be disagreement on these issues, but they are worthy of consideration and debate, which is what this institution is all about. Debate is exactly what was envisioned by this proposal. It provided for at least ten separate alternatives, each debatable for up to an hour. My friend is absolutely right, it could take 10 hours, but God forbid we spend 10 hours discussing an issue as important as this. We imposed no restrictions. Any proposal for reining in costs could be considered and debated. This is a foreign concept in the 110th Congress, but we actually believe that open, rigorous debate is the key to finding solutions to our most difficult challenges. 
   Unfortunately, the rule before us today continues a very troubling pattern: the Democratic majority leadership would rather duck and cover than stand and deliver on a very important issue for the American people. 
   In case the American people haven't noticed, Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives has been locked in a legislative holding pattern. We have at least five appropriations bills which have been ordered reported by the Appropriations Committee. How many  have been considered on the floor during this very important traditional appropriation month? Not a single one. Zero. Nada. None. 
   The same is true for real energy legislation. Oh, we've had fig leaves on the floor like the one we had just a couple of hours ago. But the majority is not interested in debate on these measures. They bring controversial energy legislation that no one has ever seen to the floor, and then they impose ultra-restrictive rules so that Republicans, or Democrats, cannot offer their own ideas. 
   These flawed bills fail, of course, but the Democrats get to avoid a real debate on the important issues of conservation, alternative energy sources, and yes, new domestic supplies of oil. 
   This pattern continues today with this rule. Instead of having a real debate on legislation to reform the Medicare program, we are using the rules to completely avoid the program altogether. 
   The reason, Mr. Speaker, is simple. The Democratic majority leadership is more concerned about protecting their Members from tough votes than engaging in the honest and open debate they promised the American people when they won the majority nearly 2 years ago. They are more interested in maintaining their electoral fortunes than tackling the tough business of actually governing. 
   Now if press reports are to be believed, the Democratic majority plans to avoid the most basic responsibility we have as legislators: making decisions about our spending priorities. Instead of doing the business of passing appropriations bills and considering legislation on key issues like how we can get gasoline prices down and how we deal with Medicare, they are going to punt all of the tough choices until the next administration. I am just shaking my head and asking, Mr. Speaker, what is it that we are doing here and what is it that we are afraid of when it comes to doing our work in this 110th Congress? 
   We have an opportunity right here and right now to break this pattern. If we defeat this rule, we can have a real debate on alternatives to reform Medicare spending. We can start the business of governing and have a real debate on the real issue of fiscal responsibility, which is exactly what this provision is all about. 
   But if we pass this rule, it is another blow to responsible government. It is another example of how far the Democratic majority leadership has fallen from the principles that they ran on and promised the American people nearly 2 years ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and vote ``no'' on this rule.

   I have got to say that before I do, Mr. Speaker, we have the Committee on the Budget, Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, the Rules Committee, all of which have jurisdiction on this. We've been limited to 30 minutes of debate on this side, and I just wondered if he might be interested in propounding a unanimous consent request that we extend the debate by maybe 5 minutes on each side.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 20 seconds to say to my friend that we have been constantly arguing that we're willing to sit down and talk about this and debate these issues at any time. And we're willing, and the two top dogs on the Ways and Means Committee have both said they're willing to do that; and we've been willing all along. And that's exactly what this provision is all about. 
   The fact of the matter is the tax cuts that have been put into place dramatically surge the flow of revenues to the Federal Treasury. We all know that. And we have a responsibility to look at anything we possibly can to bring about a fiscally responsible Medicare program and we're going to do that. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 1 minute to my very good friend from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).

   Mr. DREIER. Let me say, Mr. Speaker, that we very clearly have an opportunity before us. We have an opportunity to defeat this rule so that we can do what it is that we came here to do. We have had a wide range of recommendations that have come here from the Medicare commission. And we have a proposal that is before us submitted by the majority leader and the minority leader as required under this law. It made two very important recommendations dealing with liability reform in ways which we could bring about fiscal responsibility of Medicare. That's what our charge is. That is what our job is as Members of the United States Congress. 
   The action that we are about to take in this House is to simply sweep it under the rug and pass off to the future what we were sent here to do right now. We're rapidly approaching the date by which time we need to begin taking action. That is July 30. And our colleagues, unfortunately, have chosen to turn their back on those who want to bring about a fiscally responsible solution to a challenge that we all know is looming. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat this rule so that we can move ahead and do the right thing for our seniors and for future generations. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1528, NEW ENGLAND NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I'd like to express my great appreciation to my very good friend and Rules Committee colleague, the gentleman from Atwater, California, who so ably represents his constituents here, is beginning his second session as a member of the Rules Committee, and I will say that it is great to welcome a fellow Californian to the Rules Committee. 
   But, Madam Speaker, at first blush one looks at this bill and it is, as I think was really reflected in the gentleman's remarks, sort of innocuous and noncontroversial. I mean, it's a pretty simple measure. New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act, who can be opposed to that? I mean, who could be concerned about that? 
   It certainly wouldn't be the first time in the 110th Congress that we have had a measure brought up with a rule that could have very easily been considered under suspension of the rules. After all, today so far we have under suspension of the rules passed a bill that provided a $150 billion economic stimulus to our Nation's economy, an issue which I'm very proud to say, as we all are, that saw the two parties come together, working with the White House in a bipartisan way to make sure that we could have this economic stimulus package. And I hope and pray that it mitigates the economic challenges that our constituents are facing in the future. 
   And then, Madam Speaker, we move from there to consider the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, an extension of that, as we worked on the issue of reform. And so here we've dealt with the economic stimulus and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, both measures considered under suspension of the rules, and now we have a rule for consideration of the New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act. 
   I think my point is that this is a measure that very easily could have been considered under suspension of the rules, and we understand that there is an attempt to fill the schedule and there were people who quipped about that last night up in the Rules Committee. It is unfortunate. I know a number of other Members have already left. We didn't work today until noon; and we are in a position now, having begun working so late, that we're going into the night on this measure, which is a bill that initially, as I said, could have been completely noncontroversial and considered under suspension of the rules. 
   But I will say, having looked now at the measure, there are concerns that have been raised. They are concerns about private property rights and the threat of eminent domain. In fact, Madam Speaker, the State of New Hampshire opted out of the national designation because of these concerns. The people of New Hampshire believe that the trail running through their State is well managed and is in no need whatsoever of Federal intervention.     
   But the other States involved would like to move forward on the Federal designation, so we are here late this afternoon to consider this. 
   Now, as we proceed, we've simply asked that the concerns that have been raised see the light of day on the House floor; as I said, these concerns as they relate, first and foremost, with the issue of private property rights and eminent domain. 
   Unfortunately, while seven amendments were submitted to us in the Rules Committee, only two were made in order, two out of seven amendments submitted. And unfortunately, contrary to the promise that was made at the beginning of the 110th Congress by Speaker Pelosi that we would have a substitute made in order for legislation that's considered, a substitute that was proposed by Mr. Bishop was, in fact, denied by the Rules Committee. And why? I mean, I ask about the time constraints again. As I said, we didn't begin work today until noon. The House convened at noon. Our most critical business of the day, as I said, the stimulus bill and the FISA law, were considered under suspension of the rules. So, why the rush for us to proceed with this New England Scenic Trails bill? 
   There is really no practical reason why, Madam Speaker, now that we've decided to not take this up under suspension of the rules and have a debate, that we can't engage in a little extra debate to allow for the concerns to be vetted. And if we can't have an open debate on the issue of scenic trails, then one's got to ask, what issue will we have an open debate on? I mean, what hope is there for an open process for the most significant and the most controversial issues if we can't have it on the New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act? 
   Now, six amendments were submitted by our friend, former Rules Committee colleague, Mr. Bishop, addressing the private property rights issue. Four were rejected by the Rules Committee. A seventh amendment was offered by Mr. Flake that would explicitly prevent the use of earmarks in this bill. Now, Mr. Flake's amendment would have provided an opportunity to examine this bill's provision to direct unspecified Federal dollars to two private entities. Now, did any Members have a personal stake in these private groups, in these private entities? Did any Member make a specific request on behalf of these private entities? Mr. Flake's amendment would have helped to shed a little sunlight on this provision before we direct Federal taxpayer dollars towards two private groups. But this amendment was also rejected, Madam Speaker, unfortunately, by the Rules Committee. 
   Shutting out this amendment is, to me, probably the most troubling of all. Obviously, the issue of private property rights and eminent domain that Mr. Bishop has wanted to address and his four amendments that were denied is very, very troubling. But this issue of completely preventing Members from the opportunity for sunshine and disclosure on what could have been a request by a Member for support for two private organizations is very troubling. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, I've got to say that this issue itself gets right to the heart of one of the biggest challenges that we faced under the Democratic leadership in this place, and it is the inability or unwillingness to rein in wasteful earmarks. 
   Now, last week, we Republicans were meeting in West Virginia, and we spent a great deal of time talking about the issue of earmarks when our Republican conference came together. And I'm happy to say that, with a united front, Republicans came together on this issue and we decided that we would call for a moratorium on earmarks, a moratorium until a bipartisan committee can formulate a proposal that eradicates waste, fraud, and abuse in the earmark process. It's the so-called Kingston-Wolf-Wamp legislation that has been put forward. 
   Now, we offered to have a complete ban on earmarks, and we challenged our Democratic colleagues to join in with a bipartisan agreement to have a moratorium on earmarks until such time as this bipartisan committee can come forward. Now, Madam Speaker, as I see you in the chair, as I see my friend from Atwater, I suspect that either or both of you, and certainly a lot of your Members, are going to be going on to your retreat. The Democratic Caucus is, I know, going for a meeting that will be taking place over the next few days. And it's fun, but challenging, and great to have an opportunity for the two parties to work within their caucuses, your caucus, our conference, to deal with these issues. 
   Well, I would just like to say that, just as we did at our meeting last week, while far be it for me to be so presumptuous as to say I should set the agenda for the Democratic Caucus retreat, I would like to say that in light of the offer that we made coming forward as Republicans on this issue of earmarks, I would recommend that in  light of the discussion that came here on the floor today on this issue, the speech that was delivered last night from the President of the United States in which he called for cutting in half the number of earmarks saying that he would veto legislation if he didn't see it cut in half, the request that we have made on behalf of our constituents to say we should have this moratorium done in a bipartisan way, and we as Republicans are challenging our Democratic colleagues to do that, I would like to say that I hope very much that Members at your retreat would, rather than spending a lot of time on a number of other issues, I would hope that you would put partisanship aside and try to work, just as we did on this economic stimulus issue, in a bipartisan way to recognize the very, very pressing need for earmark reform and our proposal, which should, in fact, provide strong bipartisan support. 
   I will say, Madam Speaker, that the integrity and the effectiveness of this body depends on our agreement to proceed with very, very important bipartisan reform on this issue. It's my hope that my Democratic colleagues will use their upcoming retreat over the next few days as an opportunity to urge their leadership to accept our proposal to make a bipartisan effort to tackle this very, very critical issue. 
   Today's bill was perhaps a small but yet a significant opportunity to signal a newfound commitment to open process and meaningful earmark reform. Unfortunately, today's bill is a missed opportunity. I suspect that this measure will proceed. I don't think that we'll have the votes to defeat the previous question, which I should say I'm going to attempt to do, to defeat the previous question so that we can make in order what I would describe as the Marshall proposal, the proposal that has been put forward by one of our Democratic colleagues, Mr. Marshall, which is basically identical to the Boehner proposal that we have on earmark reform, which will provide a greater degree of transparency, accountability, disclosure, and enforcement on this issue, which unfortunately is not there. 
   So, when it comes to our attempt to defeat the previous question on this, what I will be offering is tantamount to a bipartisan proposal for our colleagues as we seek to address this issue. 
   So, again, I would say, Madam Speaker, if my colleagues had proceeded with this bill under a suspension of the rules, you would not have had to listen to the speech I just delivered because we would have done the exact same things as we did on the $150 billion economic stimulus bill, and we would have done the exact same thing as we did on the very important Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reform measure, and albeit simply an extension, the steps towards bringing about reform. 
   But in light of the fact that we are here, denying the opportunity for us to address the issue of private property rights and eminent domain, and the opportunity for the kind of transparency and disclosure that everyone around here talks about on the issue of earmarks that would have come forward in the amendment offered by our colleague, Mr. Flake, I'm going to encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we can make that earmark reform proposal in order. And if that is defeated, I will urge a ``no'' vote on the rule as we proceed with this. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to respond to my very dear friend from Atwater by saying a few things. 
   First, on this notion of Mr. Bishop's very able leadership position on the committee, my friend, who served with great distinction in the California State Legislature, knows very well that the legislative process is an ongoing process, and people work on amendments, people work on legislation in committee. And the fact that Mr. Bishop may have been working on some of the amendments that he is dealing with right now and did not offer them in the committee should in no way deny him the right to represent his constituents and the American people with one of his brilliant, new, and creative ideas that quite possibly developed from the markup to the Rules Committee and now to the floor. 
   So, I would argue that it is very important for us to do everything that we can to ensure the most open amendment process, which is what we were promised at the beginning of this Congress. 
   Second, Madam Speaker, I would say to my friend on this notion of the designation of earmarks, I will say that I am particularly proud of the fact that in the 109th Congress we dealt with stronger enforcement, we dealt with the issue of earmark authorization, tax bills, and appropriations bills. Now, I will recognize that the definition that  exists for earmarks in the 110th Congress is not nearly as strong as the definition that was put into place in the 109th Congress. Why? Because the gentleman is trying to argue right now that there are no earmarks in this bill. Well, I would argue that in the 109th Congress, based on the definition that we passed in this House and was implemented, that this would have been considered an earmark.     
   Now, I know that there is a lot of vagueness on this, but we do know the following: this is an authorization bill, and there are two private entities that are the beneficiaries of this. The gentleman may be absolutely right. It may be critically important to the New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act to have these items in there. It may be. Far be it from me to say that they shouldn't be there because I don't know at this point. All we're arguing is that we should, in fact, have the opportunity for our colleague, Mr. Flake, who spent a great deal of time dealing with the earmark issue, to come forward with his amendment so that we could debate it. That's what we are hoping for. 
   So I will say, Madam Speaker, that I believe that if we, as an institution, are serious about the issue of earmark reform, reining in wasteful Federal spending, we should, in fact, in a bipartisan way, in a bipartisan way, proceed with this moratorium until such time as the bipartisan committee can come back with a group of recommendations as to how we can again, in a bipartisan way, deal with this issue of earmark reform. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I would like to yield such time as he may consume to my very good friend from Utah, my former Rules Committee colleague (Mr. Bishop).

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume as we proceed with this debate on this authorization and earmark process. 
   I will acknowledge that based on this new and, I believe, rather unfortunate definition that is provided for earmarks, you have, in fact, seized a little loophole in trying to determine that these are not earmarks. 
   And I will tell you, Madam Speaker, what that loophole consists of. Not a specific dollar amount. Now, Madam Speaker, potentially this is even more egregious. Why? Because without a specific dollar amount, we don't know exactly how much is going to be expended. And Mr. Bishop has just given me a copy of the proposed blueprint budget; and, Madam Speaker, what that consists of is specific designation to these private entities. And in many ways, this is, as I said, more egregious than had a specific amount been put into place, which would have required this to have been considered as an earmark. 
   Madam Speaker, our quest is simply for more transparency, accountability, and disclosure of our constituents' hard-earned taxpayer dollars; and we believe very strongly that that should, in fact, be the case. Now, everyone says what I just said. Everyone says we want more transparency, accountability, and disclosure. Everyone says that we want to be great stewards of the taxpayer dollars, those dollars of our hardworking constituents. The fact is what we have got here is something that is potentially even worse than under the definition that you all have as an earmark. 
   So I will say that looking at this proposed blueprint budget makes it even more imperative that we do everything within our power to proceed with making sure that we defeat the previous question and make in order the earmark amendment that we are going to be offering, and I hope very much that my colleagues will join in doing that. 
   Madam Speaker, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question, as I have said, so that I can amend the rule to allow for consideration of H. Res. 479, the Boehner earmark enforcement rule changes. And don't fear, the amendment would not prevent the House from considering the New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act. It would merely allow the House to also consider the Boehner earmark reform proposal. 
   Over the first year of Democratic control, we have learned that the earmark rule does not apply when considering amendments between the Houses as well as a myriad of other legislative scenarios which were not contemplated when the new Democratic majority put through the so-called earmark reform rules. These loopholes, as I was saying earlier, have prevented numerous earmarks from being challenged in the energy bill, the State Children's Health Insurance Program expansion legislation, and the omnibus bill, which, as we all know, contained nearly 9,000 earmarks, including at least 150 earmarks that were air-dropped in the bill at the last minute. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, it's not just Republicans as I was saying in my opening remarks who have taken note of these earmark loopholes. Our colleague from Georgia (Mr. Marshall) recently introduced a virtually identical rules change geared at closing the air-drop loophole as well as the amendments between the Houses loophole.     
   Obviously, I believe it's about time for the Democratic majority to start listening not only to concerns that are emerging from those of us who serve in the minority, but from members of their own caucus on this issue as well. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment and extraneous material be inserted into the Record just prior to the vote on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I offer this motion to recommit to rectify what my Rules Committee colleague, the gentleman from Miami (Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart), eloquently described as an outrage. 
   What we have done in this measure is unprecedented, and we are undermining the goal that I think most all of us share of trying to have a responsible Federal backdrop to deal with the potential terrorist attack on our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the things that we all know is that certainty is absolutely essential when you are dealing with the issue of insurance. Now, we know that people can't run a business without insurance, people can't hire people without insurance, they can't build without insurance. Insurance is absolutely essential. But it is critical that certainty be provided and, unfortunately, it is not being provided under this measure. 
   I would like to quote the letter that was sent from our friend from New York (Mr. Ackerman) to Speaker Pelosi when he said, ``It is our strong belief, however, that making the entire program contingent on Congress passing a second piece of legislation completely undermines the intent and desired effect of the legislation. Under this proposal, policyholders would not know for certain whether their policies would pay out in the event of an attack and insurers could be placed in the unthinkable position of either not paying out on their policies or facing insolvency. The uncertainty that this proposed solution to the PAYGO problem would cause would render the legislation almost completely useless.'' 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, it is very, very important that that certainty be provided. Now, I have heard that there is a letter that has come from the Speaker to my friend from New York (Mr. Ackerman) that says this will be rectified. Well, Mr. Speaker, by passing this motion to recommit, we can guarantee that it will be rectified. We can guarantee that it will be rectified because we are in fact sending it back to the committee. 
   Why is it we are doing this promptly rather than forthwith? We know there are PAYGO problems that need to be addressed by this committee. The problem with what we have done is that in the name of trying to protect this poorly crafted PAYGO rule that was put into place at the beginning of the 110th Congress, we are waiving PAYGO. That is exactly what is happening here, Mr. Speaker. 
   So I urge my colleagues, if you in fact want a responsible Terrorism Insurance Act package, we need to recommit this bill to the committee so that they can come out with an even better work product than the one they have today. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote on the motion to recommit.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2761, TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, a week ago yesterday we marked the sixth anniversary of one of the most tragic days in our Nation's history, that being September 11, 2001. We all, in the wake of that tragedy, the likes of which we had never seen in our Nation's history, came together and united in a bipartisan way to deal with the aftermath of September 11 of 2001. One of the many things that we did was realize that we are a Nation at war, and in light of that, the private insurance industry, and I am a free marketeer, the private insurance industry needed to have some kind of Federal backdrop if another horrendous terrorist attack is thrust upon the American people. So I supported the notion of saying, you know what, when we are a Nation at war, the free market can't just automatically protect those who are victimized by that kind of attack. So I became a supporter of this and I worked on it early on and supported the extension of it. And as I stand here today, I still believe that we are a Nation at war and it is imperative that we do everything possible to ensure that we, the Federal Government, stand up and play the role that we have to in leading the fight. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, what we are doing with this rule is undermining something that Mr. Arcuri said in his opening remarks that this bill creates: certainty. Mr. Arcuri said that this bill creates certainty. Mr. Speaker, what we are doing with this self-executed provision in this rule, and my friend Mr. Ackerman from New York understands this very well, is we are completely obliterating any kind of certainty. 
   Now, this was designed as a mandatory program. Mandatory, why? Because if we face the attack, there needs to be certainty that the Federal Government is behind it. Now, I know that many people will say, oh, of course the Congress is going to take action, of course the Congress will do it. You know what, Mr. Speaker? That is not good enough for people who are investors, people who are in an industry that is responsible for dealing with the aftermath of the kind of attack that we saw on September 11. 
   That is why I believe it is absolutely imperative that we oppose this rule. We need to do everything that we can in a bipartisan way to defeat this rule. Why? Because we have been given this multipage, self-executing provision which undermines the jurisdiction of the Rules Committee. And that is why I am really hard pressed to believe that any member of the House Rules Committee, the traffic cop for this institution, I believe the single most important committee in this institution, how any member could basically cede the authority that we would have on this. And you look at the other committees of jurisdiction that are completely ignored, the Judiciary Committee. The Budget Committee clearly should be involved in this process. We need to have budget process reform. Our committee, our Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker, should be holding hearings on this. We should look at the issue of dynamic scoring. Yes, the hands of the Congressional Budget Office are tied because they have to look at 5- and 10-year projections. What we need to do is we need to bring about the kind of responsible reform that can ensure, that can ensure that we have the kind of certainty that is necessary. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I have got to say that I know that there is strong bipartisan concern about this issue. This is not the way to deal with it. I said if given a simple choice in the Rules Committee between a waiver of PAYGO, which is, I believe, a very flawed rule that was put into place at the beginning of this Congress, or this provision, this self-executing provision, sure, I'd prefer that waiver over that. But there has got to be another solution. And the reason is that this new Congress put into the rules this PAYGO provision, very well intentioned but very, very badly flawed, Mr. Speaker. So I think that if we look at what it is we are doing on this in the name of trying to avoid a waiver of PAYGO, this self-executing provision actually waives PAYGO completely.     
   And so I've got to tell you, this is a horrible rule; it is a horrible process; it is unprecedented. And I hope the Democrats and Republicans alike will join in saying, yes, we need to have a responsible terrorism risk insurance measure passed, but we need to come down with a provision that responsibly budgets that, and this is not it.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON RULES -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I think this is the first time in the 110th Congress that I have stood here taking out a 1-hour Special Order, and I don't do this very lightly and obviously I don't do it terribly often. But, Mr. Speaker, I am here to address an issue that, frankly, doesn't get a great deal of attention either in this House or among the American people. 
   Last week my very distinguished colleagues, with whom I am pleased to serve on the House Rules Committee on the minority side, the gentleman from Miami, FL, Lincoln Diaz-Balart; the gentleman from Pasco, WA, Doc Hastings; and the gentleman from Dallas, TX, Pete Sessions; and I came together. And we, after a great deal of research, have compiled a report and unveiled this. 
   This report, Mr. Speaker, is entitled ``Out of Order,'' and I would commend it to all of my colleagues. It is relatively short, about 10 or 11 pages, has got a number of graphs, and it is available for any one of our colleagues who would like to see this report. You can get it on the Web right now if you'd like, Mr. Speaker, at rules-republicans.house.gov. And I will repeat that again. It's rules-republicans.house.gov. 
   And what we are going to do, Mr. Speaker, over the next hour is we are going to hear about this report, and a number of our very distinguished colleagues who have, for lack of a better term, been victimized by the actions of this Rules Committee are going to share with our colleagues some of the experiences that they have had. 
   Now, one might say that we are here whining or complaining about our mistreatment. Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are here because the American people, Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike, were promised something much different than what they have gotten. We are not here to whine. We are not here to complain. We are here to fight on behalf of the American people's right to be heard, the right to ensure that our deliberative democracy is, in fact, that; that our process of representative democracy is able to flourish. And, tragically, if one looks at this report, over the last 9 months we have found that that has not, in fact, been the case. 
   Now, many might argue these guys want to just talk about process. Mr. Speaker, I say to my colleagues process is substance. It has been through this horrendous process that we have seen, in the farm bill, a massive tax increase that was written into place by the Rules Committee. We have found, through this Rules Committee, that they have prevented us from having the opportunity to bring gasoline prices down, and we all know that gasoline prices are incredibly high. How did they do that? By denying an opportunity for us to have an amendment that would have done what virtually everyone says is essential in our quest to reduce gasoline prices, and that is to increase refinery capacity. Unfortunately, the permitting process is so onerous that it has been literally decades since we have seen a new oil refinery put online. 
   What happened? Right upstairs, just one floor above where we are now, Mr. Speaker, we saw that process utilized to prevent us from having the ability to even have a vote on whether or not we would create the potential to increase refinery capacity. 
   And then in the dead of night, in the very dead of night on the so-called SCHIP bill, which virtually every single one of us want to make sure that poor kids are able to have access to health care, we want to do that, but we don't want us to proceed with something that was done in the dead of night at 1 o'clock in the morning by the Rules Committee, and that is take the Medicare Advantage program and basically throw that out the window, undermining the ability for senior citizens to have access to quality health care. 
   And so this notion of our, as some have liked to say, whining about process is not the case. We are here fighting on behalf of the American people so that we can have some success with the process of representing them as effectively as possible. 
   Now, we know that throughout the last couple of years and, in fact, at the beginning of this year, we, as Members of the United States House of Representatives, were promised an awful lot. And, Mr. Speaker, I know that often the other side will simply raise criticism about how we as Republicans managed this institution. And I have admitted that we have made mistakes. I admitted that we didn't do it perfectly. And I know we have three present members of the Rules Committee and one former member of the Rules Committee here, and I have acknowledged to them that we didn't do everything perfectly. 
   But I will say this, Mr. Speaker: our discussion here is not about what we did. It is about what Members of the new majority promised they were going to do. 
   I would like to share a couple of quotes, and we have got some charts here. I don't often use charts, Mr. Speaker, but I think it is important to point to some of the things that were said. 
   Here is a quote from Steny Hoyer, the majority leader. Let's look at this, Mr. Speaker. In testimony that he gave before the Rules Committee on June 23 of 2003, he said: ``Mr. Chairman,'' I guess he was addressing me at that point. He said: ``The lack of a free and fair debate on such important matters is an embarrassment to the Members who are privileged to serve here. It demeans this House. It cheats the American people, and it offends our democratic traditions.'' 
   So we were promised that there would be a new day, a new day when they became the majority. Let me just take a moment to look at the track record, and then I want to begin yielding to some of my colleagues. 
   In the last 9 months, this Rules Committee has issued more than double, in fact, many more than double the number of closed rules than our Republican majority Rules Committee did. Now, Mr. Speaker, for those of our colleagues who may not have been following this all that closely, it means no amendments and very limited debate. So we were promised this new open process that was denied in the past, and yet they have come forward with more than twice as many completely closed rules, shutting out any opportunity for amendment. 
   This Rules Committee has rejected more minority-sponsored amendments than the Rules Committee of the past did.     
   And Mr. Speaker, this Rules Committee has, unfortunately, reduced by a full day the amount of time that Members and their staff have to review the bills and to submit their amendments. So they promised that all this great deliberation was going to take place, and they've actually cut nearly in half the amount of time the Members have to review and look at and offer amendments to measures. 
   One of the most outrageous things of all, Mr. Speaker, one of the most outrageous policies to come forward is one which is a slap in the face at any American who has their Representative here trying to offer an amendment for them. For management purposes, if the  Rules Committee obviously establishes that they are going to have some kind of structured rule, we have a deadline for filing, and that deadline is stated, for example, at 5 p.m. on a certain date. And we have instance after instance where Members have literally arrived at the door 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 minutes after 5 p.m. and they've been told that their amendment can't even be considered, can't even be submitted for the Rules Committee to consider. Now, I will say that this is something that has never been done in the 220-year history of this institution. 
   The Rules Committee was established, Mr. Speaker, on the 2nd of April, 1789, which was the second day of the first Congress. Since that period of time, we have never had this kind of treatment of Members. And that's a new policy that has been put into place under this so-called enhancement of deliberativeness, openness, transparency, disclosure and accountability, and all of those words that we've continued to hear from so many in the past who have touted all the changes that need to be made. 
   So let's see what we've got. Okay. We've got a quote from the very distinguished chairwoman, the gentlewoman from Rochester, New York (Ms. Slaughter). Now, this was on the 20th of April in 2005. And in this quote, she was describing the job of ranking minority member of the Rules Committee in a press release that was put out. It is the job that I now hold as ranking minority member. And in this press release she stated, ``My job on the Rules Committee is to serve as the guardian of the democratic process in the House. That process and the democratic values of everyday Americans are under attack by an out-of-control majority. Someone has to step up to the plate and ensure that the business of this House is conducted in an ethical manner, without corruption and without arrogance. I didn't ask for that job, but I humbly accept the responsibility.'' Now, that's a statement that was made by the very distinguished present chairman of the Committee on Rules. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have to say that when we look at this record over the past 9 months, it is, to me, a very, very sad commentary that every single American has had their rights undermined on dealing with substantive public policy issues. 
   Just upstairs about 2 hours ago in the Rules Committee, we, unfortunately, reported out a rule dealing with a very important issue that we're going to be considering this week, and there were some questions that were raised. The minority was promised last August 2, 2 months ago today, that that issue would be resolved. And unfortunately, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes), who serves as the ranking member of a subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee on the issue in question, which is one that we want to address, it's one that's getting a great deal of attention now, but what happened? The issue and the concerns that were raised in a bipartisan way were completely ignored; so, no opportunity whatsoever to address that. 
   We offered two amendments upstairs to try and address those and, unfortunately, by a partisan vote we saw the American people, through their Representatives on the Rules Committee, denied that chance to have this issue dealt with in a bipartisan way, as had been promised in the past. 
   There are a number of issues that I would like to get into to discuss. We know probably the one that has gotten the most attention within the last week had to do with the aftermath of the unveiling of our very important out-of-order report, which again I would say to my colleagues, I encourage them to look at this report. It's available at rules-republicans.house.gov. And any of our colleagues can go online right now and get a copy of this. And Mr. Speaker, I would encourage them to do that. 
   After we unveiled this plan last week, Mr. Speaker, in which we talked about this problem, the Rules Committee took action which I find to be absolutely reprehensible, and there was bipartisan concern voiced over the action that was taken. We were considering a critical issue. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the other natural disasters that we faced in this country, the issue of flood insurance is one which clearly is not partisan at all. I mean, Republicans, Democrats, independents have tragically been victimized by these natural disasters. They've hit primarily the Gulf Coast, and my friend from Florida certainly has been often victimized by hurricanes in south Florida, and others have dealt with this very serious challenge. Well, there were a number of amendments that had been proposed. Our friend from Georgia (Mr. Price) is here, and he is going to talk about one. 
   When the Committee on Financial Services went through its markup process, there was an indication provided, and I will let him expand on this, that the process of dealing with flood insurance would be addressed going through the process and that there would be opportunity for amendments to be considered. In fact, the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services came before the committee on Rules and asked that a number of Republican amendments be made in order. 
   Mr. Speaker, we couldn't believe what happened. There were 13 amendments made in order on that bill; not one single Republican amendment was made in order on that bill. And what happened? We saw bipartisan outrage. There were people, including the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, who could not support that rule. And that was unprecedented. I've been here 27 years and I've never seen a circumstance like that. And so what this shows, Mr. Speaker, is the Rules Committee is being used very arrogantly to undermine the rights of the American people to deal with an issue as critical as flood insurance reform. 
   And so it saddens me that we've had to take this time out, it truly does, because I know that I would very much like to be able to work in a bipartisan way on all of these issues. I've continued to try and do that in the past, and I will continue, as all of my colleagues will, to strive for bipartisanship on behalf of the American people in the future. 
   Let me say that I am very privileged again to be joined by my distinguished colleagues on the Rules Committee, and we now have two former members of the Rules Committee who have come to the floor as well. And I begin by recognizing my very good friend, the gentleman from Miami, Florida (Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart). I'm happy to yield to my friend.

   Mr. DREIER. If I could reclaim my time, I would just like to ask my friend to repeat that again. We've got this chart here that shows this, that if you juxtapose the 109th and the 110th Congress, you can see that if you look at the number of closed rules, we have had a dramatic increase in the number of closed rules. I think it's even more than this chart has shown, more than double. And again, today, we just, in the last couple of hours, had more closed rules. 
   And I'm happy to further yield.

   I know that I want to recognize my friend Mr. Sessions, who's here, but we also want to recognize another very distinguished former member of the Rules Committee. I again am saddened that he is not able to serve with us on the Rules Committee any longer. That's what happens when you go under the minority.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I want to begin by saying that I agree with many of the points that my dear friend from Atlanta, Mr. Scott, has made. He has put forth some very thoughtful arguments. And he is absolutely right. He comes from Georgia. I come from California. We're in the midst of a very serious housing crisis. In fact, the foreclosure issue is one that has impacted my State of California, and I know it has impacted Georgia and other segments of the economy. 
   But I have to say, as I listened to my friend's remarks, I was really struck with the fact that he failed, Mr. Speaker, he failed to look at the overall picture. It is true, there are Americans who are hurting. But to describe the economic challenges that we face today as the worst economic times since the Great Depression is, at least, a slight exaggeration.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, the second point that he made, which I think is a very important one, is to say that this is the number one issue facing Americans. 
   Now in the debate on the last rule, our friend from Pasco, Washington (Mr. Hastings) pointed to a survey that was done, I think it was a CNN survey or some other survey, in which they talked about the priority issues. 
   Guess what issue number one is? Its the issue that our friend from Dallas was just talking about, gasoline prices. That happens to be, Mr. Speaker, the number one issue, and you have to go down the list to get to this as a priority issue. 
   All I'm arguing, and I'm not saying that this isn't, Mr. Speaker, a very, very important issue. It impacts the people whom I'm honored to represent here in a very negative way. But what needs to be recognized is, we have to look at where we are. We had anemic growth the last quarter, six-tenths of 1 percent. What that means is that while we may be possibly at the beginning of an economic recession, while we had anemic growth, it was not negative growth, which it takes, as my friend, Wharton-educated, has just pointed out, two quarters of negative economic growth for us to be in the midst of an economic recession. That is not to in any way diminish, Mr. Speaker, the pain that so many of our fellow Americans are feeling at this point. 
   Now let me just say about this issue. The President of the United States very much wants, as he said to Republican Members today, to have a bill that he can sign. And I've just spoken with my very good friend, the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, who last night in the Rules Committee came forward with a very thoughtful alternative. That alternative focuses on strengthening a number of the very important existing programs that we have. They include, reform of the Federal Housing Administration, FHA reform legislation which we've worked on; the government-sponsored enterprises, GSE reform, very, very important; the FHA secure program; Hope Now. There are a wide range of programs that are out there. 
   And we've regularly encouraged our constituents who are facing the challenge of foreclosure to call that 800 number that has been put forward, because I know full well, from having spoken with many lenders, there is a desire not to take back these homes. My friend from Atlanta was absolutely right when he closed his statement by saying that the priority is to make sure that these Americans are able to stay in their homes. We want to make sure that they stay in their homes. 
   And guess what? To the surprise of many, these lenders don't want to take these homes backs. They don't want the responsibility of being saddled with them. And so the issue of forbearance is something that I know for a fact  lenders want to engage in with these borrowers. 
   But as my friend from Dallas has pointed out very well, we have before us a structure which is very unfortunate. Yes, we know we went through the committee process. We know that we have seen a very fair process by the chairman of the Financial Services Committee. But, unfortunately, what we're doing here is taking up a Senate amendment. 
   So while tomorrow, if we consider this wartime supplemental, for the first time ever we are going to be completely ignoring the committee process, the subcommittee, committee process. And, of course, we'll look at the prospect of taking a shell bill here and denying the minority an opportunity for a motion to recommit. That's why so many members of the Appropriations Committee have been here demonstrating their outrage on this process. But on this bill what we're bypassing is floor consideration of the measure because we're simply taking a Senate amendment. 
   Now what does that do, Mr. Speaker? Just as the proposed plan to deal with the supplemental appropriations bill, it denies the members of the minority a right to offer that very important cherished motion to recommit. 
   And so I have to say, Mr. Speaker, I'm very, very troubled with this process, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I was seeking to get the floor from my very dear friend from Florida to simply say that all we were asking for was nine amendments. Unfortunately, the process that was so eloquently outlined by our friend from Savannah, Georgia (Mr. Kingston) is exactly the process that is being used on the next foreclosure bill that we have. Having completely denied the opportunity for the hearing process, and as we go through every single step that should be part of this measure, the minority is going to, unfortunately, not have a chance whatsoever to offer its motion to recommit. 
   We are not asking for hundreds of amendments, Mr. Speaker, we are simply asking on this bill for nine amendments. When only a third of our amendments were made in order, three-quarters of their amendments were made in order, let's have a little more fairness.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his helpful contribution. 
   We have heard countless members of the Appropriations Committee come to this floor and demonstrate their outrage. And why? Well, for the first time in the history of this institution, 219 years old, for the first time in the history of the institution, we are bringing up tomorrow, in the Rules Committee I suspect today, I don't know if we have a meeting scheduled or not, we are bringing up a wartime supplemental under a process which doesn't ask, as my friend from Tampa said, for hundreds and hundreds of amendments. We are simply asking for one simple bite at the apple, Mr. Speaker, a motion to recommit which was promised at the beginning of this Congress which was designed to be a great, new, open Congress with an opportunity for regular order to proliferate and succeed. And, unfortunately, what we are doing with this process is completely obliterating the right, as my friend from Houston said, of millions and millions of Americans to be heard. 
   We have seen the committee process completely abrogated as we look at this wartime supplemental, and now here we are saying that there won't  even be an opportunity to consider, that sacrosanct one opportunity for Members of the minority to be heard. It is an absolute outrage that this would proceed, and that is why so many of our Members have demonstrated their concern.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend from Big D for yielding me time and for accurately pointing out the size that we are looking at exploring in an environmentally sound way in Alaska is the size of the Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport. I have often said the Dulles International Airport. It's a pretty small area, and I think we need to do that. 
   I just don't get it. I have enjoyed listening to a load of our newly elected friends from the other side of the aisle over the past hour and a half as we have debated the motion to instruct conferees come to the floor and talk about the need for us to increase exploration. Obviously these newly elected Members have been hearing from their constituents just like virtually everyone has. 
   I appreciate the fact that they have had their ear to the ground, and they have heard the hue and cry from the American people that we need to do everything we can to address this problem. 
   The thing is, this bill, as was correctly stated by my friend from Dallas, is nothing but a reaffirmation of current law, and it is called the DRILL Act. The thing that is very perplexing about this is that we are trying to have an all-of-the-above solution, which does include drilling in an environmentally sound way, and yet this bill, which was introduced late last night, just provided to members in the minority again very, very late last night, was cobbled together. We had a Rules Committee meeting yesterday, and no one knew what it was. 
   We offered, at that juncture, a bipartisan, and I stress a bipartisan, package of legislation which has been introduced, considered. A number of those measures are right here in the well with discharge petitions, and these measures are provided, having gone through an airing by Members of this body, and, yet, we are not given a chance to do that, to have a vote on it. 
   Now, again, this is called the DRILL Act, but fact of the matter is, the structure around which we are considering this measure should be we are afraid to vote on the potential for drilling act, is really what it is.     
   Why? 
   Because we know full well that this procedure, known as suspension of the rules, is really building on what is taking place in our House Appropriations Committee right now and virtually every other committee in this Congress; and that is, we are afraid to have any kind of debate, discussion or debate or vote on the issue of drilling. 
   Now, I am one who believes, as our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have said, that we need to pursue alternative energy sources, renewable energy, we need to do everything we can to encourage conservation, and we have a lot of very interesting proposals out there to do that. 
   But I think common sense says that, for the next few decades, even though we need to do everything we can to wean ourselves off of our reliance on fossil fuels, we have no choice. And so that is why, when I listen to my colleagues say that we should pursue the petroleum reserve and get 10 billion barrels, why don't we also look at ANWR to go for 10 billion barrels? 
   Again, I believe that the American people want us to come together to address this. As we listen to the horror stories of what has happened, one of the most telling came to me from a grandparent who said that, in one of our town hall meetings, they can't afford to pay for the gasoline to drive to visit their grandchildren from the San Gabriel Valley of California down to Long Beach. And the notion that this dramatic increase in gasoline prices is literally dividing families is something that I think we, as Democrats and Republicans, should come together to address. 
   Now, as we listen to our need to expand drilling and to encourage big oil to do that, I think we need to look at the fact that, for at least a decade and a half plus, we have been trying to encourage things like exploration in ANWR. And what has happened? Well, in the other body we had members of the Democratic Party filibuster this measure. 
   I also have to say that in 1995, 13 years ago, we all know that we were able to get through both Houses of Congress, through both Houses of Congress, a measure that would allow us to, in an environmentally sound way, explore that tiny area in Alaska. And what has happened as a by-product of that? Well, unfortunately, then-President Clinton chose to veto that measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (AMERICA'S CHALLENGES IN THE 21ST CENTURY -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, as we all know from listening to our colleagues and, even more importantly, from listening to the American people, the United States is currently facing a host of critical and complex challenges that have an enormous impact on our daily lives. 
   Fuel prices have skyrocketed, creating a ripple effect throughout our entire economy. We pay ever increasing prices at the pump, at the supermarket and nearly everywhere we buy the everyday goods that our families need. We all feel the strain of these rising prices. At the same time, we see our economy softening because of the housing crisis. 
   The threat of radical extremism persists throughout much of the globe, including, of course, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, where our brave men and women in uniform are fighting. We, of course, constantly face the problem of illegal immigration, which exposes the weaknesses of our borders and further strains our economy. 
   Madam Speaker, these challenges are as diverse as they are complicated. They did not develop overnight, but have arisen over time. They contribute to a growing and pervasive frustration by the American people. These challenges are daunting, but they are far from hopeless. 
   I believe the key to finding the solutions to the challenges of the 21st century is not to view them as isolated problems. We need a broad, visionary approach that sees these issues for what they are: the interconnected challenges of a smaller and smaller world. 
   Growing demand for energy in both China and India, combined with volatility in the Middle East, central Asia and the Niger Delta contribute to rising gas prices here in the United States. Natural disasters combined with rising fuel prices contribute to a global food crisis that threatens a billion people. Weak and corrupt governments perpetuate poverty in the developing world, which is exacerbated by the growing food crisis, contributing to growing unrest and ripe conditions for radical extremism. 
   Every single day, Madam Speaker, every day, people who have not been screened for a criminal or for a terrorist background enter our country through porous borders. Of course, we know all too painfully well the cabal of 20 hijackers from 7 years ago this coming September 11. They fed off the deep discontent that poverty and ignorance breed. They trained in Afghanistan, received funding through international financing schemes. They entered the United States by way of a broken immigration system and perpetrated, as we all know, the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil. 
   These issues are not isolated from each other. Any 21st century agenda for America must recognize the fundamental nature of these issues and take a comprehensive view towards solving them. I believe this demands an approach that looks inward as well as outward. 
   First and foremost, we need to look at how American policy is affecting American problems, and we need to find an American solution. Second, we need to look at the reality of this interconnected world about which I've spoken and give our approach a global view. 
   Our energy crisis provides a good illustration of exactly what I mean. There are a number of contributing factors that are driving up prices, as I've mentioned. There is growing demand abroad. There is volatility in many oil-producing regions, but we are also suffering because we have failed here at home to develop our own domestic solutions. 
   Technology in the oil and gas industry has become so advanced that we can explore and drill without damaging our environment. Yet we have vast resources untapped in ANWR and way off our shores. An increased supply of oil does very little good without the capacity to refine it. Yet we have not built a new refinery in three decades.     
   We all know that nuclear energy is the cleanest, safest, most cost-effective energy source known to man, and yet we have also not built a new reactor in three decades. Furthermore, despite the fact that we in the United States and in my State of California are the world's leaders in innovation, we have not invested nearly, nearly enough in new green technologies that diminish our dependence on fossil fuels and allow us to use the energy we have more efficiently. 
   Madam Speaker, these are American failures. We need a comprehensive overhaul of our national energy policy to increase our domestic production, improve efficiency, and make us more self-sufficient. But at the same time, there is no escaping the global oil market and the reality that prices are driven by global factors. By promoting our own responsible energy agenda, we don't extricate ourselves from the global market. We shape it, we shape it, Madam Speaker, through our leadership. By increasing supply while diminishing demand through technology improvements, we can help to stabilize and reduce global prices. 
   By neutralizing the acute crises caused by out-of-control prices, we can help to reduce the volatility that drives up prices to begin with. In other words, we need a uniquely American solution without losing sight of our place of leadership in this interconnected world. 
   Madam Speaker, the same is very true for the problem of illegal immigration. Failure on this issue is a failure of our border security. We cannot address this problem without addressing our borders. The solution begins with substantial resources for the border patrol and increased technology, including fencing along our border. We simply must strengthen and modernize our first line of defense. 
   Yet we would be hopelessly shortsighted if we didn't recognize that the problem does not begin, the problem does not begin at the border. It begins in the poor villages of our neighbors to the south. Nowhere else on Earth do a developed and a developing country share a 2,000-mile border. Nowhere else on the face of the earth is a border of 2,000 miles existing between a developed and a developing nation. As we seek to hold back the tide of illegal immigration with a strong border, we must also endeavor to diminish the flow of that tide in the first place. 
   In the long run, Madam Speaker, growth and opportunity in Mexico is the key to ending the scourge of illegal immigration. As their economy grows and jobs are created, the desire to attempt to cross our border will greatly diminish. Because of this, a permanent solution to the problem demands that Mexico pursue sound economic policies so that there is opportunity on both sides of the Rio Grande. 
   Our policy toward Mexico must be focused on encouraging them to be accountable to the Mexican people for making the necessary economic reforms which will lead to this important growth. And because strong economies require strong institutions, we must also encourage them to pursue efforts to build their own capacity. 
   Greater bilateral engagement will ensure Mexico's continued effort to liberalize their economy, to modernize and train their law enforcement and judiciary is important, to build the capacity of their Federal, State, and local government institution is also key, to strengthen the rule of law and provide an environment where economic opportunity can flourish is critically important. It will also ensure that we have an able and effective partner in our efforts to stem the illegal flow of people and narcotics across our border. 
   Madam Speaker, we have already seen, and this doesn't get much attention, but we have already seen some positive results from our engagements. Mexico has taken a number of important steps toward reform, liberalization, and institutional capacity building. President Felipe Calderon put forth a bold reform agenda in his presidential campaign. Since then, he has taken very positive steps in instituting  economic reform, strengthening the rule of law, and very important--and they're suffering greatly from this as you know, Madam Speaker--combating corruption. 
   But we know very well that a great deal of hard work lies ahead for Mexico. Millions, millions still live in poverty, and good jobs are all too rare. Many key institutions are still very weak, exposing shortcomings at all levels of government. The criminal justice system in Mexico is still woefully strained in its efforts to combat the illegal trafficking of drugs, guns, and people. 
   These remaining challenges have left us no choice but to get tough on the issue of border security. But they also demand that we recognize that fundamental reform in Mexico is absolutely essential to tackling illegal immigration in the long run. 
   Again, these are solutions, Madam Speaker, that demand a robust agenda here at home with a view toward the broader international context out of which these challenges arise. 
   The need for development, opportunity, and growth abroad extends well beyond illegal immigration into the tremendous threat we face from the spread of radical and violent extremism. When confronting any national security threat, we know that our Armed Forces are the guarantors of our security. We need a strong, modern military to protect our homeland and fight our battles overseas. But the terrorists' designs of radical extremists will never be thwarted through military might alone. Their ability to perpetrate attacks originates with their efforts to exploit the frustrations and disaffection in the developing world. 
   Madam Speaker, with over a billion people living on less than $1 a day, the potential for exploitation is virtually limitless. Poverty breeds hopelessness, ignorance, and intolerance. These circumstances are made possible by weak or corrupt governments. They do not have the ability to strengthen the institutions that make economic opportunity possible or provide a voice for their people's frustrations. 
   The result, as we all have tragically found, is fertile ground for terrorism. Development is the only long-term sustainable solution because it is the only approach that addresses the root problems. We must pursue greater economic engagement so that new opportunities can be created, and we must also work to strengthen institutions so that governments are more accountable and economies are more open. 
   In March of 2005, I had the great privilege of joining with my colleague, DAVID PRICE, under the leadership of Speaker Hastert and now Speaker, then-minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, as we founded the House Democracy Assistance Commission. I had the privilege of leading the Commission when we were in the majority. 
   Today we continue that very able work under, as I said, my colleague, Mr. Price. Our Commission endeavors to engage in precisely the kind of capacity building that I have been discussing. We work with 12 legislatures around the world in new and reemerging democracies providing guidance and training in legislative functioning. Our mission, Madam Speaker, within the broad goals of capacity building, is very specific: to strengthen the representative bodies of these fledgling democracies so that they effectively meet the needs of the people they represent. 
   A strong, effective legislature is critical to enacting the economic policies that create both growth and opportunity. It ensures a check on an overreaching executive branch, and it gives a voice to those with grievances, all of which contribute to a vibrant, a very vibrant, prosperous, and peaceful democracy, all of which are necessary to ensure that radical extremism cannot take root. 
   Madam Speaker, clearly our struggle against terrorism demands a global development agenda. Once again, we see that the solution to the challenges we face requires that we look inward as well as outward. We cannot guard against terrorist attacks without a strong national defense, but we cannot overcome terrorism without engaging worldwide. 
   The challenges of the 21st century are not isolated problems, and we cannot hope to address them by isolating ourselves from this interconnected world. Of course, moving forward on these great challenges also demands that we, as Americans, find common ground. 
   In many ways, we, as a Nation, are currently grappling with very fundamental philosophical questions on the problems that we are confronting. A central 
   question we all have is how to apply our core American principles to the new challenges that we face. How do we secure ourselves against new threats without diminishing the civil liberties that we hold so dear? How do we wage a war against Islamist extremism without appearing to treat those of the Muslim faith with the very intolerance that fuels extremism? How do we end the scourge of illegal immigration while continuing to be that shining city on a hill to the many legal immigrants who have always helped to make this country the great Nation that it is? How do we engage in the worldwide marketplace while ensuring that Americans can successfully compete in a very dynamic economic environment? 
   There are those who say that America is bitterly divided today over these questions. Madam Speaker, it's certainly true that there is great diversity of opinion in how to address the security and economic challenges that we face. But if we are willing to engage each other in honest and open debate, this diversity of opinion is our great strength, not our weakness. 
   As we face these substantial new challenges that I discussed, we need that great clash of ideas just as our founders intended. Unfortunately, resorting to inflammatory talking points has supplanted sincere and honest debate. The shrill voices of ``talking heads'' are no substitute for true engagement. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe Americans have grown weary of politics-as-usual, of the endless fighting that takes place right here in Washington, DC, but not because of the existence of opposing views. Americans have grown weary of the obstinacy, the hardened positions and intolerance of differing opinions. The refusal to truly engage in an open and substantive way is something that has frustrated most Americans. Now, Madam Speaker, in a country of over 300 million people there will never, there will never be uniformity of opinion, but there can and should be a deep respect for the clash of ideas and an interest in reaching broad consensus on the great issues of our day. 
   Madam Speaker, this is the essence of the United States of America. And it is the essence of what we just celebrated earlier this month on July 4th: the freedom of ideas, all ideas to be debated, debunked, or developed in this messy process of democracy. I truly believe that our country will rise to the challenges we face today just as we have always done. We will accomplish this through open, sometimes heated and passionate, but always respectful debate. We will accomplish it by applying the core American values that we have long held while maintaining a global perspective on the challenges of the 21st century.     
   Whether the issue is soaring gas prices, illegal immigration, terrorism, or any other challenge that we face, we must set our priorities as Americans. But we must tackle our problems with a worldwide focus, boldly asserting our global leadership role. By doing so, we will make our borders safer, our economy stronger, and our future ever brighter for our children.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Dallas for his very able handling of this rule, and I congratulate my friend from Ohio as well. 
   Madam Speaker, I have to rise in strong opposition to this rule. We were yesterday on the House floor listening to the very distinguished chairman of the Committee on Financial Services argue passionately in support of the need for an open amendment process and how great it is. And yet today we are given a rule that denies 12 of the 15 amendments that were submitted to us. 
   It is interesting, the bill yesterday that was controversial enough that we had an open rule for it passed by a vote of, I think 423 to zip, 423-0. There was no controversy whatsoever. We had three amendments that we voted on here. But it was an open rule. 
   Now we have a bill that is slightly controversial. In fact, it is extremely controversial. And yet we have closed down the amendment process, preventing Democrats and Republicans from having an opportunity to participate in this process, as they should. 
   We, Madam Speaker, when we proceeded with the Rules Committee  meeting last night, my very good friend from Martinez, California, the distinguished chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, Mr. Miller, proceeded as he was sitting with the distinguished ranking Republican, Mr. McKeon, at the table, to tell me that I hadn't read the bill and I knew nothing about labor law. 
   Well, I will tell you this: I admitted at that moment that I had not read the bill. But I have read the bill since that time, Madam Speaker. And I have not become a labor lawyer overnight, but I will say that I have talked to a lot of people who are expert on this issue, and I have come to the conclusion that the sanctity of the secret ballot is something very, very important and very, very precious. 
   We in the Rules Committee spent a lot of time on the issue of institutional reform and, as we all know, for the first time ever, we got the Federal Government involved in providing Federal resources for local elections. Why? In the wake of the 2000 election, there was clearly a lot of controversy. Especially our friends from Florida raised a lot of understandable concerns. 
   So the Federal Government got involved and we have put literally billions of dollars into our quest to ensure the sanctity of that secret ballot. Yet at this moment, for this institution, we are embarking on legislation which will take a retrograde step on the very important secret ballot for the American worker. 
   Obviously, in the last half century we have seen a great diminution in the numbers of people who are in unions today. In the 1950s, roughly 35 percent of the American workers were members of unions. Today, it is something like 7.5 percent. It has dropped dramatically. And that is due to the choice that exists that people have made. 
   We have a strong economy, a 4.5 percent unemployment rate, growing increasing incomes that are taking place right now, and as we look at the challenge that many union organizations have with the auto industry and other industries, I believe that union control has really played a role in jeopardizing their potential for even greater success. 
   We got the report yesterday that Tupelo, Mississippi, is going to be the site of a new Toyota plant, 2,000 employees, who will be earning $20 an hour, substantially higher than the wage rates that are paid in other parts of that region, high wage rates for virtually anyone around the country. It is very, very impressive that we are looking at this growth. And there is a sadness that many people have over the fact that the big three auto makers here in the United States are faced with real difficulty.     
   Well, Madam Speaker, I argue that part of that challenge has been the overwhelming control that unions have had and the union leadership has really jeopardized the opportunity for individual choice for members. 
   I don't stand alone. Mr. McKeon just handed me a copy of this morning's Los Angeles Times. I do not always agree with the editorial policy of my friends of what I call my hometown paper, the L.A. Times, but I know them well and try to find areas of agreement. As I say, I don't always agree with them. 
   But today, they have provided an editorial and I think it is very enlightening. The close of this editorial said: ``Unions once supported the secret ballot for organization elections. They were right then and are wrong now. Unions have every right to a fair hearing, and the National Labor Relations Board should be more vigilant about attempts by employers to game the system. In the end, however, whether to unionize is up to the workers. A secret ballot ensures that their choice will be a free one.'' 
   Madam Speaker, we are undermining that with this legislation that we are about to embark upon here today. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by, now since I have the first opportunity to formally see my California colleague here on the floor, to congratulate her and all of the members of the new majority. I have congratulated Ms. Slaughter and of course Ms. Pelosi, and now I join in extending congratulations to Ms. Matsui for her move into the majority, and to say as I did yesterday that I anxiously look forward to working in a bipartisan way as was said by Speaker Pelosi and Leader Boehner here yesterday. 
   I believe it is absolutely imperative that we meet the demand that was put forth by the American people in the November election. The message that I received from that election was that they want us to work together, they want us to solve their problems. Clearly, there needs to be a clash of ideas which was envisaged by James Madison, and I believe that that is something that we can't forget, because we are not supposed to pursue what I like to call the Rodney King view of the world: can't we all just get along. The fact of the matter is we do need to recognize that there are disparate views and they need to be voiced on this House floor. 
   Now, the question is, can we in fact do that and at the same time maintain civility? And I think that is what title III is all about here. It is titled ``civility'' and it is something that I have always prided myself on, and I will say that I am saddened that it is something that has been often lacking in this House. 
   Frankly, as I have seen the debate take place even yesterday, I was concerned that some of the statements made would indicate a lack of civility, and that is all I am going to say about it. I hope very much that the title ``civility'' used for this title III is one that is recognized by Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   Let me get into some of the specifics now, Mr. Speaker, if I might. In February of last year, almost a year ago, Ms. Slaughter, the then-ranking minority member of the Rules Committee, and all of the members of the Rules Committee joined in introducing House Resolution 686. It is a resolution which called for virtually all of the things that my colleague, Ms. Matsui,  outlined are very important for us to pursue: openness, transparency, disclosure, making sure that we meet our obligation to vote here on the House floor, that we have it done in the light of day. 
   The concern that I have is that what has happened here is we have unfortunately gotten a package which does not have the kind of enforcement mechanisms that were envisaged by H. Res. 686 as introduced by the members of the Rules Committee in the last Congress, and I believe unfortunately it really is not reflective of anything other than sort of the spirit of what it was they were talking about. And the spirit is of things that we all can agree on. I am supportive of those. 
   The fact is when they were in the minority, Resolution 686 calls for consultation and agreement with the minority. Now that they are in the majority, unfortunately, this measure does not in any way reflect the need to have consultation with the minority. 
   For example, on this notion of keeping votes open beyond the 15-minute period of time, when they were in the minority they called for it to only take place if they had consultation with the minority. Well, unfortunately, this measure does not call for that. And what I am reminded of as I look at these items which touch on the issues that were raised in Resolution 686, I am reminded of again the experience that I had in the past on this when I moved from minority status to majority status 12 years ago. We had something known as the Contract With America. Some may remember that. What we said was that there would be 10 items that we would bring to the floor and we would have up or down votes on those items because, frankly, we were denied the chance for many, many years to consider them. They were items that were supported by broad-based backing of the American people. 
   Frankly, at the end of the day, President Clinton, who was President at that time, signed over 60 percent of the measures that were incorporated in the Contract With America. What we did is we outlined in detail what that would consist of. We said it would be considered under an open amendment process, and that is exactly what we did. It is exactly what we did with those measures that came forward. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we unfortunately with this measure have not seen the same kind of reflection of the goals that were outlined by the then-minority in this measure, and I thought I would take a moment just to go through a few of those items specifically and say that, unfortunately, this package is not what they called for. 
   Now, in the package that we had introduced in 686, it called for a requirement that conference reports contain an itemized list of any provisions in violation of the Scope rule. That is not included in this measure. It said that a rule prohibiting the Rules Committee from reporting martial law rules could not be in order. That is not included here. 
   A rule prohibiting the Rules Committee from waiving points of order against the conference report were a serious violation of the Scope Rule, or additions or deletions made after final agreement. That is not included here. 
   Another provision in Ms. Slaughter's resolution as introduced in February of last year: a rule prohibiting the Rules Committee from waiving points of order against a conference report where the minority party managers of the House were not allowed to fully participate in the conference. Well, they of course said they want to have this happen, but the kind of specificity and enforcement mechanisms that were outlined in the Slaughter Resolution, H. Res. 686, introduced in February of last year, not included in this measure. 
   A rule permitting consideration of a conference report only if a roll call vote in open meeting was held on its final version and the results included the accompanying joint explanatory statement of managers. Well, sounds great, we are all for that, but that wasn't included in this resolution that we are now considering. 
   A rule prohibiting the Rules Committee from calling up a rule within 24 hours of reporting it. Well, everybody talked about that. We know that on the opening-day rules package that we considered, we received it maybe 19 hours before we brought it up or something like that, but it clearly was in the violation of the 24 hours that was insisted upon by the then-minority. 
   A rule requiring the Speaker of the House to publish in the Congressional Record a log of all voting activity occurring after the first 30 minutes of any recorded vote whose maximum time for voting exceeds 30 minutes. That is not included in here at all. 
   A rule prohibiting suspensions costing more than $100 million. I don't see that in here at all. 
   A rule requiring the Speaker of the House to allow an equal number of bills and resolutions sponsored by majority and minority parties under suspension. 
   A repeal of the Gephardt rule. A rule requiring a 24-hour layover of unanimous consent requests. 
   A rule prohibiting the Rules Committee from reporting a rule unless at least one minority party member of the committee is allowed to offer an amendment to it. 
   Now, again, I know that we are hearing words from the new majority that they want to do all these things, but when they introduced House Resolution 686, they made it very clear that they had to have enforcement mechanisms and that they were going to provide guarantees of minority rights. Unfortunately, while the word ``civility'' sounds great, this measure falls way, way short of that. 
   So I again go back to when we went from minority to majority and I looked at the fact that we were able to maintain our promise, we were able to keep our word. And I am very proud of that fact. The thing that troubles me, while I am supportive of what we are trying to do here, is that it does not comply with the promises and the commitments and the vision and the goals that were set forth in February in House Resolution 686 as was introduced by the then-minority. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by reminding my California colleague that yesterday we passed the ethics package about which she spoke, indicating that we would be voting on it later today. We voted on that yesterday. It has already gone into effect, I am very happy to say. And we did it with very strong bipartisan support. 
   I am proud that the ethics reform legislation, of course, was based on and incorporated most of the items that were already passed in the House last year. Again, a year ago this month, Speaker HASTERT and I stood in the well and we outlined our call for ethics and lobbying reform, bringing about the kind of accountability and transparency and disclosure, calling for the ban on gifts and dealing with the travel and all of these problems that were out there. We recognize that they are there in a bipartisan way, and yesterday we voted that out in a strong bipartisanship way. 
   I am very pleased to see the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee here, and I will again, as I did yesterday, extend congratulations. And, Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of civility that we are pursuing, I think it is very important for us to debate these issues, and I would like to engage my distinguished new Chair in a colloquy, if I might. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I look at the resolution that is before us, the thing that I find most troubling as we focus on the issue of civility is the fact that those items that I outlined that were included in H. Res. 686 that was introduced on February 16, 2005, which called for the litany of items, and I can go through them again quickly: A requirement that conference reports contain an itemized list of any provisions in violation of the scope rule; a rule prohibiting the Rules Committee from reporting martial law rules; a rule prohibiting the Rules Committee from waiving points of order against a conference report with a serious violation; and it goes on for basically two pages. 
   What I would like to ask my distinguished Chair is why it is that those items that were incorporated in the base of H. Res. 686, the commitment that was made by the then-minority as to what would be done if they were to move to majority, are not included in this title that we are considering here, and not, in any way, included in the opening day rules package. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter).

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, let me just say I have been supportive of stem cell research, and I have supported the minimum wage increase. That is not what I am talking about here. 
   Mr. Speaker, in terms of our civil debate, which I think is very important, we are talking about the opening day rules package which is going to set forth, Mr. Speaker, the guidelines around which we will consider all of these items. 
   Now I would ask my friend, am I correct from inferring from the statement she just made that there is a commitment, a commitment that as we proceed forward to modify the rules of the House to include those items in H. Res. 686, which were really the cornerstone of the package that was introduced by Mrs. Slaughter and the other then-minority members of the Rules Committee, which guarantee these rights to the minority that they believed were so critically important when they were in the minority; and, unfortunately, are not included in the package. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, in the spirit of civil debate, let me say that I believe these measures that were authored by Members of the new majority as being critical rights that the minority should have, that those Members in the majority who believed them to be so important should obviously stand by them. 
   All I am asking is that the promise that was made in the 109th Congress by the then-Members of the minority about what they believed minority rights should be should be, in fact, implemented. Because, unfortunately, while we can talk about these great things, when you go down the line seriatim, looking at each individual item, making sure that we do have Members of the minority guaranteed to have a right in conference committees to be there, bringing an end to considering measures without a 24-hour waiting period, these kinds of rights that the  then-minority believed were imperative for the minority to have are, unfortunately, not included in this package. This is what I find to be very troubling. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my distinguished Chair.

   Mr. DREIER. Reclaiming my time so I might respond, these were not my proposals, Mr. Speaker. These were not my proposals. These were proposals put forward by Members of the new majority, and they were the commitments, the promises, and the obligations that they made as far as enforcement of minority rights that they believed to be so important. That was the platform on which they ran in November, Mr. Speaker. 
   I believe that what we should do is do all that we can to simply point to the fact that this title III on civility, which is supposed to be reflective of these notions, is in no way emblematic of H. Res. 686 that was introduced by the Members. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Once again, I am very enthusiastic about this return to civility, and I am very proud of engaging in civil debate on a regular basis. And I thank the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, for engaging in debate with me on this issue once again. 
   And I would say that as I listened to her prepared statement, I was struck with, once again, how the notion of not keeping votes open for a long period of time is an admirable one. It is a great one. But guess what, Mr. Speaker. There is not one single item in this package that guarantees enforcement. In fact, Speaker Pelosi introduced her legislation, H.R. 4682. I remember very well looking at that legislation. Mr. Speaker, I will tell you exactly what it said. It said that if a vote is kept open beyond a 20-minute period of time, there had to be consultation with the minority. Now, that is not something I proposed. That was the proposal of Speaker Pelosi. Now, the sad thing is  that in this measure there is no enforcement mechanism. 
   Now, of course, people are busy. They come over here for a 15-minute vote. They would like to have it take place within 20 minutes. We are hearing that votes won't go beyond that period of time for the sole purpose of changing a Member's vote. But, again, there is no enforcement mechanism. And, again, the enforcement mechanism was not my proposal. It is a proposal that the then-minority offered. But now that they are in the majority, they just decide to say, well, we want to keep this process going and we want to keep doing it, but we are not going to consult with the minority. So, again, those aren't my proposals. Those are their proposals. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this juncture I am very happy to yield 4 minutes to my very good friend from Marietta, Georgia, a former member of the Rules Committee, who is very thoughtful on these issues, Dr. GINGREY.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to engage in colloquy with my friend. I wonder if the gentleman has had an opportunity to look at what we consider to be the opening-day rules package that we are considering. 
   He has talked about, Mr. Speaker, some very important provisions. I believe that the 24-hour layover idea which was propounded by the then-Members of the minority is an important one. It is not guaranteed here; so it is not provided. 
   Number two, if you look at title V of the measure that is before us, title V provides 5 minutes of debate on five closed rules. The Rules Committee will not even be giving the minority the opportunity to have its amendments defeated in the Rules Committee, and we are not going through the committee process at all. 
   Now, I will acknowledge that the items that we are going to be addressing, a majority of which I support, are very important for us to proceed with, and an argument has been made that this was debated and discussed in the last Congress. Well, look at the tremendous number of new Members of the House that have come in, especially on the majority side. They are denied any opportunity to participate in this process at all. So as I hear my friend talk about, yes, we need to proceed in a civil manner, and I am all for that, I believe we need to proceed with fairness. I believe these things are all very important. It is just unfortunate that the facts are not reflected in the rhetoric that we are getting on the need for civility and openness and debate. 
   If my friend would like to respond, I would be happy to yield to him.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate that.     
   What I would say is that based on the fact that we have never before, in the 230-year history of this republic, we have never had the greatest body known to man come forward with five closed rules in an opening day package denying Members an opportunity to participate in any way. 
   So that is why I would argue this notion that we are beginning with a new tone, we are going to have an openness and all, is, in fact, not reflected in what we are facing in the next few days.

   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to respond. 
   We haven't seen any of the items. Maybe you all have those items, but we have not seen those items that we will be voting on. They haven't been submitted to us at all.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. I do so to say that I am supportive of this title called civility. We will be having a vote on that. Mr. Sessions was very appropriately raising concern over title V. We only had 5 minutes of debate on that. So he raised concern about the closed rules and shutting down operations of the Rules Committee that would record votes and make them public. 
   My concern about this measure we are going to have, which as I am going to support, because I am not going to oppose civility, is that when we look at the promises that were made by the then minority to do things like have a 24-hour waiting period before measures are brought up, it is denied in this rules package itself, because we got it about 19 hours before, so the spirit of that was denied there. 
   The whole notion of ensuring that we have consultation with the minority when it comes to keeping votes open, when it comes to the issue of ensuring that we will have minority participation conference in committees. As we go down the line and look at these items, Mr. Speaker, it does trouble me. 
   But there is a little bit of hope, and that hope was offered by the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee, when she told me there has been such a short period of time between the election and opening day and consideration of this package, that we in the Rules Committee will have an opportunity to do more. 
   So I always hold out, where there is light, there is hope, you know. I will tell you, I would do everything I can to help her maintain that commitment, and we will continue to do that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   I will tell you that this debate is to me rather sad. I listened to my friend, Mr. McDermott, with whom I have been very privileged to work for many years on trying to open up new markets for U.S. workers, to have access into those markets around the world. He represents the Seattle area, and we all know how important trade is. He and I have been privileged to try and pry open markets in Asia and Latin America and other parts of the world. 
   I just was downstairs and heard him on TV make some statement, and I would be happy to yield to him if I am incorrect in quoting him. He said Republicans don't care about those who are unemployed, those who are suffering and are victimized here. And I would be happy to yield. Is that what my friend said? I would say to my friend from Seattle, I would be happy to yield to him, that Republicans don't care about those who are unemployed?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, let me just say the 1935 Social Security Act is a debate that took place more than a couple of years ago. 
   Let's talk about what it is that we as Republicans have believed passionately in doing, and that is to ensure that people who are hurting the most are in fact able to benefit from unemployment benefits. 
   You know, we had an interesting debate in the Rules Committee last night. We just talked about the need for PAYGO compliance. Of course that was the sine qua non when we were debating the rules at the beginning of this Congress, the fact that we were going to make sure that everything was PAYGO compliant. Obviously this is not PAYGO compliant. Everyone has acknowledged that. The distinguished chair of the Rules Committee in a discussion with Mr. Hastings last night finally acknowledged that this is not PAYGO compliant, so completely contrary to what has been promised here time and time again. 
   But when it comes to actually ensuring that those who are truly in need are the beneficiaries of unemployment compensation, it seems to me we should go back not to 1935, but to 2002 because we had an extension of unemployment benefits that was put into place in 2002. 
   Madam Speaker, virtually every Democrat at that time supported the notion of saying there should be a minimum of 20 weeks of work, 20 weeks of work before someone could have the opportunity to see the unemployment benefits accrued to them. 
   What is it that this measure does? I will tell you, when I talk to my constituents about this, Madam Speaker, they are absolutely horrified. I just was downstairs 5 minutes ago talking to one of my constituents about it, and I explained what I am about to say here to our colleagues, and she could not believe it. Every member of her family with her, they were absolutely horrified when I said the following: under this plan, if someone works for only 2 weeks, they work only 2 weeks in their entire life, they are able to receive 52 weeks, one entire year of unemployment benefits. That's what it says, that's what this measure does. 
   In 2002 when we dealt with this issue, the Democrats decided there should be at least 20 weeks of work. And now when we have an unemployment rate, which as I acknowledged has gone up a half a percent, and it hasn't gone up to that level in 22 years, it is very unfortunate, it is still significantly lower than the unemployment rate we have seen in the past. And what are they saying, if someone has worked for only 2 weeks, they are able to see 52 weeks of benefits. That is just plain wrong. 
   I will tell you, whether you are a working American or an American looking for a job, that is not right because perpetuating the welfare state is exactly what that does. It is not providing a cushion of benefits. 
   We also believe, Madam Speaker, that the opportunity to say, gosh, if someone is out there and they are working to find an employment opportunity and they do, we believe we should reward that by providing them a lump-sum benefit, a lump-sum benefit that has rewarded them for the fact that they have found a job. We know it is difficult. We are not saying that everyone is going to be able to, but that is the kind of thing that we want to do. 
   And what has happened here? Well, the new majority has said an absolute closed rule, no opportunity for us to offer that kind of amendment. 
   Let me get back to the issue that we have been talking about time and time again which is on the minds of the American people, Madam Speaker, and that is the issue of high gasoline prices and the energy costs that we face right now. 
   You think about people who are struggling and are looking to find a job and are out there, looking to improve their situation, I will tell you, one of the cruelest penalties of all on them happens to be high gasoline prices. 
   Last night I had one of our telephone town hall meetings, and I had the opportunity to have nearly 5,000 households from the area that I am privileged to represent from southern California on the phone, and we talked about the need to increase energy supply. I took a number of questions during the one-hour program and not one person, not one person, Democrat, Republican, Independent, we call people regardless of their political party, not one person opposed our efforts to try to increase supply, recognizing if we can increase the supply by responsibly and in an environmentally sound way, exploring in ANWR, by pursuing the cleanest, safest most cost-effective energy source known to man, that being nuclear energy, by working to increase our refinery capacity, by looking at the shale reserves in this country, and again in an environmentally sound way exploring them, deep water exploration off the coast, those are the things that we believe are necessary. And, Madam Speaker, not one of my participants on our conference call last night indicated opposition to that. 
   The American people get it. They know that for two decades plus we have unfortunately seen a majority of the new majority in this place stand there and prevent us from pursuing opportunities to increase the supply so that we can bring prices down. 
   Now I had the chance to talk with a number of experts on this issue, a number of our colleagues who represent States like Texas and Oklahoma, and one of the things that we hear time and time again is we need an immediate response. 
   I listened to my friend from Utah talk about action. Well, I wondered,  how are we going to be able to immediately bring gasoline prices down? Having spoken to a wide range of people, because of the fact that oil prices are based on futures, if we take any of those actions that I outlined, whether it is in an environmentally sound way pursuing ANWR, whether it is deep water exploration, whether it is looking at shale, whether it is nuclear energy, if we were to take any of those actions, we would, Madam Speaker, see an immediate reduction, an immediate reduction. Why, because there would be recognition in the marketplace that we are now vigorously pursuing an effort to increase our supply. 
   So those people who are unemployed, and that is what this issue is about, those people who are out there responsibly working hard to find a job, are being penalized by high gasoline prices, just as every other American is being penalized by it because of the increased cost of virtually everything. 
   That is why it is terribly unfair for us not to responsibly look at these creative proposals that are out there. We want to ensure that people who are hurting are able to benefit from the unemployment compensation that we provide. 
   So everyone on the other side can stand up and say the Republicans don't care about those who are facing difficulty economically; that is absolute baloney. We care. We want to make sure that there are opportunities there. We want to make sure that we open up new markets around the world for job creation and economic growth so that good jobs can be created right here. 
   Let's defeat this rule and let's come forward with a measure that can get the signature of the President, because we all know that this is going no place. The Statement of Administration Policy, which I will include for the Record, has made it very clear that the President wants us to put in job creation policies, and he wants to work to responsibly deal with unemployment compensation, and the attempt to embarrass us is not going to sell with the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to Messrs. CLAY and SHAYS for their leadership on this and, most important, to our good friend, DON YOUNG, for having stepped forward to author this resolution. 
   And I want to say that as I listened to our friend, DON YOUNG, talk about Charlton Heston, I was struck by a story. DON began by taking the acting career, which, since I represent Los Angeles, I'm particularly proud of people who have great acting careers, and Mr. Heston was certainly one of those. I was struck by the fact that DON YOUNG drew from that to the fact that he focused on reality. 
   And as he was saying that, Mr. Speaker, I'm reminded of a story that Mr. Heston used to enjoy telling with regularity. When he was in the midst of rehearsals for that famous movie, Ben Hur, he would regularly say to people around him, I really want to make sure that I do this right because I want to make sure that I win this race. And he was constantly assured that he was going to win the race because the outcome was clearly predetermined. 
   But he understood full well that there was a great disparity between the roles that he played, as a great actor, and the fact that the reality of life is something that is much different, and it does take a great deal of vigilance and hard work. 
   Now, all of my colleagues have spoken about the role that he played as a civil rights leader. Mr. Young has talked about the fact that he played such an important role in preservation of second amendment rights, which was very important. 
   He was always involved, Mr. Speaker, in public policy issues. Again, as a Representative from Los Angeles, I had the opportunity to regularly discuss with him issues, and he exercised his first amendment rights with me with great regularity. He would call. And I will say that even though he was ill, I had the privilege of talking with him about, I think it was a year and a half, 2 years ago. And I knew that he had been ill, but he still was asking me questions about things that were going on here in this institution, making sure that we were staying on the right path. 
   And so it's difficult to imagine a greater patriot than Charlton Heston. And I have to say, Mr. Speaker, that still, to this day, our thoughts and prayers are with Lydia and the wonderful Heston family. And I know that at this moment he's probably up there playing tennis, which was one of his great loves, and looking down and working to make sure that we, as Members of the United States Congress, and as leaders in our great Nation, do everything that we can to preserve these very, very precious liberties that he loved so dearly. 
   I thank my friend for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend from Dallas for yielding this time, and I thank him for his great, very thoughtful statement on this issue. 
   I have got to say, as I did last night when we met in the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker, that it really saddens me that we are here at this point. It was very proudly in a Republican Congress with a Democratic President that we came together in a bipartisan way to ensure that the very, very underprivileged in this country, children, would have access to health insurance. It is something that existed for 10 years, and we know that there are still children who are in need and we want to do everything that we possibly can to ensure that children have an opportunity to have access to quality health care. Mr. Speaker, this ain't it. This is not the answer. 
   I listened to my friend from Worcester begin this very thoughtful statement about bipartisanship. He mentioned two House Republicans and two Senate Republicans who made this a wonderful bipartisan measure. But I would like to yield to my friend and engage in a colloquy with him, if I might. 
   I see here on the floor the very distinguished ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the committee that has had jurisdiction over this issue. And I would like to inquire of my friend if he knows if the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) was ever invited, as he hails this great spirit of bipartisanship, to any meeting that was held by the majority in attempts to negotiate this measure. I am happy to yield to my friend from Worcester.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for enlightening us on that, Mr. Speaker, and I will simply say that that demonstrates that, as we've heard about this great quest for bipartisanship in dealing with an issue which should have been completely bipartisan, and was when the Republicans were in the majority, I will say. The American people were represented here in a bipartisan way in fashioning a State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, that had, first, a Democratic President, Bill Clinton, sign it, and it was a Republican work product. 
   It saddens me that today we now have a Democratic Congress and a Republican President, and this Republican President is going to veto the measure. Why? Because it dramatically expands the welfare state, undermines the ability for children who are truly in need to get it, and as was pointed out in an Energy and Commerce item, it's a reverse Robin Hood. It takes from the poor with a tax increase, the most regressive tax of all, as was stated by the Congressional Budget Office, and it gives to people who shouldn't even be able to qualify for this program. 
   And that is, I believe, just plain wrong. It is a mischaracterization of what we should see in a SCHIP program. Everybody wants to make this happen. Governors across the country wanted to make it happen. Of course, they want to have access to these resources. And Democrats and Republicans want to make it happen. But this is not the right bill. If Mr. Barton had been able to participate, I'm convinced that we would have, Mr. Speaker, had a very decent bill on this. 
   Now, let me just say that the other thing that really troubles me is what we held our last vote on just a few minutes ago. Let me just very quickly, Mr. Speaker, say that we tried very, very hard at the beginning of this Congress to take the majority at their word when they said there was going to be a great new era of transparency and disclosure and accountability. 
   Well, 10 days ago, Mr. Speaker, we marked the first anniversary of our passing real earmark reform in this institution. What did it say? It said there would be transparency, accountability and disclosure on items, not just appropriations bills, but on authorizing bills and on tax bills. And, unfortunately, in this so-called new era of transparency and disclosure in this new Congress, we completely subvert the notion of transparency and disclosure on earmarks, as is evidenced in this bill. 
   When we in the Rules Committee last night saw the majority, and they all voted, we had a recorded vote on this. They chose to waive the provision that would have, in fact, had an opportunity for disclosure and accountability; and they voted, again, against it right here on the House floor. That's why, as was said by Mr. Rogers earlier, we have a discharge petition so that we can do what we did last September 14, a year ago, and that is have real earmark reform. 
   Vote ``no'' on this rule and ``no'' on the underlying legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to begin by expressing my great appreciation to my very dear friend, the distinguished and very able Chair of the Committee on Rules, my friend from Rochester (Ms. Slaughter). 
   And with all due respect to my distinguished committee Chair, I am compelled, not surprisingly, to rise in the strongest possible opposition to this rule. 
   Over the last 1 1/2 years, my colleagues Messrs. DIAZ-BALART, HASTINGS, and SESSIONS have stood right here at this lectern and opposed many, many deeply flawed rules. We began this Congress very inauspiciously as the leadership jammed through the opening week agenda before even bothering to set up the Rules Committee, allowing Ms. Slaughter to become Chair of that committee. From the very outset, there has been no pretense of concern for due process, not an inkling of respect for the rules of this House. 
   While we started at a low point, we have sunk lower and lower with each subsequent rule. One by one the Democratic leadership has trampled the rules and traditions of this body in an effort to shut down debate, cut both Republicans and Democrats out of the process, and jam through poorly constructed bills that rarely, rarely, if ever, become public law. I frequently marvel at each new low and assume that we have reached the rock bottom. As we have considered new forms of restrictive rules crafted under an ever-more restrictive process, I have often thought, ``This one takes the cake. The Democratic leadership couldn't possibly stoop any lower than this.'' Until the next comes, shutting down due process to an even greater degree. 
   So this time I'm not going to say that this rule is the absolute bottom of the barrel. I don't doubt that with a little more time and effort, based on the track record we've seen, the Democratic leadership will find a way to trample the rules and traditions of this House even more thoroughly. I will say that this is clearly the worst example that we've seen in the last 17 months since they have been in charge. 
   But before I get into the details of this egregious rule, Madam Speaker, I think it's important to discuss why it even matters what kind of a process is used to craft legislation and hold votes. I know the inner workings of the Rules Committee are thought to be so arcane that even some of our colleagues consider them to be a little too ``inside baseball.'' In fact, the distinguished Chair just spent all of her time talking about the bill itself. She didn't talk about the fact that they're trampling on the rights of Republicans and Democrats. Start talking about rules and procedure and regular order, and most Americans' eyes, and even some of our colleagues', start to glaze over. 
   So to illustrate why process matters, I will use another set of rules that are  more widely understood as an example. Even before the advent of the television show Law & Order, most of us were familiar with the basics of our criminal justice system. We're all familiar with our basic rights enshrined in the Constitution. We cannot be held without a charge. We're protected from self-incrimination and unlawful searches and seizures. We must be read our Miranda rights when placed under arrest. These basic rights are fundamental, fundamental, Madam Speaker, to American democracy. We know that there can be no justice without a fair process, and we know that the protection of the rights of the individual is more important than the outcome of any one particular case. 
   The Bill of Rights and the laws that have been enacted to uphold it aren't just a cryptic system of rules and regulations. They guarantee, Madam Speaker, they guarantee our civil rights and they guard against tyranny. Without a fair process, power is abused and rights are abridged. Process matters, Madam Speaker. Process matters because process is democracy. 
   The rules of the House were established for the very same reason. They ensure that the American people, through their elected representatives, have a say in the crafting of laws that govern them. The rules guard against abuses of power, and they ensure that the legislative process is transparent and fair. Thwarting due process is not just arcane political maneuvering around obscure, complicated rules that no one should care about. It subverts the principles of representative democracy. Let me say again, Madam Speaker, the rule that we are considering at this moment very clearly subverts the principles of representative democracy. 
   The Democratic leadership's casual disregard for these rules and principles has faced growing criticism in the media. Last week the Politico accused them of ``breaking promises,'' promises for an open legislative process that followed regular order and the rules of the House. Not surprisingly, the paper cited today's underlying bill, the supplemental appropriations, as Exhibit A in the Democrats' assault on an open and inclusive process, which was promised at the beginning of this Congress. That's not my saying that; that's an independent newspaper that made that statement. 
   Even before the new lows of the supplemental, another publication, Investors Business Daily, reported recently on the leadership's ``widening power grab,'' accusing them of ``anti-democratic'' behavior, running a ``dictatorship,'' and ``showing little or no concern for holding actual votes or building consensus on issues.'' Now, Madam Speaker, those are pretty harsh charges coming from a newspaper that is clearly a very independent publication. And they go on to say that this is all being done in an effort to ``manipulate Congress.'' Madam Speaker, ``dictatorship'' and ``anti-democratic,'' those are pretty harsh words, but they are clearly warranted. 
   The process used to craft the underlying supplemental appropriations bill has been atrocious. Committee work was completely abandoned. Without a single hearing, without a markup, without so much as consulting Mr. Lewis and the committee members, this bill was concocted behind closed doors. Zero input, zero deliberation, zero consultation. The Senate, of course, won't stand for that kind of treatment and intends to hold a markup later today before proceeding with its floor debate. But the Democratic leaders in this House apparently deem this to be a lesser body, with no right to due process. 
   The Democratic leadership intended to bring this bill up last week. They had to pull it from the schedule because fiscally conservative Members within their own caucus were outraged at the contents. A week later, Madam Speaker, a backroom deal has now been struck, bringing the remaining Democratic Members on board. How? Bringing Members on board by imposing a tax on small businesses in this country, which is exactly what this is. You see, Democrats love to stir up class warfare by justifying the small business tax as just a tax on the rich. Unless, of course, we are talking about millionaire farmers, and then they like to give them massive government payouts, which is what they did just yesterday in the farm bill. 
   To add to their inconsistency, they actually waived their own PAYGO rule to fund the farm bill subsidies, and today they refuse to waive the same PAYGO rule and use it as an excuse to levy massive tax increases on small businessmen and women in this country. Only in Washington would such logic be employed. 
   We became aware of the rough outline of this tax increase, along with every other provision of this bill, only through press reports. Some have reported a $183 billion price tag on this bill. Others have said it would be costing at least $250 billion. Various outlets reported on various provisions. But we didn't get a chance to see for ourselves what was in this massive bill until 3 p.m. yesterday. In fact, the distinguished former Chair of the Committee on Appropriations, the now ranking member, my good friend, Mr. Lewis, came before us. Within the hour before that 3 p.m. meeting, he had just gotten the copy of the measure. 
   Most egregious of all, we're not actually considering a bill here today. We will be voting on three amendments to a Senate amendment to an old House bill that has already passed but was never enacted. Did you catch that? If it sounds gimmicky and underhanded, that's because that's exactly what it is. In fact, this morning I heard our colleague Mr. McDermott on National Public Radio, where he said the crafting of this is tantamount to JOHN KERRY's very famous line in which he said ``I voted for it before I voted against it.'' The Democratic leadership knows that a vote on their full package would never pass; so they plotted a way around an actual vote on final passage. 
   For anyone who missed that, let me repeat. The House of Representatives will not be permitted a vote on the full underlying proposal. When Investors Business Daily calls this a dictatorship, they seem to have a point. 
   So what exactly is in this $183-250 billion bill that comes to us without any due process and will pass without a vote? Who can say for sure? But I know that at least $62 billion in new entitlements are included; $11 billion in unemployment insurance, and our friend Mr. Weller will be talking about this in a few minutes; and at least $51 billion in benefits for veterans. Clearly, these are very, very important issues that need to be addressed. 
   I don't doubt that the Democratic majority will try to claim that Republicans don't care about our veterans or those facing economic hardship. We hear that time and time again. To the contrary, these are such critically important issues for us that we passionately believe that we must address them in a serious and deliberative way. It is simply not good enough to slap together a proposal without a single moment of testimony or debate, throw some money at our problems, and call it a day. 
   The very critical issues addressed in this bill, from funding for Iraq and Afghanistan to international food assistance to the tremendously important domestic programs, all of these deserve a substantive, deliberative process. We should have an opportunity to examine which of these are truly emergencies and which should be included in the regular appropriations process. And all of them should have the benefit of an open debate to ensure that we are addressing our priorities effectively. 
   This rule allows for none of this, Madam Speaker. It thwarts the rules and traditions that were put in place to guard against abuses of power, and it blocks consideration of even a single amendment, including the very thoughtful and responsible alternative proposed by the man sitting to my right here, the distinguished ranking member of the committee, Mr. Lewis. He's offered a clean supplemental appropriations bill which simply provides our troops the funding they need without bogging it down with all kinds of unrelated items or adding new policy that prevents them from carrying out their mission. 
   Our hope is to get this critical funding to our troops before Memorial Day, which is fast approaching. That's not an arbitrary deadline and it's not a gimmick. Our military commanders have told us that they desperately need this funding now, and we want to be able to go home for Memorial Day and tell our veterans and our military families that we passed a clean bill that funds our troops and their mission. We  want to tell them we crafted a bill without regard to politics, without regard to providing political cover or fodder for political ads. We simply gave the troops the funding they desperately need. Now, Madam Speaker, that's exactly what the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Lewis, should be able to provide, and I'm going to seek an opportunity for him to do just that. 
   But, unfortunately, the Democratic majority can't advance their flawed policies without shutting down the process. So they prefer closed rules to open debate. They prefer backroom deals to the transparent committee process. They prefer hollow, ill-gotten victories that die after the House vote to substantive, bipartisan legislation that is enacted into law. That's exactly what we need to do, Madam Speaker. 
   So I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I am going to urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, let me yield myself 30 seconds. 
   Let me begin by apologizing to my friend from Wausau. The notion of engaging in debate on the House floor is something I feel strongly about, and I am always happy to yield to people when they make requests for me to yield. I was simply asking my friend to  yield because of the fact that the $40 billion post-9/11 supplemental about which my friend complained and referred to as ``this crowd'' came to this floor under unanimous consent, a bipartisan agreement. 
   And the three supplemental appropriations, Madam Speaker, about which my friend referred, never, never, denied a motion to recommit to the minority. And I ensured as chairman of the Rules Committee at that time the right of the minority would, in fact, be maintained. 
   Madam Speaker, I am very happy to yield 1 minute to my friend from Auburn, Washington, the former sheriff, DAVID REICHERT.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, let me yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Let me say at the outset, and again the last thing I want to do is offend my friend from Wausau by asking him to yield at any point, but I would be happy to yield to him if he wants to respond to what I am about to say. And that is, the fact of the matter is we have in this Congress the single highest number of closed rules in the 219-year history of the Republic. Never before has this, has the United States Congress had such a period of closed rules. I will tell you, it is absolutely outrageous. Why, because we were promised something that was much, much different than that. 
   On a supplemental appropriations bill, my good friend, the chairman of the committee said, ``The majority leadership decide to obliterate the legislative process. They discarded a bipartisan committee product, and they threw in unrelated, partisan political items that characterized a full partisan agenda. They have taken abusive power to a new level.'' 
   Madam Speaker, let me say that when we did that, we provided the minority a right to have a bite at the apple, a motion to recommit. They had an opportunity to offer a proposal. I will tell you it is just plain wrong to see what has been taking place here. 
   I am going to urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question so I can amend the rule to simply give Republicans one simple bite at the apple, something we always guaranteed the now-majority. 
   Mr. Lewis, the ranking member on the Committee on Appropriations, introduced a bill on Tuesday, H.R. 6062, a clean supplemental, to provide troop funding without strings and extraneous spending. If the previous question is defeated, I will amend the rule to make in order an alternative motion to concur by Mr. Lewis which would simply state that the House concurs in the Senate amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of H.R. 6062. This way the House has the opportunity to send the Senate a clean supplemental to get our troops the money that they desperately need without the hocus-pocus, three-in-one vote political gamesmanship that we have before us at this moment.     
   It's simply the right thing for us to do to send that clean supplemental.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (LUMBEE RECOGNITION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to join my very distinguished colleague from Miami, Mr. Diaz-Balart, in not only opposing this rule but opposing the previous question on this. I am going to explain that in just a moment. 
   Mr. Diaz-Balart went through and gave a very, very good summation of where we stand on this issue of openness, transparency and disclosure; and his reference to the December 6, 2006, quote from our distinguished Speaker, my fellow Californian, underscores the fact that everyone can talk about the issue of openness, transparency and disclosure. But when it comes to granting it, it's very sad and really a very sad day for this institution. 
   Now I know that there has regularly been a lot of criticism over the way we as Republicans managed this institution for the 12 years leading up to last November's election, but I like to remind our colleagues that, whatever criticism they want to level at us, it's not about what we did, it's about what they promised they were going to do. That's really the sad thing here, the promises that were made, in fact, have not been kept. I think that's evidenced, as Mr. Diaz-Balart said, by virtue of the fact that we were going to have all of these open rules, and at this moment we are considering the second totally closed rule of the day, meaning that no Member will have the opportunity to offer any amendment whatsoever as we consider this measure. 
   In the last Congress, we were proud of the fact that we were able to take on what was a bipartisan concern, that being the abuse that we saw of earmarks. We all know what that consists of. It has been reported very, very widely, the abuse of earmarks; and that played a role in leading us, in the last Congress, to respond. 
   I am very proud in the 109th Congress we were able to pass major earmark reform that got at the issue of transparency and disclosure and, most important, enforceability, making sure that Members of this House, Democrat or Republican, stand up on the floor and raise a question and bring to the attention of this House an earmark that should be brought to the light of day. 
   We heard that the reforms that were passed at the beginning of this Congress were going to build on what we did in the last Congress and ``improve'' on the earmark reform that we passed in the 109th Congress. 
   Let me say again, as I did when we considered the last rule, every Member of this House, Democrat and Republican alike, will in just a few minutes have an opportunity to vote on whether or not we believe the earmark reform that has been touted very widely is going to be enforced. That's the vote we are going to face. 
   What it consists of is Mr. Diaz-Balart will move to defeat the previous question so that we will simply have an opportunity to make it in order to consider an amendment that will allow us to enforce this much-ballyhooed earmark reform process. 
   Now, in the last rules debate, I quoted Ronald Reagan, and I quoted Ronald Reagan because during the discussion of the arms buildup and our negotiations with the former Soviet Union, Ronald Reagan used a Russian expression, and that Russian expression is ``doveryai, no proveryai.'' 
   I have to say that my Russian has improved between the debate on the last rule and the debate that we are holding right now, because I got it a little turned around. But thanks to our first-rate staff here we went on to the Internet and found the exact Russian expression: ``doveryai, no proveryai.'' Now, what that means is trust, but verify. 
   Everyone here has talked about the need for us to again have greater transparency, disclosure, accountability and enforcement on the issue of earmarks. Unfortunately, the rule that was passed in this 110th Congress, which was designed to improve on what we did in the 109th Congress, not only doesn't improve, it denies, it denies every Republican and every Democrat in this House an opportunity to come forward and, in fact, let the institution have the chance to determine whether or not this is a justifiable earmark. 
   A couple of examples most recently, we saw the clash that took place between the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, our friend, Mr. Murtha of Pennsylvania, and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Rogers). That was a very unfortunate part of the consideration of the intelligence authorization bill. 
   Then we saw the quote, the statement that was made by the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, Mr. Obey, who has announced that we are not going to be considering earmarks in the appropriations process itself, earmarks are only allowed to be airdropped into the appropriations conference reports, again, again further blurring the opportunity for Members to have, in full view, these earmarks. 
   Let me say once again we are going to give every Member of this House, in just a few minutes, the chance to vote on whether or not you believe there should be an opportunity for greater enforceability, transparency and disclosure of these earmarks that have been put into place. That promise was made early on; and, unfortunately, it has not been kept. We are going to give Members a chance to decide whether or not that promise should be kept. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question, and that ``no'' vote on the previous question will again allow Mr. Diaz-Balart the opportunity to offer this very thoughtful amendment that should enjoy very strong bipartisan support. 
   I thank again my friend from Miami for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to stand here as someone who is supportive of embryonic stem cell research. I have voted in support of this research in the past, and I plan to vote for it again today when this measure is brought up. 
   But I have to say that as I listened to my very good friend from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) speak on this issue, and I will say again to him that, as he knows, I am a supporter of stem cell research and I will be voting in support of this bill, I'm absolutely horrified by the remarks that were just made by my colleague from Massachusetts. Why? Because just yesterday he stood here during the debate on the Afghanistan Freedom Act rule and said there that we're now enjoying a new day in the House of Representatives, and yet, we today are considering this rule under a completely closed process, shutting out all Members, Democrats, Republicans alike, who might want to have an opportunity to make some kind of amendment or modification to this process. 
   Further, Mr. McGovern went on to talk about the fact that there is a very important institution in his congressional district that will be the beneficiary of the funding that is provided  for this research, and that gets right to the point that I believe is a very important one for us to make. 
   Well, we continue, Mr. Speaker, to hear this argument that it's a new day in this Congress. I am very, very troubled over a number of issues and over the fact that nothing, nothing could be further from the case. 
   Now, we've heard both sides of the aisle talk about the need for earmark reform, and that's the reason that I just raised the issue of Mr. McGovern's hospital to be a beneficiary of this bill. I'm wondering whether or not that's an earmark that we're considering. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I'm very proud of the fact that, in the 109th Congress, we passed major earmark reform legislation. It was earmark reform legislation that had enforceability and full accountability, and we heard Democrats say that they wanted to, quote/unquote, improve on the earmark reform that we proudly put into place in the 109th Congress. 
   The real tragedy here, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that we not only have seen no improvement on the issue of earmark reform, but what has happened? We have seen a retrograde step taken on the issue of accountability and enforceability. 
   And let me explain that to my colleagues and then proceed to say that Mr. Sessions will be moving to defeat the previous question, and if the House sees fit to defeat the previous question on this issue, Mr. Speaker, what we will do is we will offer an amendment, an amendment that will finally bring about the kind of enforceability that we passed in the 109th Congress but, through sleight of hand by the House Committee on Rules, has been denied every Democrat and every Republican in this institution. 
   And so let me make it very clear, as we complete this debate and go into a vote on the previous question, any Member of this institution who votes in favor of the previous question to end debate will be, in fact, denying an opportunity for us to have accountability, enforceability and transparency on this issue of earmark reform. 
   Now, what is it that we've seen reported to us on this earmark process that is going to be moving ahead in the days and weeks and months ahead? We've already seen abuse in the Intelligence authorization bill that we had, and I'm not going to get into the details of that. Everyone knows we had a major clash that took place here between our colleague from Michigan (Mr. Rogers) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha). We all know about that. 
   But what is on the horizon for us, Mr. Speaker? What's on the horizon is the fact that the very distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin, the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, has already announced, when it comes to the issue of earmarks, we're not going to be doing it in the appropriations process. How is it that earmarks are going to be able to get into the bill? They're going to be air dropped into conference reports. Now, it's very difficult to imagine a more secretive process for earmarks than to have them air dropped into conference reports. 
   But now let's again look at what we did in the 109th Congress and what we're going to propose if Mr. Sessions is successful at defeating the previous question. 
   What is going to happen, Mr. Speaker, is we're simply going to say that there should be an opportunity for enforcement. Again, we had that enforcement provision in the earmark reform that we passed in the 109th Congress, but that has been completely denied. Mr. Speaker, no Democrat, no Republican can stand up, and if a list is not provided of those earmarks, raise a question about that. If the chairman has simply said, there are no earmarks, there is no opportunity today under the action that has been taken by this Democratic Congress, whether they have said they're for earmark reform and accountability and transparency, they, in fact, deny that. 
   And so all we're saying, Mr. Speaker, is let's give Democrats and Republicans an equal opportunity to do what it is that the American people have said should be done. We want to bring an end to wasteful spending and abuse of this so-called earmark process. 
   So there's going to be an opportunity. There's going to be an opportunity in just a few minutes for every single Member of this institution, Democrat and Republican alike, to decide whether or not we're going to build on the success that we had in the 109th Congress with accountability, enforceability and transparency on earmark reform, or will we, in fact, allow a secretive process which encourages abuse to proceed. 
   Now, I'm old enough, Mr. Speaker, to have served here when Ronald Reagan was President of the United States. In his negotiations with the Soviet Union, he used a Russian expression. ``Doveryai, no proveryai,'' was the Russian expression that he used. And what did that translate to? ``Trust, but verify.'' And that's exactly what this debate comes down to, Mr. Speaker: Trust, but verify, because I hear Democrats and Republicans alike say that we need to have full accountability and we need to bring an end to abuse of the earmark process. But we need to have a process of verification. We need to have a process that will allow us to ferret out the kind of abuse that we've already seen in the 110th Congress to this earmark process.     
   Again, I am going to encourage a ``no'' vote on the previous question. Mr. Sessions will be encouraging that at the end. When, because I am an eternal optimist, like Ronald Reagan, when we defeat the previous question, all we will be doing is saying that we should come back to the kind of accountability, transparency, and enforceability of the earmark reform to which everyone seems to be so strongly committed.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 502, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend from the Big D recognizing me, and I thank both of my friends for their management of this rule. 
   I have got to clear my throat, Madam Speaker, because it was last night and early this morning that we had a freewheeling, very passionate, vigorous debate that took place on the Foreign Operations appropriations bill, as we all know. And we are here this morning addressing an issue which traditionally has, in a bipartisan way, been recognized that, as a measure to avoid demagoguery, should be brought up under a structured rule. It is the only appropriations bill that both Democrats and Republicans alike have recognized all along that we should do, and I am happy to say that we are proceeding with the other appropriations bills under an open amendment process. 
   I will say that I am very, very troubled, very troubled, with the way that this has been handled. My friend from California has just said that this is a discussion that has been going on and on. We seem to have this same discussion back and forth. And I will tell my friend we could end it right here, we could end it right here if, in fact, as the gentleman from Dallas has just said, the promises that were made in last year's election were, in fact, kept. We don't have to continue to have this kind of debate over the rule if we would see the kind of compliance with the commitments that were made to the American people. 
   Now, let me just say what did happen in the past on the issue of the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. As Mr. Sessions has just said, 100 percent of the amendments that were proposed last year were, in fact, made in order. And the year before, the gentleman is absolutely right, there were 11 amendments submitted, but the gentleman said only 1 amendment was made in order. No. One Democratic amendment was made in order of the 11 amendments, but there were Republican  amendments proposed, too, and there were 4 amendments made in order. So what I am saying is that this notion that somehow 11 Democratic amendments were submitted to the Committee on Rules and only 1 Democratic amendment made in order? That is wrong. 
   The fact of the matter is we have worked very hard to ensure that every Member who has come forward with a responsible, thoughtful amendment that should be debated on the legislative branch appropriations bill could, in fact, have that opportunity. And that is what has happened in the past. I am very proud to say that last year every single amendment submitted to the committee was made in order. This year 23 amendments were submitted to the Rules Committee, 23 amendments. And how many were made in order? It is very sad. Only three amendments were made in order. 
   Now, let's look at some of the amendments that were denied, Madam Speaker. The distinguished chairman, former chairman, of the Legislative Branch appropriations subcommittee, Mr. Kingston, is here, and he came before the Rules Committee with some very thoughtful amendments. 
   Now, my friend from California has just talked about the issue of the Visitors Center. Mr. Kingston, who has consistently raised very important questions about that in the past, said that we don't need to put $16 million, which, as was said in the dissenting views on this issue, is the tip of the iceberg, creating a chance to spend well in excess of $50 million, at the minimum of $55 million, for another building with an additional 200,000 square feet behind the Ford Building over here. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, we are going to have an additional half a million square feet when we see completion of this Congressional Visitors Center. We all hope that it happens in our lifetime, but I will say that we are going to have an additional 500,000 square feet. And I know my friend from California said he has just been there. 
   And, by the way, I should extend congratulations to the gentlewoman from Florida for the great job that she has done in working closely with Mr. Wamp on this issue. She testified, Madam Speaker, before the Rules Committee, and I appreciate her diligence on this, and I suspect that she would be somewhat concerned as well that the opportunity for an amendment process like the one that we have had in the past is being denied to a number of our Members, both Democrats and Republicans alike. 
   Mr. Kingston, the former chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, also offered an amendment calling for the Basic Pilot Program to be included, dealing with this notion that we impose on everybody else, Madam Speaker, the requirement that they comply with the Basic Pilot Program when it comes to this very serious issue of illegal immigration, and yet we are free of having to comply with that within the first branch of government. I think that is an absolute mistake, and that is what Mr. Kingston has been trying to address with his amendment. 
   One of the amendments that troubled me most that was not made in order came from a very distinguished Democratic Member of this institution. I am proud of the fact that he represents my parents in Kansas City, Missouri. It is Reverend Emanuel Cleaver, who came before the Rules Committee, Madam Speaker, and he said that he had been told by staff not to offer the amendment. He was very concerned about being there, and he said that he was somewhat confused, and, understandably, that does happen on occasion. I just told one of my staff members that the moment they tell me to do something, I automatically and instinctively do the opposite. But what happened in his case was that he felt somewhat concerned about coming before the Committee on Rules when so many people had told him not to do it. 
   I have never seen a situation like this, Madam Speaker. The Chair of the Rules Committee Ms. Slaughter had to say to Mr. Cleaver that he was welcome at any time to come before the Rules Committee and offer an amendment. I thought that that was just a right that every Member in this institution had. And, unfortunately, while we made Mr. Cleaver's amendment in order in the last Congress, this new majority refused to allow Mr. Cleaver the opportunity to even have his amendment heard, even have it debated here, Madam Speaker. 
   And that is why Mr. Sessions is going to offer an opportunity, if we can, to defeat the previous question, to take the Cleaver amendment, which deals with the very important priority that has been set forth by our Speaker that looks at the environmental standards for this institution. Mr. Cleaver simply says that prospectively we should have flex-fuel or hybrid vehicles purchased through the Members' representational accounts. It is an issue that should be debated here on the House floor. Again, we made that amendment in order last year, and it has been denied the opportunity this year. 
   One other thing that I will say again that is very troubling about this so-called new era of openness. Our colleague from West Virginia, a very distinguished former member of the Committee on Rules, tried to submit an amendment to the Rules Committee, and Shelley Moore Capito was denied that opportunity at the door to even submit her amendment, recognizing that she was a few minutes, I think right around 30 minutes, beyond the imposed deadline. I think the flexibility for Members is something that we always recognized, but has been denied here. But to have a former member of the Rules Committee denied an opportunity to even submit the amendment is, to me, Madam Speaker, undermining this entire spirit of openness. 
   So, Madam Speaker, let me say I am going to encourage my colleagues to support Mr. Sessions in his quest to defeat the previous question so that we can give Emanuel Cleaver an opportunity to offer the amendment that was denied him by the Rules Committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   And let me, if I could, just respond to a couple of his points. First of all, the gentleman has offered some very thoughtful arguments on this issue, and I think that the fact that he has made these arguments underscores why the Rules Committee should have, in fact, allowed a debate on these issues to proceed. 
   He began by talking about how unworkable the amendment that Mr. Cleaver has put forward by virtue of the fact that California has only two of these E85 stations. I know that the Cleaver amendment provides options, a hybrid vehicle, which the gentleman drives and obviously is able to get fuel very easily, and the option of looking at the flex-fuel vehicles. And, obviously, if it is a flex-fuel vehicle, it has the ability to use others. They don't have to go to those two stations that exist in California. 
   And I think that, again, that underscores the fact that we should be having this debate. We made it in order in the last Congress, and, unfortunately, they chose not to make it in order. 
   And on the issue of the additional building, he has raised a lot of interesting arguments about that. Mr. Kingston would simply like to have a chance, as a former chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Legislative Branch, to debate it. 
   I thank my friend for yielding, and I will just say that I wish we would have a chance to have a free-flowing debate on this.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I just want to say I am somewhat concerned with the whole tenor of this debate. My California colleague has stood here through the entire debate not yielding time to a single Member, talking about the fact that we are going to have this freewheeling debate. I asked him to yield to me, when he obviously has a great load of time. Madam Speaker, he chose not to yield. That is clearly his right. But if we are interested in at least a modicum of civility in the debate, I always try my darnedest to yield to any colleague who asks me to yield during debate, because I think that is what we should do around here. 
   I was simply going to respond when my friend said that Mr. Price was here decrying the fact that his amendment was not made in order, which had a more modest cut than the one that has been made in order under the Jordan amendment, that maybe some Members would determine that the $275 million figure to which my friend referred earlier, being below the President's request, is not quite enough, but that maybe the Jordan amendment is too much. 
   Mr. Price simply wanted to have a chance, Madam Speaker, to say, gosh, maybe a little more modest cut than the one that is in the Jordan amendment should be considered. 
   So, I just want to say that I, again, as Mr. Price said so well during this debate, promises were made about a new sense of openness. It is very, very unfortunate that those promises have not been kept, Madam Speaker.

   Madam Speaker, I would simply like to ask my friend, if a $4 billion increase  is, in fact, a 6.76-percent increase over last year's funding level, which does round out to be a 7-percent increase in the spending over last year's funding level, I just ask my friend from Dallas if that, in fact, is correct?

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 985, WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to begin by thanking my friend from Miami and my friend from Fort Lauderdale. We have got this Sun Belt linkage now here. The only thing in between it was somebody from upstate New York there. And I know he likes that better than Los Angeles, as he told me up in the Rules Committee just before we were going into our last break. But I am proud that there are three of us at least who come from the Sun Belt who are representing this debate on this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do rise to reluctantly oppose both the rule and the underlying legislation. The bill is very well-intentioned, and it is designed to clarify and expand the laws regarding those who try to expose waste, fraud and mismanagement in the Federal Government. 
   Whistleblowers, oftentimes, put their jobs at risk to expose wrongdoing in the workplace, and whistleblowers are absolutely crucial to our Nation's security, safety and success as well. I believe very much that their protection is an inherent right for all employees, and it needs to be maintained. 
   In addition, the whistleblower protections enable Congress to fulfill our constitutional responsibility of overseeing the executive branch. It is imperative that we do that. We need to recognize that we are a separate and coequal branch of our Federal Government. We have a right to know the actions of the executive branch and to oversee the implementation of the laws that we create as Members of this body, and whistleblowers are a very crucial part of that. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I do support the idea of expanding and modernizing whistleblower protection laws. But, unfortunately, I believe that this legislation ends up falling short of that very important goal to which I believe we all aspire. 
   The bill aims to extend whistleblower protections to Federal workers who specialize in national security issues. These workers include employees of the FBI, the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, among others. Unfortunately, the bill raises significant national security concerns that have really led me to conclude that I can't support this bill in its present form. 
   Within its oversight obligations, Mr. Speaker, Congress is tasked with protecting highly classified intelligence programs. It is absolutely critical for us to ensure that any oversight is conducted by Members and staff with the appropriate experience and expertise. 
   Now, this bill, in its current form, compromises that duty and outlines new procedures that have the potential to expose highly classified national security programs and information. 
   Now, during the Rules Committee hearing yesterday, an amendment was offered by the ranking member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Mr. Hoekstra. And I just heard my friend from Fort Lauderdale, who has served very ably as a member of the Intelligence Committee, as well as on the Rules Committee, say that there is another amendment designed to address this. 
   But, frankly, I believe very strongly that the amendment that was filed in a timely manner by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra) was one that was not made in order, and I believe really best takes on this issue of dealing with a better way to ensure the security of this important, very important information. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, 10 amendments were offered at the Rules Committee, and while I commend the majority for making five of those 10 amendments in order, I do believe that an open rule would have been more appropriate. Give the Members of this body the opportunity to offer amendments to important pieces of legislation like this, not just on noncontroversial bills, which is what we have seen the open rule procedure used for in the past. 
   At the very least, Mr. Speaker, I think we should have made all 10 of the amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee in order so that we could have had a free flowing debate on these, and we would have had a chance for people like the ranking member of the committee of jurisdiction here, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. Davis, who served very ably as the chairman of that committee before we saw last November's election make this change. This former chairman, the now ranking member, sought to offer an amendment, and he also was denied a chance to offer that amendment. 
   I do commend my California colleague, Mr. Waxman, the distinguished chairman of the committee, as well as Mr. Davis, for their hard work and expertise on this very critical issue. Unfortunately, I believe that the bill does, as I say, fall short of that goal. The goal really is an important one, as I said, to ensure that whistleblowers help us meet our constitutional responsibility for oversight of the executive branch. 
   But the national security concerns that have been raised I think are such that, in its present form, I am not going to be able to support this measure. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I do urge my colleagues to vote against this rule. And as I said, I am troubled enough that the bill itself, in its current form, is not legislation that I can support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend from Pasco for yielding to me. And I thank him for his management of this rule, as well as my new friend from New York (Mr. Arcuri). 
   I have to say that I'm glad that there is bipartisan concern voiced about security, and I appreciate the remarks that my friend from New York has just made, Mr. Speaker, about the issue of ensuring that we provide security for our children and for anyone who possibly could face the challenge of being a victim of crime in this country. 
   The fact of the matter is I am very, very supportive of the notion that Mr. Hastings is putting forward here that we need to do everything that we can to prevent those who want to, en masse, kill us, as Americans, from being able to do that. 
   Now, it was 1978, Mr. Speaker, during the Cold War, that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was put into place. It was designed to deal with what today is very, very antiquated technology. I mean, I remember when we had this debate before about the notion of being able to follow one single telephone line that is out there. Well, when all we had were hard lines and one telephone line, courts would get a warrant to follow that one phone line because that's the only way people could communicate. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, we all know that the world, when it comes to telecommunications, certainly is a heck of a lot different than it was 30 years ago, 29 years ago, 1978. 
   And what is it that we're saying? 
   Mr. Hastings is saying that, in recognition of the statements that were made most recently by the Secretary of Homeland Security Mr. Chertoff, that there is a higher level of chatter, and we need to do what we can to monitor it; coupled with statements made by the Director of National Intelligence, Director McConnell, who's made it very, very clear that we are today blind and deaf when it comes to the ability to monitor not people here in the United States, Mr. Speaker, we're talking about people who are foreigners and who are trying to do us in. 
   And so Mr. Hastings is simply saying that what we need to do is defeat the previous question so that we can make in order a chance for us to deal with the issue of modernization of that three-decade-old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which today hamstrings us when it comes to the need for us to try and prevent terrorists from killing Americans. It's just that simple. And that kind of modification, that kind of modernization, that kind of reform is absolutely essential if we're going to have the tools necessary to successfully prosecute the war on terror. 
   And so I believe that every Member, Democrat and Republican alike, who's concerned about our need to ensure that people who are overseas and want to do us in, and that we cannot monitor, we should be able to do just that. And I think most thinking Americans believe that having the capability to monitor those in Iran, in Syria and in other countries who would want to do us in, that they should, in fact, be monitored, and we should get that information. 
   Now, this bill itself does, as my friend from Pasco has said, have a number of good things in it. It has some very, very important items that will help us deal with the challenge of crime that exists in this country, and obviously it provides very important funding for a high priority that I have, and that is NASA funding. The jet propulsion laboratory in La Canada Flint Ridge, California, is a very important facility which has made great strides with its Mars program and a wide range of other programs that they're involved in. 
   Mr. Speaker, this program also has funding for something that I believe is essential for us to realize, and it's on an issue that this place has debated time and time again, and it's one that we're still struggling over, and that is the issue of border security and the problem of illegal immigration. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I'm going to be offering an amendment when this bill proceeds which will allow us to actually increase the funding for what is known as the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP. 
   Now, one of the things we found, we put this program into place in the mid-1990s, and we found that State and local governments are, in fact, shouldering the responsibility, the financial burden, of the incarceration of people who are in this country illegally and commit crimes. In my county alone of Los Angeles, the cost is $150 million a year, according to my friend who's the sheriff of Los Angeles County. He's said that to me repeatedly; $150 million a year to incarcerate people who are in this country illegally and have perpetrated crimes against our citizenry. 
   It's not the responsibility of the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles or the State of California to shoulder that financial burden. The protection of international borders lies with the Federal Government, Washington, D.C., and that's why we have the SCAAP program. 
   We need to secure our borders. We need to take the responsibility for securing our borders. And because we have not done that yet, and I still am optimistic about our chance to do that, we need to make sure that we reimburse the States and counties and cities that are, in fact, responsible for the financial burden today of incarceration of those people who are in this country illegally and have perpetrated crimes against us. 
   And so I will be offering that amendment. We'll be transferring monies, Mr. Speaker, out of the administrative expenses of the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice, and I hope that we will be able to have strong bipartisan support. 
   I will say I'm very proud that our California delegation has, in years past, come together, Republicans and Democrats, working together to increase the level of funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. Last year I was proud to have offered an amendment that had a $50 million increase for the SCAAP funding level that brought it to the $405 million level where it is today, and we had Democrats and Republicans joining in support of the amendment that I offered. 
   I hope very much, Mr. Speaker, that once again this year we'll have Democrats and Republicans who will join in support of the amendment that I will be offering that will have that increase in the funding level for SCAAP, so that we will be able to say to State and local governments that you are not going to be totally responsible for shouldering that burden. 
   So I thank my friend for yielding. I want to join, again, in urging a ``no'' vote on the previous question so that we can make this very important amendment in order for FISA reform. And I hope that when we do get to consideration of the bill itself, that we'll have strong bipartisan support for the very important amendment that I'm going to be offering to increase funding for SCAAP.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment. 
   I would like to first express my appreciation first to Chairman Mollohan and to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and to the members of the Appropriations Committee for increasing the level of funding within the committee. 
   My colleague Mr. Carter, who is a coauthor of this amendment and was involved in this, in the work of the Appropriations Committee, I have to finally say we brought the level of the committee funding to exactly $405 million, which is where we actually had it last year. 
   I would say I was very pleased in working with then-chairman Jerry Lewis and other members of the Appropriations Committee in the 109th Congress to add an additional $50 million to the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. We got to that $405 million level. This year we are at the same level thanks to the work of Messrs. MOLLOHAN, FRELINGHUYSEN, CARTER, and others who have been involved in this. 
   This was an issue that actually came to the forefront in 1994 when a number of us felt very strongly about the fact that cities, counties and States are not responsible for protecting international borders. It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to secure our Nation's borders. 
   It saddens me greatly that here we are, 13 years later, still struggling with the issue of securing our borders. Ms. Zoe Lofgren, the distinguished Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, has spent a great deal of time reaching out to me and others working on our effort to try to deal with this issue of border security and bringing an end to illegal immigration. 
   I will say that we haven't gotten there yet, as we found from the actions or lack of actions so far in the other body, and, frankly, in this House as well, on the issue. What we do know is it is still the responsibility of the Federal Government to secure our Nation's borders. That is why we should not, as a Federal Government, be imposing on cities, townships, counties or States the responsibility for incarcerating those who have come into this country illegally and have committed crimes against our fellow Americans.     
   I happen to live in Los Angeles County, and our county alone, the cost for incarcerating people who are in this country illegally and have committed crimes is in excess of $150 million a year.  
   The level of funding in this program is $405 million right now. If we are successful, which I suspect we will be, with passage of this amendment, we will add $55 million taken from accounts which I know concern the distinguished ranking member and I suspect the chairman as well, deal with the $5 million from the construction fund for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the administrative funds in both the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice. 
   Mr. Chairman, we feel very strongly that as we look at the challenge of securing our borders, of ending illegal immigration, and of creating, creating a degree of equity when we look at the costs inflicted on local and State taxpayers, we need to pass this amendment. 
   We know that as we look at the challenges ahead, the costs are going to continue to be very, very high, as I said, with my county alone at $150 million. And the total program will end up, assuming passage of this amendment, to be $460 million for the entire country. We still have a ways to go. 
   I was very pleased, Mr. Chairman, in the 109th Congress, as I said, to have offered this amendment. I was hoping in the 109th Congress to have built the kind of bipartisan support that we enjoy for this amendment. I was saddened that we weren't able to do that, but we were nevertheless able to succeed in passing that and at the end of the day actually have that funding level increased. But as the problem continues, it is essential that we step up to the plate and take on our responsibility for dealing with this issue. 
   So once again, Mr. Chairman, I express my appreciation to all involved. The lead author of this amendment, Ms. Zoe Lofgren, has worked, as I said, on the immigration issue for a long period of time, and I believe that she is going a long way towards addressing this question.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. And, Mr. Chairman, I will again state my great appreciation to the distinguished chairman from West Virginia and the gentleman from New Jersey. And the gentleman from New Jersey has just bragged on the States of Texas and California, and I will reciprocate by bragging on both New Jersey and West Virginia and saying that they're both great and very important States. 
   And I suspect that in West Virginia and New Jersey, the challenge of trying to deal with the cost of the incarceration of people who are in this country illegally and have committed crimes is a very serious and important one, and I recognize the sensitivity. 
   I personally am not a huge proponent, as I said earlier in response to the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee's comments on the Legal Services Corporation when he was testifying before our Rules Committee. And as I look at the numbers for both of these accounts, and I know that my friend from New Jersey, when the chairman and the ranking member were testifying before the Rules Committee, argued for a slightly, he said that he believed that the level overall could be slightly lower. And I looked at the level of funding, and the gentleman is absolutely right. I am a huge proponent of trade, breaking down barriers, and I want to do everything that I possibly can to expand export opportunities for the United States around the world. 
   But as I look at the level of funding, Mr. Chairman, for both the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce actually has a 7 percent increase over the President's request, 6 percent of the level of funding last year. That's $468 million more than has been requested by the President, and that's in the case of the Commerce Department. In the case of the Department of Justice, it's $1.7 billion more than the President has requested. 
   Now, in both of these areas we know that the President is absolutely committed to dealing with the crime problem, which is a very serious one, and obviously with the issue of expanding trade opportunities. And the overall level of funding in both of these areas is significantly higher than what was expended last year and what the President's request level is. 
   And I think that as we look at establishing priorities, it, from my perspective, is relatively, relatively, and I'll say that a third time, relatively easy. And I know how tough it is for the two gentlemen who manage this area to find that State Criminal Alien Assistance Program funding is, in fact, a  very high priority for both Democrats and Republicans, as I said, for people in both West Virginia and New Jersey, as well as California and Texas and, frankly, all across the country. And so I would hope that as we move ahead with this process, that we'll see support in this House for this amendment. 
   And I know that as the two gentlemen head to working with our colleagues in the other body and ultimately with the administration, I hope that we will be able to keep this issue on the forefront as a very important priority.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Dallas for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come to the well for the exact same reason that our California colleague, the distinguished Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, has taken time, and that is to talk about what many have described as probably the worst fire that has ever hit Southern California. 
   I was just talking to the dean of our delegation, Mr. Lewis, who is going to be returning to California. I know a number of our colleagues have gone now. He represents the Lake Arrowhead area where Governor Schwarzenegger and other elected officials are looking at this situation. 
   As the Speaker pointed out, 365,000 people have been evacuated from their homes, and literally hundreds of thousands of acres have been burned. And Mr. Lewis just reminded me that one of the things that we can be extraordinarily grateful for is that we have been able to learn from previous fires how to deal with this. For example, we've had an increase in the number of what are known as the Mobile Airborne Firefighting System aircraft, the MAFS, which are going to be coming from other States. And we, as Californians, are very grateful for the fact that other States are working with us to deal with California's challenge in this time of need. 
   There are other environmental issues with which we've had to contend, the bark beetle that Mr. Lewis just mentioned, and making sure that we are able to go in and clean up areas which create the potential for fire. And so we've learned a lot from the horrible  circumstances that we have faced in the past. And I'm convinced, Mr. Speaker that we will, in fact, learn from this tragedy as well. 
   Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost their homes. And if there is any kind of silver lining, when you think about the fact that 365,000 people have been evacuated, hundreds of thousands of acres, countless structures in the hundreds have been obliterated, and yet the report now is that there is only one loss of life. And obviously there are a number of firefighters who have been injured. According to a report I just saw on the television, another 25 individuals have been injured, and our thoughts and prayers are with them. But we are very grateful for those who have stepped up.     
   Governor Schwarzenegger just, Mr. Speaker, talked about the fact that at this time of need, calling on those in the grocer industry and a wide range of others coming in and providing water, diapers, baby formula, other foodstuffs that are necessary for those who have been evacuated and those who are engaged in firefighting is something that has really been remarkable, as our Governor just said. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I have to tell you that one of the things that I have been struck with is that, while some people try to make things like this partisan, we are coming together as a State delegation to deal with this. As I said, a number of our colleagues have already gone to California. I know some members of the San Diego delegation, because that area has been hit particularly hard, have already gone. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to express my appreciation to those who are on the front lines and to say, as our Governor has, again, we have all come together to try to provide assistance, and the one thing we need to do now is pray for an improvement in both the wind and create the potential for some rain, if that's at all possible, to help provide some kind of relief, and to again state that at this time of disaster we want every level of government as well as individuals to continue to work together, and I am convinced that we will be able to.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I obviously join my colleagues, rising in strong opposition to this closed rule, which did not allow for any kind of deliberation whatsoever. 
   I have to begin by saying that I am somewhat troubled at the fact that we continue to see this pattern of name calling from the other side of the aisle. 
   We recognize that we have begun a new Congress. I am very proud, as a Californian, that we have the first Californian and the first woman Speaker of the House of Representatives. I am very proud of that fact and I think it is a great thing. I am proud that our State has been able to do that. And she is the first Italian American Speaker of the House of Representative, and she always likes to state that, and I congratulate her for that. 
   I believe we need to, as members of the minority, give the benefit of the doubt to this new majority. It has been 12 years since they have been in the majority, and I think we should provide an opportunity for people to understand their new roles in this institution. But I have to say that while we have continued to have name calling--and the distinguished chair of the Rules Committee has just said that for the last 12 years the Rules Committee was dishonest. I don't know exactly what that means. I am very proud of the record that we have had the last 12 years in the majority in the Rules Committee, and I am proud of the fact that we have been able to put together strong policies to encourage economic growth in this country, we have been able to ensure that we have not had an attack on our soil since September 11. These kinds of policies have come from committees in the Congress, through the Rules Committee to the floor, and I am proud of that fact. So I don't know exactly what it means to simply say the Rules Committee has been dishonest for the last 12 years. We all know that there has been a lot of name calling that has come from the other side of the aisle. 
   I have to say, Mr. Speaker, that we are at a point right now where it is important for us to recognize that it is not about what we did, it is about what the new majority promised they were going to do. 
   Now, the distinguished Republican leader stood here and talked about the fact that we have, over the past several days, gone through this process right now; it has been under a closed rule. Yes, Speaker Pelosi announced there would be no opportunity for debate and discussion through the regular order process. So that was an announcement that was made. As the Republican leader said, the Chair of the Rules Committee announced before the process even began that we were going to have closed rules on both the education bill and on this energy bill. I have to say that it is a troubling indication because it is 180 degrees from what was promised by the new majority when they were in the midst of their campaign. 
   I have to also say, Mr. Speaker, I heard the gentleman from Massachusetts get up and congratulate our friend from Miami for having supported a couple of the items. I am proud that I have supported a number of these items. I think something important to note is that at least half of the items in the Six for `06 were voted on and passed by the Republican Congress. Stem cell research, in a bipartisan way, passed. It would not have come to the floor had the Republican leadership not seen fit to bring it to the floor. 
   On the issue of the minimum wage, we brought to the House floor, Mr. Speaker, the issue of increasing the minimum wage. We simply said that we should recognize that those who create jobs might want to have the wherewithal to pay those people the minimum wage. And so we had a vote on that. 
   Earmark reform. We are very proud of the fact that last fall we passed very broad-sweeping earmark reform that enjoyed bipartisan support here. 
   So what we are doing in many ways on this Six for `06, Mr. Speaker, is simply voting again on initiatives that passed in a Republican Congress. 
   I also have to say that we passed lots of energy legislation in the past, and we have been able to see a reduction in oil costs. Oil prices are dropping right now. We continue to see that, and that is because of the fact that we want to encourage alternative sources and attaining domestic energy self-sufficiency. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is just important for us to take a moment to look at this issue of fairness and balance and recognize that we do want to work in a bipartisan way, but the issue of this name calling I think should come to an end, and let's try to look to the future rather than the past.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule, and the underlying legislation, H.R.  6, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. I am a firm believer that Congress should do everything possible to address the Nation's energy needs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil while still protecting the environment and maintaining reasonable energy prices. I believe, however, that this bill falls short of fulfilling this responsibility. Not only that, the Democrats have shut out any hope of fixing the bill's problems by reporting a closed rule for H.R. 6. 
   The basis of this bill is very simple--it raises taxes on domestic oil producers and then turns around and spends that money to subsidize ethanol, solar energy, and windmills. In the process, Democrats also want to tell the market how to work. Common sense would tell us that if you increase the cost of domestic oil production by $10 billion, you are ensuring that U.S. imports of foreign oil will rise and domestic production will fall. These are basic market principles. 
   Consumers want affordable gas prices, Mr. Speaker, and unfortunately this bill does nothing to lower them. Raising taxes on firms in the oil and gas industries does nothing to lower the price of a barrel of oil. We all know that numerous factors affect gas prices--Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and OPEC members in the Middle East, for example. These are complex domestic and international market factors that are hard if not impossible to control. The Democrats are apparently oblivious to this reality. 
   We also understand that this bill would raise $5 to $6 billion in revenue by removing the tax breaks provided to the oil companies in the 2005 energy bill. But in fact, the Congressional Research Service has reported that the net impact of the 2005 energy bill was an increase in taxes to the oil and gas industry by some $300 million. So how will removing this provision help raise revenues? Furthermore, as Members of Congress, we want to enable companies to take every step forward in the exploration of domestic sources of oil and natural gas. It is counterintuitive to take away incentives for companies to participate in this exploration. 
   The Democrats talk about keeping America competitive, yet this legislation would impact a domestic company's eligibility to remain competitive with foreign manufacturers by repealing a 2004 tax provision that reduced the effective corporate income tax rate to 32 percent from 35 percent. Why would we deliberately put American producers at a disadvantage with their foreign competitors? 
   Included in this piece of legislation, which, I will remind my colleagues, did not receive any committee consideration in the 110th Congress, are provisions for a trust fund for alternative fuels. The Democrats say this trust fund money, created by funneling the revenue from abolishing crucial tax incentives and the tightening of royalty regulations, will accelerate the use of clean energy resources and alternative fuels and promote the research and development of renewable energy technologies. This trust fund is an idea that's been heralded by Members on both sides of the aisle. And the objectives that I just mentioned are surely noble ones. However, this bill creates a trust fund and then ends there. There is no mention in the bill as to how this new revenue is to be spent, just suggestions. In this respect, this is a bill with good intentions but no teeth. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are not arguing that more time and money deserves to be spent on the development of alternative energy. It should. In fact, studies have shown that between 2004 and 2006, investment in alternative energy doubled to $63 billion. And the market is responding. Venture capital funding of green-energy technologies has quadrupled since 1998. Members of Congress have submitted numerous amendments to H.R. 6 mirroring these efforts. The Rules Committee received almost 20 amendments with thoughtful suggestions as to how to direct trust fund money, and other productive approaches to solving our energy needs. Not one amendment, Mr. Speaker, was made in order. In fact, even before the Rules Committee had heard testimony from any of the amendment sponsors, Chairwoman SLAUGHTER announced that she would be granting a closed rule. The Democrats had already made up their minds and closed their ears before they even heard the first amendment. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6 was referred to four committees. In another instance in denying the due process and minority rights that Democrats promised the American people, those committees never once met on the bill at hand. Members on both sides of the aisle never had the chance to draft, review or amend the bill. The Democrats campaigned on honesty and openness, and heralded a new era in minority rights, but again have failed to live up to their promises. Again, they completely ignored regular order and pushed this bill to the front of the line, and the deficiencies in the bill are evident because of it. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have missed yet another opportunity today to craft comprehensive legislation that would address issues that are important to the energy debate. During the 109th Congress, we worked with Members on both sides of the aisle on legislation that increased refinery capacity. This legislation received strong bipartisan support, and yet is noticeably absent from this legislation we have before us today. 
   This bill is just like Proposition 87--the 2006 ballot initiative that would have taxed California's home-produced oil in order to subsidize ``green technology'' alternatives. Thankfully those in my home state were smart enough to defeat Proposition 87, knowing full well it would have damaged California's home oil and gas industry, increased foreign oil consumption, and raised the energy bills of the state's residents. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill raises taxes and raises prices at the pump. And all the American people are getting in return is a promise that we'll actually do something down the road. The new majority is well on its way to fulfilling another empty promise and at the expense of the American consumer. Let's vote down this rule, and force the majority to take this bill through committee where we can have a real energy bill with real solutions.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 63, IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule and the underlying resolution. This rule lays out a bad process, and the underlying legislation lays out bad policy. 
   This rule silences any meaningful debate on the floor by denying both Republicans and Democrats the right to offer any amendments or any substitute whatsoever. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic leadership has attempted to mask this denial of real debate by providing us with 36 hours of floor time. But this nearly unprecedented amount of time is really little more than a joke; 36 hours of debate, without any opportunity whatsoever to voice dissent with a substitute, amounts to nothing more than 36 hours of talk. The American people want and deserve a real and meaningful debate, not empty gestures that show utter disregard for an honest and open discussion on this issue. 
   Why can't we have a discussion that explores real options and real solutions? 
   The reason is very clear, Mr. Speaker. Our Democratic colleagues have none. 
   It was bad enough when we addressed issues like stem cell research and minimum wage without any transparency or openness whatsoever. We have dealt with several important issues in a complete vacuum. But now, our Democratic colleagues are running roughshod over our national security, what is clearly the number one priority that we as a Federal Government, as federally elected officials, address. 
   We know, Mr. Speaker, that the war on terror and policy in Iraq is very clearly the single most important issue that will be addressed by the 110th Congress. It clearly ranked very high on the list of issues voters cared about most in last November's election. The American people are concerned about this war, and they want to know that their elected officials are developing a sound and effective policy. 
   So what have the Democrats offered us? What is the substance of their proposal in a nonbinding resolution that denies the troops the numbers that they need to succeed? In other words, their proposal is, in fact, meaningless as legislation, and it is disastrous as a policy. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is an admission of defeat. And it is a vote of no confidence in our troops. Like it or not, it is a vote of no confidence in our troops. Why? Because it does not provide our troops what they need to succeed. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are all opposed to the status quo in Iraq. And the President stood right here when he delivered his State of the Union message and made it very clear. He wants this war to be over, and he wants it to be won. 
   We all know about the tremendous challenges that our men and women are facing over in Iraq. We all know that. We hear it regularly from our constituents, the families, and we hear it directly from the men and women who are serving. We all feel very deeply about the enormity of the sacrifice that so many have made in service to their country. And we know that they look to their Commander in Chief for a strategy for victory. 
   The President has put forth his strategy, Mr. Speaker. With the advice and close consultation of our generals in the field, he has called for a surge in troop levels in order to give our Armed Forces the support that they need. 
   Why, again is he doing this? So that he can give our men and women in uniform, our troops, the support that they need so that they can succeed. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, it is our role as a Congress to thoroughly vet the President's proposal to ensure that we develop an effective policy for moving forward. With this resolution, the Democrats have ignored our constitutional role. They have not held a single hearing on this resolution. They have called not one expert witness to testify for the record on the merits of this resolution. All that they offer is a knee-jerk reaction against anything that the President says. Again, anything that the President says is wrong in the eyes of so many of our colleagues. 
   Obviously, we, Mr. Speaker, cannot be a rubber stamp for the executive branch, the second branch of government. But neither can we afford, neither can we forfeit our duty as a deliberative body to fully explore the plan that has been put forward and to craft sound public policy as it relates to this. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the absence of any deliberation, the Democrats have concocted a resolution that simply does, as I say, concede defeat. To the American people, it admits the Democratic leadership is devoid of ideas. And to the troops, it admits that they have no faith in their mission, no faith in the troops' mission whatsoever, because they need this sound strategy that has been put into effect so that we can, in fact, attain victory and they can be successful. 
   What is worse, it tries to shroud their lack of faith in our military with platitudes about supporting our troops. You can't claim support for our troops without supporting their mission, Mr. Speaker. Again, you cannot claim to support our troops without supporting their mission. It is an outrage that they would deny our men and women in harm's way the traditional and additional support that they need to succeed. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, yesterday afternoon I had an opportunity to talk with one of my constituents, a former marine called Ed Blecksmith. Very tragically, 2 years ago this past November, his son, J.P. was killed in one of the most famous battles in the war in Iraq, the battle of Fallujah. Mr. Blecksmith implored me to support a policy of victory. He said that his son's death will have been in vain if we do not complete our mission. He made that very clear to me. Again, we got into this battle to win, and victory is, in fact, the only option. That is from the father of a man who was tragically killed in Iraq. 
   And I know that we are going to hear a wide range of views over the next 36 hours that have come forward from different families. And, of course, our hearts go out to them. But I will say that this proud former marine does not want his son to have died in vain, and he is insistent that we do all that we can to ensure that we complete this mission. 
   Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq, like all wars, has been very long, very difficult and very painful. It has come at a very high price, and we all know that it has taken its toll on the American people. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, we go to war to win. We go to war with a mission, and we dishonor the lives of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, if we, in fact, abandon that mission. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution offers no hope to the troops, and it offers no hope to the people of this country who want to see the conflict in Iraq resolved so that our troops can come home to their families. 
   Mr. Speaker, they deserve better. We have a duty to offer them something better. We have a duty to pursue nothing less than victory. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this rule, reject this resolution, and, instead, work together to fulfill our constitutional responsibility as effective legislators. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 63, IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, on the eve of the Civil War, that great philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote: ``War is an ugly thing but it is not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which think nothing worth a war is worse.'' 
   No one likes this war that we are in. As I said earlier, the President stood here just weeks ago, and in his State of the Union message he said, I wish very much that this war were over and that we had won. That is the goal. The goal is victory. 
   We need to make sure that our men and women in uniform, many of whom are paying the ultimate price every single day, as we look at the tragic loss of life, we need to make sure that they have everything necessary so that we can, as my constituent Ed Blecksmith, a father of a man who was killed 2 years ago last November in the battle of Fallujah, said, so that we can complete our mission. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe very fervently that you cannot support our troops without supporting their mission. This resolution that is before us unfortunately undermines the ability of our troops to complete their mission. 
   We have had some very thoughtful proposals that have come forward. We just had Mr. Wolf stand here and talk about the opportunity that was denied him to have a vote on the very important bipartisan work of that Iraq Study Group. Much of what the Iraq Study Group has done has been already implemented by this administration, but there is more that needs to be done. Mr. Wolf was tragically denied an opportunity to even have a vote on whether or not we should support that bipartisan effort of the Iraq Study Group. 
   We also had testimony last night, Mr. Speaker, from a man who just yesterday marked the 34th anniversary from being freed after 7 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, our colleague from Dallas, Texas, Mr. Johnson. He was denied a chance to have a substitute that would simply say that we are not going to cut off funding for our troops. 
   Now, there are many who have argued, Mr. Speaker, that this resolution that we are going to consider in the next few days is simply a first step. It is a first step towards ultimately cutting off funding, and, Mr. Speaker, I think that would be wrong, and that is why I am urging defeat of the previous question. When we do that, we will be making in order, when we defeat the previous question, an opportunity for us to say that we will not cut off funding for our men and women in uniform. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge a vote against the previous question; and if by chance we fail on that, I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule, and I urge a ``no'' vote on the underlying resolution which does, in fact, undermine the goal of completing our mission and bringing our men and women home. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (SAN GABRIEL BASIN RESTORATION FUND AUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by rising to compliment my distinguished California colleague, the Chair of the subcommittee, for her amazing and festive outfit which includes shoes and earrings which I hope very much our colleagues will seize the opportunity to see during this holiday season. 
   The importance of stating that is matched by my praise for her work and the work of her staff on this important legislation. It has been nearly a decade, actually back in 1999, that we were able to first pass legislation designed to deal with a horrendous tragedy that came in the aftermath of the Cold War. It was during the Cold War that we had a wide range of defense contractors, some of which are in business today, and some of which no longer are in business; but during that period of time, they legally disposed of spent rocket fuel. They did it legally. No one knew what the ramifications of that would be at the time. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, what happened? Well, in the mid-1990s there was this discovery of perchlorate which was a byproduct of the disposal of that spent rocket fuel. Unfortunately, it created the potential to contaminate the water for as many as 7 million Californians. 
   That is why I want to join in praising Mrs. Napolitano for her work in expanding this cleanup effort, and I want to thank all the members of her staff. I also want to express appreciation to our colleague, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who also has worked very hard on this. And I know that the discovery of perchlorate is something that has hit other parts of the country. 
   Well, we in the San Gabriel Valley have put together what clearly is the best model for not only our area, Mr. Speaker, but for other parts of the country, Dallas, Texas, other parts of California, where this has been found. What does that partnership consist of? It is the Federal Government, and there was a lot of litigation that was initiated in the 1990s over this problem. I decided back then in the 1990s, why should we wait for litigation to go through the courts when perchlorate was seeping into the groundwater when it was very clear that the Federal Government had contracted with these people and we won the Cold War. 
   And so it was obvious that this was a Federal responsibility for us to step up to the plate. But there, obviously, were a lot of others who did want to take on some of the responsibility, so companies like Aerojet and other companies did agree to participate in the cleanup effort. And the State of California and local governments as well have been part of this process. 
   Again, our bipartisan staffs have worked so closely together on this issue that to me, Mr. Speaker, it is a great demonstration of the willingness of Chairwoman Napolitano to reach out and work on an issue where we could find areas of agreement. Again, I can't thank her enough for that. And I will say that as we look at this challenge down the road, we hope very much that it is taken care of. But I am well aware of the fact that we will see further environmental difficulties in the future, and I believe that this legislation, H.R. 123, will be a model that can be utilized for many of the other environmental challenges that we face beyond the issue of water in the future. 
   So again I thank all of my colleagues who have been involved, Mr. Speaker,  and I thank those in our local area, the Water Quality Authority and other entities that have stepped up and are working with us, because they really were key in putting together this model; and I urge my colleagues to support the gentlewoman's resolution here.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (SAN GABRIEL BASIN RESTORATION FUND AUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill's passage. H.R. 123 is an important continuation of the successful federal-state-local partnership that already exists in providing one of the most basic necessities of life--clean drinking water. The bill extends the current authorization of the San Gabriel Basin Restoration Fund by a total of $61.2 million--$50 million for the San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority (WQA), and $11.2 million for the Central Basin Municipal Water District (Central Basin). 
   The San Gabriel Basin Restoration Fund was created because of the critical need to quickly implement a plan that would address the contaminated groundwater in the San Gabriel Valley. Before important environmental laws were put into place, the Federal Government had contracted with defense companies that were, at that time, legally permitted to dispose of spent-rocket fuel without proper safeguards for groundwater. There had already been clean-up efforts in the region for other contaminants but in 1997, perchlorate contamination was discovered in the groundwater in the San Gabriel Valley. Unfortunately, at the time of discovery, many of those contractors and other responsible parties had either moved their businesses to other locations, or had simply gone out of business. The region's groundwater remained threatened while mounting litigation between the Environmental Protection Agency and private parties potentially responsible for the contamination delayed any hope for a solution. 
   In 1999, the Federal Government rightfully stepped in with the creation of the Restoration Fund to provide a mechanism for those responsible for the contamination to partner with local, state and federal agencies to solve the crisis and immediately implement the clean-up. The willingness of the Federal Government to partner with local and state agencies proved to be the impetus for private investment and participation in the ongoing cleanup efforts. 
   I am proud to say that this partnership is an example of good stewardship of taxpayer money. Initially in 1999, when we first began the process for creating the Restoration Fund, the total cost of cleaning up the basin was estimated at $320 million. Congress created the Restoration Fund in 2000, with an initial authorization of $85 million, or a 25 percent investment. To date, a little over $70 million has been appropriated, with approximately 83 percent of the cleanup provided by local sources and responsible parties, with about 12 percent federal funding. 
   After recent evaluation of the total project, accounting for increased levels of detected contamination, increased energy costs and inflation, the total cost of cleanup now, almost a 
   decade later, is approximately $1 billion. With a modest increase of $61.2 million, bringing the total federal investment to $146.2 million, or approximately 14 percent, the WQA and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation can continue jointly administering this cleanup program. 
   Their outstanding work is why this project is cost effective and such a huge success. In working with the WQA and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation over the past decade on this regional solution, there is no doubt that this increase is warranted and will be utilized in the most effective way to continue to provide safe drinking water. 
   The cost-effectiveness of the original authorization of the Restoration Fund is clear. And without a doubt, that cost-effective use of the federal investment will be continued in this new authorization. The federal partnership will continue to hold the coalition of local water agencies and private parties together to finish the job that we started a decade ago. 
   It is important to note that this bill, while originally introduced to authorize additional funds for the WQA, was amended to include additional funding for the Central Basin. The WQA and Central Basin were jointly authorized to implement the cleanup by the original Restoration Fund. These two agencies have worked side by side for many years to ensure that the millions of residents in our region have safe drinking water. While the Central Basin has realized its full authorization under the Restoration Fund, there are funds yet to be appropriated to the WQA under the original authorization. Therefore, the WQA is not responsible to provide the Central Basin with any further appropriations that are secured under the original $85 million ceiling. 
   However, we all recognize Central Basin's desire to seek additional funds beyond what they have already been fully provided under the original authorization to ensure the safety of the region's groundwater. Central Basin has stepped forward in committing to providing the 35 percent local cost share on any future appropriations they secure. Once the WQA receives its full appropriation under the original authorization, should the WQA and Central Basin decide to pursue and split a single appropriation as they've done in the past, then the WQA and the Central Basin have mutually agreed that the WQA will receive 90 percent, and Central Basin will receive 10 percent of any annual appropriation to the Restoration Fund under the new authorization ceiling outlined in this bill. I want to commend the cooperation between these two agencies in working out the details of the implementation of this bill and for their continued service to the residents of the San Gabriel Valley. 
   This bill is a product of strong bipartisan cooperation with the Chair of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power, Ms. Napolitano, an original cosponsor of the bill and great partner throughout the years in addressing the very serious challenge of keeping our groundwater supply safe for southern Californians. I am very proud to have the support of our friends Gary Miller, Lucille Roybal-Allard, Adam Schiff, Hilda Solis and Linda S&#225;nchez. I also want to thank Ranking Member Cathy McMorris-Rodgers for her support throughout the legislative process as well as recognize the hard work of the very able Majority and Minority subcommittee staff including Steve Lanich, Kiel Weaver, Emily Knight and from Chairwoman Napolitano's personal office, Daniel Chao. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Chairman, I stand today in opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation, H.R. 1227, the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act of 2007. The stated goal of H.R. 1227--to facilitate the speedy recovery of renters and homeowners who are still displaced by Hurricane Katrina--is a worthy one. However, this legislation will not achieve this goal, and will in fact make matters worse. 
   The Disaster Voucher Program is currently a temporary program, but H.R. 1227 would extend it into a permanent voucher. Furthermore, it would require HUD to provide tenant replacement vouchers for all public housing units not brought back on line, including those slated for demolition prior to the storms. In other words, this bill mandates the reconstruction of a previously flawed public housing system in New Orleans, rather than addressing root problems and looking for new solutions. 
   In addition, Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1227 not only calls for the reconstruction of a failed system, but it does so in a very costly manner. The CBO estimates that H.R. 1227 would increase direct spending by $224 million in 2007 and by $469 million between 2007 and 2012. 
   H.R. 1227 simply ignores ``pay-as-you-go'' rules and provides new funding without finding a way to pay for it. Chairman FRANK, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Financial Services, has stated that H.R. 1227 was symbolic of a commitment to helping the poor no matter what other priorities Congress has. Rather than offering those who face hardship a symbolic and irresponsible gesture, we should be looking at ways to encourage reform of New Orleans' public housing system and ensure a workable, sustainable program that actually meets the city's needs for quality housing. 
   In the 109th Congress, the Republican Majority put in place a system to do exactly that. We provided more than $110 billion to hurricane-devastated Gulf Coast, including $16.7 billion for the Community Development Block Grant program. However, rather than simply attempt to re-establish a failed system, we required that states develop a comprehensive plan for addressing their housing needs. We demanded accountability, so that Katrina victims would have quality housing to return to. 
   As HUD Secretary Jackson said last year, everyone who wants to return home to New Orleans should be allowed to do so. The Republican Majority offered the opportunity for a better home to return to. We should be focusing on how to implement a comprehensive, long-term plan to address this range of issues that challenge the Gulf Region. We can accomplish much of this with the funds that we already made available in the previous Congress. This bill, however, simply appropriates new funds to recreate old failures. It is not a solution; it is the perpetuation of problems. 
   Mr. Chairman, Members were given notice late Friday that their amendments to H.R. 1227 would be due by early Monday morning. Hardly enough time for Members to formulate substantive amendments. I requested last night during the Rules Committee hearing that we grant this bill a modified open rule--one that allows any Member the opportunity to submit their amendments for consideration by preprinting them in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the day before. Unfortunately, we were denied, amendments were shut out yet again, and I believe this bill could suffer for it. 
   Mr. Chairman, again, I oppose this restrictive rule and the underlying legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (THE VALUE OF THE AMERICAN SERVICE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, last week I spoke here in the well about our service economy. Accounting for nearly 80 percent of both our workforce and private sector gross domestic product, services actually form the backbone of our economy. These industries are thriving in the worldwide marketplace and are a major source of our global competitiveness. Our annual exports in services are approaching $400 billion, and we have long had a trade surplus in this sector of the economy.  
   Mr. Speaker, one such source is the motion picture and television production industry. This industry is a thriving economic engine, creating well-paying jobs and economic benefits to communities all across America, not just in my State of California. In fact, with filming in 44 States, the motion picture and television production industry generates more than 1.3 million American jobs, $30.24 billion in wages to American workers and $30.2 billion in revenue every year. It is very competitive internationally, with a $9.5 billion trade surplus. And it is the only industry, Mr. Speaker, it is our only industry in which we actually have a trade surplus with every single one of our trading partners. 
   Motion pictures and television production creates jobs in a wide range of fields, from the highly technical to the highly creative. But one thing they have in common is that they are largely based on the knowledge economy that provides the foundation for both our economic well-being and our comparative advantage in the global economy. 
   Another major services sector is the express delivery industry, Mr. Speaker. This is an industry that is not only thriving in the global economy, but it is actually making the global economy possible. In a world where just-in-time delivery is essential to doing business, where U.S. companies, large and small, can get raw materials from Chile, make products in Michigan and sell them in Korea, express delivery is obviously a very integral part of that economy. 
   Goods transported by air account for only 3 percent by weight of all goods traded globally, but 40 percent of value. That is 3 percent in weight, but 40 percent in value. 
   U.S. companies that ship worldwide are helping to grow our economy as they facilitate the interconnectedness of the world's producers and consumers. For example, Mr. Speaker, every time UPS adds 40 new international packages into its system, it creates a new job right here in the United States of America. Every day, in fact, UPS carries 8 percent of all U.S. gross domestic product and 3 percent of world global gross domestic product within its system. By tapping into the ever-growing need to ship worldwide, express delivery companies create new jobs here at home, facilitate economic growth around the globe and demonstrate that U.S. service companies are thriving in the worldwide marketplace. 
   Mr. Speaker, the telecommunications industry is yet another example of American businesses that are both tapping into and facilitating a shrinking world that brings a globe-full of benefits and opportunities right to our doorstep here in the United States. U.S. telecom companies are extremely competitive in the global economy, with international revenues rising more than 12 percent in just the last year. 2006 was the third year in a row with double-digit growth in international revenue. The global telecom market is projected to reach $4.3 trillion by 2010. That is $1.2 trillion in the United States, but $3 trillion internationally. 
   Clearly, the competitiveness of the U.S. industry depends upon worldwide economic global engagement. At the same time, these services are making the world more and more connected, enabling producers, consumers and investors to communicate quickly and easily with every corner of the globe. And, as we have seen, our service providers thrive on this increased connectiveness. As global leaders, they are constantly creating new opportunities, here at home and around the globe, as they grow our economy and make the worldwide marketplace more and more accessible for everyone. And they have done so at a time when worldwide economic liberalization in services has been very limited. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue on a path towards greater economic freedom so that our service industries, the backbone of our economy, can achieve greater and greater success in the global marketplace.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (ESTABLISHING THE HOUSE DEMOCRACY ASSISTANCE COMMISSION FOR THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to my very good friend from Miami (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen); and of course my great pal from California (Mr. Lantos), my classmate and neighbor, who, as soon as I took the well, decided to walk off the floor, but he is still here for a moment. And I do appreciate the fact that in a bipartisan way we have taken on what is one of the most interesting and fulfilling challenges that I have faced in the many years that I have been privileged to serve here in the Congress. 
   And, of course, as I look around the Chamber and see colleagues like LOIS CAPPS and, of course, the man with whom I served as a partner in a bipartisan way on this, DAVID PRICE from North Carolina; on our side of the aisle, JEFF FORTENBERRY and JOHN BOOZMAN, who are among the Members to serve on this commission, it is very, very important today that we reauthorize this effort. 
   As we look at our quest to prosecute the global war on terror, it is obvious that many things need to be done. We obviously need to have the military wherewithal to do everything necessary to make sure that as we face terror attacks and other military conflicts that we are able to successfully take that on. But, similarly, it is important for us to look at other ways in which we can do everything possible to help people who are struggling. 
   And I forgot to mention Ms. Schwartz, who I had not seen because my peripheral vision wasn't that great; so I am happy that she is here, another very able and hardworking member of our commission. 
   But, Madam Speaker, as I was saying, as we look at this challenge not only dealing with the military challenge, it is important for us to work to build democracies and those institutions that relate to it and the rule of law and political pluralism and self-determination, as I like to always say, those things that we have a tendency to take for granted here in the United States but are so important. 
   And this commission was specifically built on something that we did about 15 years ago following the crumbling of the Berlin Wall and the demise of the Soviet Union, that being our effort to let Eastern and Central Europe know that as they work to claw their way from totalitarianism that we would do all that we could to help build their parliaments. And, Madam Speaker, that is exactly what we have now been able to do so far in six countries and we have six other countries with which we are working very closely, assuming that we reauthorize this effort here. 
   And we are going to be doing so, I know, under the very able leadership of my colleague Mr. Price, and I am going to be working on our Republican side with members. And, again, I was very privileged to serve as chairman that we did this as a partnership. It was not only a partnership in a bipartisan way between Democrats and Republicans here, but it also has been a very important partnership in working with nongovernment organizations, with the Department of State, with the National Endowment for Democracy, with the International Republic Institute, with the National Democratic Institute, and a wide range of other entities out there that recognize that building these parliaments that will have the ability to engage in oversight of their executive branch, to put into place a budget process to make sure that they have the kind of constituent service that is very important for them, these are the kinds of things that this commission has worked on so effectively. 
   A couple of quick examples from the missions that we have been on so far: one of the things that we found in Kenya when we visited there was that it was essential for us to help them build up their budget process and their committee process there as well, and we were able to provide through our commission great benefits for them. 
   And, frankly, when we were on our mission there in Nairobi, Kenya last July, we went to the site of the former U.S. embassy. And we all know back in 1998 that our embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya were attacked by al Qaeda, and now for us to see the role that we are playing in helping to build this democracy in and the fledgling parliament in Kenya has been a very important thing, especially in the light of the fact that most recently we have seen an effort supported by the Kenyan Government and the Ethiopian Government in liberating the Somalians from the hold of those Islamic extremists. So we are seeing a real tangible benefit in this war on terror from the work of this commission. 
   Similarly, in the Balkans, in Macedonia, on our mission there most recently just over the Thanksgiving break, we were able to do a great deal in helping with the building of their committee process there, and our commission has worked long and hard on that. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I am going to quote my friend DAVID PRICE because my feeling is virtually identical to that. When we think about the important work that we do with the privilege that we have of serving as Members of the United States Congress, there is nothing that is more fulfilling and rewarding and tangible for us to see than the opportunity to participate in this very important work on the commission. 
   So I express my appreciation again to Chairman Lantos and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and all of the members of this commission, and we look forward to reporting back to our colleagues here in the House of Representatives, Madam Speaker, on the very important success that we are going to be having in the months and years to come.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   I have to say, as I listen to my good friend from New York (Mrs. Maloney), who has worked long and hard on this, it didn't take a year for us to pass this measure through the House of Representatives; it passed, as the gentlewoman said, by a vote of 421-0 in the last Congress, and that was in response to the DPW deal, which obviously raised a number of concerns from a number of people in this institution. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a Republican bill, which, as the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Financial Services pointed out in the Rules Committee last night, enjoys strong bipartisan support, and it enjoys the kind of support that motherhood and apple pie enjoy. There is no controversy to this bill whatsoever. And I am very proud of the fact, as the gentlewoman from New York said, that we are now, by passing an open rule for the second time in the 110th Congress, doubling the record that we had in the 109th Congress when it came to open rules. But the true test will come when we are dealing with a controversial issue that does not enjoy strong bipartisan support. That is where this Madisonian vision of a clash of ideas is very important, Mr. Speaker. 
   And so I hope very much that as we bring measures, both of which in the 110th Congress were passed by unanimous votes in the 109th Congress, to the floor, and we are very proud of the fact that they are being considered on an open rule, I hope very much that we will do everything that we possibly can to ensure that debates like the one that we had 2 weeks ago on the issue of Iraq are considered under a process that will allow maybe a chance for the minority to consider a substitute, or a process that would, again, bring that clash of ideas, because it is very clear there was complete agreement on the fuels bill that we dealt with 2 weeks ago under an open rule, extraordinarily strong bipartisan support. There is complete agreement on the goal of CFIUS reform. Yes, we know that 12 amendments were filed by seven Members last night that will be considered here on the House floor under this open amendment process, but at the end of the day, Republicans and Democrats will come together in support of this. 
   The true test, Mr. Speaker, will be whether or not we take up a measure where there is strong, vigorous disagreement on the part of our Members. But I will say that we need to recognize that the two most important issues that we face as Members of this institution are the issues of, first and foremost, our national security; and, second, ensuring that we create economic opportunity for all Americans and maintain the strong, bold, dynamic growth that we have in our economy. 
   This measure that we are addressing today actually addresses both issues, Mr. Speaker. It will strengthen the process by which our national security stakeholders in the administration, from the Defense Department to the National Security Agency, review and investigate foreign investors in the U.S. economy. It focuses in particular on those companies that are controlled by foreign governments or are based in countries that support terrorism. These are commonsense reforms that again enjoy strong bipartisan support that will provide an adequate level of scrutiny to ensure that no investment poses a national security threat to our interests. However, it also ensures a process that, while thorough, is not prohibitive. This legislation is a reflection of the need for a review process that does not close us off to the vital foreign investment that is a major source of our economic strength. 
   I again praise the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Financial Services who last night in the Rules Committee talked about the importance of foreign direct investment. FDI is very important to us, and if we look at our economic growth, there is a strong, strong reliance that we have had. Because economic security underpins national security, it is absolutely imperative that we work to ensure that our economy remains the world's best place to invest and do business. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me provide some numbers that not everyone is familiar with. Foreign companies currently employ 5.3 million Americans here in the United States. We just got the report of this Toyota plant that is going to be opening in Tupelo, Mississippi. It is important to note that those foreign investors who employ 5.3 million Americans actually pay wage rates that are 50 percent higher than the average wage paid here in the United States. Companies like Toyota, Siemens, Novartis come to the United States in order to tap into our powerful market, innovative environment and superior workforce. In the process, they generate greater economic activity, create high-paying jobs and improve our  standard of living. And we have enjoyed these benefits, Mr. Speaker, because of the openness, strength and dynamism of the U.S. economy. 
   As we debate the need for national security reforms to our review process, we must recognize that to close off our economy to the world's investors would be to close ourselves off to the prosperity and opportunities that we have long enjoyed as the world's best investment. We cannot lose sight of the fact that we have prospered not in spite of, but because of our Nation's openness. 
   I believe that this bill charts a smart path that preserves both national security and our ability to attract investment and grow our economy. My colleagues, as I said, all agree with me. We have been through this process before, as I said, in the 109th Congress.     
   The bill that was passed in the last Congress was sponsored by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the distinguished minority whip, and this legislation which is virtually identical to the bill we are considering today, was considered by an overwhelming unanimous bipartisan vote. 
   Personally, I would very much like to see these good, well-crafted utterly noncontroversial bills where they belong, and that is on the suspension calendar where we passed it quickly and expeditiously in the last Congress. 
   But the fact of the matter is we are where we are, Mr. Speaker. It is important for us to recognize our priorities of national security, number one; and, number two, our economic strength and making sure that we expand that economic growth. 
   I urge support of this rule and the underlying legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to compliment my friend from Dallas for his very thoughtful statement. He has made the case that we want to defeat the previous question on this so that any Member, Democrat or Republican alike, would have the opportunity to offer their thoughtful proposals as to how we would deal with this issue of skyrocketing gasoline prices. 
   I represent Southern California, and I will tell you that it is a major concern of my constituents. And I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as we have seen this dramatic increase take place over the past year plus, year and a half, agree it is very, very troubling.     
   And I was struck. I've had the benefit of looking at the advance copy of Mr. Sessions' closing remarks. His thoughtful staff has coined actually a  very, very apropos phrase here in describing what we have as the Pelosi Petroleum Price Increase--PPPI. And I think that really does coin it very well, because we know that 2 years ago tomorrow, Speaker Pelosi made this statement: ``The Democrats have a commonsense plan to deal with skyrocketing gasoline prices.'' 
   Now since that period of time, and I just was struck, I saw a cartoon in today's USA Today in which they go through this litany of proposals. We're telling Big Oil to make sure that they bring prices down, and proposals are thrown out in this cartoon, saying, Why don't we deal with the question of nuclear energy? Absolutely not. 
   Why don't we look at clean coal? Absolutely not. 
   Why don't we look at possibly responsible, environmentally sound exploration in ANWR? Absolutely not. 
   Why don't we look at using the cleanest, safest, most cost effective energy source, that being nuclear? We haven't built a nuclear power plant in 30 years. Absolutely not. 
   Why don't we increase our refinery capacity? There has not been a single new refinery built in 30 years. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, these are the kinds of proposals that we very much hope we will be allowed to offer. The way to do that is to defeat the previous question on this rule so that we can say to our constituents, we are going to take firm, bold, dramatic steps to decrease the cost of the gasoline that they are putting in their cars every single day. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding. I thank him for his very thoughtful comments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   ``A commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing gasoline prices.'' That's what my friend from Pasco just quoted my California colleague, our distinguished Speaker, as having said 2 years ago tomorrow. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we look at what has taken place over that 2-year period of time, we know, and I will tell you that as a driver and a representative of people who drive the freeways of southern California, we've seen gas prices skyrocket over the past 2 years.     
   There's no plan put forward. 
   We're very proud of the fact that we have a plan. I just had the privilege of talking to my friend from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) about some of the challenges that we face. Obviously, I believe that environmentally sound exploration in ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, is the responsible thing for us to do. The Outer Continental Shelf is what we need to pursue. There's this potential of a great new shale find in North Dakota. 
   And then one of the interesting things that Mr. Shimkus and I were just discussing is the fact that it, of course, has been three decades, three decades, since we have seen the construction of any new refinery in this country and, of course, three decades since we have seen the construction of any nuclear power facility. We all know that nuclear power is the cleanest, safest, most cost-effective energy source around. 
   These are the kinds of responsible things that we are proposing, Mr. Speaker. Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have consistently stood in the way of every single one of those very responsible measures. 
   And pursuing alternative sources is something else that we strongly support. Coal to liquid, those are the kinds of things that we need to be doing. 
   Now, what is it that we are doing here with this rule? We are, of course, talking about small business issues, but we know the overwhelming concern of our constituents today is this problem of skyrocketing gasoline prices. 
   So when we move to defeat the previous question, Mr. Hastings, my friend from Pasco, is going to seek to offer an amendment to this rule. The amendment will simply say that any Member, any Member, who has a proposal that will deal with providing a commonsense plan to address the problem of skyrocketing gas prices will be able to offer that amendment here on the House floor. So all we're asking our colleagues to do is to amend this rule by defeating the previous question so that we will be able to deal with one of the most pressing concerns that our constituents are asking us to address.  
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we will allow our Members to step up to the plate and offer these very, very thoughtful solutions or anything that our friends on the other side of the aisle might seek to offer as an amendment that would, in fact, allow this to happen. 
   I thank, again, my friend for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I express my appreciation to my colleague from Sacramento for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   I have to begin by saying that as I saw my friend from Sacramento stand up, I couldn't help but think about the many years in the early 1990s that I worked very closely with her late husband, Bob Matsui, on trade agreements. We worked very closely on the North American Free Trade Agreement and a wide range of other agreements. I would just like to say that I know that he would be very proud to see his wife, DORIS, here participating and working very hard on this agreement. 
   I also have to say that I am very pleased to see so many of my colleagues and for us to, as the gentlewoman from Sacramento just said, working in a bipartisan way on this. We have the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, my very good friend from New York (Mr. Rangel), talking to JERRY WELLER from Illinois, who has been a great champion of free trade for a long period of time. 
   I am particularly glad to see people like the distinguished chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, Mr. Levin, with whom I have, over the past several decades actually, engaged in a rigorous discussion and exchange on a lot of trade issues. We have had a different perspective in the past. 
   While I am not in complete agreement with every single aspect of this, I am very proud to be joining in support of his initiative here. Of course, I see Mr. Crowley who has worked hard. 
   On our side sitting right here, Mr. Speaker, we have our distinguished friends from Florida, the DIAZ-BALART brothers, sandwiching our great friend, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, as they have demonstrated a very strong commitment to security and economic development within this hemisphere. 
   So I will say that we are at this moment beginning a debate on what I truly believe is one of the most important national security issues as well as economic growth issues for the United States of America, the U.S.-Peru trade agreement. 
   The vote on this implementing bill has been a long time in coming, as my colleague from Sacramento said. We have pending trade agreements with three Latin American countries, Colombia and Panama, in addition to this Peru agreement. And I hope very much, Mr. Speaker, since from my perspective, and I know not everyone agrees with me, but I believe very passionately, as I know my colleagues sitting here with me on the second row agree, that these three trade agreements are very, very important and the arguments in behalf of their passage are, in fact, very, very similar. As I said, we begin today with Peru, and I believe we will pass this bill with a large bipartisan majority. 
   I want to again commend my great friend, CHARLIE RANGEL, and our ranking member, JIM MCCRERY, with whom Mr. Rangel has worked very closely on these trade agreements. I congratulate both of them for having worked so hard on this. They have worked to restore what I believe is so critically important, and that is the bipartisan tradition of trade. 
   I failed to mention Mr. Neal. I do, of course, recognize my friend from Massachusetts, who is obviously working on and has got to be supportive of this since he is sitting next to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that we are now restoring this great bipartisanship when it comes to trade and I think it's a great day for this institution. 
   The Peru agreement is an excellent place to begin to renew that support for open trade as an institution, because the economic benefits will be largely focused on the one thing we all seem to agree on. What is the one thing that every single American agrees on when it comes to the issue of trade? That is exports. 
   We all agree that we want to open up new markets. I don't believe that a single one of my colleagues would consider arguing that exporting goods and services from the United States of America is a bad thing.     
   We're all in agreement increasing our exports to foreign markets is very positive for American workers, producers and our economy at large. And the reality is that exports are central to the issue of trade with Peru. Why? Because we have long had an open door to products coming from Peru into the United States. Congress created and extended a system of trade preferences for Peru, Colombia and other countries as well, which allows their goods to enter the U.S. market. So the U.S. consumer can have access to those tariff free. These preferences have enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support, overwhelming bipartisan support for these preferences that allow Peruvian, Colombian, Panamanian goods and services to come into this country duty free. That's existed and, again, that has enjoyed bipartisan support. 
   What we need to do now is we need to make sure that we take the step, having opened up our markets to them, to make sure that we open up their markets for U.S. goods and services. 
   That's what all three of these agreements, Mr. Speaker, are all about. We unilaterally extended duty-free access to our market because we wanted to help create real opportunities for workers and producers in this region to enter the worldwide marketplace. 
   Now, these preferences have been very successful. They've boosted exports to the United States and gave workers in those countries, Colombia, Peru and Panama, they gave these workers an alternative to the drug trade and other illicit industries. They've helped to usher in a new peaceful, prosperous era for all three of these countries, Peru, Colombia and Panama, where poverty is diminishing and, as well all know, democracy is solidifying. 
   Now it's time to make this a reciprocal arrangement. U.S. exports, things made by Americans, our workers, should get the same treatment in their markets as Panamanian, Peruvian and Colombian workers get with access to our markets. With this Peru Free Trade Agreement, we will begin to level the playing field for American workers. 
   I happen to believe that comprehensive, broad-based liberalization brings about the greatest economic benefits. I know some in this body might disagree. But as I've said, we all recognize the benefits of increased exports. Having opened the door on imports, we now must give our own exports equal footing. 
   Those who would oppose this agreement today should recognize that they oppose nothing less than the promotion of American exports, the promotion of products made by U.S. workers. 
   A vote, Mr. Speaker, against the Peru Free Trade Agreement is not a vote against free trade. It is a vote against giving Americans, American workers, a fair shot. 
   But the significance of this agreement reaches far beyond economics, as I said at the outset. Just as our system of trade preferences was rooted in foreign policy, so is this agreement; our system of trade preferences dealing with the drug problem that Mr. Rangel's been involved in for decades, and I've enjoyed working with him in that battle. Just as that is, this also is very similar in that it is dealing with a foreign policy objective of ours. 
   We have come to realize that one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century is the promotion and strengthening of democratic institutions throughout the globe. 
   This is a battle for hearts and minds. It is a struggle to ensure that liberty and the rule of law prevail over tyranny. And we heard that stated so eloquently right in this Chamber at 11 o'clock this morning when we had that spectacular speech delivered by Nicolas Sarkozy, France's new President. It is a struggle to ensure that opportunity and prosperity prevail over hopelessness that turns into extremism. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a challenge that has risen in the far corners of the globe, but it also exists right here in our own backyard. Today, Latin America, as we all know, is at a crossroads. Where armed conflict, drug wars, poverty and stagnation were the norm just a few years ago, a quiet revolution of economic and political liberalization has begun to transform a continent. Slow, steady reform has put much of this hemisphere on the right path.  
   But there has been a resurgence in antiliberalization forces that does threaten this reform. We all know that Hugo Chavez in Venezuela is systematically dismantling the institutions of democracy and free markets in his own country and exporting his authoritarian agenda to his neighbors. We all know that all we need to do is look at his circle, his close circle of friends: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Fidel Castro, Daniel Ortega. That demonstrates the level of tyranny to which he aspires. He has already drawn Evo Morales in Bolivia and Rafael Correa in Ecuador into his orbit. Hugo Chavez and his assault on free government and free markets is a direct threat to the American ideals and the ideals, again, that were outlined so eloquently by President Sarkozy this morning, those ideals of liberty and prosperity. We want them prevailed throughout the world and we certainly want to take every step that we can to ensure that those principles of freedom and liberty and prosperity thrive right here in this hemisphere. 
   And yet there are bulwarks for these American ideals in the region, and Peru is a key example. Peruvian President Alan Garcia himself embodies the struggle between these two visions. He first served as President of Peru in the 1980s, governing with antiliberalization philosophy. He presided over a withering economy that offered very little hope to Peruvians. And he said to us when we, in a delegation, visited with him when we were with our great Commerce Secretary, Carlos Gutierrez, that the statist populace vision of the past has failed. At that point, Mr. Speaker, he presided over that withering economy that offers, as I said, very, very little hope to Peruvians. But unlike most of us in politics, President Garcia is today getting a second chance. Nearly two decades after his first term, he has returned to the presidency and he has learned from his mistakes. He's been a champion of this agreement and our goal of solidifying the economic and political reform that has taken place. He is part of the anti-Chavez vision for Latin America, and he is joined by other allies in reform like President Uribe in Colombia, like President Torrijos in Panama. 
   We have a very clear choice today, Mr. Speaker. We can strengthen the hand of Hugo Chavez, or we can strengthen the hand of the liberalizers and proponents of democracy and free markets. This is the battle for hearts and minds, and it's taking place right here in the Western Hemisphere. We know who our good friends are, and Peru, Colombia and Panama lead the pack. It's no coincidence that we embarked on trade negotiations with all three of these very important allies of ours. 
   I would have liked to have had a vote on each of these critical agreements today. I very much wish that we could be voting on all of them today. But I'm pleased to at least begin with Peru. And I will say again that I very much look forward to our voting, I hope just as soon as possible, on the agreements with Colombia and Panama, because the exact same arguments that I have propounded are similarly applied to Colombia and Panama, the arguments I've made for Peru. All three share the same benefits and all three pose the same risks if we fail to implement them. All three extend our trade system, our trade preference system to American workers and producers, and all three are critical to our quest to strengthen and solidify political and economic freedom throughout Latin America. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying trade agreement. And I urge the Democratic leadership, Mr. Speaker, to move as quickly as possible to bring forward the pending agreements with Colombia and Panama. And I urge them not to let politics undermine liberty in our hemisphere. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege for me to rise and join my California colleague, Speaker Pelosi, in support of this rule and in support of the underlying legislation. 
   We began this morning here with a brilliant address delivered by the new President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy. In that speech, he talked about the need for greater economic liberalization and the move towards markets. He talked about a new day in France and the fact that he is doing everything that he possibly can to make sure that they create new opportunities for economic growth and success in that country. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, we all know that the United States of America, as President Sarkozy said, is the strongest, most powerful nation in the world, economically, geopolitically and militarily. And, Mr. Speaker, this agreement is about making sure that within our hemisphere, we have an opportunity, an opportunity to open up new markets for U.S. workers. 
   Now, I stumbled through an exchange with my friend from Ohio when I was talking about a great Ohio company, Whirlpool. What I was trying to say is that Whirlpool has projected that they will have a 400 percent increase in their level of exports from Ohio to Peru. And what does that mean? Whirlpool projects that it will create 9,000 new jobs for workers in Ohio. 
   Mr. Speaker, Peru, Colombia, Panama, through trade preferences that we have joined together in a bipartisan way in granting, have had access to the U.S. consumer. This agreement is not about free trade. It is about opening up new opportunities for U.S. workers, and it is about the security of this hemisphere. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I want to express my appreciation to my very good friend  from Rochester, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, at this moment, we are beginning the debate on this very, very important package. For the second time this week, this body will consider a plan to unclog our banking system and to unfreeze our credit markets. The plan before us today is similar to the one that failed to pass on Monday but with two very important and key additions. 
   First, it allows the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to insure larger bank deposits, which is absolutely essential for protecting our Nation's small businesses. Second, it extends a number of critical tax credits and protections that will reduce burdens on middle-income Americans, that will increase the use of renewable and alternative energy and, very importantly, that will promote job creation and economic growth for businesses, large and small. These are significant improvements, Madam Speaker, that make this a better bill, but the bill isn't the only thing that has changed since Monday. 
   The economic landscape has shifted as well, or more accurately, the landscape has become clearer. Prior to Monday's vote, we had a 3-hour debate. We heard from a lot of Members with dire predictions if there were a failure to act. I was one of those who expressed a deep concern for the economic consequences if we could not enact an effective rescue package. This was reasoned speculation but speculation nonetheless. 
   Today, we can act on more than speculation, Madam Speaker. As Monday's vote went down, it took the Dow with it. Anyone who watched CNBC's coverage saw a direct juxtaposition. One half of the screen showed this House floor. The other half of the screen showed the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. With each new ``no'' vote, the Dow lost points, and greater panic spread throughout the trading floor. 
   By the end of the day, as we all know, the Dow dropped 770 points, or $1.2 trillion. Let me repeat that, Madam Speaker: There was more than $1.2 trillion lost on that day, and as we all know, that was the single largest point loss in the history of our Republic. 
   The next day, as hope was renewed that there would be a second bite at the apple, a rebound began. It wasn't a full recovery of Monday's losses, but significant ground was regained on the hope that this rescue bill would ultimately pass. 
   Now, I know that deep and pervasive skepticism of this package persists, and I understand that skepticism very well. I, myself, am very skeptical about this package. I held a telephone townhall meeting Wednesday night, and a number of different points of view were expressed by my constituents. Those who oppose this bill explained their reasons very carefully, and I agree with every single word that they said. They said we should let the market sort itself out. They said that people must not be shielded from suffering the consequences of their own bad choices. They said that we should be considering alternative solutions based entirely on market principles. These are precisely my instincts as well, and I couldn't agree more, but I've ultimately concluded that this bill is a necessary evil. 
   Why can't we let the market sort itself out this time? 
   Because, Madam Speaker, the market didn't cause this mess. Let me say that again: While people say we should allow the marketplace to sort this situation out on its own, we should not do that because the marketplace did not create this mess. Government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made this mess possible. Government regulators failed to apply adequate oversight. Today, we are not experiencing market failure. Let me say that again, Madam Speaker: Today, we are not experiencing market failure. We are experiencing the inevitable failure of government attempts to manipulate the market. The Federal Government must now do its part to undo the damage and allow the market to operate freely once again. 
   Shouldn't we let people suffer for their own mistakes? 
   Yes, we should, starting with the Wall Street executives who exacerbated this problem. This bill bans golden parachutes for those who seek assistance, which is one of the things that consistently came forward from my constituents, but the problem with today's crisis is that responsible people who have followed the rules are suffering, too, not just those who behaved irresponsibly. 
   Madam Speaker, as you know very well, small businesses are losing their lines of credit. Families who have saved for a down payment for years are unable to get home loans.     
   Parents and students are finding it difficult to get loans for tuition. Those nearing retirement have seen their nest eggs evaporate as the stock market has fallen. Today's credit crunch is hurting businesses and individuals indiscriminately. It is bringing our engines of growth to a grinding halt and shutting hardworking Americans out of their dreams. 
   The Los Angeles Times, my hometown paper, yesterday chronicled this deepening crisis, declaring, and I quote, ``Credit Freeze Puts Business on Thin Ice.'' 
   Madam Speaker, we know that our State of California is faced with very difficult circumstances as a State. We've heard that from our Governor. Small businesses all over California, as is the case in the rest of the country, are losing access to credit, getting forced into laying off workers and cutting operations. And they're looking for leadership from Congress. One business owner is quoted as saying, and I quote, ``Payrolls are getting harder to meet. Cash flow is extremely difficult. I'm getting the feeling that if we don't have a Federal deal, a lack of cash flow is going to bring everything to a halt.'' 
   Now, Madam Speaker, today's bill is rightly called a rescue bill. But who are we rescuing? 
   Madam Speaker, as you know very well, we're not rescuing the fat cats. The fat cats can take care of themselves. Today we want to rescue the working Americans whose livelihoods are threatened by our current economic situation which, again, has been caused by bad government policy. 
   Finally, there is the question of why we must consider this particular bill and not alternatives. This is a very good question, Madam Speaker. 
   I've been a big proponent of having an open process that allows for other plans to be considered. And just last night, I've offered plans like the LaTourette plan and others at the Rules Committee for us to allow just that. But those amendments have been rejected by the Rules Committee and we have only this one bill before us. So our choice is very simple, pass this bill, or do nothing. 
   This is not a perfect bill. It is far from a perfect bill, far from it. But it is far better than the original Paulson plan. It includes strong bipartisan oversight, accountability, a ban on golden parachutes and a 100 percent guarantee that the taxpayers will earn back every penny of their investment. Those are critical protections that Republicans fought for and won for the American taxpayers. 
   This bill was improved further by the Senate, which added more protections and credits for taxpayers. We can accept this important but imperfect bill or, Madam Speaker, we can do nothing. We saw on Monday the consequences of doing nothing. Today we have a second chance. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. I yield myself the balance of my time.  
   Madam Speaker, we are obviously dealing with a very, very serious and challenging issue here. The American people are hurting, and they are looking to us for leadership. 
   I strongly support the statement that was just outlined by my friend, Mr. LaTourette, the gentleman from Ohio. And we sought to make his amendment in order in the Rules Committee last night; unfortunately, it wasn't made possible. 
   We are faced with a clear choice: either deal with the situation that we have, the bill that is before us, or do nothing at this juncture. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I am voting ``no.'' I am voting ``no'' to a bailout for Wall Street. I am voting ``no'' to golden parachutes for those bums who have gotten us into this situation. I am voting ``no'' to a blank check for Secretary Paulson. I am voting ``no'' to taxpayer funding for ACORN. I am voting ``no'' to allowing judges to reduce the value of our homes. I am voting ``no'' to mandating union leaders to serve on boards of private businesses. I am voting ``no'' to government manipulation of the housing market. 
   Madam Speaker, I am voting ``yes'' to unclog our banking system. I am voting ``yes'' to increase protection for family and small business savings. I am voting ``yes'' to ensure that sons and daughters can have access to student loans so that they can get a college education. And I am voting ``yes'' to guaranteeing that taxpayer dollars are in fact going to be repaid and made whole. And, I am voting ``yes'' not to 1930s type of regulation; I am voting ``yes'' to 21st century regulation and oversight. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   The rule waives the application of the earmark disclosure rule against the amendment printed in part A of the committee report. The amendment is self-executed by the rule and, therefore, evades the application of clause 9. 
   I doubt that the self-executed amendment contains any earmarks; however, there is no statement in accordance with rule 9 that it does not.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and on this beautiful day in our Nation's Capital, I wish you and our colleagues a Happy Halloween and say that it is an honor to be here on what is a very important piece of legislation. 
   I thank my friend for yielding me the customary 30 minutes and want to congratulate him on his very thoughtful statement and say that I consider him to be one of the most able Members of the new class that has come in. I hope my saying that doesn't jeopardize his standing in the Democratic Caucus, but I do appreciate his hard work on the Rules Committee. 
   I was prepared, Madam Speaker, to rise in support of this rule, but I've decided to oppose the rule, and the reason I've decided to oppose the rule is not the fact that we, for the first time in the 110th Congress, have a substitute made in order on a bill that has come forth from the Committee on Ways and Means. I should say at the outset that last night our colleague Mr. Hastings of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, said that there was only one instance in the 109th Congress where an amendment was made in order by the then-majority for the consideration of a Ways and Means Committee bill, when, in fact, we researched that overnight and found that there were five instances, five instances in the 109th Congress where our majority, in fact, made in order an amendment to a Ways and Means Committee bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I would, at this point, include in the Record that statement which outlines those measures that we have put forward.  
   Bills referred to the Committee on Ways and Means considered under ``structured'' or ``modified closed'' rules in the 109th Congress: 
   1. H.R. 8--Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act of 2005. 
   2. H.R. 6--Energy Policy Act of 2005. 
   3. H.R. 4297--Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation Act of 2005. 
   4. H.R. 4437--Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005. 
   5. H.R. 4157--Health Information Technology Promotion Act of 2005.  
   Madam Speaker, so I do say that here we are on Halloween for the first time in this 10-month period of time having a substitute made in order, and I was, as I said, prepared to support the rule, but I've decided to oppose it. I decided to oppose it because of an article that I read in the Roll Call this morning which made it very clear that the Democratic majority is once again going down a path that they abandoned last summer, I'm happy to say, but they've unfortunately brought it to the forefront again, and that is the notion of casting aside the opportunity for the single bite at the apple that the minority has, and that is to offer the motion to recommit on measures. 
   Now, I know, Madam Speaker, that's a very inside baseball discussion, but our colleagues know that the motion to recommit is something that was often denied the Republican minority during the four decades before 1994, and when we won the majority in 1994, we made it very clear that we would, in fact, guarantee the minority, guarantee the minority a right to a motion to recommit, meaning at least one bite at the apple on a measure, even if all amendments were denied. 
   Now, this report has come forward that the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, Ms. Slaughter of  Rochester, New York, is in the midst of a discussion, and she said in this quote in the paper that she wants to not say that it is imminent but she wants to get it right, getting it right, shutting down the opportunity for the minority to have that single opportunity to address an issue in the bill. And so the mere fact that this has come to the forefront again, Madam Speaker, has led me to come to the conclusion that I can't be supportive of this rule that we're debating here today. 
   I will say that I am in opposition to the underlying legislation itself, but as I said, I'm very happy that we have the opportunity to debate a minority substitute for a major package from the Committee on Ways and Means. 
   Now, I mention this nearly 1-year period of time we've gone through, completed 10 months here, and we saw at the beginning of the Congress this wonderful document that I'm sure you've seen, Madam Speaker, that was put forward by Speaker Pelosi. It's entitled ``A New Direction for America.'' Now, in this document, she says that basically every measure that is considered here on the House floor, and I quote from this document. It says, ``should include procedure that allows an open, full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.'' 
   Now, Madam Speaker, that was what was stated by Speaker Pelosi at the beginning of this Congress, and today, Halloween 2007, October 31, marks the first time, the first time in the 110th Congress that this opportunity for the minority has been availed us.     
   I will say that we have repeatedly considered in the Rules Committee Ways and Means measures, and we have repeatedly asked for a minority substitute to be made in order so that our constituents, and this has nothing to do simply with party, this has to do with the right of each Member of Congress who represents 600,000 and some people to have their opportunity to be heard here. Unfortunately, throughout this entire year, up until this point, every request for that minority substitute has, unfortunately, been denied. 
   I am happy that we are finally, today, allowing what I know will be a very thoughtful substitute that will be debated by my California colleague, Mr. McKeon, the ranking Republican on the Committee on Education and Labor, as well as the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, our friend from Louisiana (Mr. McCrery). 
   I do commend my colleagues on the Rules Committee, the majority on the Rules Committee, for taking this first step. I hope very much that it is a sign of a new day at the Rules Committee. I hope that we will have this greater transparency, openness and bipartisanship which we were promised at the beginning of this year. 
   The underlying bill was actually a good place to start with this, in part, because the issue in question is so important, and, in part, because the proposal that has been reported from the Ways and Means Committee is in such dire need of improvement, that's why I believe that this substitute is one which should be able to enjoy very strong bipartisan support. 
   Madam Speaker, as you know very well, and you have been involved in the trade debate since you have come to the Congress, and I suspect you were probably interested in it even before you came to the Congress, the issue of trade adjustment assistance is a very, very critical and important and a very well-intentioned program that does need to be reformed and modernized in order to effectively help American workers compete in the worldwide marketplace. My friend from Vermont talked very thoughtfully about the issue of globalization and the fact that we have seen a dramatic improvement in our gross domestic product growth. 
   In fact, just this morning, I know it surprised many, we got the report that we have a 3.9 percent GDP growth rate annualized, the report that came from the Commerce Department this morning, demonstrating that opening up new markets and developing opportunities for U.S. workers and consumers has, in fact, been a positive. 
   I will acknowledge, and I know we are going to be hearing a lot of sob stories through this debate, and, frankly, I am sympathetic with those sob stories, the stories about people who have been victimized by trade. 
   But I have got to say that one of the sad things that I have observed in the debate on trade is that it is blamed for virtually every ailment of society. In fact, I often am reminded of the fact that one time a constituent came up to me a couple of years ago and said we didn't have a single illegal immigrant coming from Mexico into the United States until you passed the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
   We know very well that the North American Free Trade Agreement has actually created a third of a trillion dollars in cross-border trade between the United States and Mexico. I argue that the problem of illegal immigration would have been dramatically worsened had we not put into place the trade agreement which has improved the quality of life and the standard of living in both countries. 
   I will say that the middle-class population in Mexico today is larger than the entire Canadian population, and that is by virtue of the fact that we have seen economic growth take place in Mexico that is a by-product of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
   But having said all of that, as we will continue to rage on with the debate on the benefits of trade as we face, I hope, in the coming weeks and months the trade agreements for Peru, Panama, Colombia and South Korea, I will recognize that there are some sectors of our society that have not benefited from trade, and that's why we are here today. We are here today to recognize that it is very, very important for us to do everything possible to address the concerns of those workers who have been negatively impacted by trade. 
   Unfortunately, what the Democrats have done is to take an inefficient program and compound the inefficiencies and inadequacies and block all efforts to build more accountability into the system, which we all believe is very important. Then they intend to self-execute the fusion of this ill-advised proposal with another bill that imposes massive new regulations on American job creators. Perhaps most troubling is that this bill opens the door for TAA benefits to be granted to illegal immigrants. If we look at that problem, potentially having illegal immigrants benefiting from the program, if we look at the regulatory burden which is going to impinge on those who are creating jobs, I think we have got to recognize that we have a lot of work to do on that. I believe the substitute is the best answer. 
   The Democratic majority has tried to distract us all from the mess they have created by throwing billions of dollars at the problem. Of course, since money sadly does not grow on trees, the Democratic majority has once again resorted to raising taxes to pay for their boondoggle that won't actually do what they claim, in this case helping American workers deal with job loss. In fact, by saddling businesses, large, medium and small, with hefty new regulations, they are further diminishing our economic competitiveness and, in fact, exacerbating the problem that they purport to address with the measure that they have brought forward. 
   How the Democratic majority can say with a straight face that they want to help workers and yet are determined to shut down the job creators is beyond me. Whoever said irony was dead should just turn to C-SPAN. It's alive and well here on the House floor. 
   The challenges facing Americans in 2007 are very, very different than the challenges of just a few years ago, let alone when the TAA was established. Fundamentally, we are still striving for the same things we always have, good jobs that allow us to provide for our families and ensure a better life for our children. But we are achieving these goals in very different ways, and facing very different obstacles. The reality is that opportunity and challenge often go hand in hand. 
   One enterprising young entrepreneur may be very successful at tapping into the global economy, finding clients and contractors all over the world, allowing businesses to grow here at home and creating lots of good, well-paying jobs for Americans. But the company down the street might not navigate the effects of globalization so successfully. It may find itself struggling to compete with Indian software designers or  Polish manufacturers or Australian marketing firms. The opportunities are limitless, but the challenges are broad-based. Limiting our focus to just those whose jobs are directly impacted by trade is a hopelessly narrow and simplistic approach. Trade is just one factor in the ever-churning economy that we face. 
   As I said, unfortunately, there is this tendency by many, the moment they witness any kind of change, the moment they witness any kind of displacement, the moment they witness any kind of problem at all, they want to blame it on trade, and that is just plain wrong. 
   There are new technologies growing exponentially and changing the nature of jobs and job creation irreversibly. 
   There are new competitors halfway across the globe that are in the marketplace whether we trade with them or not. There are 100 million Chinese workers who have been lifted out of abject poverty and are entering the middle class for the first time ever. Madam Speaker, you know as a proponent of trade that these are all good things, but we have to change our thinking in a very broad way if we don't want to drown in a sea of changes that we aren't prepared to navigate. 
   We need better math and science education from kindergarten all the way up. We need to make adult continuing education a part of everyday life. We need to enhance the financial literacy of American families. We need an economic agenda that is focused on growth and competitiveness, including opening up new markets for American producers and service providers. In other words, we need policies that assure that individuals are always finding new and better job opportunities. 
   When all else fails, we need worker assistance programs that help all workers get the training they need throughout an entire lifetime in an effective way that actually allows them to continue to climb up the economic ladder. We need programs that help to keep workers competitive, regardless of why they have lost their jobs. Whether the blame lies with technology, lost competitiveness, or simply dying industries that are going the way of blacksmiths and buggy whip makers, the only thing that matters is that every American can find a job and remain upwardly mobile throughout a lifetime. 
   As I said, Mr. McCrery and Mr. McKeon have crafted a very thoughtful substitute that would work to accomplish just that. It would integrate trade adjustment assistance into other Federal worker programs so that we can help all workers facing tough times to get the training they need to remain competitive. Let me say again, we are very, very committed to ensuring that those workers who are facing tough times because of displacement that has come about due to trade agreements, that their concerns and their needs are addressed. 
   It would integrate trade adjustment assistance, as I said, in other Federal worker programs. In particular, it focuses on the Workforce Investment Act which has, as we all know, been very, very effective. This substitute would provide greater flexibility for workers so that they can actually get their training and education while they work, over a longer period of time. It would bring trade adjustment assistance into the 21st century, broadening its focus to reflect the new realities of the worldwide marketplace. It would ensure that the program remains accountable so that we can assure the taxpayers that their money is being spent in an effective and an efficient way. It would do all this without raising a single tax or creating any additional barriers to innovation and entrepreneurship. 
   This very thoughtful substitute is based on the premise that broad, far-reaching challenges demand broad, far-reaching solutions. And it is based on the very logical and simple fact that workers don't benefit when government puts job creators out of business. The Democrats' bill, on the other hand, takes a very narrow and flawed approach, while drastically increasing the money that we are wasting. Only the Democrats could manage to think small and spend big all in the same bill. 
   I hope today we can have a meaningful debate on the important issue of enhancing the competitiveness of the U.S. economy and ensuring that American workers, all workers, have access to new and better opportunities. I believe that our substitute gets us closer to that goal, and I anxiously look forward to the debate on this proposal. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   And I would say to my good friend from New York that I think he's taken out of context my use of the term ``sob story.'' 
   Now, as I said, I am a strong proponent of trade adjustment assistance and want to do everything that I possibly can to ensure that workers who have been negatively impacted by any kind of trade agreement are, in fact,  able to receive the training and the benefits that can help them improve their standard of living and their quality of life. 
   But, Madam Speaker, when I was using the term ``sob story,'' what I was talking about is the fact that time and time again we have demands made on those job creators out there, demands made of job creators which undermine their ability to create jobs and opportunities for people so that they can succeed. And then we, unfortunately, are faced with complaints coming from those people who are negatively impacted by the demands of policies that they have made to increase the regulatory burden, to increase the tax burden, which prevents those who are struggling to create new opportunities for U.S. workers from having an opportunity. 
   It looks like my friend would like me to yield to him. I am happy to yield to my friend.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. If I can reclaim my time, Madam Speaker, the point that I try to make on trade is that it is a win-win. As I said in my statement, we have just this morning gotten the news of a 3.9 percent Gross Domestic Product growth rate, annualized, which is the largest growth rate that we've had in a year and a half. 
   Now, I recognize that we have problems out there with the subprime market. We have lots of difficulties with which we're trying to contend. 
   I think it's very important, Madam Speaker, for us to note that as we deal with these problems they are not trade related. They are not trade related. In fact, the standard of living, quality of life, 3.9 percent GDP growth rate that we're enjoying is due to the fact that we are in the midst of prying open new markets for U.S. workers so that they can sell to them. 
   As I said in the Rules Committee last night, Madam Speaker, 96 percent, 96 percent of the world's consumers are outside of our borders. The world has access to our consumer market. The world can sell to the consumers in New York, in California, and in other States as well. That has helped improve the quality of life and the standard of living for the American people. And so as that has happened, we have access to our market, but unfortunately, those other markets around the world are not as open as ours. 
   What is it that these agreements do that have been negotiated with Peru, Panama, Colombia and South Korea, and I hope, Madam Speaker, that we can do many more of these agreements. What they do is they pry open their markets for U.S. goods and services.     
   For example, in Colombia, the tariff rate on U.S. goods going into Colombia is 11 times greater than the tariff rate on Colombian products coming into the United States. 
   So, Madam Speaker, what we are saying is we want to create opportunities for U.S. workers so that they can export more. And, yes, if there is some displacement, we want to do everything that we possibly can to ensure that those workers who are negatively impacted by trade are, in fact, able to be trained and have the assistance that they need. 
   With that, I would like to inquire of the Chair how much time is remaining on each side.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The point that I am trying to make is that people who are impacted on a wide range of other factors that are not trade related are not those who should be directly benefiting from this. 
   We need to look at ourselves, what it is that we as a Nation can do to ensure that those individuals about whom my good friend has just spoken, who are laid off and are looking for new opportunities and want to have an opportunity to succeed, we need to look at what policies we can pursue in ensuring that we create the kind of opportunities those people deserve. Because right now government policies with a tax and regulatory policy and a lack of opportunity to sell in new markets around the world, because we have not proceeded with those trade agreements, are the things that are jeopardizing the ability for those U.S. workers to find the kind of opportunities they need. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   A couple of things. At the outset, Madam Speaker, I referred to a statement that was made by my good friend from Fort Lauderdale on the Rules Committee last night when he said that there was only one opportunity in the 109th Congress for an amendment to be made in order for a Ways and Means Committee bill when, in fact, we researched that, as I said, and Mr. Hastings was absolutely wrong when he said it. We have five instances in the 109th Congress where we, in fact, did make in order amendments for Mr. Rangel on the Ways and Means Committee for the consideration of measures. 
   Also stated last night, unfortunately, our friend from Worcester (Mr. McGovern) made a statement that all trade adjustment assistance measures have been considered under suspension or closed rules. There was an item that was considered under suspension. As I said, if it's considered under suspension and passed, it means that there is clearly a strong bipartisan consensus because, as our colleagues know, Madam Speaker, one is required to have a two-thirds vote to make that happen. 
   But there was another bill that dealt with this issue. It was H.R. 3090, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, and it was considered under a structured or modified closed rule in the 107th Congress and it provided then-Ranking Member RANGEL with an amendment in the nature of a substitute. So I just think it's important for us to make clear that we, in fact, did provide those kinds of opportunities. 
   Madam Speaker, as I said, I was prepared to support this rule. I do believe that it is a monumental accomplishment that, as we have gotten to October 31, Halloween, we are for the first time seeing a substitute made in order for the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, and I congratulate the Democratic majority, after having made this promise in January in a New Direction for America, that great document put forward by Speaker Pelosi in which the promise was made that amendments, open, full, fair debate, including a substitute, and it has taken us until October 31 before that has happened, but I celebrate,  Madam Speaker, the fact that we have finally gotten to this point. That was what was going to lead me to be supportive of this rule. 
   But then I picked up the Roll Call newspaper, one of our affectionately called ``rags'' on Capitol Hill here. On page 3 I looked, and I have a printout of it right here, the article goes through a press conference that the majority leader held yesterday and a statement by the very distinguished Chair of our committee, the gentlewoman from Rochester (Ms. Slaughter), in which she said the following: ``Nothing is imminent. We want to take our time and do it right.'' 
   Madam Speaker, what she is referring to is this quest that was launched by the Democratic majority to undermine the minority's right to offer a motion to recommit. Now, again, as I said earlier, this is all inside baseball, but the motion to recommit means that nearly half of the American people, through their elected representatives, Democrat or Republican, have a right to offer a motion to recommit. 
   There have been some very thoughtful motions to recommit, 21, 22 of them that have succeeded in this Congress. Madam Speaker, we are in the minority. They would not have succeeded had we not seen a large number of Democrats join, and in a number of cases they have been passed nearly unanimously on recorded votes. So now with what are described as simply political moves, which are, interestingly enough, very thoughtful proposals that have been propounded by the Members of the minority, we are being told that once again the majority is looking to deny nearly half the American people the right to be heard on one single instance. So for that reason, I am going to encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule. 
   I am going to ask Members also to oppose the previous question on the rule so that I can amend the rule to allow the House to go to conference with the Senate on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill, which passed this House with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
   There have been reports that the majority leadership is planning on playing a political game with our veterans and our men and women on the front lines by wrapping the Defense bill and the Veterans Affairs bill into the Labor, Health and Human Services bill. 
   The Military Construction bill could have been sent to the President's desk weeks ago, but the Democratic leadership was content to play political games with America's kids. All we have asked this majority to do is to simply come to the table and I am asking here today that we oppose the previous question so that I can make in order an amendment that would allow us to proceed with this.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3920, TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, we are here discussing trade adjustment assistance, and it is designed to ensure that, we as an institution, will have an opportunity to, as I said earlier, open up those very important markets around the world. They're all relatively small, and the United States of America has a $13.3 trillion economy, the largest economy the world has ever known. We have lots of things that are trade-related that are beneficial to the United States of America. First and foremost is our national security. I think it is critical for us to proceed with passage of the Panama, Peru and Colombia free trade agreements for the security of this hemisphere. Similarly, the Korea agreement is very important because we all know about the challenges that exist on the Korean peninsula, and engaging in greater economic exchanges between and among these countries is very important for our Nation's security. 
   At the same time, Madam Speaker, it is important that we do what we can to ensure that we have the very important trade adjustment assistance for those Americans who are negatively impacted by trade. 
   With that, I am going to urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question. And if by chance the previous question proceeds, I am going to urge a ``no'' vote on this rule because of the kinds of things that the new majority is trying to do to undermine the rights of nearly half the American people. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (U.S. SERVICES INDUSTRY ESSENTIAL TO GLOBAL ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, when we look at the issue of globalization and the rapid economic rise of countries like India and China, critical questions about the continued competitiveness of the U.S. economy are understandably raised. Are there industries where we still have a comparative advantage? Can we compete with countries that have more than a billion people? Will the power of our innovation maintain our global economic leadership? These are complicated questions that demand a thorough analysis of our economy, our strengths and our weaknesses and the policies we are pursuing. I have explored some of these very issues in recent weeks from some remarks I have been making here in the House. 
   Actually, as we look at the very positive indicators we have in the U.S. economy, we are thriving because of our engagement in the worldwide marketplace. Because of the complexity of these issues, we need a rigorous, open and honest debate. But today I want to talk about an economic issue that is not at all complicated, Madam Speaker; a matter of benefits that is so clear and widespread that it may be the one single globalization issue that is too simple to refute, and that is the issue of our services industry. 
   Services have become absolutely crucial to our economic growth, employment and international trade. This sector represents nearly 80 percent of both economic output and private employment in this country. Services are essential inputs into the production of virtually all products that we make, sell, buy or consume. The price and quality of services influence cost and productivity in all other sectors of the economy, including manufacturing and agriculture. 
   Because our economy has come to rely on efficient, innovative and effective services, the industry has grown to become the largest part of our economy. In fact, services account for 78 percent of private sector GDP, or in excess of $8.5 trillion. 
   This tremendous growth can be seen in our workforce as well. Since 1993, the services sector has added roughly 25 million new jobs to our economy, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that virtually all new employment in the United States over the next half decade will be in the area of services. 
   While the issue of job creation is absolutely critical to the strength of our economy, the issue of job quality is absolutely critical to standards of living. Again, the services industry is at the cutting edge, creating jobs that pay very well. Services jobs pay an average of $51,045 annually. In many service industries, ranging from professional services, management services, wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, financing, insurance, information services and others, the average compensation levels are significantly higher than that. These are the types of jobs that constantly offer the opportunity to learn new skills, develop expertise and continue to climb the economic ladder. These are not the hamburger-flipping jobs that the service industry has been maligned for in the past. These are high-quality, high-paying jobs that offer the chance of advancement and an ever-increasing quality of life, and they are the backbone of our economy. 
   Just as the service industry has thrived here at home, it is tremendously competitive in the worldwide economy as well. Madam Speaker, U.S. financial services, express delivery, telecommunications, entertainment, audio-visual services and IT are achieving exceptional success around the globe. With 95 percent of the world's consumers outside of the United States, their presence in foreign markets is crucial for their global competitiveness. 
   Today, the U.S. is the world's largest service exporter. U.S. services exports have reached nearly $400 billion annually, with a trade surplus of about $66 billion. Our services companies have built this record, even though faced with high and complex barriers in many key foreign markets. The service sector remains one of the most tightly closed and controlled industries within our trading partners around the world. The removal of these barriers is crucial to our continued competitiveness. 
   As services become more liberalized, they will have an even more powerful effect on the competitiveness of our entire economy. When it comes to the issue of globalization, services are a clear example of American competitive advantage and global leadership. 
   Some facets of the globalization debate involve complex issues and challenges that require a great deal of careful consideration and analysis for us to fully understand them. But the U.S. service industry stands out as a clear, irrefutable example of how the U.S. economy thrives through global engagement, and it is a powerful and compelling indicator of how much our economy has to gain by expanding that engagement with the rest of the world's consumers, producers, workers and investors. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to pursue an economic agenda that empowers U.S. companies and entrepreneurs to harness the power of the worldwide marketplace to grow our economy right here at home.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2638, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to this rule. As has been pointed out by our distinguished Chair, Ms. Slaughter, and the gentleman from Miami, Mr. Diaz-Balart, in their thoughtful remarks on this issue, this is an open rule. The problem is, we are still dealing with this problem of the lack of reform in the earmark process. It is for that reason that having voted upstairs, yes, the fact that we haven't brought about the very important reform that is necessary to this horrendous earmark process, that I am going to join with Mr. Diaz-Balart when he calls for defeat of the previous question and an opportunity that would be allowed by defeating the previous question for us to offer an amendment that would take on this earmark issue. 
   Mr. Diaz-Balart very correctly pointed to the fact that in the 109th Congress we were able to implement very important, sweeping reforms for the earmark process. We know that there was understandable, bipartisan outrage that was reflecting the concern of the American people over the abuse of earmarks. There are people who are in prison today because of this, among other reasons. That is why last fall, we stepped up to the plate, and under our Republican leadership, we put together a bipartisan support for earmark reform. 
   At that time, unfortunately, our colleagues who were in the minority and today in the majority described those reforms as a sham and meaningless. But those reforms, Mr. Speaker, guaranteed accountability, transparency, enforcement, disclosure, things that have been completely thrown out the window unfortunately in the 110th Congress. 
   So while they described the very important, tough reforms that we had in the 109th Congress as a sham, they have gone right down into the drain and really created potential for little more than abuse of the issue of earmarks. 
   We have already seen examples of that. Of course, the problem that took place in the clash between the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriation Subcommittee, Mr. Murtha, and our colleague from Michigan, Mr. Rogers, when it came to the issue of earmarks. Unfortunately, there was no chance whatsoever for us, because of the lack of enforcement that exists now under the Democratic leadership, for us to get at that. 
   Then when we heard just last week the words that came from the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Obey, that we will not see earmarks provided in the appropriations process itself, but instead, what we are going to see is this secret slush fund put into place that allows, in a very secretive process, to ``air drop'' these earmarks into a conference report that could come out at some later point. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, that is not what the American people wanted when they called for reform of this earmark process. That is not what they expected. It is not what they got with the reforms that we put into place in the 109th Congress. But unfortunately, well, we had these great reforms, but they have been thrown out the window in the attempt to continue to, in a surreptitious manner, seek these things in there. 
   We just marked the 20th anniversary of the very famous speech that was delivered by Ronald Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate where President Reagan said, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.'' I have been reminded, I mentioned here last week when we had two votes on different rules to try and bring about reform of the earmark process another famous speech Ronald Reagan gave in the negotiating process with the Soviet Union. He said, and I have now been working on my Russian on this, ``Doveryai no Proveryai,'' which meant ``trust but verify.'' 
   The fact of the matter is, we want to be able to trust our colleagues, fellow elected representatives, to do the right thing when it comes to earmarks. But we feel very strongly that the American people should have the right and the opportunity to verify whether or not those dollars that are being spent can, in fact, stand up to the light of day. 
   So while I am pleased that we are going to have a truly open rule if, in fact, this thing passes, I am going to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question. And if we don't succeed, Mr. Speaker, in defeating the previous question, I am going to urge all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to vote ``no'' on this rule because of the fact that it does not step up to the plate and allow us to have the kind of reform of earmark abuse that the American people desperately want.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (HONEST LEADERSHIP AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding, and I want to say what a privilege it is for me to be, as always, on the floor with the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my good friend from Detroit (Mr. Conyers) and, of course, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, my friend from San Antonio (Mr. Smith). 
   Mr. Speaker, as I listen to the distinguished Chair go through the litany of items that are included in this measure, I couldn't help but think it's virtually identical to what we passed in the last Congress. I know there are a number of things we came to agree upon, and so that's why I rise today in somewhat quiet resignation over this so-called Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. I am not opposed to the bill. I am not opposed to the bill because, frankly, there is nothing to be opposed to. 
   The bill that I sponsored that Mr. Smith referred to in the last Congress was repeatedly referred to by our leadership colleagues on the other side of the aisle as a sham. They regularly said that the items that frankly were just outlined by Mr. Conyers in this bill that he is describing, when I offered it, it was described as a sham. 
   But my colleagues, unfortunately, while we were successful during the House consideration of the bill to bring it up to the sham level from its initial sub-sham status, I would argue that this bill is not much better overall on the substance, and it is far, far worse on the process, which is a big part of the responsibilities that I have. 
   The new majority, as we all know, promised us open conferences, with meaningful participation by the minority party. What we have here is a willful effort to avoid a conference entirely without any participation by Republicans or public disclosure of the language. 
   Now, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules just last week complained to me about how the former chairman of the Ways and Means Committee never told his ranking member about where and when conferences on tax bills were meeting. 
   Well, I have got to hand it to the new majority. They have come up with a novel answer to that problem. Don't hold conferences at all. That way, you aren't even bothered with having to file a conference report. That's right, the most open Congress in history, which is what we have continued to hear this one described as, has not made the text of its ballyhooed lobbying bill available to the public or rank-and-file members anywhere, anywhere that we could find. 
   As late as 8:30 this morning, we checked the Speaker's Web site, the majority leader's Web site, the Judiciary Committee's Web site, even Thomas. It was nowhere to be found. 
   We were able, we were able, though, to get a copy of it. Guess how? We got it from a lobbyist. When I say that there was no participation by Republicans, I mean none, none whatsoever. 
   As I said, I have the greatest regard for my friend from Detroit (Mr. Conyers) who works so ably as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I appreciate his support for my amendment that I offered on floor. 
   However, you can imagine my surprise when I discovered late yesterday that there were changes in my amendment in the document that we have in front of us. Now, these changes aren't  bad changes. I am not going to complain about the changes that were made. They probably actually improved the amendment; that's what the legislative process is all about. 
   But if the majority really wanted to declare a new day and live up to the promises of inclusion, calling me, asking me my thoughts on the change might have been a step in the right direction; but apparently the majority just couldn't be bothered with that at all. 
   There is a great deal missing from this bill that a majority of the House, including 138 Democrats, voted for, things like a reverse revolving door, requiring a lobbyist to disclose earmarks that they are lobbying for, and an end to the State and local governments lobbying loophole. 
   Despite promises to the contrary, they haven't extended our earmark rules to cover authorizing and tax bills, which is one of the last things we did in this Congress. Unfortunately, we have yet to bring the new majority's level up to ours on dealing with that disclosure on authorizing and tax bills. 
   As the majority pushes this bill through without any input from Republicans, they are responsible for its content. They are responsible for its content, not us. 
   I mourn this missed opportunity for bipartisanship, which we continue to hear about on a regular basis, and, frankly, grieve the broken promises which, not just Republicans, but the American people have been subjected to.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (GLOBALIZATION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, if we take a look at the last half century, it is clear that there has been no greater force for positive economic and political change than globalization. Yes, Mr. Speaker, I said globalization.  
   Greater integration of the world's economies has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the developing world, nearly doubled the middle class population in Mexico and expanded our economy into a $13 trillion global leader for greater economic and political freedom. 
   The benefits of globalization can be seen every single time that a Chinese blogger gets past government censors or a U.S. company trains factory owners in Thailand in worker rights and protections. 
   So how did the greatest engine of global prosperity become so maligned? How did this poverty fighting, democracy enhancing force get blamed for all of the world's evils, from job losses in Michigan to poor water quality in Guatemala? 
   In part, Mr. Speaker, this can be explained by the fact that globalization has improved so many aspects of our lives, but it has done so in very subtle ways. As a result, we do not always recognize its benefits. 
   When you go to the grocery store and find fresh grapes in the dead of winter, you might not know that the fact that they are there and fresh and reasonably priced is that they come from Chile. You just know that you get to enjoy those winter grapes. 
   When you buy educational software for your second grader, you might not know that it was developed by a small business in Pennsylvania, assembled in Malaysia and serviced by a technical support firm in India. You just know that your daughter is starting to do a better job at reading. 
   When you buy a new TV because Wal-Mart finally had it at a price you could afford, you might not know that they cut costs by developing and implementing a revolutionary operational structure. You may not know that they source, ship and track goods to and from every corner of the globe by using such innovative practices that they have transformed the entire retail industry. You just know that you get to watch this Sunday in the Super Bowl the Colts and the Bears play away on an amazing screen. 
   Globalization has impacted us in countless ways, with improvements that range from a better MP3 player to a better job, and together they contribute to a better life. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, while the improvements to our standard of living often go unnoticed, the challenges that come with change are painfully clear. When a factory closes down, the hardship is very real and very visible. For the individuals who face those tough times, winter grapes and flat-screen TVs seem absolutely meaningless.     
   When confronted with the difficult challenges change can bring, it is very natural to condemn change itself. But like all hard things in life, it is just not that simple. While one company suffers from competition from China, several others thrive by utilizing low cost, high-quality Chinese goods. A tech company contracts with a call center in India; and as a result of the cost savings, they can afford to hire new programmers here in the United States. 
   In fact, the numbers overwhelmingly show that globalization has been an enormous net positive for job creation right here at home: over 20 million new jobs since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, including more than 7 million new jobs in the last 3 1/2 years. Unemployment, as we all know, is at a near historic low of 4 1/2 percent. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, while the benefits have been dispersed to all Americans, there is no denying that there are those who have faced great challenges. So do we try to halt the march of globalization? Let us set aside the question of whether we should deny the tremendous benefits for all in order to try to protect the few. 
   Let us ask the question, Can we do that? Can we protect an industry from losing jobs? If so, do we protect textile workers or the workers who design, market, and sell apparel? Do we protect manufacturers that make steel products or the manufacturers that use steel products? Maybe we should all buy American. Does that mean that we buy Fords that are made in Canada and assembled with Mexican parts? Or do we buy Toyotas made in Kentucky with American and Japanese parts? Do we buy iPods designed in California, but assembled in China? The fact is, globalization has made old ideas about protectionism absolutely obsolete. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is essential that we recognize the leading role that we as a country are facing. I urge my colleagues in a bipartisan way to join in support of this effort.  
   But like all hard things in life, it's just not that simple. While one company suffers from competition with China, several others thrive by utilizing low-cost, high-quality Chinese goods. A tech company contracts with a call center in India, and as a result of the cost savings, they can afford to hire new programmers. In fact, the numbers overwhelmingly show that globalization has been an enormous net positive for job creation: Over 20 million new jobs since the implementation of NAFTA, including 7 million jobs in the last 3 1/2 years. Unemployment has dropped to 4.5 percent, a near-historic low. 
   But while the benefits have been dispersed to all Americans, there's no denying that there are those who have faced great challenges. So do we try to halt the march of globalization? Let's set aside the question of whether we should deny the tremendous benefits for all in order to try to protect the few. Let's ask the question of can we? 
   Can we protect an industry from losing jobs? If so, do we protect textile workers, or the workers who design, market and sell apparel? Do we protect manufacturers that make steel products, or the manufacturers that use steel products? Maybe we should all ``Buy American.'' Does that mean we buy Fords, made in Canada and assembled with Mexican parts? Or do we buy Toyotas, made in Kentucky with American and Japanese parts? Do we buy iPods, designed in California, but assembled in China? The fact is, globalization has made old ideas about protectionism obsolete. Its impact is wide, pervasive and irreversible. We simply do not have the option anymore of withdrawing from the world and denying ourselves the benefits of a global marketplace. 
   Our only option is to use the prosperity it has brought to help those who are struggling. It doesn't matter why a job is lost. Whether globalization played a part or not, what matters is that workers have the skills they need to find even better jobs than the ones that were lost. If we make a commitment to American competitiveness, including worker competitiveness, we can both enjoy the benefits and address the challenges of a global economy. 
   What we can't afford to do is demonize the source of our unparalleled prosperity. There's no question individuals will face hardship at times, and that naturally breeds anxiety. But anti-globalization rhetoric that exploits and preys upon the anxieties of working families is cheap, dirty politics. And it is dangerous. It risks the growing standard of living that the world's economic liberalizers are enjoying. I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject the politics of isolationism and continue to pursue the path of greater economic integration in the worldwide marketplace.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished Rules Committee colleague, my friend from Tampa, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, even though we went through that little bump with my colleague from Pasco temporarily handling it. And I have to say that this is obviously a very solemn, serious and difficult time for our Nation as we are in the midst of facing a financial crisis the likes of which no Member of this House has seen, probably even our oldest Members have not witnessed. Maybe we have a couple of people. Maybe Ralph Hall lived during the Depression. But it is something that most of us clearly have never witnessed before. 
   People are likening this to the economic challenges that we faced following the Second World War. And we are attempting, as we all know, in a bipartisan way to deal with this issue. Our distinguished Republican whip, Mr. Blunt, is involved in these bipartisan negotiations so that we will be able to have a package emerge from this institution in a bipartisan way that will be able to stabilize the markets, respect the American taxpayer and ensure the kind of stability when people are seeking to keep their homes, run their small businesses and engage in the normal activities that exist in the United States of America. 
   And it's with that as a backdrop, Mr. Speaker, that I have to paraphrase the statement of the former running mate of Ross Perot, the late Admiral James Stockdale, who, in the famous oft-quoted Vice Presidential debate in 1992, said: ``Who am I and why am I here?'' I would ask that somewhat rhetorically, Mr. Speaker, because we are here dealing with a very important issue. Of course job creation is priority number one. Making sure that we can stimulate our economy is a very, very important issue. But this is not the way to do it. And 1 hour ago, the United States Senate made that decision by defeating the motion to proceed in the Senate. So this is dead. 
   The President of the United States put out a statement of administration policy in which he said that this measure would be vetoed if it were to get to the President. And it's not going to. And so that is why I ask, Who are we and why are we here? Because there is absolutely nothing but political posturing taking place. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is being done in the most outrageous of ways in that we regularly show here something that was touted 2 years ago, but we never hear the majority Members talk about any longer, and that is a document called ``A New Direction for America.'' This document was designed to talk about the very important degree of openness and transparency that would exist if in fact the Democrats were to take control of the United States Congress. And unfortunately with where we are, we have completely eviscerated that entire concept of ``A New Direction for America.'' 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, we are all accustomed to hectic, get-out-of-town weeks. The heaviest lifting typically falls to weeks prior to district work periods, when we're all anxious to return home to hear from our constituents. But even under the circumstances, this week's proceedings are absolutely unprecedented. The emergency negotiations, as I mentioned, on a financial rescue package are very difficult. And they are very challenging. And we want to see it done in an appropriate way. But they have been made all the  more frantic because they're set against a backdrop of a year's worth of unfinished business right here in the House of Representatives. 
   The Democratic majority has unfortunately shirked virtually every one of its core duties and obligations as legislators. Our most basic and fundamental job is the responsible and efficient spending of the taxpayers' dollars. That is the single most important thing that we do here, is responsibly, with the power of the purse, spending these dollars. This is done through the passage of 12 appropriations bills as we all know. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, how many of these 12 bills has the House passed as we began this very difficult week? One. Only one of the 12 appropriations bills was passed. And how many have become law? Zero. Not a one. So we arrived at this last week of session for the fiscal year without enacting a single appropriations bill. 
   The Democratic leadership had long since abandoned any plan for attempting to make progress on our constitutional power of the purse. Their solution? Write a bill to put off their duties for another 6 months. They can't be bothered to do their jobs now or after the election. They want to wait until the fiscal year is half over before finally getting to work. 
   So we started this week after what amounts to a 9-month vacation from responsible legislating. The Democratic majority decided to take three of the 12 appropriations bills, one of which never even went through committee, and slap them together. They tacked on $55 billion in extra funding for various causes, extended their fiscal deadline for 6 months and sent it up to the Rules Committee barely an hour before we reported it out. 
   The entire body of their appropriations work for the entire year was put together in one bill, the bulk of which was delayed by half a year. They were kind enough to give us an hour before meeting on the rule at nearly 11 o'clock at night. It was on the floor the next morning. And voila. They put the entire Federal budget to bed as far as they were concerned. 
   But that was Tuesday. What did we do yesterday? The Democratic majority's flawed tax extenders bill, and a $100 million mistake. In their rush to pump out bad legislation, the Rules Committee ended up passing out a rule and bringing it to the floor for a bill that no longer existed. Democrats and Republicans were actually voting on two different bills. The discrepancy, as I said, was over $100 million in tax increases. 
   Now to many in this institution on the other side of the aisle who have this sort of tax-and-spend mentality, $100 million in taxes may seem to be very insignificant. But not to the American people. Not to the American taxpayer, Mr. Speaker, and certainly not at times like these. Fortunately this mistake was caught, and we returned to the Rules Committee to fix it. What other mistakes have gone unnoticed? We may never know until it's too late. But this is the very real risk when you jam through a flawed agenda in a frantic and haphazard way. 
   And this bill is a perfect example of that. 
   Having punted on appropriations and jamming through the tax extenders bill after two tries, now the Democratic majority is free to turn to everything else they meant to do this year. How do you do a year's worth of work in 1 week? For starters, you don't, Mr. Speaker. You just don't. 
   There are a host of very critical issues that simply won't be addressed this week, such as our Nation's energy crisis. But you can certainly move things along by shutting down due process entirely. We did their hodgepodge appropriations bill without a single amendment or even a motion to recommit. We did their tax extenders bill without a single amendment either. 
   Now we are considering a rule to waive the rules to allow the underlying bill to be expedited. Then we will consider a rule to bring up the underlying bill. Again, this is a bill that the President has said he would veto and a bill that is similar to it is not even going to get through the United States Senate. So once again, under a completely closed process, there is no opportunity whatsoever for Members to participate in any kind of real debate. 
   What is the result of this haphazard way of legislating? First and foremost, there is clearly no deliberation. Now say what you want about this place, but the American people do send us here to think about, to discuss, to ponder and to try and work out a compromise in a bipartisan way as we proceed with what it is that we are trying to do. So no deliberation at all. I mean, there is no means for amendment. There is no means for open debate. Second, as we have just seen again from that tax extenders bill, mistakes are inevitable. 
   This clearly goes beyond poor policy. And shirking our duties for another 6 months is clearly very, very poor policy. As yesterday's proceedings demonstrate, Mr. Speaker, we are also talking about the sloppy mistakes that are an inevitable result of shoddy work. 
   The Democrats roundly criticized us for moving our agenda too quickly in the past few Congresses. They were particularly critical of not giving Members or the American people enough time to review legislation so this deliberative process could proceed. 
   Now on this document which I pointed to when I first stood up here entitled ``A New Direction for America,'' this document, by the way, I would say to our colleagues, is still available on the Speaker's Web site. So if anyone would like to read a copy of ``A New Direction for America,'' I commend it to them. 
   In this document, they promised this new direction, as I said. And it reads as follows: ``Members should have at least 24 hours to examine bill and conference report text prior to floor consideration.     
   ``Rules governing floor debate,'' it reads, ``must be reported before 10 p.m. for a bill to be considered the following day.'' 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I have no idea how ``2 hours'' equals ``at least 24 hours,'' which is what was promised in this New Direction for America by Speaker Pelosi. It is that kind of math, long on promises, short on results, that got us into our current financial crisis. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we consider today's underlying bill, amusingly called a stimulus bill by the Democratic majority, the American people should know it was written through the night and sent to us at 9:43 this morning. Not even Republican appropriators had seen it, so not even members of the Appropriations Committee have seen it. 
   I just had a chance to look through it, and we have some unbelievable things we have found in this. Members should know the Democratic majority is rushing to cover up 9 months of nothing with a flurry of activity in these waning hours of the 110th Congress. They are resorting to draconian measures and shutting out all meaningful debate in this charade. They are pushing off the real work for another 6 months. And they are producing such shoddy work that a $100 million tax increase is ``a mistake,'' and that kind of thing is appearing here. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is one sorry week for the House of Representatives. I don't believe that the American people will be fooled. 
   Now, of course, as my colleague talked about the importance of infrastructure construction, building schools, making sure that we provide relief to those who are truly in need and have suffered from the economic downturn that we all know is there, to do it in the way that is being done is, I think, a very, very sad commentary on this great deliberative institution. 
   So I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule. It is a martial law rule which is very, very unfair. We do need to, at the very least, give our Members an opportunity to have a chance to read this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to as I do this engage in a colloquy with my good friend from Hood River, Oregon, who has long been a great champion of something known as the Secure Rural Schools Program, something that has enjoyed very strong bipartisan support. In fact, five Democratic members the Rules Committee are cosponsors of legislation designed to address that. 
   I will say that obviously we know that as we deal with this economic downturn, everyone has acknowledged it, there are many things that do need to be addressed. And we know that FMAP is one of them, dealing with Medicaid reimbursement to our States, infrastructure construction, as I said, working to do what we can to stimulate economic growth. 
   We happen to believe very strongly that it is also essential for us to do all that we can to stimulate private sector economic growth. Now, I know that that term may be difficult for some in this institution to comprehend, but we do have a $14 trillion, that is with a T, a $14 trillion economy in the United States of America. We are the world's only complete superpower. And we are going through extraordinarily challenging economic times. But we need to remember that our goal with the package that we put together in dealing with this financial crisis will be one that is designed to create stability, security and confidence in our credit markets and in the overall financial system. No doubt about that. 
   My State of California, the West and other parts of the country are dealing with the fact that the Washington Mutual Bank was just taken over, and I have to say having spoken with top leaders at J.P. Morgan, I am very grateful that all of those deposits are in fact secure with J.P. Morgan's acquisition having taken place there. But we know in other areas there is a lot of uncertainty. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that we want to do what we can to put into place policies that will encourage private sector economic growth. Unfortunately, this so-called stimulus package that has been presented to us is one that is focused on public sector economic growth. 
   Again, many parts of it we support. It is very key for us to have an infrastructure system in this country if we are going to encourage the private sector movement of goods in the country and for people to be able to move around. We know that these are very important items. But there are many, many other things that we need to do to deal with private economic growth. 
   Now, I talked about the procedural problem that we have and the fact that this New Direction for America has been eviscerated by the actions that we are taking here, and that has been the case for the entire Congress, tragically. But we just now had, as my friend from Hood River said very well, received this at 9:43 this morning, so a number of us are having a chance to look at this. 
   My friend just pointed to me on page 12, the fact that we have something in this bill known as the 21st Century Green High Performing Public School Facilities for the Department of Education, which would allow for the construction of so-called green schools, putting roughly $3 billion, $3 billion in this, to build schools in the Mariana Islands, Micronesia and other spots. And I know that the package that my friend from Hood River, Oregon, has been championing, working with our Rules Committee colleague Mr. Hastings on for secure rural schools, has a cost of about $3.1 billion over a 4-year period. 
   So we are just finding these things out in this measure. To me, it is beyond the pale that they would come forward without allowing a single opportunity to work in a bipartisan way. 
   I congratulate my friend from Tampa for talking about the need for us to work in a bipartisan way. She is absolutely right. I totally concur with that. Unfortunately, this legislation is doing anything but that. 
   I would like to now yield to my friend from Hood River, Oregon, a great champion of the Secure Rural Schools Program.

   Mr. DREIER. If I could reclaim my time, Mr. Speaker, I began my remarks by talking about the fact that we are dealing with a very serious economic downturn and a financial crisis in this country, and very serious attempts are being made to work in a bipartisan way. We have Republican representation. I know Speaker Pelosi and those at the White House are working on this. 
   Now, to liken this $60 billion package that was just dropped on us, which is designed to dramatically increase public spending, with the effort that Democrats and Republicans alike are pursuing to try and deal with the economic challenges that we face as a country when it comes to the confidence level of markets and people who are losing their homes, is just preposterous.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me just say that we are, as I pointed out at the beginning of the debate on this issue, faced with a very serious economic downturn. A crisis of confidence exists in our financial markets. An attempt is being made in a bipartisan way to deal with that at this very moment. We all hope that there can be a resolution that ensures that taxpayers are not going to be unfairly saddled with a responsibility, and that the government is not going to expand its reach any further. 
   As we look at those bipartisan negotiations going on right now between the two bodies, including the White House, Democrats and Republicans alike, it seems to me that we need to recognize that what we are engaging in here is little more than posturing. Yes, we all acknowledge that there are things in this measure that are very important that we need to address, but this is not the way to do it--in an overnight package that was presented at 9:43 this morning, 46 pages long, rammed through the Rules Committee with a partisan vote, and already terminated in the United States Senate, and with the President of the United States stating that if he were to get this measure, he would, in fact, veto it. So I wonder why it is that we are here. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee has twice this week, before the Rules Committee, said that the most famous line from Franklin Delano Roosevelt's famous speech was, ``We have nothing to fear but fear itself,'' but, he said, the line that got the greatest ovation was, ``We must take action.''  
   It is very clear that we do need to take action. But action should not be taken in a way that completely undermines the deliberative process. 
   There were mistakes that were made in the past Congresses, and I will acknowledge that. Some of those mistakes that were made led to the establishment of this document called ``A New Direction for America.'' 
   This ``A New Direction for America'' has just been obliterated. It is absolutely worthless, because it has been thrown out the window, a commitment made that has been ignored. 
   I want to say that I hope that we can defeat this rule. We are going to try to defeat the previous question. Recognizing that this Nation needs to use more of its natural resources while looking to the future with renewable sources of energy, Republicans are advocating an all-of-above approach. We believe that this legislation will lower the price of gasoline, which is what fuels America's cars today.     
   If the previous question is defeated, I will move to amend the rule to allow a resolution which will prevent Congress from skipping town until we pass comprehensive legislation that will bring down the high cost of energy for American consumers. My colleagues will have the opportunity to support giving States the opportunity to explore and extract energy resources right off their own coasts, opening America's Arctic energy slope, extending renewal energy incentives, supporting research for alternative clean fuels, and minimizing unnecessary litigation that delays or prevents American energy production. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous materials inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pasco for yielding, and I congratulate him on his fine management of this rule; and I thank my friend from Ohio for her thoughtful remarks. 
   I have to say, as I have been listening to the debate from my friends on the other side of the aisle, they continually say this is a great day for education. But the tragic thing is that this is a horrible day for future generations. Why? Well, as the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), the former Rules Committee member, just stated, there are nine new entitlement programs included in this measure that is designed for budget savings. Reconciliation is all about trying to rein in the reach of the government, trying to bring about a modicum of fiscal responsibility. 
   Yesterday up in the Rules Committee, the distinguished Chair of the committee, my friend from Martinez, California, Mr. Miller, when asked why it is we are making these mandatory instead of discretionary, meaning we would have the opportunity to look at them again, to possibly make modifications in them, he said we have authorization bills that are done and they end up dying, so we need to make these programs mandatory. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, every single Democrat and Republican regularly talks about the need to rein in the so-called mandatory spending. We spend our time around this place talking about discretionary spending, earmarks and what we expend on the discretionary level. And it is a drop in the bucket compared to the mandatory programs that are out there. As we all know, Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, a wide range of mandatory programs exist, and this bill that is designed to bring about a reduction in spending establishes nine new mandatory programs. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it is very obvious that we need to defeat this rule and bring about a reconciliation bill that in fact will not expand the number of mandatory programs, and we have an opportunity to do that right now. When we go into this vote, Mr. Hastings is going to seek to defeat the previous question so we will have an opportunity to make in order the Castle amendment. A very, very respected member from Delaware, the former Governor of the State who is an expert on dealing with our Nation's education needs, offered an amendment in the Rules Committee that was unfortunately denied. That amendment simply said that as we look at these nine mandatory programs that are put into place, he goes ahead and establishes them. But instead of making them mandatory, he makes them discretionary, discretionary so that we will have an opportunity as Members of Congress to look at those issues. And the savings created go to what everyone says they want to increase, and that is the Pell Grant program. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to regularly support the notion of our global leadership role when it comes to trade, when it comes to technology, and I recognize that it is absolutely imperative for the United States of America to have the best education system possible so that we can remain competitive globally. 
   I have just come back with a number of my colleagues from Indonesia, from Mongolia and other countries in Asia over the Independence Day break, and one of the things that we found is that education is a key issue in these countries. We all know that in the United States of America we seem to be falling behind, so it is imperative that we do all that we can to ensure that there is access to education for our young people. I believe that we can put into place policies that will allow us to make education more affordable and more accessible without a dramatic increase in the number of mandatory programs. 
   The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) talked about his amendment that was denied totally by the Rules Committee. The only thing made in order in this bill is a manager's amendment that will actually be self-executed, not considered on the floor and debated but self-executed if this rule in fact passes, and the amendment in the nature of a substitute that is going to be offered by the ranking member of the committee, Mr. McKeon. But other than that, all of the other amendments that were offered, Democrats and Republicans were denied an opportunity to offer any amendments. 
   My California colleague, Mr. Bilbray, had a thoughtful amendment dealing with the basic pilot program as it relates to illegal immigration. All it was saying was that institutions that get Federal funding are required to comply with the basic pilot program as it relates to the hiring, potential hiring of people who are in this country illegally. That amendment is not going to be able to be debated or even considered in this measure. 
   Mr. Ehlers had amendments that he sought to make in order, as did Mr. Kline. They were very thoughtful proposals. Not one of them was made in order. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join with Mr. Hastings as he moves to defeat the previous question so that we can make Mr. Castle's amendment in order. That will allow us to take the expansive mandatory spending and shift it to discretionary spending, and the savings that we have go to the Pell Grant program. 
   If we do in fact fail in our quest to defeat the previous question, I hope my colleagues will vote against this rule so we can start over and do a very good and decent reconciliation package on this.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak briefly about the issue that my good friend from Burbank, Mr. Schiff, did, and that is the issue of minimum wage. 
   I am well aware of the fact that 80 percent of the American people believe we should increase the minimum wage, and I am for everyone's wage being increased. I want those who are struggling to get on the first rung of the economic ladder to have every opportunity possible. 
   That is why I think it is very important that as we prepare to embark on this debate on the minimum wage, that we focus on the most important item that we face and that was raised by Mr. Schiff, that being the issue of our being the richest economy in the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is not by accident. It is because of policies that we have put into place that are doing everything we can to ensure economic growth. So that is why as we look at this issue of making sure that people  who are dealing with economic challenges, we need to make sure that job creation is priority number one. And that is why focusing on reducing the tax and regulatory burden on those who are creating jobs should be priority number one.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5, COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Dallas for yielding, and I appreciate his fine management of this rule. 
   I rise in opposition to the rule, and I do so as we all share a very strong and passionate commitment to doing everything we possibly can to increase access and affordability for young people in this country who want to have an opportunity to gain the best education possible. 
   As I listened to my friend from Sacramento respond to Mr. Sessions, she was talking about the fact that tax cuts for the rich had in fact played a role in creating this huge deficit that we have today and that we need to focus on education rather than giving tax cuts to the rich; that we have this sea of red ink. Mr. Speaker, I just can't comprehend what it is that is being argued by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   Today, we have seen a reduction of $71 billion in the Federal deficit over what it was a year ago. The deficit is on a downward slope. Why is that? It is the fact we put into place growth-oriented tax cuts. 
   Now, a few years ago, the American people were decrying the fact if we graduated students, there wouldn't be jobs out there, there wouldn't be an opportunity for students once they graduated. And guess what has happened? Since we have put into place these tax cuts, we not only have reduced the deficit, we have created 7.2 million new jobs, many of which are being filled by young people who are graduating. 
   Now, we all recognize that it is absolutely essential that we do everything that we can, everything within our power, to make sure that young men and women have an opportunity to get into the best college possible and are able to afford their education. The tragedy is, as I listened to my colleague from Ohio, the new member of the Rules Committee, Ms. Sutton, she very, very eloquently argued on behalf of what we all aspire to, and that is making sure that we can be competitive, making sure that we have the best students possible, and that they graduate to the best jobs. 
   This bill, unfortunately, is very flawed. We had this campaign promise that was made; that we were going to cut all student loan interest rates in half so that we wouldn't see this huge burden imposed on the young people in our country. Well, unfortunately, this bill now is just making a very, very modest, minuscule step towards that goal of ensuring we bring about this massive reduction in interest rates. 
   The other thing, Mr. Speaker, that I think is very important for us to point out is that there will not be a single student who will have an opportunity to go to college because of this bill, and there will not be a single student who will see their tuition reduced because of this bill. And I believe that what we need to do is, we need to recognize that there is much work that needs to be done. We want to make sure that we lower those costs and do everything that we can to put into place greater transparency and disclosure. 
   This rule, unfortunately, denied us the opportunity to propose a very thoughtful amendment that was bipartisan. I know the Democrats would have joined in this if there had been an opportunity, because Democrats and Republicans both were denied an opportunity to participate in this process that would have allowed for disclosure of tuitions, and it would have incentivized institutions in this country to do everything possible to try and work to get those tuition rates down. 
   We need to make sure we have the best students possible. We need to make sure we have the best education possible. We need to focus on that. The real problem in this country is on K-through-12 education. That is where we need to focus our attention so that we can make sure we have people trained at an early point in life, so that they can then be poised to get into higher education. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a very, very flawed bill itself. The rule is an absolute outrage, the fact it denies any Democrat or Republican an opportunity to participate, and I urge opposition to it.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding, Mr. Speaker. 
   Let me just say my friend has just indicated that there was discussion that took place with the ranking minority member and the Republican Whip before the vote took place. The concern that we have on this issue is the fact that we even moved ahead with consideration when there was protest raised by our leadership staff saying that we have a problem here, it needs to be addressed. I didn't even know that this was taking place until  we were well into debate on the attempt to override the President's veto. 
   So that is a concern we have raised. We acknowledge that mistakes are made. We know that happens. It has happened under both parties in the past. But to proceed when there has been concern raised by the minority staff is another matter.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. I am happy to continue engaging in a colloquy with the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Agriculture. 
   What I would say, Mr. Speaker, is that, again, we all acknowledge that mistakes are made. But this is a bill that has enjoyed bipartisan support. I am not going to give all my arguments. I have given them during debate on the bill. I voted against the bill, but I am not standing here trying to block it from becoming public law. We saw there were only 108 of us yesterday that voted to sustain the President's veto, so that much is there. 
   But the fact is that is not the bill that we voted on in this institution before, and with this concern that has come to the forefront, Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that since our Republican leadership staff indicated to members of the majority that we should not proceed until we resolve this matter, and as we discussed yesterday in our colloquy with the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, the notion of all of a sudden taking part of one bill, having it signed or vetoed, and that bill not all being included as one, it has created a tremendous confusion and a potential constitutional quagmire.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Reclaiming my time, I simply want to say that the concern that we have was the rush to proceed with that veto override vote last night, when in fact from what I infer from what the distinguished chairman has just said, Mr. Speaker, that obviously the bill should be together. We should in fact move ahead, for all intents and purposes, from scratch on this so that we can follow, as Mr. Hastings up in the Rules Committee last night explained when we talk to school groups, how a bill becomes the law. 
   This is not the way it is done. This is not the way it was envisaged by the Framers of our Constitution. And, as I said last night in the Rules Committee, we have Members looking at article I, section 7 of the U.S. Constitution, which does raise this. 
   All we are saying is we acknowledge mistakes were made. We don't believe there was any intent here, until we proceeded after, and, again this is a bipartisan bill, after there was concern raised from our minority leadership staff members. 
   So that is why I believe that the decision was an incorrect one. And the notion of our now including in this Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization bill in the rule to allow that bill to come up a provision that allows us to proceed with this kind of debate is just plain wrong. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.

   Mr. DREIER. Would the gentleman yield? 
   It has nothing to do with feelings being hurt on this issue. My feelings aren't hurt at all over this issue. My concern happens to be the U.S. Constitution. I know that raising the term ``the Constitution'' is something that my friend might not like. And I congratulate him on his work product on this bill through the process and all. I know he has worked very hard. My feelings aren't hurt. I am just saying that we believe that things need to be done correctly, under the Constitution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4156, ORDERLY AND RESPONSIBLE IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise to express my appreciation to my friend from Worcester for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I listened to my long-time Rules Committee colleague, the gentleman from Worcester, I am reminded of a great speech that was delivered last Friday. Last Friday, our very distinguished colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, JOE LIEBERMAN, in an address, said something that I think encapsulates exactly what we just heard from my very good friend. 
   Senator Lieberman, in speaking of the Democratic Party, and he is now an independent Democrat, sometimes I see him listed as a Democrat, I know he organizes with the Democrats, he is listed as an independent as well, he said, ``The Democrats are emotionally invested in a narrative of defeat.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I have got to say as I listened to the words of my colleague from Worcester, I can't help but think that Senator Lieberman was right on target when he used that language, ``emotionally invested in a narrative of defeat.'' I was so struck with that when I heard it that I committed it to memory, and I think, again, it really takes on exactly what we have just heard. 
   It comes as no surprise that I rise in very, very strong, vigorous opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation as well. We have had 40 votes on Iraq policy, and today's bill brings us to vote No. 41. Not one, Mr. Speaker, not one of the withdrawal bills went through the normal legislative process. Not one, not one of these 41 measures is the product of a committee markup. Not one got its own hearing. Not one has been brought up under an even slightly open process, allowing for amendment, and consequently not allowing for any kind of real debate. 
   Mr. Speaker, most telling of all, not one has been enacted into law. 
   Now, we all know that the Democrats control both the House and the Senate, and still they cannot produce a single legislative victory on Iraq. Not once, not twice, not 10 times. Forty times. Mr. Speaker, 40 times we have gone through the motions of their failed, bankrupt strategy. I can't recall a more naked display of demagoguery. 
   Now we come to vote No. 41. It has all the hallmarks of the Democratic majority's work: no deliberation, no gesture towards bipartisanship, and no hope of being enacted. 
   But there is something different about the vote this time, and that is context. We are considering this vote in a much different context than we have the 40 previous votes that we have addressed on this. In fact, our colleague in the Senate, JOHNNY ISAKSON, Senator Isakson, said this debate was understandable in May. He said in July, it was questionable. He said now it is absolutely ridiculous.  
   For many months, the situation in Iraq has been very bleak. While there were many promising signs of progress, the turnaround in al Anbar province most notably, the overall picture was one of great challenges and struggles. I have argued repeatedly that a precipitous withdrawal would only create more challenges, and, Mr. Speaker, I have highlighted the signs of progress amid the struggles all along. 
   But today, the tide is turning in Iraq. We are seeing far more than pockets of success, as my friend has said. We are seeing a dramatic shift in the landscape. It began in al Anbar, as I have said. The Sunni sheiks there turned on al Qaeda, joined with the largely Shiite Iraqi army and with coalition forces, and reclaimed the province. Ramadi, its capital, the city that we have all heard of described as the most dangerous city in the world just a year ago, hasn't had an attack in 3 months. The city and the province are rebuilding. They are constructing small business centers so that the entrepreneurial spirit of Iraqis can flourish once again. 
   A delegation, including the Anbar governor, the Ramadi mayor, several prominent religious leaders and Ahmed Abu Risha, the brother of Sheik Sattar Abu Risha, the father of the Sunni Awakening, was just here in Washington a couple of weeks ago. They came here, Mr. Speaker, to spend several days receiving training in institution building, good governance, transparency and the rule of law. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are Anbar's political, business and religious leaders, not coming here to seek security assistance, not seeking military assistance. They have achieved security in al Anbar. Now what they want, Mr. Speaker, is help from us in their quest to build a democracy. But, most important of all, they are serving as a model for the rest of Iraq. 
   Prior to their trip, they participated with Shiite leaders in a summit in Karbala. Sheiks from Karbala and Najaf, Iraq's two holiest cities for Shiite Muslims, reached out to their Sunni brothers in Anbar and asked for their help in combating al Qaeda. This comes at a time when Sunni and Shiite leaders in Baghdad are reaching out to each other to begin the process of reconciliation as well. 
   Baghdad's notorious Adhamiya neighborhood that we have heard so much about, formerly the site of some of Iraq's worst sectarian violence, is now a place where Sunni and Shiite sheiks are meeting regularly to discuss how to bring their people together, just the things that my friend from Worcester said are so imperative. They are taking place at this very moment. 
   Now, all of this has been possible, Mr. Speaker, because of the dramatic drop in violence brought about by General Petraeus' counterinsurgency strategy. This strategy, which included the surge, has resulted in months of plummeting IED attacks, plummeting American troop deaths, plummeting Iraqi civilian deaths, and plummeting sectarian attacks. 
   Many of my colleagues have pointed out that this has been the deadliest year for American troops yet in Iraq, and, Mr. Speaker, I will acknowledge that this has been the deadliest year for American troops in Iraq. And it is true over the past year we have tragically seen that great number. But that does not reflect what is happening now in this post-surge world.     
   The past few months have seen the most dramatic decline in the deaths of American troops because we have had a new strategy. Mr. Speaker, we have had a new strategy, and that strategy is working. And perhaps most important for all of us, that strategy has enabled our military commanders to begin a drawdown in U.S. troop levels. 
   Not because of artificial timetables. Not because of the micromanagement of Members of Congress from the comfort of our offices thousands of miles away from the front lines. But by empowering our commanders on the ground, they have created a stable security situation that is allowing for both the beginnings of Iraqi reconciliation and the safe withdrawal of our troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, the big question for today is this: Will the dramatic improvement in Iraq prove to be a true turning point or nothing more than a lull in the war? I don't know the answer to that. Neither outcome is a foregone conclusion. Whether it is a major turning point in the war or just a lull, no one knows for sure. What we do know now will profoundly affect the future of Iraq. Will we fund our troops and empower our commanders to continue to do what is best for our long-term interests? Or will we pull the rug out from under them now at the precise moment they have achieved what we have asked of them? 
   As one of my friends just said to me, it seems like our friends on the other side of the aisle want defeat before we can win. 
   For my colleagues who would resort to the latter option out of political expediency, Mr. Speaker, let me remind them of another war our men and women are fighting. Today our troops are also battling a very real enemy in Afghanistan. 
   We got a terrible reminder just a few days ago of the viciousness of that fight when six of our counterparts, members of the Afghan Parliament, were brutally targeted in the worst attack in Afghanistan's history, and I would like to express my appreciation for the bipartisan support that my colleague, DAVID PRICE, and I offered as leaders of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. 
   We have been working with those parliamentarians in Afghanistan, and we are hoping to work with those in Iraq as soon as possible. And we once again express our condolences to the people of Afghanistan who have suffered the single worst attack in their nation's history when a week ago yesterday six parliamentarians and 44 other people were brutally murdered. 
   Let me also remind my colleagues that this war that we are seeing in Afghanistan is not our first war in Afghanistan. Many of us were intricately involved in their war against the Soviets in the 1980s, many Members who are still here today. And what did we do after the Soviets were defeated? We withdraw and left the Afghans to fend for themselves. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot forget that democracy is hard work. For over a decade, unfortunately, in Afghanistan we indulged in the luxury of ignoring what was going on there. And then on a sunny Tuesday six Septembers ago, 3,000 Americans paid a horrible price for that mistake. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot refuse to learn from history or we are doomed to repeat it. Our support for our troops in Iraq has earned us a far more stable, secure situation. And yet what does the Democratic leadership propose to do? Their bill would reward our military commanders' success by cutting them off. 
   It would provide constitutional protections for terrorists, while leaving our veterans, including Iraq veterans, without funding. It would force the same disastrous, shortsighted withdrawal that led to the terrorist sanctuary in Afghanistan. It would do all of this at a time when we are achieving not just pockets of success in Iraq but broad-based improvements, and at a time when Republicans have been trying every possible means to get an appropriations bill for our veterans to the President, which he will certainly sign if we can ever get it to him. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic majority's priorities, foolhardy policies, and constitutional rights for terrorists have never been so out of whack. I suppose we can take comfort in the fact that this is all a meaningless charade that will never be enacted, because we all know this will never be enacted. But that is a hollow comfort when we consider our troops in harm's way and our veterans in need. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a very cruel comfort for the families of those who have made incredible sacrifices in this war. 
   I often think of my good friend, Ed Blecksmith, a former marine and the father of JP Blecksmith, also a marine, who died in November 2004 just 3 years ago in the very famous battle of Fallujah. I have talked about the Blecksmith family here on the House floor many, many times. I didn't know JP, but from everything that I have read, and I have a recent article that has just come out about him, he was a very talented young man with a very bright future. He had so many opportunities before him, and he chose to be a marine because he wanted to serve as his father had done. His family proudly, but soberly, supported him. As a  former marine, Ed Blecksmith knew in a very real way the cost of war. JP Blecksmith would not return to his family, having made the ultimate sacrifice. 
   And his father said something to me that I will never forget. He looked me in the eye and asked me to make sure that we complete his son's mission in Iraq. He has said to me on countless occasions, You must complete the mission or my son JP will have died in vain. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is deeply heartening to see the beginnings of victory. And no, I am not saying ``mission accomplished'' or anything like that because we know full well that we have difficult days ahead. But it is deeply heartening to see the beginnings of victory in Iraq, for JP's sake and for the sake of all who have paid a very dear price. 
   We have a profound responsibility to allow our commanders to continue on this path. 
   Mr. Speaker, after 41, 41 wasted efforts, I can only hope that the Democratic leadership will finally abandon empty demagoguery for substantive legislation, meaningful debate, and a quest at bipartisanship so we can work with the President to come to an agreement. Until that time, I urge my colleagues to reject this closed rule and the terribly wrongheaded policy that it seeks to shield.  
   The Fallen: 2nd Lieutenant JP Blecksmith, 24  
   On the night before 2nd Lieutenant JP Blecksmith shipped out to Iraq, after his family took him out for dinner in Newport Beach, California, his older brother, Alex, picked up a pair of clippers and shaved JP's head. When that was done and JP looked ready for combat, Alex gave his brother a hug. Then Alex climbed into JP's green Ford Expedition and drove it north, back to the family's house in San Marino, weeping part of the way. He had a feeling. So did his parents. A premonition. They didn't talk about it much, but two months later, in November 2004, when JP joined a wave of U.S. Marines roaring into the city of Fallujah as part of Operation Phantom Fury, the feeling intensified. 
   On the night of November 10, Blecksmith and his closest friend in Iraq, Lieutenant Sven Jensen, slept on a rooftop in Fallujah. It was, miraculously, a quiet night, and chilly. They got a decent night's sleep. They awoke just before sunrise and were amused to find a small pet bird with green wings and a yellow belly perched a couple of feet away from their faces. Jensen took a picture of the bird. There were other ones like it all over Iraq, because when U.S. troops were searching abandoned houses, they often found cages that had been left behind. The soldiers let the birds go free so they wouldn't starve to death. 
   Hours before, JP had sent a letter to his girlfriend, addressing it formally, as always, to ``Ms. Emily M. Tait.'' In it he wrote, ``By the time you receive this, you will know we have gone into the city. We've been preparing for it the last few days, and my guys are ready for the fight, and I'm ready to lead them. It'll be hectic, and there will be some things out of my control, but the promise of you waiting at home for me is inspiring and a relief.'' Now he was in the thick of it. Blecksmith and Jensen came down from the roof, ate their MREs for breakfast, and got their orders. Before the invasion the battalion commander, Colonel Patrick Malay, had given his men an analogy: `` `Imagine a dirty, filthy windowpane that has not been cleaned in hundreds of years,' '' he recalls saying. ``That's how we looked at the city of Fallujah. Our job was to scrub the heck out of that city, and then take a squeegee and wipe it off so that it was clean and pure.'' Most of Fallujah was empty, and anyone left in the city was presumed to be an insurgent. 
   Blecksmith and the other members of the India Company of the Third Battalion, Fifth Marines Regiment, moved south through the city, with their blood types scrawled in indelible marker on the sleeves of their uniforms. The streets smelled terrible--a stubborn aroma of rotting food and bodies. Late in the day on November 11, things started to go wrong. A marine in Blecksmith's platoon, Klayton South, was shot in the mouth by an insurgent when he kicked open the door of a house. Blood gushed from his mangled teeth and tongue. The medics cut into South's throat to give him an emergency tracheotomy. (He survived. He's since had more than 40 operations to repair the damage.) ``It shook the platoon up,'' Jensen says now, ``and JP was the most in-control person I saw. He had a sector to clear, so he rallied his guys and said, `Okay, we've got to continue clearing.' '' Blecksmith's and Jensen's platoons moved off in different directions, and the two friends shot each other a glance. ``I'll never forget looking at his eyes the last time I saw him,'' Jensen says. ``He turned and he gave me almost an apprehensive look, like, Oh, s-it, we've got some s-it going on. I wanted to say `Hey, I'll see you later.' But I didn't say anything to him.'' 
   Minutes later, Blecksmith led his platoon into a house and climbed a flight of stairs to the roof to survey the surrounding landscape. Shots came from a building across the street. Blecksmith stood up to direct the squads under his command, shouting at them to take aim at the enemy nest. He was tall, and was now visible above the protective wall. ``He was up front a lot, and he made a big target, and we'd talked to him about that,'' Colonel Malay says. ``He exposed himself consistently to enemy fire in the execution of his duties. He displayed a fearlessness to the point that we had to talk to him about the fact that nobody is bulletproof.'' 
   As Blecksmith stood on the roof, a sniper's 7.62-mm bullet found one of the places on his body where he was vulnerable. It was a spot on his left shoulder, less than an inch above the rim of his protective breastplate. The bullet sliced downward diagonally, coming to rest in his right hip, and along the way it tore through his heart. ``I'm hit,'' Blecksmith said. He fell. He raised his head for a moment, and that was it. A Navy medic got to Blecksmith immediately, but he was already dead, and his men carried his heavy body back down the stairs. He was 24. 
   That night in San Marino, Alex Blecksmith came home from work and noticed that the house was dark. He opened the front door and saw his mother, Pam, sitting at the kitchen table with a couple of marines in dress blues and white gloves, and he heard the phrase ``We regret to inform you .....'' 
   The funeral was so magnificent, so full of pageantry, that at times it was difficult for Alex to remember that the guy being buried was his brother. The Marines do it right when it comes to honoring the fallen. They do it so right that you can get swept up in the ceremony and feel as though you're watching a parade. The funeral took place at the Church of Our Saviour in San Gabriel--the church where the most celebrated of San Marino's favorite sons, General George S. Patton, had been baptized as a baby. As the flag-draped casket was carried out of the sanctuary and into the California sun, a long, silent line of almost 2,000 people followed. There were marines and midshipmen and local firefighters in uniform. There was a 21-gun salute. Four World War II fighter planes swooped toward the cemetery in the ``missing man'' formation--just as they passed over the funeral, the fourth plane symbolically split from the quartet and veered into the sky. A bagpiper played a Scottish dirge. One of JP's old friends would later observe that the day, in all of its glory and pomp, made him think of Princess Diana's wedding. 
   As public support for the war in Iraq wavers, it's easy to forget that people like JP Blecksmith even exist. The American military is so predominantly blue-collar that we tend to assume that the sons and daughters of the rich never voluntarily die in warfare anymore. Blecksmith was born in September 1980, just weeks before his state's own Ronald Reagan was elected president, and he spent most of his youth in the small Los Angeles County town of San Marino during what felt, for many of its wealthy and conservative inhabitants, like something of a ``Leave It to Beaver'' golden age. To look at a photograph of him, blue-eyed and suntanned and grinning, is to understand the enduring magnetism of the word ``California.'' He stood six foot three and weighed 225 pounds. His chest was a keg; his biceps were gourds. His biography reads as though it were scripted by a Hollywood publicist: legendary quarterback on the Flintridge Prep football team, track star, graduate of the United States Naval Academy. 
   His father, Ed Blecksmith, who is 64, runs an executive-recruiting firm in Los Angeles. He and Pam met in the early seventies, while both were working in the White House. Along a wall leading into their kitchen hang framed Christmas cards from Dick and Pat Nixon. ``Here's a kid,'' Ed says, ``who didn't need to do this.'' It's as though JP were transplanted into our world from the Eisenhower years. Somehow, in an ironic age of Jon Stewart and ``South Park,'' the guy grew up in a kind of pre-Summer of Love bubble in which young men of strength and valor still yearned to distinguish themselves on the battlefield. He was groomed, in a sense, for something that no longer exists, at least not for guys who grow up in the wealthiest zip codes in the country. He believed in ideals of duty and sacrifice that have become, for many men, anachronistic and even unfathomable. 
   ``I was in awe,'' says Peter Twist, Blecksmith's closest friend since preschool. Twist played wide receiver to Blecksmith's quarterback on the Flintridge Prep football team; a local newspaper called the duo ``Fire & Ice.'' Blecksmith was known for being fast, composed, smart, and unflappable, and his giant arms could propel the ball a good 80 yards down the field. If he had an athletic flaw, it was that he was aware of his own flawlessness. ``He had such personal confidence,'' says Tom Fry, a mentor to Blecksmith in high school and one of the assistant coaches on his team. ``He felt that if all the stars aligned, there was nothing he couldn't do--it was JP's world.'' When they graduated in 1999, Twist and a couple other teammates went off to the University of Arizona, where it's safe to say the prospect of partying was on their minds, while Blecksmith opted for the rigors and restrictions of Annapolis. ``I was stoked for the man'' says Twist, 26, who lives in Newport Beach and works in the mortgage business. ``Most of us are still trying to figure it out, but JP always had a goal.''  
   November 11, the date on which JP Blecksmith died, was noteworthy for other reasons. It's Twist's birthday. It also happens to be the birthday of General Patton, who grew up in San Marino and holds a prominent place in the town's history. This coincidence has only bolstered the mythology of JP Blecksmith--a feeling that it was his destiny to die in combat. The Blecksmiths have a statue of Patton on a shelf in their home, and it becomes clear in conversation that Ed, a decorated Vietnam veteran himself, sees a kind of mystical link between the fate of his son and the military, triumphs of the legendary general (who was a passionate believer, it just so happens, in reincarnation). 
   Indeed, JP Blecksmith fit the ``hero'' mold in such classic, square jawed American style that a kind of cult of JP has begun to develop in San Marino. They give out awards in his name at the local schools. On the Fourth of July, San Marino hosts a JP Blecksmith 5K run. A Marine Corps training center in Pasadena has been christened Blecksmith Hall. On a hot Sunday morning this past August, Alex parked his brother's Expedition in the cemetery and walked across the grass to the pale granite stone that says JAMES PATRICK BLECKSMITH. An elderly man wandered over to the headstone, hand in hand with a grade-school kid who had a blond Mohawk, and told Alex, ``I never met JP, but I go by here and show my grandson his grave''

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I will say to my colleagues that it's very interesting to listen to this debate, because as we've proceeded, I have yet to hear the word ``victory'' come from the other side of the aisle at all. I have yet to hear anyone interested in trying to build a democracy. 
   Now, we saw three elections take place in Iraq, as we all know, with a 70 percent voter turnout. 
   We know that there are problems there. My friend from Worcester correctly said that we have problems with corruption in government in Iraq. We've had corruption problems in this country as well. But the fact of the matter is we have seen dramatic improvement. There is no doubt about the fact that we've seen improvement. 
   And I've got to say, Mr. Speaker, that we continue to hear this term ``redeployment.'' That means one thing. It doesn't mean victory. It doesn't mean build a democracy. It means withdraw and lose. And I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, we are determined to ensure that that doesn't happen. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds, and I do so to say I still have yet to hear the term ``victory'' come from the other side of the aisle. I still have yet to hear anyone talk about the notion of building a democracy in Iraq so that self-determination and the rule of law and the building of democratic institutions can, in fact, have a chance to succeed. And there is no recognition of the fact that we have seen a tremendous number of reduction in IED attacks, and the number of overall attacks has dropped dramatically.

   I'm very sorry that my friend wouldn't yield so that we could engage in debate. And I will say, victory means ensuring that our children don't face the threat of another terrorist attack like what we saw on September 11. We know that Iraq is the central point for al Qaeda, and I am absolutely determined to ensure that we achieve victory. 
   There have been tremendous achievements when it comes to democracy building. We can't ignore that. But we want to bring our troops home as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Let me just first say this has been an interesting debate and I do think that victory, a dramatic reduction in the number of attacks, the fact that reconciliation is, in fact, taking place in Baghdad is something that cannot be ignored. 
   Mr. Speaker, earlier today, before the House voted for the 12th time to allow the House to go to conference with the Senate on the Veterans Affairs funding bill, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart) and I had a brief colloquy after which a Member on the other side of the aisle claimed that we had misrepresented the facts about this Congress's track record on getting the Veterans Affairs appropriations measure signed into law. 
   Well, I take this as akin to being accused of lying. Here is what we said, and, Mr. Speaker, I will say it again: The House passed the Veterans and Military Construction funding bill on June 15, 2007, by a vote of 409-2, with the Senate following suit and naming conferees on September 6. Unfortunately, the majority leadership of the House has refused to move the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations act to conference and has refused to name conferees. 
   So whether the majority likes it or not, that is a fact. Now, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards) and the gentleman from New York said that we were misrepresenting the facts. How is this so? For 68 days, Mr. Speaker, the message from the Senate requesting a conference has languished at the Speaker's desk without action. How is this fact disputable? Just look at the  calendar and count the days between September 7 and today, and you'll come up with 68. Every day the Democrats choose not to act to move this bill forward, our Nation's veterans lose $18.5 million. 
   Those are the facts surrounding this bill in this Congress. The gentleman from Texas went on earlier to malign Republicans for what we did or didn't do concerning veterans funding over the last 12 years, which begs the question, what does the last 12 years have to do with this year? Are Democrats trying to use past Congresses' shortcomings as excuses for their own failed policy? Otherwise, how is this even relevant? 
   I am sure that the gentleman from Worcester would stand up and attempt to deflect this plea by criticizing Republicans, just as his colleagues before him, and touting the increases in funding for our veterans provided by this Congress which all but two Members of this body voted for. The sad fact is that this Congress hasn't provided the funding that the gentleman has espoused. Why is that? That's because not one dime will flow from the Treasury to the Department of Veterans Affairs until the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill is signed into law, and in order to do so, this House has to go to conference with the Senate and send a bill down to the President to sign. So let's finally get that process started. 
   Mr. Speaker, anyone who is concerned about funding for our veterans must join us in voting against the previous question so that I can amend the rule and we can go to conference with the Senate on this much-needed and far-delayed funding measure. 
   I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material appear in the Congressional Record just prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this conference report, and I want to join in commending first the managers on both sides of the aisle, our friends from Florida, Ms. Castor and Mr. Diaz-Balart, and of course Mr. Miller, Mr. McKeon, and Mr. Castle, and all those who have been involved. 
   The Head Start program is a very important program. It has proved to be successful. And I'm pleased that we have a measure that is going to, I believe, become law and ensure that we are able, as we look towards preparing children for that very critical K-12 education, which we all know is facing very serious challenges, the Head Start program can help as they launch into that challenge. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to take my time, and Mr. Diaz-Balart and I were just talking about an op-ed piece that was written by the former staff director of the Committee on Rules, Don Wolfensberger, and it got a response in today's Roll Call that I think is a very important one. And I think that, in light of the fact that we're debating rules here, this is a debate on the rule, and we've seen some real challenges when it has come to ensuring that the American people have their right to be heard here on the House floor. I think that I will share an article. And at this time, I would like to insert this article into the Record, Mr. Wolfensberger's op-ed piece.  
   Minority's Motion To Recommit Should Not Be Curtailed  
   It is the height of political arrogance for the majority party in the House of Representatives to dictate which minority party motions are legitimate and which are not. Yet that is exactly what the Democratic leadership is threatening through possible House rules changes governing the motion to recommit. 
   The motion to recommit a bill to committee with instructions to amend it was originally used primarily as a majority party device to make last-minute, minor corrections before final passage. All that changed in 1909 when Speaker Joe Cannon (R-Ill.) temporarily headed off a bipartisan effort to amend House rules and remove him as chairman and a member of the Rules Committee. Cannon recognized conservative Democratic Rep. John Fitzgerald (N.Y.) to offer a substitute amendment that, among other things, guaranteed the minority a final opportunity to get a vote on its position using the motion to recommit with instructions. (Cannon would still be booted from Rules in a bipartisan revolt the following year.) 
   The minority's right was slowly chipped away when Democrats last ran the House. Beginning in the early 1980s, Democratic Speakers and their Rules Committee majority minions used an obscure 1934 precedent to justify not only limiting the contents of the minority's instructions but also eventually denying them the right to offer any instructions. Republicans fiercely fought these limits at every turn and vowed that if they came to power the minority's right to offer its alternative in a motion to recommit with instructions would be fully restored. They fulfilled that promise upon taking control of the House in January 1995, and the Democratic minority enjoyed the right unimpeded over the 12 years of Republican control. 
   Nothing in the guaranteed right limits the minority to a motion that immediately adopts an amendment--the ``forthwith'' motion. The minority also may move to send a bill physically back to committee with instructions to hold more hearings, conduct a study or make specified changes in the legislation. This latter device, to recommit with instructions to report back an amendment ``promptly'' (instead of ``forthwith'') has been unnerving Democratic leaders every time Republicans have used it to raise politically sensitive issues. In two instances the majority withdrew bills from the floor rather than risk having them sent back to committee.  
   The most recent example was the leadership's decision to pull the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendments in the face of a likely GOP motion to recommit with instructions to ``promptly'' report back an amendment to exempt from FISA court coverage any surveillance of al-Qaida or other terrorist groups. 
   Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (Md.) argues that such motions are offered simply for ``political purposes'' rather than for the ``substantive purposes'' of ``trying to change policy.'' At the same time he concedes that Democrats used such tactics when they were in the minority. The only apparent difference is that Republicans have had a higher success rate with their recommit motions (though the only ones to succeed so far have been ``forthwith'' motions). 
   The majority is attempting to impose its notion that the only ``legitimate'' role of the minority party is to offer substantive policy alternatives in their recommit motions for instant incorporation in a bill. One way Democrats might try to enforce this concept is to only allow the minority to offer ``forthwith'' motions to recommit so that legislation can move immediately to final passage after the motion is voted. This ``amend it now or forever hold your peace'' approach overlooks one important role of an opposition party, and that is to oppose. 
   Opposing legislation does not carry with it the obligation to offer responsible policy alternatives that conform to the majority's timetable for passing a bill (especially when the minority is being blocked from offering any amendments on a record-breaking 35 percent of major bills). Opposition may include not only trying to defeat a bill, but also to slow it down, including sending it back to a committee for more work. 
   Yes, a straight motion to recommit without instructions would accomplish this same purpose. But who is to say that the minority should not be able to score its own political points by sending a bill back to committee with a message attached? After all, the majority routinely gets plenty of PR mileage out of reporting and passing bills on its political agenda. To assert that the minority is playing politics with its motions to recommit while the majority is somehow above such things in advancing its bills is laughable. 
   The difference, the majority would have us believe, is that it is achieving a serious public policy purpose for the betterment of humankind while the minority is merely engaging in ``cheap shot'' political tricks with no redeeming social value. That may be true at times, but the minority should be allowed to stand or fall on public and media perceptions of its actions--whether they be seen as foolish or heroic. The majority also will stand or fall on public perceptions of the quality of its legislative enactments and may well look just as foolish if well-intentioned bills produce bad results. 
   At a time when Congressional Democrats are under heavy fire and record low public approval ratings for a lackluster performance (including their inability to put even one of the 12 regular appropriations bills on the president's desk over a month after the start of the fiscal year), they would do well to spend more time honing their governance skills and less trying to control minority party behavior.   
   This paper, Roll Call, which we all get around here on the Hill, has been very critical of whichever party has been in control. I will say that when we were in the majority, this paper was often very critical of us. And today they have an editorial. Again, this is not Republicans speaking. It's not Republicans whining. It's not Republicans claiming that their rights are being trampled on. This is from the editorial page of today's Roll Call, and the editorial is entitled as follows, Madam Speaker, it's entitled ``Let 'Em Move.'' 
   ``Embarrassed though House Democratic leaders may be by Republican  success in proposing, and, often, passing politically loaded motions to recommit, it would be an outrage for the majority to limit the minority's right to do so. 
   ``Despite promises to manage the House on a more open basis than Republicans did during their 12-year rule, Democrats have been every bit as authoritarian, prohibiting any floor amendments, for instance, at more than double the rate of the previous Congress.'' I'm going to repeat that, Madam Speaker, ``more than double the rate of the previous Congress,'' the number of closed rules that they've had. ``Motions to recommit legislation to committees with instructions on how to alter it are often the only opportunity the minority has to affect the legislative process. 
   ``When they actually win a majority on the House floor, because a number of Democrats vote with Republicans, they constitute a huge embarrassment to Democratic leaders. This has happened 21 times this year, versus practically never during Republican rule, and each time Republicans have crowed that Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and her team `have lost control of the floor.' '' And let me remind you, Madam Speaker, I am simply reading from the editorial page of today's Roll Call. 
   They go on to say, ``Democratic leaders routinely fume at the practice, as when House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer accused the GOP of using the motion `for political purposes, not substantive purposes ..... not to change policy, but to try to construct difficult political votes for Members,' meaning potentially vulnerable Democrats.     
   ``As Roll Call reported last month, Democrats are searching for ways to change House rules to limit the minority's right to propose motions to recommit. They have done so before, so far without success--once, because Republicans halted proceedings on the House floor to protest the attempt. We suggest that Democrats just drop the idea and learn to live with the GOP motions as a legitimate part of legislative work in a democracy. 
   ``It's certainly true that many of the Republican motions have been politically designed, especially repeated motions to deny government benefits to illegal immigrants. Any Democrat who cast a vote against the measure, even if government aid was already barred by law, might well fear that it would be used by a potential opponent in a political commercial. 
   ``At the same time, many of the GOP motions have been substantive and have gained majority support because they contained popular ideas or posed politically difficult choices.'' Roll Call goes on to write, ``Examples include a ban on Federal funding to colleges that prohibit military recruiting on campus and an increase in funding for missile defense.'' 
   Madam Speaker, this Roll Call editorial reads, ``On two occasions, GOP motions were so threatening to the Democrats' purposes that they actually pulled legislation on terrorist wiretapping and voting rights for the District of Columbia. 
   ``Rather than limit one of the minority's few rights to affect legislation, we suggest that Democrats expand those rights by allowing Republicans to offer amendments on the floor. Would some of them be `purely political'? Of course. But more open and democratic debate also might produce better policy and reduce partisan rancor.'' 
   Now, again, Madam Speaker, those are not my words. Those are the words of the editorial board of the Roll Call as printed in today's paper. I want to say again, this paper was often critical of us when we were in the majority, and they have now, I believe, been right on target in pointing to the fact that the notion of trying to deny the American people their opportunity to be heard through this motion to recommit would be a horrible thing. I believe the Democratic majority, Madam Speaker, should, in fact, follow this encouragement from Roll Call and allow more amendments to be made in order. 
   I also want to say that I will join with my friend when he seeks to defeat the previous question on this rule so for the 11th time, we will be seeking to bring assistance to our veterans to the floor. This is Veterans Week. We marked Veterans Day Monday. I will say that it is absolutely imperative that any Member of the House who wants to ensure that we have the resources necessary for our veterans should vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we can, in fact, get that assistance that they so desperately need.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   I would just like to ask him to clarify one more time before we vote on this issue, I think this is going to be the 11th time we have had an opportunity to vote on this. 
   I have just been reminded by our crack Rules Committee staff that this is, in fact, the 12th time that this House has had the opportunity to vote on this issue. I guess the second or third time in Veterans Week. We have just marked the date on which we honor our Nation's veterans, and this House has repeatedly, repeatedly denied us the opportunity to move ahead and get the very much-needed assistance to our Nation's veterans. I think that this vote is going to be critically important in our quest to move that effort forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, we have spent a great deal of time this afternoon focusing on the fact that we have the first female Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in our Nation's history. And I think it is also very important for us to note today that we have the first female Chair of the House Rules Committee in my good friend, Ms. Slaughter, and I would like everyone to join in extending congratulations to Ms. Slaughter. 
   Now, let me say, Mr. Speaker, that I look forward to working in a bipartisan way in the spirit that was outlined by Speaker Pelosi, and I, of course, will treat the new Chair of the Rules Committee with the dignity that she deserves. 
   I will say, Mr. Speaker, that I do rise with mixed emotions today. I was very proud to join with you as we came down the center aisle escorting the new Speaker of the House, my fellow Californian. And I am very pleased that we have the first woman, the first Californian, and the first Italian American as Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
   I have mixed emotions because, while I am very, very proud of Speaker Pelosi, and the new Rules Chair, Ms. Slaughter, and others who are assuming leadership positions, I also am very disappointed. 
   I am disappointed as I look at this package that we are about to consider, because I do join with you, Mr. Speaker pro tempore, the distinguished majority leader, and Speaker Pelosi, as we have discussed privately and publicly, in our quest, and I think Speaker Pelosi put it extraordinarily well, focusing on the priorities that we have. We are, first and foremost, Americans. We are here to do the people's business and they sent a very strong message last November, and I believe we have an opportunity to do just that. 
   I will say that I remember very well the opening days of the 104th Congress, 12 years ago. I remember the very heady feeling that came from knowing that, for the first time, at that juncture, in almost half a century, we Republicans were in the majority of the House of Representatives, and we were going to do all that we had promised the American people. 
   We were that optimistic, quite frankly, because we didn't know any better. None of us had ever served in the majority and we were blissfully unaware of the pressures and problems associated with trying to govern this institution. 
   During the 109th Congress, the Democratic Caucus, many of whom actually served in the majority before 1995, made a lot of promises about how they would run this place if they ever achieved the majority again. Of course, they, unlike Republicans in 1994, had the experience of having run this place, having served in the majority. And I have a great deal of admiration for my colleagues, because they know exactly what they are facing. Knowing that, knowing exactly what they would face in the majority, they made a commitment to minority rights, should they regain the majority. 
   And that, Mr. Speaker, is why I said I am disappointed. The resolutions before us bear very little resemblance to the rhetoric on this floor and on the campaign trail. The much ballyhooed commitment to minority rights is virtually nonexistent in the measures before us today. They undermine minority rights that were constantly guaranteed when we were in the majority. The rights of the minority are undermined. Their promises are for a delivery date at some later point, if we agree to be cooperative, according to one Member on the other side of the aisle. And we have, as an IOU now, a wink and a nod and a gentle ``trust us.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, trust is something that is in short supply in this House, and the actions of the incoming majority are, based on the package that has been brought before us early last evening, certainly less than 24 hours before we are considering it here on the House floor, are not doing a lot to bolster our reserves when it comes to the issue of trust. Despite an oft repeated commitment to provide Members with, as I said, at least 24 hours to review legislation before voting on the floor, we received this package at 6:15 last night, 6:15 only after that package was delivered to our friends up in the press gallery. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, despite Speaker Pelosi's principle that we need to return to regular order for legislation, including a full committee process of hearings and markups and, I quote Ms. Pelosi here when she said we need an ``open, full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.'' 
   Now, we, in spite of that great directive that came forward, we have a rules package that actually self-executes closed rules for bills that haven't even been introduced, and won't even be going through the committee process. The section of the package that includes those closed rules is debatable for just 10 minutes. This is the polar opposite, the polar opposite of how the Republicans opened the 104th Congress, when our priorities were considered in regular order and under an open amendment process. 
   Mr. Speaker, also providing a stark contrast is the fact that we put in place, from day one, a guaranteed bite at the apple for the minority in the form of a motion to recommit. We felt so strongly about the fact that when we were in the minority we were denied that chance. So that is why at the beginning of the 104th Congress we put into place that guarantee for the minority. 
   But I must remind my Democratic colleagues on the Rules Committee that, time and time again, they have made clear their view that the motion to recommit is an insufficient opportunity to articulate their alternative. That argument was propounded constantly as we were dealing with public policy questions. So you can imagine how surprised I was when the Speaker recently replied to a reporter's question about Republican alternatives to  the Democratic priorities by saying, ``They'll have a motion to recommit.'' 
   Even worse than five closed rules, Mr. Speaker, is the rollback of one of the most essential elements of transparency that Republicans put into place back at the beginning of the 104th Congress; that is, the right to know how a member of a committee votes on legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, this rules package exempts the Committee on Rules from the requirement to publish the votes of its members on its committee reports, something required of every other committee except the Ethics Committee. 
   Now, in my 12 years as a member of the Rules Committee majority, we took more than 1,300 votes in committee, every single one of which was accurately reported in the committee's report. 
   Mr. Speaker, at best, this is a solution in search of a problem. At worst, it is an attempt to shield the Rules Committee from the public scrutiny of its actions. 
   We were told by the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee that ethics reform and rules reform were not just election year issues for Democrats. Now, Mr. Speaker, sadly, this document says something quite different than that. Promises were made, and they are not being kept. That is the thing that I find to be most troubling. We intend to explain the many inconsistencies for the record and as the debate moves forward. 
   At the same time, Mr. Speaker, we want to work with our democratic colleagues. Even with this treatment of minority rights, we stand here determined to work in a bipartisan way to confront the challenges that we all know face this country. Unfortunately, this rules package shuts us out from the start. It is my hope that the promises made will, indeed, be kept. But, Mr. Speaker, this package does not inspire a great deal of hope in that they in any way will. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, I rise with a great deal of disappointment and a great deal of concern about the first actions that we are taking here. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that I reserve the balance of my time.

   I will tell you this: I am prepared at this moment to take my three Republican colleagues and go right upstairs to the Rules Committee and go to work at this moment so that we don't have closed rules in the opening day rules package for consideration of measures that have not gone through the committee process and have not had any opportunity to even have our amendments denied in the Rules Committee.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I am actually very enthused and excited about the great new opportunity that lies ahead for every single one of us. We have heard speeches today from our distinguished Republican leader, and we are all very proud that my fellow Californian has become the first woman to preside over the greatest deliberative body known to man. And, as I said earlier, I am particularly proud of the fact that I am being succeeded by the distinguished chairwoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), as the first woman to chair the Rules Committee.     
   I am enthused about the challenges that lie ahead, and I am very encouraged by the words that we heard from our new Speaker about the need for civility, about the need for us to make sure that we recognize that we are first and foremost Americans, and that the message from last November's election was a very clear one. It was a message that we should come together, work together, Democrats and Republicans alike, to solve the challenges that we face so that we can in fact do the people's business. 
   We are very proud of the accomplishments that we have had over the past 12 years, and I believe we can work with the new majority to build on those successes, the successes of ensuring that we have an economy that is second to none, an unemployment rate that is at near-record lows at 4.5 percent, strong domestic product growth, more Americans working than ever before in our Nation's history, more Americans owning their own homes, and more minority Americans owning their own homes. 
   I also am particularly proud of the fact that working together, Madam Speaker, we have been able to ensure that since that tragic day of September 11, 2001, we have not faced another attack on our soil. 
   The fact that we have not faced another attack is not an accident. It is because of good public policy and the leadership that we have had. Now we do have a change in leadership here in this institution, and there have been a wide range of promises that were made by Members who formerly served in the majority and now are coming back to majority status. As members of the minority, they talked about the need for enhanced minority rights. And I believe many of those things are very, very important. I believed them before, and I believe them now. 
   One of the things that I think is very important is for us to have an opportunity for consideration of measures here on the House floor that allow for a greater opportunity for Member participation. The thing that troubles me most is if we don't defeat this previous question and then defeat this rule that allows us to move forward, we will be proceeding with a package that will bring forward five closed rules, preventing the Rules Committee from having an opportunity to in any way consider the chance to bring forward amendments. 
   Never before, never before in our Nation's history have we seen an opening day Rules Committee that would allow for the consideration of five closed rules in the opening-day package. And one of the things, of course, that was discussed widely by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle which we have strongly supported is the notion of transparency, accountability, and disclosure. 
   One of the most troubling aspects of this measure is that we would move to prevent the RECORD from showing the votes that are cast in the Rules Committee. 
   We were very proud that we eliminated proxy voting when we came to majority status. Why? Because we wanted Members to show up to work, and we wanted the American people to see their work product. 
   Well, unfortunately, the American people understand what it means to show up to work. They understand what it means for greater disclosure and accountability and transparency. We heard the opening remarks during this rule debate on letting the sunshine in. The sun is shining outside today, and it is going to shine in. Under this provision, we see a prevention for the opportunity for the sun to shine in the Rules Committee, and I find it very troubling. 
   Madam Speaker, I will be asking Members to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can amend this rule to make in order to consider the Speaker's minority bill of rights as was outlined on May 25, 2006, in her document ``New House Principles: A Congress For All Americans.'' We need to give the new majority an opportunity to live up to those commitments that were made. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment and extraneous materials in the RECORD immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to begin by extending my compliments to my very good friend from Maryland, the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Hoyer. In fact, Mr. Hoyer just quoted John F. Kennedy and I believe that he was right on target in focusing on that brilliant quote of President Kennedy's where he said that we should not seek the Republican answer, we should not seek the Democratic answer, we should seek the right answer. I was struck with that, Mr. Speaker, and I believe that we should join in strong support of this resolution, of support of this title; and I am going to urge my colleagues to join in voting in support of this title which uses the rules base of the 109th Congress as the basis for which these proposed changes are being offered. 
   But I think it is very important for us to note that if we are going to, in fact, seek the right answer as opposed to the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, we need to do that by vigorously pursuing the deliberative process about which we all speak. And I know that during the past several years, my very distinguished colleagues on the other side of the aisle raised concerns about a lack of deliberation that existed in this House and the fact that more amendments could have been made in order. I will acknowledge that we could have made more amendments in order. That was clearly an option there. But as my friend, having served in the majority, knows very well, there are challenges that need to be addressed when you are in the majority, challenges of managing this institution. I see him sitting there very comfortably and I am glad that he is comfortable at this point, but I know full well that he, Mr. Speaker, is going to face many management challenges in the days and weeks and months ahead. 
   But during the past couple of years, what we have heard is a commitment to minority rights made by those who were formerly in the majority, who were in the minority at that time and are now back in the majority. And so I would argue that the words of President Kennedy can best be implemented if we in fact do increase the level of deliberation, and that is why as we look at the proposed changes that we are going to be considering, I have to say that when it comes to the actual management, I am concerned. I am concerned about the prospect of, for the first time in the history of this institution, taking prospectively five closed rules and placing that in the opening-day rules package. 
   Similarly, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about the prospect of taking this issue of transparency, accountability, and disclosure about which we on both sides of the aisle regularly talk because we are here to represent all of the American people, the notion of now saying again for the first time in the history of this great institution that we are going to create an opportunity whereby we will not have accountability and transparency in our very important deliberations that will take place in the Rules Committee. 
   And so again I would say in response to the brilliant words of President John F. Kennedy, as outlined by our distinguished majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, that we do seek the right answer; and I believe that the best way to seek the right answer is through enhanced deliberation, and we have a chance to do that. 
   Now, I will when it comes to this vote urge my colleagues to vote in favor of title I. Title I, as you know, Mr. Speaker, simply provides a chance to use the opening rules package of the 109th Congress, and I think that that is a correct thing for us to do; and I hope the Democrats and Republicans alike, and the majority leader has just called for support of title I and I will urge the colleagues on our side of the aisle to join so that again we will be coming together and I think having the right answer on that. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

In fact, if the gentleman was here when I had an exchange with the distinguished new Chair of the Rules Committee when she tried to argue that we somehow were debating the rules for the 109th Congress, the Chair confirmed the fact that we are in fact considering in toto the package for the 110th Congress using as base text the 109th. 
   What I have here and if I am able to gain unanimous consent for this, Mr. Speaker, to include in the RECORD, is the draft which uses the 109th base text and has the proposed changes, the different titles for the proposed changes for the rules of the 110th Congress. 
   I would ask unanimous consent to include this draft with the date and the time on it showing that it did not fall within the 24-hour notification period of time that my friends have consistently insisted on.

Yes, I was proud to have crafted those, working with my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and we passed those at the beginning of the Congress and we are going to have a chance in just a few minutes to vote on those again. 
   The point is, it is not the rules of the 109th Congress that we didn't have a draft of. We did not have a draft until January 3 at 5:45 p.m., which clearly did not comply with that 24-hour requirement that has been put forward. And that is the only point that I am trying to make.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that we can, in fact, join in a bipartisan way in supporting implementation of title I of this provision. And I believe that it is great that my friend from Florida (Mr. Hastings) began heaping praise on the many accomplishments of the 104th Congress when we implemented things like an end to proxy voting, term limits on committee chairmen, and the other items which we have which go on and on and on, increased transparency and accountability and disclosure. 
   I will say that, as I have said, I am very, very troubled and saddened by the inconsistency when it comes to the issue of transparency and disclosure in light of the discussion that Mr. Hastings of Pasco, Washington and I have had about closing down transparency in the Rules Committee now. 
   My friend from Florida mentioned the fact that I may be the champion of closed rules. I will admit that as chairman of the Rules Committee, I did bring more than a few closed rules here, primarily on bills that related to tax issues, which was done under the Democratic majorities of the past and I suspect will be done in the future as well. But I will say this: Never before, never before have I, as chairman of the Rules Committee, prevented the Rules Committee from having an opportunity to deliberate and including in an opening day rules package five closed rules. I am concerned as we move forward with that. We will have that debate later on. But I look forward to urging my colleagues to join in support of title I.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this package. Once again, I think we will have an opportunity for bipartisanship. The issue of ethics and lobbying reform is something that we believe is very, very important. As I sit here today, I am reminded of the fact that 1 year ago this month, Speaker HASTERT and I stood right upstairs in the press gallery and unveiled a package for lobbying and ethics reform, which was maligned by many of our colleagues, unfortunately. 
   But I will say that I am very pleased with the fact that we were ultimately able to pass out of the House our measure, which did a number of things that I am happy to see are incorporated in this provision that is coming forward from the new majority. 
   The thing that troubles me most, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that this was done in a unilateral way. We are all very proud of the fact that we have a working, strong, vibrant bipartisan Ethics Committee. It would have been great if we could have had the Ethics Committee come forward with these recommendations. 
   There has been no consultation whatsoever between the majority and the minority, although I will say, again, I congratulate those Members of the new majority for including, including many of the items that were either incorporated in H.R. 4975, which was our lobbying and disclosure act that we passed out of the House last year, and some of the provisions that Speaker HASTERT and I outlined a year ago this month: free clearance of travel, a ban on travel and an end to gifts. An end to the K Street Project. These are all very important reforms that I do think are essential. 
   I will say this, Mr. Speaker, as I listen to my very good friend from Massachusetts, and I congratulate him on his new position in the majority on the Rules Committee, what happens between today and March 1 of this year? Well, let us see, we have the month of January and the month of February, and, guess what, under this package, the status quo in the 110th Congress, under the Democratic majority, remains in place without any kind of reform or change. 
   So I have got to ask rhetorically, anyone who wants to answer as to why we are waiting until March 1 before we see any kind of implementation here. They want to see guidelines put forward, maybe by the Ethics Committee. If that is what they would like to do, why don't we impose an immediate ban until they come up with recommended guidelines? 
   So I will say that as I listen to these proposals, they are interesting, I am very pleased that they have incorporated them. I don't believe they go far enough. In a few minutes, my colleagues, Mr. Kirk and Mr. Shadegg, will be talking about concern on the pension issue, which unfortunately has been left out of this, but I do believe that by and large this is a measure that is going to be worthy of bipartisan support, and I am going to urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me, again, say that we look forward to supporting this package, much of which, the items that the gentlewoman just outlined, were included in H.R. 4975, which passed this House last May with strong bipartisan support. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield 2 minutes to my very good friend from Highland Park, Illinois (Mr. Kirk).

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me just, before yielding to the gentleman from Marietta, say very quickly again, the legislation that passed the House, H.R. 4975, specifically banned the K Street Project. Look at the language. It is virtually identical. We focused on the issue of lobbyist travel and gifts. And I believe that we can come together in a bipartisan way. We want to work in a civil tone, as was outlined by Speaker Pelosi today. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that I am happy to yield 3 minutes to my very good friend, former member of the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Marietta, Dr. Gingrey.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to congratulate the gentleman from New Hampshire. We welcome him here. Unfortunately, this package doesn't start today and start now. It starts March 1 of 2007, 2 months from now. 
   I also want to say to my very good friend from Massachusetts once again that if you look at the package that we passed in May of last year, it is a package that enjoyed bipartisan support. It is one of which we are very proud. And I believe that if you look at the fact that we did go beyond preventing registered lobbyists from coming onto the House floor and the gym, we are doing many of those same things here. It has been done before. 
   And that is why we are proud to be here in support of this effort, which, again, some of us believe does not go far enough and there are some problems with it, but we do believe it is a positive step. Why? Because it is a reaffirmation of what Speaker Hastert led us to last year. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to yield 4 minutes to my good friend from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg).

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to say that I do congratulate my colleagues. I want to begin by saying as a Californian that I am very proud of the fact that California has provided the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives. Similarly, I have congratulated our colleague, Ms. Slaughter, who will be the first woman to chair the Rules Committee in our Nation's history. 
   This has been a historic day and I believe a very exciting day for us. I am pleased that we have been able to do a number of things already in a bipartisan way, and I think this issue of ethics and lobbying reform, building on the reforms that we passed in the 109th Congress, utilizing those very positive provisions, is exactly what we are about to vote on here in just a few minutes; and I think that it is a time when we can be civil. 
   And I will say to all of my friends on both sides of the aisle, the American people want us to deal with these problems, and I will reaffirm my commitment to my colleagues on the Rules Committee that I will continue to strive to comport myself in the most dignified way possible in dealing with my colleagues, and I urge support of this very important measure. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York, the distinguished Chair on the Committee of Rules for yielding me the time, and I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in the strongest possible opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation. I could start this debate by quoting my Democratic colleagues on the Rules Committee when they decried Republican tactics over the last few years, how they railed against closed rules and chided me personally. I am a big guy, I can handle it. But they attacked me personally constantly for denying amendments that were offered by both Democrats and Republicans. I could quote every instance that they promised to do better, to have the most open and fair Congress in the history of this country, and to not have late-night meetings. But today, Mr. Speaker, I am not going to do that. I am going to recognize that that would simply distract from this very, very important issue. Instead, I  am going to simply provide the House, Mr. Speaker, and you witnessed much of this last night, with a factual account of what took place in the wee hours of this morning. 
   Shortly before 1 a.m., the Rules Committee on party-line votes reported out two self-executing closed rules, and denied the consideration of some 70 amendments submitted to the Rules Committee from both Republicans and Democrats as well. That is what happened. There is no denying it. You, Mr. Speaker, witnessed it yourself when you were upstairs in the Rules Committee. 
   So regardless of the process, this supplemental appropriations bill is a constitutionally dubious attempt at micromanaging the Iraq war into what I believe would be inevitable defeat if it succeeds. It enjoys such limited support on the other side of the aisle that it had to be ladened with unrelated pork in order to win enough votes to have any hope of passing. It is a cynical ploy that will leave dire consequences for the region, and for our own security, in its wake. 
   The Constitution lays out a very clear system of checks and balances derived from the ideas of the Framers of our Constitution. By giving the three branches of government distinct roles, we guard ourselves against tyranny; we guard ourselves as individuals against tyranny in each branch. 
   The President cannot wage war without authorization or funding from Congress. But if authorization and funding are granted, the President serves as the Commander in Chief with the authority to execute the war. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill ignores the intentions of those Framers, and it attempts to turn the Constitution on its head. James Madison, Father of the Constitution, the author of the Constitution in Federalist No. 51, wrote, and I quote, ``In framing a government that is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control the governed, and in the next place oblige it to control itself.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, Madison recognized the inherent challenges in designing a government that is both effective and limited. He knew that, without checks and balances, tyranny would, in fact, ensue. 
   This bill attempts to diminish these checks and balances. It tries to turn Congress into a collection of 535 Commanders in Chief. This legislation of micromanagement is based on a disastrous strategy. Its authors fund the war, and then mandate its failure. They seek to tie the hands of our military commanders, and then force them to retreat when they are unable to meet impossible timetables. They mandate the withdrawal with no regard for the situation on the ground, and then they sweeten the deal with $15 billion in money that is unrelated spending that has got a little something in there for practically everyone: $283 million for the milk income lost contract program; $74 million for peanut storage costs; $1.3 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers. Billions and billions of dollars for these projects, some worthy, some not.     
   But none of them related to the troops, and what this is, this is a war funding supplemental. None of these are emergency items. 
   Their only connection to emergency supplemental appropriations for the war, Mr. Speaker, in Iraq, is that they are necessary to build support for this bill, a bill that trades victory for electoral gains. Make no mistake, this legislation is a political solution for Democrats, not a strategy for winning in Iraq. 
   And what would the consequences of defeat be? The National Intelligence Estimate, the 9/11 Commission, and our people on the ground have all made it very clear that a precipitous withdrawal would have catastrophic consequences. The carnage of the battle of Baghdad that we are witnessing today will be just the beginning. Violence will spill out across the country and spread to the entire region. 
   In our absence, Iran and Syria will be utterly unfettered in their ability to incite a regional war that threatens global security, with enormous casualties suffered by the people of the region. 
   Proponents of a policy of defeat often point to our diminished standing in the international community. But what about our standing with the Iraqi people? Terrorist attacks on our own soil have demonstrated that our security and their security are directly linked. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, Operation Iraqi Freedom has bound us even more closely. We have a commitment to help the Iraqi people establish lasting security through democracy. We have a commitment not to abandon them to be slaughtered by terrorists. 
   And if we retreat, we not only abandon the Iraqi people, we draw terrorism back to our own doorstep. Have we so soon forgotten the tragedy of attacks on our homeland? 
   We took the war on terror to the terrorists and have suffered not one attack since September 11 of 2001. 
   With this bill, we would bring the war on terror back home. Only this time we will have strengthened the terrorists ourselves with a road map for success. We will have demonstrated precisely what it takes to defeat the United States of America. We will have clearly signaled to them that they must simply bide their time until the mandated retreat, at which time they will be able to terrorize with impunity. 
   I, like many Americans, Mr. Speaker, have been discouraged by this war. We all feel the toll that it has taken. And we are keenly aware of the price that we are paying, especially in a human sense. Every one of my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, has, as I have, looked in the faces of constituents whose family and friends have made the ultimate sacrifice in this war. Their pain is very real, and their loss is profound. 
   I regularly talk to a man called Ed Blecksmith whose son J.P. was tragically killed 2 years ago this past November in the very famous battle of Fallujah. And he has, time and time again, said to me, if we don't complete this mission, my son J.P. will have died in vain. 
   But we do not honor those who have sacrificed by abandoning their mission. We do not honor those in the field who are fighting, as we speak, by tying their hands and depriving them of the means to succeed. We will honor them by winning the war in Iraq so that our men and women come home having completed their mission. 
   We know that their mission will not be complete in the immediate future. As President Bush and General David Petraeus have both acknowledged, success will take months, not days or weeks. But there are signs of hope that the President's new plans, under General Petraeus, are working. 
   As Brian Williams of NBC reported from the field in Iraq, he said, ``This change in policy, getting out, decentralizing, going into the neighborhoods, grabbing a toehold, telling the enemy we are here, talking to the locals, that is having an obvious and palpable effect. There are hopeful signs.'' That was said by the NBC news anchor, Brian Williams. 
   Mr. Speaker, to abandon our mission now would be disastrous. I urge my colleagues to reject the policy of defeat, reject the return of terrorism to our homeland, and reject this unconstitutional power grab whose sole purpose is to cede victory to our enemies. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, in 1859 that great philosopher and religious leader John Stuart Mill wrote: ``War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.'' 
   We have yet to hear from the other side of the aisle about how we are going to win the global war on terror. We haven't heard, as my friend, Mr. Lungren, just said to me, the ``V'' word. How are we going to be victorious in this war? 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule. This is the largest supplemental spending bill in the history of this planet; and it is being brought up under a closed rule. 
   Our colleagues in the other body will have an opportunity to amend and discuss and debate this. Only a few Members of the Democratic leadership fashioned this measure, Mr. Speaker. It is unfair. It sends the wrong message to our troops. We must be victorious in this war. 
   With that, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and if they pass this rule, a ``no'' vote on the underlying legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I want to express appreciation to my very good friend from Dallas and my new friend from New York for their management of this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to say that to me it is very clear. Mr. Sessions' very able assistant just gave me a copy of the Constitution. Article 1, section 2 says: ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States.'' 
   Until we change the Constitution and make the District of Columbia a State or include it as a State or as a part of Maryland, it seems to me that this is unconstitutional. 
   I mean, I am not a constitutional expert, but I know that Mr. Sensenbrenner stood here. We had a wide range of other people who have been arguing. I listened this morning to that great constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley from George Washington University on National Public Radio. He was talking about this exact line that I just read, arguing that it is unconstitutional. 
   I don't exactly understand why it is we are here. But there is something that hasn't been discussed at all in this debate, and that is how are we going to pay for this thing. We do know that we have got this structure that is put into place, PAYGO, as it's called. 
   Well, there was mandatory spending in this to establish a new Member of Congress; and under PAYGO, the rules that are adopted, the costs clearly have to be offset. The offset that is self-executed into this bill, by the rule, raises the requirement for income tax withholding by three one-thousandths of a percent. It's a pretty tiny one. But it has the potential for some real problems. Think about the self-employed computer programmer who earns $80,000 a year. 
   This computer programmer would have to calculate their estimated tax themselves and make quarterly payments to the government. If that computer operator misses that new three one-thousandths of 1 percent increase in withholding and underwithholds by as little as 6 cents per month, that person is subject to the Internal Revenue Service prosecuting them and seeking interest and penalties as if they were trying to evade paying their income taxes. 
   Basically, I concluded that if the government is going to require that they are going to take money that they say you could potentially get back from this, it is a tax increase, because if the government holds money that is mine, no matter how small it is, and I am not getting interest on that money, that, to me, is a tax increase. That is exactly what we are going to be doing when any Member votes to pass this rule that allows us to proceed in this matter. 
   I don't understand why it is that we are here. It is, to me, a very, very unfortunate thing. We now see how the Democrats intend to close the so-called tax gap, and it's on the backs of the average taxpayer in this country, and it is just plain wrong. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule. If, by chance, we pass this rule, which, from my perspective, self-executes a tax increase on the average hard-working taxpayer in this country, I urge a ``no'' vote on the bill itself.  
   One of the most ridiculous aspects of this rule is the mechanism used to pay for the mandatory spending in this bill. 
   The bill provides for a new Member of Congress, and as a constitutional officer, that Member's salary is a mandatory expense. 
   Under the PAYGO rules adopted by the House, those costs must be offset. 
   The offset self-executed into the bill by the rule raises the requirement for income tax withholding by three one-thousandths of a percent. 
   What does that mean to the average taxpayer? Well, for a married couple who both happen to be firefighters earning $80,000 a year, their interest-free loan to the government just went up by about $1.60. That's right, $1.60. But they do have to send approximately 13 cents per month more to the government to pay for a new congressional seat. 
   That's not the worst part, though. Take the self-employed computer programmer who earns $80,000 per year. She has to calculate her estimated tax herself and make quarterly payments to the government. 
   If she misses that new .003 percent increase in withholding, and under-withholds by as little as 6 cents per month she is subject to the IRS prosecuting her and seeking interest and penalties as if she were trying to evade paying her taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, we now see how the Democrats intend to close the so-called ``tax gap''--on the backs of average taxpayers, all to pay another Member of Congress.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. I would simply argue, based on the point that has been made by that great expert Mr. Turley, we need to look at amending the U.S. Constitution before we go down that road. And we also have to look at how it is we are going to pay for this. Are we going to pay for it by basically imposing a tax on the average taxpaying citizen of this country by withholding dollars of theirs? I just think it is plain wrong.

   Mr. DREIER. Absolutely. And I will tell you that when the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee last night began his testimony before the Rules Committee, he quoted both Kenneth Starr, and frankly I will say that it was with a great deal of pain and it was precedent-setting that our distinguished Judiciary Committee chairman Mr. Conyers and he said this, quoted for the first time, and I suspect maybe the last, Kenneth Starr, and he went on to refer to the fact that Viet Dinh had clearly concluded this. 
   There are conflicting views as to the constitutionality of this. I recognize that. And, in fact, Mr. Sensenbrenner, when he was addressing the Rules Committee last night, said that he believed that this was a 50/50 call. 
   I think that there are a lot of different opinions on it. Jonathan Turley is one that has spent a great deal of time looking at this, and I just happen to think that he is right. And the way I read the Constitution, that is the way I see it.

And that is why I argue that if, in fact, we are going to do this, we should look at a way in which the District of Columbia becomes a State so that it can, in fact, comply with the Constitution.

   Mr. DREIER. Again, this description of the District of Columbia as a special entity is absolutely right. That is what the Framers of our Constitution wanted to do in establishing the District of Columbia to ensure that it is not a State. That is the uniqueness of the District of Columbia. And I am arguing that if, in fact, we need to make this change so that it complies with Article I, section 2, it seems to me there needs to be a modification to the Constitution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, as we clearly saw last week with the sharp decline in our stock market following a major drop in the Chinese market, the increasingly global nature of our economy is one of the most defining issues of our time. The growing connectedness of the world's consumers, producers, workers, and investors is having an impact on virtually every aspect of our lives. And with all the rapid change that globalization is bringing about, it is very natural for us to ask ourselves the question: Have these changes been for the better? We want to know if globalization is improving our lives or making them worse. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the biggest concerns that we have when we look at this question is the issue of income inequality, something that many people are talking about. We read reports of massive executive salaries, and compare them to the circumstances of America's middle class and the concerns that working families have, and we inevitably wonder if the system is in fact fair. I recently spoke here on this issue, on this very question. 
   The critical issue is not, Mr. Speaker, whether those at the top are becoming more prosperous; the critical issue is whether everyone is becoming more prosperous, particularly those who are at the bottom of the economic ladder. 
   We looked at the issue of wages and saw that they are growing for all workers. But when we looked even deeper, we saw that the outlook is even more positive. The purchasing power of working families is increased by lower taxes and greater access to low-cost goods through international trade. This growing purchasing power, along with rising wages, is increasing the standard of living for all Americans, with the greatest positive impact for those who are just beginning to move up the economic ladder. 
   Today, I want to look at another issue that helps to answer the question of whether quality of life is improving for everyone; that is, the issue of jobs, Mr. Speaker. More specifically, new job creation, and the quality of those new jobs. 
   Jobs are perhaps the most critical issue in determining standards of living. Does everyone who wants a job have a job? Does that job provide the opportunity to prosper and improve one's quality of life? Just as we saw with wages, the numbers demonstrate a very positive outlook for workers. Unemployment is at 4.6 percent, a rate that is exceptionally low. Mr. Speaker, in fact, we have had 16 straight months of unemployment at 5 percent or less. At the same time, the workforce has been rapidly expanding. Our economy has created nearly 7 1/2 million new jobs in the last 3 1/2 years. There are 146 million Americans working today, more than at any time in our Nation's history. The jobs outlook in the United States continues to be very, very good. 
   But just like with wages, we see an even fuller picture, a better picture when we dig just a little deeper. Average monthly hires last year were nearly 5 million, the highest rate ever since data have been collected. Of those 5 million, the share of workers who left their old job voluntarily for new work was also at the highest level. 58.3 percent made that move. This means that workers are not just finding jobs, they are finding better jobs, better opportunities. Anyone who has been stuck in a dead-end job knows that this is a huge quality of life issue. 
   Having a job is essential to providing for a family, and any job can serve as a starting point to success. But having a good job that offers new opportunities to prosper is essential to a growing standard of living. 
   The fact that we are seeing 5 million new hires every month demonstrates a great deal of churn and dynamism in our workforce, and we know that that change is not always easy. 
   But the rapidly growing number of workers who are voluntarily leaving their old jobs demonstrates that new and better opportunities are being created. It demonstrates, Mr. Speaker, the increased confidence in our workforce that comes with growing prosperity and the prospect of a better life. And it also helps to answer the question of whether the standard of living is improving for everyone, not just those who are at the top of the economic lead ladder.     
   New jobs and new opportunities are helping to make all of us more prosperous. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to pursue pro-growth economic policies, including an embrace of America's global leadership role. Those policies have brought about this dynamic work force, where everyone is upwardly mobile.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. 
   And I want to thank my very distinguished colleague ANNA ESHOO for authoring this, and I want to congratulate my California colleagues on both sides of the aisle for once again coming together to recognize public service. 
   Mr. Speaker, I never had the opportunity to serve in Sacramento, but I did know Leo McCarthy to be an extraordinary public servant. And one of the things that is very moving, as I listened to the remarks of my colleague from Highland, Mr. Lewis, who was elected with Governor McCarthy in 1968 to the California State legislature and as I listened to ANNA ESHOO, who I had no idea she was his district office representative, I was reminded of the fact that public service is a very important calling. And as I listened to Ms.  Foxx outline the service record, although I suspect she never met Leo McCarthy, she went through his extraordinary accomplishments. 
   As a legislator, I am reminded of the fact that we need to recognize that we are here to do the people's business. Yes, we need to have that clash of ideas. Yes, it is important that we engage in vigorous debate. But at the end of the day, we are here to accomplish very important things for the people whom we are honored to represent. 
   It was in 1963, as has been pointed out, that he first ran for the County Board of Supervisors, and I will say I learned not only that ANNA ESHOO was his district representative, I had heard that he was from New Zealand originally, but then when I heard he was from Auckland, I was of course reminded of the old story about the guy who got on an airplane to go to Oakland, California, and ended up in Auckland, New Zealand. And it sounded like Leo McCarthy actually took the reverse route, and I wondered how many times he was headed to Oakland that people might have thought that he was going home to Auckland. 
   But the fact is I had great regard for Leo McCarthy, and I wondered why anyone would leave New Zealand, because it is a spectacular spot. In fact, I have said on more than a few occasions if I didn't have the opportunity to live in the United States of America, New Zealand would be the spot that I would live in. 
   But having said that, I will simply say that my colleagues, Republican and Democrat alike, had great regard for Leo McCarthy and his extraordinary public service to the people of California. 
   May God rest his soul, and our thoughts and prayers are with his wonderful family members. And I know that one of the things Leo McCarthy said when asked the question what his greatest accomplishments would be, he said it was his family, and so our thoughts and prayers are with them.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I simply rise to say that my very good friend, the distinguished gentleman from Maryland, is incorrect when he said that we are asking for a measure to be considered overnight. On Tuesday of this week, this measure was sent to this House. We have had an opportunity, as we have looked at the issue of FISA modernization since July of this past year to get it done, and there is an urgency at this moment. So it has not been overnight. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (QUESTION OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. And we have all come to the conclusion that this has been a very sad day in many ways. Of course, the saddest part of it was the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Tom Lantos. 
   I would simply like to say that Mr. Diaz-Balart had the responsibility of serving as the floor manager for a rule that was, as he said in his very thoughtful statement, unprecedented. And we had a debate on that rule, and this House chose to do something it had never done before, pass a rule which took two contempt resolutions and adopted them. That was a decision of the House. And I think it was an unfortunate one. 
   Mr. Diaz-Balart had a responsibility to stand up for this institution. He and I stood together at that service, heard from colleagues of ours and heard from many other distinguished people who remembered the life of Tom Lantos.     
   We were stunned when all of a sudden the bells rang and the House was going to reconvene in the middle of this memorial service. 
   Now, members of the majority staff, Madam Speaker, had been informed, had been informed, of exactly what it was that we in the minority were going to do. If the House reconvened and we proceeded with consideration of this special rule, we had informed the members of the majority staff that we were going to call for a vote. 
   So Mr. Diaz-Balart was simply working to, under very, very, very challenging, and, again, from my perspective, unprecedented circumstances, where I had never before seen the House of Representatives convened during a memorial service being held in Statuary Hall, but under those circumstances, Mr. Diaz-Balart had the responsibility to fulfill his duties, not to the Republican Members, but to do what he believed to be right, and I agree with him, obviously, in upholding the rights of this institution. So for any Member, any Member or anyone outside to malign Mr. Diaz-Balart for simply doing his job under very difficult circumstances is not right. 
   Let me conclude by simply saying that Mr. Diaz-Balart is one of those Members who we all know is a fighter for freedom and has been throughout his entire life. In many respects, LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART is very similar to Tom Lantos. 
   Madam Speaker, I will say that it is a tragic irony that as we are remembering the life of Tom Lantos that a Member like LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART would in any way be maligned for his work on behalf of the struggle for freedom and democracy and the liberation of people all over this world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, Speaker Pelosi is absolutely right, this is a very, very sad day for all of us. We just memorialized our colleague, Tom Lantos, and we have come back today to deal with an issue which I believe is one that creates the potential to undermine the power of the first branch of government. 
   Now, as has been said, if we looked at the potential court challenge that we can see, this notion that has been put forward by our former colleague, Mr. Edwards, that we are, in fact, a separate, independent, and equal branch of government could be thrown out the window. 
   The other thing that's very sad about today, Madam Speaker, is the fact that we are here with an absolutely unprecedented rule. Never before in the history of the Republic has there been such a rule. This rule actually undermines the deliberative nature of the people's House. What we're doing is we are saying that there will be no debate whatsoever, no debate whatsoever on these very important two contempt resolutions, no debate whatsoever. When this rule is adopted, we will see those two measures hereby adopted, meaning that there will be no chance for us to, as a House, have the kind of debate that we did for an hour upstairs in the Rules Committee. And so, we're throwing out the window the notion of participation in a free and open debate. 
   And Madam Speaker, the other thing that is very sad about today is that, while we were promised 1 year ago last month a new direction for America, a new era of openness, an opportunity for free-flowing debate, we will, with passage of this resolution, be on the brink of seeing the 110th Congress, and I will say to the distinguished chair of the Committee on Rules, since she is presiding over this, Madam Speaker, we will have, this Congress, adopted more closed rules than any Congress in the history of the Republic. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule. And I urge strong support for the resolution which will allow us to finally bring about modernization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

   Mr. Speaker, bipartisanship is something that everyone has said we need to have as we deal with this issue. The distinguished Speaker, my fellow Californian, Ms. Pelosi, said when she was minority leader that ethics reform must be done in a bipartisan way. 
   The majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, stood in the well when this bill was pulled 2 weeks ago and said he wanted to see this work done in a bipartisan way. Mr. Wamp and Mr. Hill have worked in a bipartisan way. We need to have bipartisanship. 
   I am going to urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so in fact we can do what the American people want us to do, work in a bipartisan way because the integrity of this institution is absolutely essential if we are going to succeed in governing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, as legislators there can be no issue of more fundamental importance than the strength and the integrity of our institution. None of our work here, none of our legislative or political priorities matter if we don't have the integrity and the trust of the people that are necessary to be an effective body. 
   The Founders of our Republic, the authors of our Constitution, were well aware of the inherent challenges in making government fully accountable. They understood human nature and the pitfalls that go with investing power in individuals.     
   After all, Madison famously wrote in Federalist 51: ``But what is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.'' Those were the brilliant words of the Father of our Constitution. 
   Our Founders recognized, Mr. Speaker, these challenges and knew the answer was to empower institutions rather than individuals. They knew that  the House of Representatives, like all government institutions, must have the authority and the imperative to preserve its integrity and to punish those individual Members who would tarnish its reputation, diminish its stature, and erode its ability to serve as the representative of the people. 
   They gave explicit constitutional authority to do so. As we all know, Article II, section V, clause 2 of the Constitution directs Congress to ``determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.'' 
   Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, they knew that the most important guarantor of accountable and trustworthy government is democracy itself. No individual Member of Congress ever acts with impunity because we are judged every 2 years by the people who sent us here. And, of course, no one is above the law. 
   As we speak, there are former colleagues of ours serving time in jail for their abuses of the offices that we hold. Outside watchdog groups, the media, individual voters and our criminal justice system are all working, and working quite effectively, to shed some light on this body and ensure Members are held accountable. 
   Externally, Mr. Speaker, the pressure is on. The problem is how to deal with accountability internally; how do we fulfill our constitutional imperative to police ourselves and preserve the integrity of this body. Our current process is broken. It's hamstrung by two key problems: partisan deadlock and a lack of transparency. This a serious challenge. It is so serious that some Members of this body apparently feel that we are not up to the job. 
   A task force was established to consider the question of whether we should just throw up our hands, concede that we are not capable of fulfilling our constitutional duty to police ourselves and set up another body to do it for us. 
   This was a dubious task to begin with, but I believe that it was tackled with all sincerity and commitment. Mr. Capuano and Mr. Smith took on the role assigned to them and very carefully considered the question. But the breakdown came when it was time to make its recommendation. 
   The proposal put forth by Mr. Capuano, which ignores the real problem of a broken, internal ethics process, and in fact exacerbates the problem by adding a new partisan outside body, was not endorsed by his Republican counterpart. It met immediate criticism on both sides of the aisle. The Democratic leadership had no choice but to pull it. 
   Now, Mr. Smith offered a very thoughtful alternative, and we were told that consideration of Mr. Capuano's proposal was being postponed in order to work with Mr. Smith and consider his suggestion. That bipartisan negotiation, to my knowledge, Mr. Speaker, never took place. Mr. Wamp and Mr. Hill also submitted a proposal, a bipartisan proposal; but it was disregarded as well. Instead, we are back here confronting essentially the same deeply flawed proposal that was yanked from the schedule a couple of weeks ago. 
   They may have put lipstick on that pig, but it is still a pig, Mr. Speaker. This proposal still sets the stage for partisan witch hunts. It may take bipartisan support to initiate investigations, but they can be advanced purely on partisan lines. So at the very beginning, when little information is known, bipartisanship is called for. But once the process begins, the flood gates for partisan attacks are wide open. The minor modifications made to the original proposal do nothing more than attempt to obfuscate the utterly partisan nature of the proposed Office of Congressional Ethics. 
   As we have seen countless times under the Democratic leadership, a bad proposal demands a draconian process to get it through. And the worse the proposal is, the worse the process needs to be. We've seen an explosion of closed rules in this Congress. And what does a closed rule do? It severely restricts debate and shuts out all amendments. This has become the go-to rule for this new majority. And that's as bad as it could possibly get. Right? There is nothing worse that they could do than to shut out all amendments and alternatives. Right? 
   I used to think so until this point, until we saw this rule. This one absolutely takes the cake, Mr. Speaker. In case you missed it when the Clerk read it, and allow me to repeat it, pay attention or you will miss it again: ``Resolved, that House Resolution 895, as amended by the amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, is hereby adopted.'' That's what the resolution says. This rule actually provides for passage of the underlying proposal without so much as one single word of debate on this proposal. They simply declare it into existence. No debate, no vote. A closed rule may shut out dissent, but this rule eliminates deliberation altogether. 
   Before this Congress even began, our distinguished Speaker, my fellow Californian, committed to ``the most honest and open government,'' has managed to stoop to unprecedented lows in closed, inaccessible government that operates purely on back-room deals with no place for open, honest debate. And for what purpose? To ram through a policy so bad it has been widely and heavily criticized by both Democrats and Republicans. A policy to turn our ethics process into nothing more than cheap partisan games and a policy of abandoning our constitutional imperative to police ourselves and ensure the integrity of this great institution. This is terrible policy, brought to us by a singularly terrible rule. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject the rule and demand real ethics reform that actually addresses the root problems in our current system and accepts responsibility, as the Constitution directs us to, for our own ethics process. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, as I listened to the very distinguished chairman of the Military Quality of Life Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, I've got to say that I was somewhat saddened at this constant finger-pointing: the Republicans did this in 1996 and we didn't know how to run the place and we didn't provide the funding that was necessary for veterans and all of this sort of stuff and we were late in doing these things. 
   The fascinating thing about this is that there's this brilliant document that came forward during last fall's campaign, and it was unveiled by the new Speaker of the House. It was called ``A New Direction for America.'' And in it, it talked about this new spirit of openness, the fact that we would have transparency and disclosure and accountability, the likes of which we had not seen in a long time, if ever. 
   Madam Speaker, I will tell you that we all know that we've gotten the exact opposite of that. I unveiled a few weeks ago, along with my colleagues Mr. Hastings, Mr. Diaz-Balart and Mr. Sessions, an outline of what has happened in this year. 
   Well, this process that we're dealing with at this very moment is an example of the kind of arrogance that we have seen in trying to utilize veterans as a political pawn. 
   Now, the distinguished ranking member, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Wicker), quoted the veterans publication in which they said very clearly, we can do something that will ensure that the resources necessary for our Nation's veterans are there. We can pass in a bipartisan way a military quality of life appropriations conference report. We can get it through both Houses of Congress, and we can get it to the President of the United States. And then we will have, albeit late, we will have been able to get the funding that is necessary. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, I don't believe that there are Members of this institution who actually want to deprive our Nation's courageous veterans from having access to the quality health care and the other items that they need to have to address their concerns. I don't believe that anybody sincerely wants to do that. 
   But I will tell you this, we know full well that there has been game-playing in this process. In fact, all one needs to do is look at the rule. We know that rule XVIII in the Senate basically says that you cannot link up two appropriation bills. It's a scope violation, and it can't be done. 
   Madam Speaker, on October 31, 44 Members of the United States Senate signed a letter, and I'd like to include this letter in the Record at this point.

   Mr. DREIER. Well, I had just completed my statement, Madam Speaker, and the gentleman said getting lectures from people, and I'd given a 5- or 6-minute statement. So I don't know, maybe it was an exaggeration for me to infer that the gentleman was referring to what I said when, in fact, I had served on the Rules Committee in a leadership position in the past several Congresses. So maybe I was wrong in interpreting that he was referring to my statement. 
   But, Madam Speaker, let me say this: we know that the House of Representatives did, in fact, pass out those appropriations bills. We worked in a bipartisan way to make that happen. We had a friendly exchange with the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Appropriations in which we characterized the Senate as the enemy and the other party as merely the opposition. 
   The fact of the matter is we've had a real challenge in dealing with the Senate. We know that as we look at this measure we, in past Congresses, have, in fact, been successful at passing measures out of the House of Representatives. 
   And I will say again that my friend referred to these lectures when, in fact, I began my remarks by pointing to the fact that we were promised a new day, and the fact is we're getting much, much worse. We're getting much worse than the behavior and the performance that my friend complained about of the past. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I've got to say that playing politics with our Nation's veterans is exactly what we're going through right now, and I think it's a very sad commentary. And I am gratified, I'm very gratified, that our Nation's veterans organizations are recognizing exactly what's happening, and I thank my friend for yielding.

   Yesterday afternoon I followed the example of our colleague, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), and  his wife, Beverly, who regularly go out and visit our wounded troops, and I went out to the Walter Reed Army Hospital. I had the opportunity to see a number of these courageous men who have sacrificed and have been wounded. And I couldn't help but think of it, as I came back and went to the Rules Committee last night and saw this attempt being made, which they have done, to tie the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill to the Veterans bill, as nothing but pure politics which undermine the ability for us to get what these brave men and women who have fought on behalf of the cause of freedom need.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank my very good friend from Rochester, New York (Ms. Slaughter), the very distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, for yielding me this time. I am compelled to rise in the strongest possible opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation. Once again, the Democratic majority is running scared from openness and transparency because they know that their policies cannot withstand any scrutiny. They have shut off all meaningful debate, amendments and alternatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will say that no matter how intense, no matter how bitter, no matter how hate-filled the vitriol is that comes towards us, I will continue to strive to work in a bipartisan way to deal with this very important issue and other issues as well. 
   I think we evidenced that last night when we offered an amendment in the Rules Committee that would have allowed the Members of this body to replace this proposal with one that actually enjoys strong, bipartisan support. I am referring, of course, to the Iraq Study Group recommendations, the so-called Baker-Hamilton Commission. 
   This group spent literally months, Democrats and Republicans together. A former Member of this house as the Democratic leader, the former Secretary of State, James Baker, as the Republican leader, and an equal number of Republicans and an equal number of Democrats came up with bipartisan recommendations as to how we, as a Nation, could move forward. 
   Knowing that this sound and very responsible policy would very easily trump the inferior proposal that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are hoping to move on the floor today, they took the only route that they seem to know, and they have a great deal of experience at this, Mr. Speaker. They just shut down the process completely. 
   They seemed to know, Mr. Speaker, that, unfortunately, this very thoughtful work product, which is not supported by everyone, but it enjoys strong bipartisan support. Again, our former colleague, the very respected former Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs it is now called, it was the International Relations Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee before that, Mr. Hamilton, and the highly regarded Secretary of State, James Baker, came up with this package. 
   And what is it our colleagues did? With a very passionate statement made by our friend from Virginia, my classmate, Mr. Frank Wolf, who was really the progenitor of this Iraq Study Group, working with a wide range of people to come up with just the establishment of the group, and now this work product has come forward, heralded by people all across this country, and what is it that they have done? They have chosen to take this inferior proposal and say, we are not going to even allow consideration of the Iraq Study Group. 
   Now, having precluded any real debate, they have nothing to fall back on but really cheap political ploys. The announcement was made several weeks ago that every single week leading up to Congress' adjournment for the month of August, we would have votes on Iraq. 
   One of the Democratic majority's favorite gimmicks is to give their ill-conceived bills grand-sounding names and shroud them in warm, fuzzy ideas that no one could possibly oppose. 
   Earlier this week, they rammed through the House is a massive giveaway to trial lawyers. And what was it called? The anti-discrimination bill. 
   Just yesterday, we considered a bill that slashes Medicare coverage for millions. What was it called, Mr. Speaker? The Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. The audacity of cutting Medicare with a bill that has ``Medicare protection'' right in the title is, to me, absolutely staggering. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I am proud that we, as Republicans, worked to address important issues with prudence and deliberation, issues that affect the quality of life and standard of living for all Americans. Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side, we will witness it in just a few minutes once again, they resort to demagoguery and name calling and all kinds of other vitriol. 
   When we refuse to be suckered by their slipshod efforts and poor policies, they accuse us of being pro-discrimination, or anti-children's health, or any other awful-sounding label that they can come up with. They will make some great and fascinating political ads. As this season goes on, we will see some of them on YouTube, I am sure, and other places. And if you look at these votes on discrimination and on the issue of Medicare and children's healthcare, obviously, we will be hearing a lot about the things that have been done here on the House floor during the campaign season, which obviously is under way right now. 
   They will no doubt continue with this tired approach here today. We are going to hear about how the underlying bill before us today is about ``troop welfare.'' We are going to hear about the ``terrible strain'' the war in Iraq has put on the members of our Armed Forces and their families. 
   I want to make sure it is absolutely clear that we are all, all, very concerned, Mr. Speaker, about the welfare of our troops. It is a bipartisan concern, and anyone who would argue that we are somehow not concerned about the welfare of our troops is barking up the wrong tree. We see with sobering clarity, Mr. Speaker, the magnitude the impact the war has on their families. No American deserves more support than those who put their lives on the line to protect each and every one of us, and no one is more determined to fulfill our commitment to these men and women than my Republican colleagues and I are. 
   That is precisely, precisely, Mr. Speaker, why I stand in opposition to both this rule and the underlying legislation. The Democratic majority can slap any old bill together and say it promotes troop welfare. But, Mr. Speaker, that does not make it so. And they can slap any old bill together and  accuse its opponents of undermining troop welfare. But that doesn't make it so. 
   The reality is that this bill undermines our military leadership, who are already committed to the welfare of our troops and their families. And to imply in any way that our Nation's civilian and military leadership is not committed to the welfare of our troops and their families is again a very specious argument. 
   The reality is that this bill undermines our military leadership who are committed to the troops; and, in fact, it opens up the potential to force troops to stay in the field longer, handle missions for which they are not prepared, and ultimately create greater risks for our men and women who are in harm's way. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Armed Forces are already working toward the goal of ensuring that every servicemember spends 2 years at home after each year in the field, and that Reservists get 5 years at home after each 1 year of deployment. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Marine Corps is already providing what this bill would mandate, time at home at least equal to time deployed. The Commandant of the Marine Corps must approve any deviation from this policy. 
   Let me say once again, Mr. Speaker, I don't understand why it is that we are here dealing with this issue when we could in fact pass the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. We instead are doing something that the Marine Corps is doing right now. Again, the Commandant of the Marine Corps would have to approve any deviation from this policy. 
   What this bill does is to remove any flexibility that allows our military leaders to make deployment decisions that best provide for both troop welfare and, Mr. Speaker, something that we never hear discussed from our colleagues on the other side the aisle, and that is mission completion, completing our mission, making sure that we have success and victory. It adds another layer of bureaucratic red tape. Ironically, and tragically, it could actually force our commanders in the field to extend deployments and force our troops to take on missions for which they are not fully prepared. 
   Mr. Speaker, preventing our commanders from being able to task each unit to take on the mission for which it is best prepared and best trained would needlessly risk the lives of our troops. 
   I know that we all want the ultimate desire of every member of our armed services: that they be speedily and, as I said a moment ago, victoriously returned to the loving arms of their families and the accolades of a grateful Nation. But, Mr. Speaker, this bill is not, this bill is not the way to ensure that. 
   The Democratic majority can keep playing these games. They can continue to claim that this bill will improve the quality of life of our troops and their families. They can continue to accuse its opponents of callousness and indifference to servicemen and servicewomen. But I don't believe the American people will be fooled, Mr. Speaker. They are quite capable of seeing past clever bill titles and phony rhetoric. 
   This Democratic majority has got to learn that it takes more than demagoguery to lead this body and to lead this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, as well as the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding, and I would like to congratulate him not only for his amendment, but also for the comments that the former Governor of Delaware has just offered on the work of the Iraq Study Group. 
   Again, this was a bipartisan effort that was launched by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), who, as we all know, speaks passionately and eloquently on this and other issues. 
   We all want to see this war come to an end. President Bush stood right here in this Chamber in January delivering his State of the Union message, and he said the following: I wish this war was over and we had won. 
   So there is a shared goal of our trying to bring this war to an end as quickly as possible and to bring our men and women home to their families. 
   Frankly, I join my colleague from Delaware in stating that I believe that the opportunity for implementation, if not all, most of the work of the Iraq Study Group, this great bipartisan gathering, would go a long way towards achieving that goal to which both Democrats and Republicans claim to aspire. 
   So I would just like to thank my friend for his remarks, and I thank him for yielding to me.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, at this time I am very happy to yield 5 minutes to my good friend from Bridgeport, Connecticut (Mr. Shays), who next weekend will be making his 18th trip to Iraq. I know he shares my concern over the fact that, unfortunately, this rule fails to allow this House to consider the work of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, Mr. Speaker. 
   I will say again that it really baffles me as to why this majority will not allow us to have an opportunity to consider this bipartisan work product of the Iraq Study Group. 
   On the opening day, Mr. Speaker, the new Speaker of the House of Representatives stood and talked about this new sense of bipartisanship. We all know that the war in Iraq was the key issue in the November election. We know that the war in Iraq was the key issue in last November's election, and it is on the minds of all of our constituents. We are all concerned about the future that this war on terror holds for all of us, and that's why the Iraq Study Group was established. 
   Our former colleague, the former chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Lee Hamilton, the former Secretary of State, a Democrat and Republican led eight other Democrats and Republicans, highly regarded in this country, strongly partisan individuals, they came together with a bipartisan proposal. Unfortunately, the supposedly new bipartisan spirit that exists here in the House denies us a chance to even consider that. 
   No one demonstrates more passion on this issue than Mr. Wolf. When he made the arguments before the Rules Committee, they were very compelling and very strong as only FRANK WOLF can offer them. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, we have not seen a chance to do that.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I do so to say that just this week we all saw a great deal of attention focused on an op-ed piece written in the New York Times by two of the harshest critics of the war in Iraq. I am referring, of course, to the Brookings Institution Fellows Michael O'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack. And I saw Ken Pollack with Wolf Blitzer on CNN the other day saying he did not write the headline in the New York Times which talked about this is a war we might win. He did stand by every word in that piece that was written, and I am going to ask to include that piece in the Congressional Record.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume; and I will say again to my colleagues that, as we look at this challenge, this is a very difficult one. It is one that we seek to address in a bipartisan way, Mr. Speaker, Democrats and Republicans coming together. 
   Now, our former colleague, Mr. Hamilton, co-chairman of the Iraq Study Group, has made it very clear that the  work product which was unleashed, turned over last December, is still applicable today. This notion of saying that we need to look at bringing this group back together, I don't have it with me here, but I have one downstairs in my office. We have the volume, the work of the Iraq Study Group, that we've all gotten copies of; and all we're asking, Mr. Speaker, is that this bipartisan work product be able to be voted on and supported here. 
   Now, what is it that we have before us? We have a closed rule. And I'm saddened greatly to report to the House, by virtue of this closed rule having come from the Rules Committee, reported out last night, we have by far exceeded the doubling, the doubling of the number of closed rules in this Democratic majority than we had in the Republican majority at this time at the beginning of the last Congress. It saddens me. 
   Again, I will say that, Mr. Speaker, while we hear about this great new day, a sense of openness, transparency, accountability, what is it that we've gotten? We may not have been perfect when we were in the majority, but under this new majority that promised all of these great things to the American people, we have gotten now more than twice as many closed rules in the first 7 months of the year than we had in the first 7 months of the 109th Congress, and I just think it's a sad commentary on where we are. 
   Now to the issue at hand, Mr. Speaker. As we look at the challenge that the families of those loved ones face, I would like to share the remarks of some of the families that I have heard. 
   There is a young man who was killed tragically in the battle of Fallujah. His name is J.P. Blecksmith from San Marino, California. His father, like J.P., was a Marine; and after his son was tragically killed, Ed Blecksmith said to me, he said, David, if we don't complete our mission in Iraq, my son J.P. will have died in vain. And he said, we need to do everything that we possibly can to ensure victory. 
   And I will tell you that what we're doing here today under this closed rule, I believe, creates the potential for undermining the success that, as was pointed out and as I said in my last statement, is outlined in the remarks in the article in the New York Times, the op-ed piece written by Ken Pollack and Mike O'Hanlon, and there's another statement that was made. 
   I met a woman just a couple of months ago. Denise Codnot is her name. She came here to Washington, and she walked into my office, Mr. Speaker, and her son Kyle was killed in Iraq, 19 years old. He was in the Army. And she looked me in the eye and said, my son wasn't killed in Iraq. My son proudly gave his life, proudly gave his life for the cause of freedom. And she said to me, we must do everything within our power to ensure success and victory. 
   This war on terror has been very painful for us, Mr. Speaker, very, very painful for everyone involved, especially the families of those men and women in uniform. But we know there is an interconnectedness of this war on terror, and that is the reason that on this rule we are going to continue our quest to deal with modernization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   Now, I know that my colleagues last night in the Rules Committee, we passed out a special rule that will allow for consideration of possible negotiations that would take place on this issue, but, Mr. Speaker, we have been waiting since April of this year when the statements began to come forward from the Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell; from the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Michael Hayden; from the Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, the three Michaels I call them, who have come forward with this urgent plea for us to take the very antiquated, three-decade-old, three-decade-old 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and modernize it. 
   I am going to move, Mr. Speaker, to defeat the previous question, and I would like to yield 1 1/2 minutes to my colleague from Albuquerque, New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson) whose legislation will be made in order if we are successful in defeating the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I think it's been very, very clear here this is a closed rule. It's outrageous that we have continued down this pattern of closed rules; and we were promised, the American people were promised much better than that. The underlying legislation is legislation that the administration just announced the President would veto if it were to pass. We should be debating the work of the Iraq Study Group, the bipartisan package; and, unfortunately, with this closed rule, we're denied a chance to do that. 
   I also believe that my colleague from New Mexico, while debate seemed to be very personal among members of the Intelligence Committee, it comes down to the very strong statements that have been made by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. We need to immediately modernize the three-decade-old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we'll have an opportunity to make in order the very thoughtful legislation that has been introduced by our colleague from Albuquerque, Mrs. Wilson. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I begin by expressing my great appreciation to my friend from Worcester for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   I have to ask myself exactly why it is that we are here. One might think that this is Groundhog Day. We've already passed a rule on the Agriculture appropriations bill, and I would say to my friend, we've already passed the so-called SCHIP bill, which proposes a cut for seniors on the Medicare program and a massive tax increase for people all across this country and perpetuates this generational warfare challenge. That bill is behind us. 
   We have not had a single dilatory motion that I've seen since passage of this SCHIP legislation, and yet the Rules Committee chose last night to do something that, from all of the research that we have done, has never been done in the history of the Republic. 
   It is true that on occasion we have, after lengthy debate, come back with second rules when we were in the majority. For example, in 1995, we came back with a rule on the Interior appropriations bill that, by the definition of the new majority, would have been defined as an open rule. It simply said there would be a preprinting requirement that was put in order for all of the other amendments that would be offered during the measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, never before have we seen a rule on an appropriations bill come from the Rules Committee to the floor that self-executes one amendment. But this rule doesn't self-execute one amendment; it self-executes six amendments. This has never, ever been done. 
   We did, as my friend from Worcester said, have an interesting long discussion last night. We were here until nearly 3:30 in the morning yesterday, and then we had a lengthy discussion as we were waiting for votes here on the floor last night up in the Rules Committee. And I talked about the fact and my colleagues on our side talked about the fact that this was unprecedented. And Mr. Hastings, the gentleman from Fort Lauderdale, said, oh, well, will the world come to an end? The world isn't going to come to an end. But one of the great privileges that I have is working with our colleague, DAVID PRICE, on our House Democracy Assistance Commission. And we are, right now, engaged with 12 new and reemerging democracies around the world. I like to argue that one election a democracy does not make. 
   It's really hard work building democracies. And in countries like Lebanon, Afghanistan, Liberia, Kenya, Macedonia, the Republic of Georgia, the Ukraine, Haiti, Colombia, East Timor, Indonesia, Mongolia, countries that are moving towards democracy or have relatively young democracies, we have been working with their new parliaments because we know how important it is to have parliaments that have committee structure, oversight of  the executive branch, libraries, members who can work to provide constituent services. That's what this 20-member Commission that DAVID PRICE now chairs, and I'm privileged to serve as the ranking minority member on, has been working on. 
   What we've done, Mr. Speaker, is we've said we have a 220-year history in the United States House of Representatives. We don't claim to have a corner on the truth, we don't know exactly how it's done, but we do have experience. And Mr. Speaker, it saddens me greatly that as we continue to work with these new and reemerging democracies for these countries that are just beginning to have a taste of political pluralism, the rule of law, and the opportunity to build democratic institutions, that we, today, are once again restricting the opportunity that the minority has had. 
   I will say that my friend has talked about breaking an agreement. You know, there was an agreement, a bond that was talked about in last year's election and a bond that was made with the opening speech that was delivered by my California colleague, the gentlewoman from San Francisco, our new Speaker, the first woman Speaker of the House of Representatives. I regularly laud the fact that she has done that, the first Californian and the first Italian American. I am very proud as a Californian.     
   But I will tell you that commitment was made on the opening day, and has been made repeatedly, by my very good friend from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader, time and time again. We have continued to hear about this promise that we will have a great new sense of openness. We will have transparency. We will have accountability. We will have the things to which we all supposedly aspire. But what is it we have gotten here, Mr. Speaker? 
   As bad as you all say that we were when we were in the majority, as bad as the now majority says that we were, Mr. Speaker, when we were in the majority, we would have never contemplated self-executing five amendments in a rule for an appropriations bill.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, never before have we had an action such as this, self-executing six amendments in passage of the rule and completely shutting down the process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. That is the reason I reminded my friend of that, of course, Mr. Speaker. 
   Let me just say that getting the people's business done is a priority for every Member of this House. I recognize the responsibility of ensuring that we move through with our appropriations work. As the gentleman knows very well, we were able to complete the House's work on appropriations bills in the past. The distinguished majority leader wants to do that as well. 
   I do believe that if we look at the, you can call it a bump in the road, we have had very, very strong disagreement, as I said earlier, over the SCHIP bill. There was a lot of consternation about this. But the fact of the matter is, the additional hour was granted. We have now moved beyond that bill. We are now at nearly 2:30 in the afternoon, and things have moved certainly relatively smoothly today on the floor. I am just saying that I am very, very concerned about setting this kind of precedent to the appropriations process itself. 
   I recognize we came forward with closed rules in the past. You all, unfortunately, have had twice as many closed rules at this point from the beginning of the last Congress. But on the appropriations process, I just hope, for the good of the institution, that being the half of the American people who won't be able to be heard, there were more than 60 amendments that were in the queue to be considered for this measure, that we don't go down to only 12 amendments. I just find that very troubling. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, I mentioned the fact that this is the 27th year for the two of us to be serving in this great institution. If one goes back and looks beyond last year but instead at the appropriations process which during our 27-year period has been considered under an open process, there are times when we would be here late at night voting on appropriations bills in the past. It has allowed Members to work their will as they have gone through this. 
   So while you have looked at the precedent of last year as part of this agreement that you and Mr. Boehner had, the concern that I have is that this is setting a precedent for the future, which is a very, very troubling one. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, with the utmost respect for my good friend from New Haven, the distinguished Chair of the subcommittee, I will say that we could at this moment be debating this bill if we continued with this open amendment process.

   Mr. DREIER. If I can reclaim my time, let me just tell you the guarantee of the process. I was very happy to yield to my friend, and I will be happy to yield to her again, but I will say, Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is we have not had any dilatory tactics put into place since passage of the SCHIP bill. All the time we spend on this rule could have been spent discussing exactly what the gentlewoman has been speaking about. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield 2 minutes to my very good friend from Morristown, New Jersey, a hardworking member on the Committee on Appropriations, Mr. Frelinghuysen.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to apologize to the House for calling for the motion to adjourn, and I do so because in 15 minutes a memorial service is going to be held for our former colleague, Guy VanderJagt, over in the Ways and Means Committee room. 
   And I will say that Guy VanderJagt is someone who served longer in the minority than any Member on the other side of the aisle. 
   But no one understood about the rights of the minority better than Guy VanderJagt; and I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, those rights are outlined very clearly in the opening of Jefferson's Manual. 
   Now, we have been excoriated over the past hour for having used what have been called dilatory tactics 2 days ago before we passed the SCHIP bill. The fact of the matter is that is now ancient history. We have been struggling to ensure that we continue with the debate on this very important bill under an open amendment process. 
   I am going to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that we will have the opportunity to table this measure and go back to an open amendment process. Why? Because this rule represents the trifecta of bad process. It has shut down the amendment process, it has restricted the period of time for debate, and it has rewritten the bill through self-execution in this rule. And I am going to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that we can go back to what was promised on the opening day, and that is an open process. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the distinguished minority leader, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner).

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I was very interested to hear the remarks of the gentlelady from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE) when she inferred that the vote on the motion to recommit was not a substantive or amendatory vote. This is simply not the case. The motion to recommit has been held as the opposition's, traditionally the Minority's, last opportunity to perfect the bill prior to its adoption. The motion to recommit was often denied the Republicans when they were in the Minority prior to 1995. When the Republicans took the majority in the 104th Congress we had promised to protect the Minority's right to offer the motion to recommit and we kept our promise by instituting a rules change which prohibited the Rules Committee from denying that motion. 
   And to simply make the point more clear that a motion to recommit is a substantive amendatory vote, I would like to refer the gentlelady to page H210 of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD dated January 9, 2007. There she will find a series of parliamentary inquiries directed to the Chair by the gentleman from Texas, Mr. HENSARLING. In one of the inquiries the gentleman from Texas specifically asks the Chair, Does the special order provide for the consideration of any amendments? To which the Speaker replied, ``By way of the motion to recommit.'' So, unless the gentlelady would like to overturn the ruling of the Chair, clearly the motion to recommit is amendatory and therefore highly substantive.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, but I have to say that I am very, very troubled that we are where we are. 
   I see the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, my very good friend from Detroit, Mr. Conyers, on the floor. Just before we adjourned for the Memorial Day break, he and I were in a lengthy exchange, both upstairs in the Rules Committee and then here on the House floor dealing with the issue of lobbying reform, and I was very pleased that Mr. Conyers supported an amendment that I offered dealing with disclosure of post-employment plans for Members. It was a very thoughtful process. Concern had been raised about that, and Mr. Conyers was very, very generous in looking at that issue, in dealing responsibly with it, and accepting the amendment that I proposed to that issue. 
   When we were in the midst of debate, and I will have to say when he stood there, I was somewhat concerned over the fact that we saw gross politicization from some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who have continued to try to make campaign speeches on this issue of lobbying and ethics reform, talking about the message that was sent last November. 
   We all know that the American people want an institution, a United States House of Representatives, that is above reproach. We all know that Members of this institution should in fact be held to the highest possible standards. 
   But I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, what troubles me about where we are at this moment. I just today looked at a report that was issued on the great new openness and the way this institution has been run and how dramatically improved it is. And then we are given, with this resolution, with all due respect, Mr. Speaker, a very, very poorly drafted resolution. That is the reason that we have a referral process. 
   In the 109th Congress, we had many, many issues that we had to address. And original jurisdiction matters that were referred to the Committee on Rules in fact were addressed in hearings, were addressed in markups, and in fact were resolved. 
   We listened to colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, talk about all of these great reforms that were implemented on the opening day of the 110th Congress and these great changes that have taken place. Well, Mr. Speaker, I have to tell you that we also have been spending time in the 110th Congress cleaning up the poorly worded, messy language that we dealt with. 
   One example: In a rule that was passed by this House we self-executed a provision which actually allowed Members to once again attend charitable events. In the opening day rules package that was put into place on this issue, Mr. Speaker, there was a provision that actually denied Members, it denied Members, the opportunity to attend charitable events. 
   Now, that was rectified. But I use that one example, Mr. Speaker, to point to the fact that if we had handled this issue the way Mr. Conyers had handled the issue of lobbying ethics reform, which we supported in a bipartisan way, we would not be dealing with a resolution that creates the potential, Mr. Speaker, for Members of this House who face a traffic ticket, Members who might want to protest, as I said earlier in my remarks, at the Sudanese Embassy over policies that are taking place there. 
   What it would mean, Mr. Speaker, is under this resolution, a Member who gets a traffic ticket, gets a ticket for littering, is arrested for protesting at the Sudanese Embassy, that that would have to be referred to the Committee on Standards. 
   My friend has just said there is a provision in here, it is the last line, item 2 in the ``resolved'' clause, which says if the committee does not empanel an investigative subcommittee to review the allegations, submit a report to the House describing its reasons for not empaneling such an investigative subcommittee, together with the actions, if any, the committee has taken in response to the allegation. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this very, very poorly crafted resolution basically does state that the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct does in fact have to deal with this, even if they choose, because it was a protest or a traffic ticket or a littering ticket, they still have to deal with this issue by choosing not to empanel an investigative committee to address that. 
   Now, our new colleague from Kansas stood up and very proudly talked about the fact that she is dealing with this issue of pension reform. We all want to do everything that we can to make sure that Members don't have the taxpayers subsidizing these pensions of criminals, people who are imprisoned.     
   We know there was concern raised about family members, but I will say there is nothing in this resolution that we are debating right now, Mr. Speaker, that addresses the issue of ensuring that criminals who have served in this institution are not going to continue to benefit from their pensions. In this very unique case, Mr. Speaker, I will say that we are very troubled over the fact that there are co-conspirators involved in this charge; and, Mr. Speaker, they are in fact family members who potentially could become the beneficiaries of this pension. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I will say again I am going to vote in favor of this resolution, but I am very, very troubled about the way it has been worded. I am very troubled over the fact that it was not referred to the Rules Committee of which I am privileged to serve as the ranking minority member. I think this is a very poor way of doing business. 
   Our Republican leader came forward with an appropriate privileged resolution which simply called for the Ethics Committee to expeditiously take action. We have had to wait for nearly half a year without any action whatsoever being taken to follow up on the action that was taken in the 109th Congress. 
   I believe everyone should in fact be deemed innocent until proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. I believe that as we look at this, though, it is imperative that we have action taken as quickly as possible. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1 minute to my very good friend from Texas, Judge Gohmert.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to once again engage in a colloquy with my very good friend from Maryland, the distinguished majority leader, if I might. 
   As we are standing here today, I will say, unfortunately, on the House floor this has become sort of the Rules Committee original jurisdiction process. We are now doing it on the House floor because a decision was made by the majority leadership to prevent the Rules Committee from having an opportunity to even consider this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, if I might just pretend as if this is a committee hearing and assume that the distinguished Chair has yielded time to me, I would like to inquire of the author of the resolution as to whether or not it is the intent to have Members of this institution who might possibly be engaging in a very, very great protest over which they feel very strongly and they are arrested, I would like to inquire is it the intention of the author of this resolution, Mr. Speaker, to have that measure, have that Member, referred with a potential huge, huge legal fee, $450 to $1,000 an hour, to action taken by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct? 
   And, similarly, I ask whether or not it is the intent of the author of the resolution to have the measure if someone, a Member of this House, gets a traffic ticket and they have to face a legal challenge there, if it is their intent that the issue of a Member's traffic ticket be referred to the Ethics Committee so the Ethics Committee can decide whether or not they want to empanel an investigative group to look at this, or choose to waive it. Or, as I said earlier, for littering or any other small instance. 
   My concern with this very poorly crafted resolution, my concern, Mr. Speaker, is we will see a situation whereby Members are faced with that kind of challenge. 
   I would be happy to yield to my friend to have him respond if that is the intent of his legislation here.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman did say and he talked about the great colleagues we have who serve on the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, and he did refer to the fact that this measure and the concern over a traffic ticket would, in fact, have to be referred to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. So I am inferring from that that it is the gentleman's intent that a measure like a traffic ticket or a protest at the Sudanese Embassy is to be referred to the Committee on Standards.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would just say if the gentleman were to read the resolution which he has authored, he would see there is no specificity. And, in fact, it is very possible, it is very possible that if we pass this legislation, we would be in a position where the Committee on Standards would be forced to deal with the issue of a traffic ticket, a protest, a littering ticket or any measure like that. My only question of the gentleman was that in fact his intent. He said this was authored in response to the Republican measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Maryland.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, the only point I am trying to make to my very good friend from Maryland is that this is a measure that clearly should have been referred to the Committee on Rules. The gentleman has on three occasions talked about the intent, the intent of his legislation. 
   This is drafted. We are about to vote on it. Why is there not specificity as to how Members are treated when dealing with an issue like of a traffic ticket juxtaposed to the 16 counts we are dealing with in the case of Mr. Jefferson? 
   There is not clarity in this measure, Mr. Speaker, and I believe it is very important for us to recognize that if we are in fact in this House with a great new sense of openness and a greater deliberative nature, this is a sad commentary on where we are. As I said in my remarks, everyone wants to talk about and is a proponent of holding this institution to high ethical standards. This is not a partisan issue. Unfortunately, it was used as a very partisan issue in last November's election. 
   But as we have found, there are problems of corruption on both sides of the aisle. It seems to me that as we deal with an issue that is as important as holding this institution to the highest possible ethical standards, Mr. Speaker, it is very important for us to do it right. 
   Unfortunately, and again, while I am going to vote for this resolution, I think it was very, very poorly crafted. I think we as an institution, Mr. Speaker, can do much, much better than we did with this. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I'd like to during this period of time engage my friend in a colloquy. 
   And let me say as we begin this process, that I'm very troubled that we have this 40 minutes of debate, and we are in a position right now where we had to hear a whole line of campaign speeches that were, as the gentleman from Maryland said, a very important part of last November's process, the election, and we had to listen to those speeches again rather than trying to clean up this very, very poorly crafted legislation. 
   Now, I asked my friend to yield earlier, and he refused to yield to me, Mr. Speaker. And as I made that request, I was struck with the fact that the report that was just issued today continued to talk about this great sense of civility, openness and bipartisanship that exists in this institution. So I will say that I was somewhat troubled by that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have just been informed that the distinguished majority leader has another speaker from which we're going to hear, and before I engage in my colloquy with him, and I hope he might be generous with whatever time is remaining so that we can try to clean up this legislation or at least the intents of it, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As we've been sitting here listening to what frankly have been a flow of campaign speeches, we've been trying to sort of study and analyze and scrutinize what the majority leader, for whom I have highest regard, describes as well-crafted legislation. 
   So I'm going to with the remaining time that I have continue to try and inquire about this legislation which should have been referred to the Rules Committee, that should have been an original jurisdiction hearing. 
   A question that has just come to my attention, Mr. Speaker, and I would be happy to yield to my friend for an answer on this, is whether or not a Member who conceivably receives a traffic ticket, and again, the language here says, ``be it Resolved, That whenever a Member of the House of Representatives, including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress, is indicted or otherwise formally charged with criminal conduct.'' 
   Now, my question to my friend would be, if a Member were to get a speeding ticket, and I was just informed by one of our crack staff people here who is aware of the fact that in the State of Virginia, if someone exceeds the speed limit by 10 miles an hour, they could be out here on the George Washington Parkway, there is in fact a criminal charge leveled against them. If that were to happen to a Member, is that Member under this resolution that we are going to be voting on compelled to actually inform the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct that that person faces that criminal charge? 
   And I'd be happy to yield to the majority leader to clarify this bit of confusion that we have in this legislation, Mr. Speaker.

Mr. Speaker, if I could reclaim my time, when the gentleman says I'm just focusing on traffic tickets, if in fact someone is arrested for a protest at the Sudanese Embassy, is it the intent that that Member be compelled to inform the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of this action?

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, if I could reclaim my time, that is the reason we need to have that clarified. Let me read the resolution on which we're about to vote. 
   It says, ``otherwise formally charged with criminal conduct.'' That is the language that is here. If that happens, then the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct is expected to take action, whether or not they choose to empanel an investigative committee or choose to waive it. The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct is compelled to take action, whether it be a traffic ticket, an arrest at the Sudanese Embassy or a littering ticket. 
   And I'm happy to yield to my friend if he wants to further clarify the confusion and explain to us what ``otherwise formally charged with criminal conduct'' is, and Mr. Speaker, the reason I'm doing this is to simply underscore the fact that this measure should have been referred to the Committee on Rules so that we could have held an original jurisdiction and done what we've already had to do in this Congress so far, and that is clean up on issues like the charitable events attending, we had to clean that up  through a self-executed measure in a rule that was passed last month.     
   That's why we have a chance to do it. I believe it should be done. 
   I am happy to yield to my friend.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me say there is absolutely nothing trivial about this issue. We are here on the floor because of the fact that we have faced a very serious attack with an indictment against one of our colleagues. That Member happens to be a Democrat. 
   We have all discussed the fact that this is a bipartisan issue, and there is a goal to ensure that this institution is held to the highest possible ethical standards. We have before us a resolution, which, based on my experience in this House, is very poorly crafted. It is a resolution which creates the potential for all kinds of havoc. 
   I have been spending the last 40 minutes making a feeble attempt at trying to create some kind of legislative history as to how Members of this institution in the future are going to be treated, as our friends on other side of the aisle have rushed to the floor and tried to politicize this very, very important substantive issue. 
   They have done it. They have done it through the campaign process last fall, and I believe that we need to do what we can to put this measure before the Committee on Rules so we can, in fact, have a decent hearing on it. 
   I thank my friend for yielding.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Republican leader for yielding. 
   I would like to begin by engaging my very good friend and classmate, the distinguished majority leader, in a colloquy, if I might; and I would be happy to yield to him to respond. 
   Our Republican leader, Mr. Boehner, has just referred to the fact that, on May 1, we saw the appointment of the pool of those on the Ethics Committee who would in fact be responsible, or they will be impaneled to deal with this question, and he referred to the fact that we have gone for, really, almost the first half of this year without any action taking place. And as he correctly said, a decision was made to empanel that group on the majority side today. 
   We got the news yesterday of this very unfortunate indictment. I would just like to inquire of my friend exactly why it is that it took us this long to see action taken, when, in fact, so much other action was taken in the 109th Congress. 
   I would be happy to yield to my friend.

   Mr. DREIER. If I could reclaim my time, and I thank the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Speaker, for his comments and for being forthright in saying that they really don't have an answer in response to the fact that this has been open for literally months, this entire year. A very serious question was carried over from the 109th Congress to the 110th Congress, and I listened to my friend just a few minutes ago provide a great campaign speech about the message that was sent last November and the fact that we've got this great degree of openness and transparency and all, the likes of which didn't exist in past Congresses. 
   But I will say, Mr. Speaker, that I am really very troubled when I look at this resolution that as our Republican leader, Mr. Boehner, said was just provided to us. 
   Now, let me state very clearly for the record, this falls within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Rules. This has not been referred to the Rules Committee, and with our first look at it, again it was just handed to us, it would be an understatement to say that we're very troubled with the potential ramifications of what this resolution would do, Mr. Speaker. 
   One of the staff members just said to me, it would be possible that one of our Members could be protesting at the Sudanese Embassy. We know that there is a great deal of controversy and question around policy that takes place in Sudan as it relates to Darfur and other things, and conceivably if a Member of this institution were protesting and were arrested, it would have to be referred to the House Committee on Ethics, and they would be required to empanel an investigative committee to look at this or report back as to why it didn't take place. 
   In this resolution, it says any Federal or State court. I don't know if someone possibly might be exceeding the speed limit and pulled over and ticketed. I don't know whether or not that Member would have to be referred to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and see an investigative committee empaneled to investigate that speeding ticket. 
   The point that I am making, Mr. Speaker, is we continue to hear about this great new openness and transparency and the deliberative nature of this institution, when we have a resolution that the majority leader correctly has introduced, and he is certainly entitled to do that, to say it is to be referred to the Committee on Rules. Yet from what the majority leader has said, Mr. Speaker, we're scheduled to vote on this in just a matter of a few minutes, and we've just looked at this three-page measure, and those are the questions that we have initially that I would have certainly raised if we had had a hearing up in the Rules Committee on this measure. 
   Everyone wants to make sure that this institution is held to the highest possible ethical standard. I believe that we all sincerely want to do that.     
   The issue of ethics and lobbying reform and all has been greatly politicized by our friends in the majority; greatly politicized by our friends in the majority. We had a debate on this just before we adjourned before Memorial Day, and to me it was just outrageous to hear the kind of rhetoric that was used, pointing the finger of blame on this issue. 
   I think it is very sad. We are here responding to an indictment, the likes of which has not been seen for a Member in a long, long period of time, and I hope very much that as we do seek greater deliberation that we will take resolutions like this and run them through the regular order process.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (ECONOMIC ISOLATIONISM -- (House of Representatives - March 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, as the two Democratic contenders duke it out in the Presidential campaign, there's one issue that they both seem very eager to be identified with. And it's very unfortunate, it's the issue of economic isolationism. This kind of policy is as dangerous as it is inconsistent with their own rhetoric. 
   Both Democratic contenders like to talk about the need to enhance our Nation's image and increase our leadership in the international community. They talk about diplomacy and soft power, and then they turn around and insist we try to withdraw from the worldwide marketplace and cede our global economic leadership. It has even been suggested by them that we go back on a 14-year deal with our two closest neighbors, including our neighbor to the north who has been such a key political ally. 
   Perhaps this outlandish rhetoric is delivered with a wink and a nod. Perhaps it's merely an attempt to score a few political points without any intention to actually dismantle the deep economic and political ties that we share with our trading partners in this hemisphere. Frankly, I hope that that is the case. But either way, Madam Speaker, this is very dangerous rhetoric. 
   NAFTA has long been addressed by those running for office as though it were an unmitigated disaster; no one seems to want to touch it with a 10-foot pole. After all, everyone knows that NAFTA has hurt our economy and cost us millions of jobs. Right? Wrong. In 1994, when Bill Clinton sent NAFTA to the Congress, the gross domestic product in this country was $6.9 trillion. Today, we have a $14.1 trillion economy. In other words, we have more than doubled the size of our economy in the NAFTA-era. When adjusted for inflation, the numbers are still very striking, with 50 percent growth since 1994. During the same period, 25 million jobs have been created, while our labor force has grown by 18 million. 
   Fourteen years of NAFTA have seen our economy grow considerably while more Americans are working than ever before and new jobs have abounded. To put it bluntly, anyone who says that NAFTA has destroyed our economy is flat out wrong. Not only has the predicted ``giant sucking sound'' that we heard about during the NAFTA debate not come to pass, but the precise opposite has taken place. 
   But, Madam Speaker, NAFTA is just one component of the complex relationships that entail our global engagement, where the economic and the political are inextricably entwined, and nowhere is this role more critical than in our own neighborhood. We have spent years and countless resources promoting democracy in this hemisphere. The rise of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and his cohorts throughout the region have demonstrated that authoritarianism in our backyard is still a reality. As he sends troops to the border he shares with our friend and ally, Colombia, we are reminded that tyranny in our hemisphere still poses very grave threats. 
   NAFTA, CAFTA, the Peru Free Trade Agreement, and the proposed agreements with Colombia and Panama build upon the twin pillars of liberty: democratic governments and free markets. They enhance our economic strength with new opportunities and give us greater leverage to ensure that we have peaceful and prosperous neighbors. And we know that peace and prosperity, Madam Speaker, go hand in hand. 
   We simply cannot disengage economically without disengaging politically. Engagement through trade is our source of strength and our leadership, and we would disengage to our peril. Those who regard our leadership in the international community so casually that they would trash it for political gain threaten not only our own prosperity, but our ability to play a positive role in this hemisphere and around the globe as we seek to grow our economies and to grow the economies of our neighbors.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1257, SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Dallas and thank him for his superb management of this rule on our side. 
   As I listen to the arguments propounded by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, including the distinguished Chair of the committee, the conclusion that I have drawn here is, we have here a solution that is really looking for a problem. 
   I continue to hear great praise for the action that our former colleague Chris Cox, the now chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has taken in doing something that we regularly called for in this institution when it comes to our work here: transparency, disclosure, and accountability. 
   Under this regulation that has been promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, it calls for full disclosure of the compensation packages for the top five executives. What it means is, we are empowering shareholders and any other interested party with more information, with a better understanding of what it is that we are trying to deal with here. 
   So why now, after the Securities and Exchange Commission has done what the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Frank, has just said is actually going beyond what it is that we are doing, why do we need to take action here in this institution on this issue? 
   Now, while I know that my friend from Massachusetts and my friend from Alabama, the distinguished chairman of the committee and the ranking member, had this exchange on nonbinding resolutions and the impact that this might have, I think most have concluded that there is a very deleterious potential impact that this legislation could have; and that is, it quite possibly will dramatically enhance the number of potentially frivolous lawsuits being brought forward by shareholders. 
   Now, I find that very troubling in light of the fact that we have in a bipartisan way in the past been able to pass legislation which has been trying to focus on the tremendous cost burden that is imposed on the American consumers, shareholders, taxpayers, all the way across the board, with the number of frivolous lawsuits that we have seen. And, again, we want very much to see the market run its course on this issue. 
   I think that this is bad legislation. I think it is poorly crafted. And I think, again, based on the action that the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken, let's see how that works. Let's let it go into place. Let's let the entity  which has responsibility for this deal with it, see them work and see this information come forward, and see if we still have what is seen by many to be a problem. 
   I also argue that as we look at these compensation packages that have existed, and there are a heck of a lot more than any of us in this body make, that is for darn sure, but the fact of the matter is, these are decisions that boards of directors make. And one of the precious rights that we have as American citizens is the right not to own a stock. There is no one that I know on the face of the Earth who is compelled to purchase a share of stock, and I think that the right not to own a stock is a precious one. 
   And, you know, if I don't like the decision that the CEO of a company that I own a stock in or that the board of directors of that company makes, you know what, I will sell that stock. And I am happy to sell that stock, and that is my right to do it. If I don't like the decision that a board of directors has made, a decision that a board of directors has made when it comes to compensation for their executives, if that really is driving me and I am convinced that the stock should be much higher, I will sell it. So I believe that it is a real mistake for us to make this kind of overreach. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I also have to say that I am very troubled with what we are seeing here now as the new definition for rules that have come forward. Now, I entered into the Record of the Rules Committee last evening back to the 103rd Congress when our distinguished former colleague, Joe Moakley, was chairman of the committee and he had in his survey of activities of the Rules Committee the definition of rules. This rule that has come forward is defined as an open rule with a preprinting requirement, but, Mr. Speaker, it is much more than that.     
   Traditionally, an open rule that has a preprinting requirement has been known under Democratic and Republican Congresses as a modified open rule. Our colleagues, in their quest to say that they have had more and more open rules, have redefined what an open rule is, but the thing that troubles me is not just that they have done that. But they, by passage of this rule, have actually prevented Members of Congress from being able to participate in this under an open amendment process. 
   Why? The majority leader has apparently announced that we are going today to begin consideration of this shareholder bill, and then we are going to consider it on Friday. So what it means is, as we proceed with the amendment process today, Mr. Speaker, unfortunately what we are doing is we are saying to Members of the House of Representatives who want to amend this bill on Friday that any amendment that they might be offering had to have been printed in the Congressional Record last night, 3 days before the measure is considered on the floor, and they are trying to define that as an open amendment process. 
   Mr. Speaker, if it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it is a duck. And you know what? This is not an open rule. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule and to oppose the underlying legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Chairman, I share Mr. FLAKE's commitment to reducing government spending and making sure taxpayer dollars are spent in the most efficient and effective way possible. 
   I would also like to say that I am a strong proponent of making earmarks more transparent by attaching Members' names to their sponsored projects. My feeling all along has been that if a member is not willing to defend their earmark on the floor of the House, then it was probably not worth the money. That is why I was so gratified to see the Majority include projects and their supporters in each appropriations bill. Especially, so that no member has to guess whose district each of these projects is in. 
   So now, I welcome the opportunity to support Fairplex, a non-profit institution that contributes every day to our local community. Fairplex, located in Pomona, CA, represented by my friend and colleague GRACE NAPOLITANO is host to over 300 events each year, and 2 years ago, they had the privilege of hosting out-of-country voting for the historic Iraqi elections. There is $250,000 provided in this bill for the Trade and Conference Center, which is an incredibly important addition to the Fairplex that will provide small businesses with a venue to operate, share ideas, and grow. This project is a model of the Small Business Administration's mission of facilitating the environment necessary for America's small businesses to succeed. 
   Mr. Chairman, 43 percent of the goods coming to and from the consumers and workers of the United States of America come through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. One of the most important centers for trade, planning and strategic meetings has been held at the Fairplex. As we look at our quest of trying to open up new markets for U.S. goods and services all around the world and as we look at ensuring that American consumers can have access to the best quality product at the lowest possible price, the utilization of this trade and convention center is critically important. 
   As important as the issue of global trade is, I was really struck when the December before last, I had the opportunity to listen to a friend of mine who happened to be at the Fairplex Trade and Conference Center. I have shared this story before but it is worth reminding my colleagues. Leading up to the December 15, 2005 Iraqi elections, of the eight planned voting sites for the Iraqi people who are here in the United States of America, one of those had unfortunately and unexpectedly closed down. 
   And what happened? The people at the Fairplex Trade and Conference Center came forward, and literally at the drop of a hat, they were able to provide the chance for Iraqis who were in this country on that Election Day to exercise that right to vote. Their ability to be on the frontline to participate in the Global War on Terror is something that I believe is vitally important. 
   I was listening on the phone as applause went up every single time that a ballot was placed into that voting box, and it was a great moment. And as we look for continued progress in Iraq, I am reminded of each of those votes that were cast at the Fairplex Trade and Conference Center. This particular earmark is there helping us in the Global War on Terror and helping us remain competitive globally. 
   We in the House strive for Federal, State and local cooperation on a myriad of issues, from national security, to education to disaster response. Coordination and investment by all levels of government can give programs a much better chance for success. That is exactly what is happening at the Trade and Conference Center with all levels of government involvement and more important, private sector investment. It is worthy of this continued Federal partnership.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding and I appreciate his fine work. 
   It's no secret that there is a lot of controversy surrounding this issue of modernization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and everything that surrounds our effort to successfully prosecute this war on terror. We know that sacrifices have been made. We know that sacrifices continue to be made. And we're all very committed to the civil liberties of every single American. That's why I'm convinced that we are not going to take actions which will in any way undermine the civil liberties of our fellow Americans. 
   It is very important to note, Mr. Speaker, that as we look at this issue, there is a great deal of bipartisanship that exists. Unfortunately, it's not in this body. And I recognize that as the people's House we have a unique responsibility and we should not in any way become a rubber stamp for action taken by the other body. But I will say this. As we look at bipartisanship, it extends beyond our colleagues in the United States Senate. It does exist right here in the House, in that 21 Democrats signed a letter to the Speaker and made the specific request that we have a chance to vote on the proposal that is, in fact, the bipartisan compromise that did emerge from the Senate. We also have had a bipartisan group of attorneys general across the country who have indicated that they very much believe that we should proceed with taking the action that is embodied in that bipartisan compromise that has emerged from the Senate. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most important things that we should note is not simply bipartisanship but something that clearly transcends any kind of politics or partisanship, and that is the words that come from the Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell. And when I say that he transcends partisanship, I would like to remind our colleagues that this is a man who has spent four decades of his life working in the intelligence field. He was the head of the National Security Agency for President Bill Clinton, and he now serves as the Director of National Intelligence. 
   In testimony before the Judiciary Committee, he referred to the fact that there has been a 66 percent reduction, a two-thirds reduction in the amount of information that they need, that they should be able to glean in the intelligence area. And he has said that in his discussions and negotiations with those in the telecommunications industry that they will not be able to continue as they have in the past to help us prosecute this war if they don't have this immunity. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I think that one of the things that we in this debate on the rule are saying is that, let's just allow a vote on that bipartisan compromise, the so-called Rockefeller-Bond bill that emerged from the Senate. Sixty-eight Democrats and Republicans came together and agreed on it. And we had an interesting Rules Committee meeting, Mr. Speaker, in which we simply said, okay, we're going to have a chance to vote on the measure that will emerge from the majority, but why if as my very dear friend, the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, Mr. Conyers said, he said he wanted there to be an exchange of ideas, if there's going to be an exchange of ideas, let's at least allow our colleagues to have an up-or-down vote on that bipartisan compromise which embodies the above-partisan recommendations of the Director of National Intelligence, the bipartisan recommendations of the attorneys general across the country and simply say that we should have a chance to vote on it. It's very unfortunate that this rule denies Members of the House of Representatives the opportunity to have that vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote down this rule. We need to defeat this rule so that we can in fact have a package that will allow us to do everything we need as we pursue our very, very important responsibility, and that is to secure our Nation.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I wish to be heard on the gentleman's point of order. 
   I would just like to buttress the arguments that have been provided by my friend from Dallas. It was about 1 o'clock this morning that the Rules Committee convened, after having had this package for a half an hour. And I know my very dear friends on the Rules Committee, who probably haven't gotten a heck of a lot of sleep last night, remember very well that into the evening I had been handed by members of my staff a list of some of these hospitals that were specifically raised, that the concern that was raised by my friend from Dallas. And I've got to tell you that as I look at the hospitals in the Nashville, Davidson, Murfreesboro area in Cumberland County, Tennessee, and Marionette, Wisconsin and Michigan and Chicago and Massachusetts and New York, Clinton County, New York, we, Madam Speaker, don't understand what these are. 
   As my friend has just said, there are no names attached to this whatsoever. And we were promised this great new sense of openness and transparency and disclosure and accountability, and none of that has happened here. 
   And so I join my friend in saying that what we should probably do, if we are going to proceed here, is take a breather. I think that would be the right thing for us to do.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding and appreciate his very thoughtful remarks on this. 
   I was talking earlier about these earmarks that have been included in this measure that have no names attached to them whatsoever. They cover the States of Tennessee and Michigan and New York and other spots, and we don't have any comprehension of them, and I guess that's allowed. 
   Now, it wouldn't have been allowed in the last Congress, because when we passed earmark reform; Madam Speaker, let me just explain to my colleagues who may be a little confused on this, that when we passed earmark reform in September of last year we said that there should be full disclosure, a full listing, full transparency on all appropriations bills and on all tax bills and other authorizing legislation. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, unfortunately, when we came forward, and of course we were maligned for having passed that earmark reform in the last Congress, but when we finally came forward and rectified the structure that allowed people to only send a letter to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee if they wanted to raise concern, but they had no ability whatsoever to raise concern or raise a point of order on the House floor about an earmark, we saw that, finally agreed to it. 
   But guess what, Madam Speaker? 
   Unfortunately, the authorizing legislation including tax bills was completely omitted, completely omitted from this transparency plan that we had in the 109th Congress. And so that's, I guess, why it's allowed to include all of these hospitals in this measure without having any names attached to them, without any opportunity whatsoever to raise questions about them; and so I continue to support the effort of my friend here.

   Mr. DREIER. ``Madam Speaker, this rule is an affront to the democratic process. The underlying bill will harm every single one of the 40 million Americans served by Medicare. At 1 a.m. this morning, with absolutely no meaningful opportunity to review the almost 700-page legislation, the Committee on Rules met to consider the resolution now before us. By now I should be used to it, but we cannot tolerate these continual attacks on democracy. 
   ``When you refuse to allow half this House to speak and to give their amendments, you are cutting out half of the population of the United States from any participation in the legislation that goes on here. It defies reason and it defies common sense that political expediency and newspaper headlines could force this monumental legislation, probably the most monumental that any of us will do in our tenure in the Congress of the United States, to force it through the Chamber with little more than cursory consideration.'' 
   Madam Speaker, as eloquent as that statement was, it wasn't mine. That statement that I just read was in fact the statement delivered right here on the floor on June 26, 2003, by the now distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, my very good friend from Rochester, New York (Ms. Slaughter). 
   It was offered during the debate on the Medicare prescription drug bill and the modernization act which passed and has provided access to affordable prescription drugs for seniors for the past several years. 
   Madam Speaker, if these words that I just offered from the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee from back in 2003 were true then, they certainly are true now. 
   As Mr. Sessions said, last night, the Rules Committee met for 2 1/2 hours in  the dark of night to try to figure out the intricacies of this bill, just shortly after we as Republicans, the minority, received the final text. What became clear last night is even the authors aren't clear about the effects of this legislation. 
   We had an in-depth discussion about specialty hospitals and whether this bill would deprive 150,000 constituents, our friend from Pasco, Washington (Mr. Hastings), a hardworking member of the Rules Committee, 150,000 of his constituents, whether or not it would prevent them from having access to hospital care. 
   First, our witnesses said, no, it wouldn't. Then they said, yes, it would. Then they said the hospital deserved to be closed because the physicians who own the hospital and serve that community were trying to ``get away with something.'' 
   Now that is the round-and-about discussion we had on what is taking place in eastern Washington. That is just one isolated issue. You can just imagine how many more there are in this monstrosity of a bill. And the majority's answer to that question: Deny all amendments. Prevent anyone from having an opportunity to improve the bill. 
   Yes, Madam Speaker, we have the latest manifestation of the new Democratic philosophy described so eloquently in the Rules Committee last week. It was declared by one of our Rules Committee colleagues: If you have a problem with a bill, then no amendments for you. It is a circular logic at its worst. 
   I feel compelled to point out that even on the much-maligned Medicare prescription drug legislation that we had, we gave the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) a substitute. What do we get on this bill, in a word, we got absolutely nothing. No substitute, nothing. 
   Madam Speaker, there was no need to bring this bill before the Rules Committee at 1 a.m. this morning. The chairwoman of the Rules Committee began the 110th Congress by stressing that we would end the committee's so-called ``California hours'' that I imposed on them and have our meetings in the daylight. Well, I have to say, Madam Speaker, at 2:30 this morning the sun was not out. I have to say that this measure is one that clearly we support, SCHIP, but not this very undemocratic process and this horrible measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my California colleague and congratulate him on his stellar leadership on this and a wide range of other issues. 
   As I came to the floor just as our colleague the distinguished majority leader, the gentleman from Maryland, was addressing this House and he talked about politicization of statements that have been made, I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, when Saddam Hussein was toppled, it was not a celebration of one political party over another. It was not even a celebration just of Americans. It was a global celebration over the fact that we took this butcher who had murdered literally hundreds of thousands of his people, and we brought his reign of terror to an end, and that was worth celebrating. 
   Now, what we saw yesterday was nothing but partisanship because we know there is a real divide here. We know that the country is divided, and we know and the President of the United States, Mr. Speaker, has acknowledged that mistakes have been made, and we have gone through real difficulty. 
   I also heard the majority leader talk about the fact that there is no definition of victory. Mr. Speaker, it has been very clear from the beginning victory consists of two factors that are very important. First, we need to make sure that we have an Iraqi military force, the ISF, the Iraqi security force, able to defend the country, and we need to make sure that there is a government that can govern the country. 
   Those are the two items that have been placed forward. That is all we  want. We have seen self-determination take place with three elections that have taken place in Iraq. We have seen, I believe, positive news come forward. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, we constantly hear people describe this as the Bush plan. We hear the litany of others, and as my friend from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) just said, we know that the President is not terribly popular. The President knows that he is not very popular. He likes to say everyone likes to be loved, but I would rather be right than be loved. 
   So we know that the President obviously does not have a high approval rating right now, but he is doing the right thing. He is doing the right thing, and I believe, Mr. Speaker, that this goal is a very valiant one and a very, very important one for us to pursue. We have to bring about some kind of bipartisan resolution. 
   I am very pleased to have indications come from our friends on the other side of the aisle about the fact that we are going to provide important funding for our troops. We have to do that. That is absolutely essential, but we need to realize that we are in the midst of a new strategy. 
   I had the opportunity to talk with my good friend Mr. Murtha, the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, the other day, and we agree that we have got to come to some kind of bipartisan resolution of this. 
   But the important point that needs to be made, as we hear the names of these unpopular people, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, Bush, thrown out there, we have to realize again that this is a new strategy, and this is the Petraeus plan. It was Dave Petraeus who last week said, before a large bipartisan gathering of Members, that Iraqis today are fighting and dying for their country. And it was Dave Petraeus who said, let us have until September, at which time I will report back with my colleagues to the President of the United States and the Congress. 
   I talked to, just day before yesterday, a very strong supporter of Mr. Kerry's when he was running for President, a strong, committed Democrat, and he said that he believed that establishing some sort of artificial timeline would be wrong. 
   The President described it last night following issuance of his veto that it clearly would be a prescription for defeat, and I believe that we need to make sure that, again, as Dave Petraeus said, since Iraq is the central front in the battle against al Qaeda, we need to keep it there. 
   Mr. Speaker, sustain this President's veto. Let's come together and provide the necessary funding for our men and women in uniform.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   I congratulate both the majority leader and the distinguished minority whip for recognizing especially those of us who are in California. 
   I have a whole series of meetings that I am going to be holding in California in the next couple of days, and it has been virtually impossible to hold any kind of weekday meeting with constituents because of the challenges that we have faced over the past month. 
   And I know that our 3-hour workdays and then the half hour on a Friday have made it important to note that we have been working here, but it has made it virtually impossible to be able to hold, as I said, any weekday meetings in California. 
   I would like to just raise a question, Mr. Speaker, to the distinguished majority leader about the issue of the schedule for next week. Now, it is my understanding that the legislation that we are scheduled to consider in the Rules Committee may come up under an open amendment process, allowing us an opportunity to have amendments proposed on the floor. The thing that concerns me is that while we have had a wide range of measures brought to the floor under suspension of the rules, I have looked back at this legislation that we are going to be addressing next week, and while it will be wonderful to have an open amendment process, it will be great if that, in fact, is going to be decided by the Rules Committee, it will be a wonderful thing to be seeing, but the fact is when this legislation was last considered, it was considered under suspension of the rules and passed unanimously without a recorded vote. A voice vote, in fact, was all that was necessary. 
   So I will, just for the record, Mr. Speaker, say to the distinguished majority leader, and I thank the distinguished minority whip for yielding to me, that I am concerned about the notion of utilizing an open amendment process on a matter that is noncontroversial and very easily could be considered under suspension of the rules if it is being done solely for the purpose of saying, aha, we have moved beyond closed rules and we are now considering issues under an open amendment process when, in fact, there may not even be any amendments proposed because when this last came before us, it was considered under suspension of the rules. 
   I thank my friend for yielding, and if you would like to yield to the majority leader to respond.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to say to the majority leader that I didn't bring up the issue of process, but since my very good friend and classmate from Maryland did bring up the issue of process, pointing to the fact that an amendment was made in order even when that Member did not want to have the amendment made in order, which was clearly stated in a letter that was submitted to the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee, recognizing that that was an unprecedented move, because I will tell you, having served as chairman 
   of the Rules Committee, time and time again, we would have Members testify before the Rules Committee, making a request that amendments be made in order, and then we would get a letter from that Member asking that that amendment be withdrawn, and every time we would immediately disseminate that. 
   So the only reason that there was a great deal of consternation on the issue that my friend has raised is that the action that was taken by the Rules Committee was completely unprecedented. In fact, in all the research that we did, we were never able to find any instance that ever before, under either the Democratic majority or the Republican majority, had action like that been taken. So that led us to be concerned. Similarly, as we look at the prospect of moving ahead with very important legislation that passed unanimously without any amendment, I would simply say, Mr. Speaker, that to simply use, as the distinguished minority whip has said, that as an argument to say we provided open rules is, I think, a little bit of a stretch.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule. We keep hearing that every time this has come before us it has been considered under a closed rule. A closed rule is the norm for this. The fact of the matter is, in 1987 is the last time that we considered a year-long CR that would have allowed for consideration of the entire budget. 
   Guess what? It was under a Democratic Congress, and at that time they made eight amendments in order. Since that time, we considered short-term continuing resolutions, and they have been done under unanimous consent, they have been done under suspension of the rules. But it is a complete mischaracterization to say every time we consider something like this it has been done under a closed rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, at some point, at some point, and I don't know when that will be, the Democratic leadership is going to run out of excuses as to why they deny both Democrats and Republicans, Democrats and Republicans, the opportunity to participate in the process. 
   First, it was, we promised to get the Six for '06 done in 100 hours. We considered a lot of this stuff in the last Congress. Then it was, well, this is the same rule that was considered back in the 103rd Congress. Now it is, well, this is your mess, Republicans, and we have to clean it up. 
   The fact of the matter is, the argument that our friends on the other side of the aisle have continued to make over and over and over again is shutting out more than half of the American people. As I say, it is shutting out the opportunity for both Democrats and Republicans to participate in the process. 
   We offered 21 amendments, very thoughtful amendments, that would have taken $44.5 million, $44.5 million, that is utilized right now for rain forest education in Iowa and transfer that spending to help provide desperately needed assistance to the war wounded. These are the kinds of priorities that we have set forward, Mr. Speaker. Tragically, this process has denied us to help the war wounded over those who want to focus attention on rain forest education in Iowa. 
   Oppose this rule and oppose this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (CONDEMNING THE NOVEMBER 6, 2007, TERRORIST BOMBING IN AFGHANISTAN -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. It is with a great deal of sadness that I rise in support of this resolution. 
   Our colleagues, Messrs. Faleomavaega, Bilirakis and Price, have very adequately outlined the circumstances around which this attack took place on November 6. But if there is one message that has come forward from the tragedy of a week ago, it is that if there is any doubt whatsoever that our enemies in Afghanistan are seeking to undermine democracy, liberalization and the cause of peace for the Afghan people, one needs look no further than what took place on November 6. This was a very sophisticated attack that took place, and it is one by those who clearly do want to undermine everything that we as Americans take for granted and for which the Afghan people aspire. 
   My dear friend and colleague Mr. Price has correctly pointed to the fact that just last week we had the opportunity as members of the House Democracy Assistance Commission to meet with our counterparts, members of the Wolesi Jirga, who have in many ways modeled their Parliament, their House of Representatives, after ours. 
   I know that we are not always the best model for everything. We are in fact a model to which many around the world, including the Afghan people and members of the Afghan Parliament, aspire. And that is why, as Mr. Price has correctly said, if anyone believes that this attack that took place on November 6 would in any way, in any way, diminish the commitment of the United States Congress and our 20-member bipartisan House Democracy Assistance Commission to our assistance to the Afghan people and to the future of peace, stability, democracy and political and economic liberalization in Afghanistan, they are wrong. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the tragedy of one week ago, on November 6, in my mind, stands to reaffirm and strengthen the commitment of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. 
   Now, while Mr. Price went through and talked about naming the six parliamentarians who tragically were killed and, as was pointed out, 50 people killed and many, many people wounded, I think it is important to note that Sayed Mustafa Kazemi was in fact a very bright 45-year-old leader who has, through his career, been responsible for bringing together a wide range of very, very diverse interests within Afghanistan. As Mr. Price pointed to the diversity that exists  within the Wolesi Jirga, it is important to note that Mr. Kazemi was in fact, if not the paramount leader, one of the top leaders in bringing these very diverse groups together.     
   Now, this delegation was in the Baghlan province doing their work, as we as Members of the House of Representatives do our work when we have delegations going to visit and work on different projects. This was the Economics Commission. As Mr. Price said, we had seen Mr. Kazemi as the head of the Economics Commission in the past. These were members of the Wolesi Jirga, parliamentarians just as we are, working on the project of trying to bring about greater reform and success to the people of Afghanistan. And to have them attacked in such a way is something that will in fact go down in history. 
   My friend from North Carolina said this was the worst attack to take place since the Taliban has come to power. Mr. Speaker, just today the British Broadcasting Corporation reported that the attack on November 6 was the single worst attack and the largest loss of life in the history of Afghanistan. Never before has such a large number of people been killed in an attack such as this. 
   So that is why I am very pleased that Mr. Price asked me to join with him working on this resolution. That is why we stand together, Democrats and Republicans, reaffirming our commitment to the future of Afghanistan. We know it was September 11 of 2001 and the attacks that emerged from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, support for that effort, and al Qaeda that led to the work that we have done in Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, we remain committed. Our resolve is in fact strengthened by this tragedy. I urge my colleagues to join in support of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2831, LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my good friend from Worcester for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. And I rise in strong opposition to the rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, discrimination is wrong. And I, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, are horrified, absolutely horrified at the thought of discrimination taking place. And like Lilly Ledbetter, we want to ensure, as she very selflessly said, that as we look to future instances of potential discrimination, that no one is ever treated as she was.     
   But I will say that this rule and the underlying legislation are a very, very bad signal in our attempt to address this question. 
   From a substantive point, this bill is only the most recent salvo in the Democratic majority's assault on entrepreneurship and the competitiveness of the U.S. economy. From a process standpoint, this bill continues their assault on this institution and, by virtue of that, the rights of the American people. 
   After a campaign last November that was founded on a commitment to openness, deliberativeness and responsible legislating, this bill and the process by which it has been addressed are just another example, another addition to the ever-growing list of broken promises that have been made to the American people. 
   In crafting the underlying bill, the Democratic leadership all but abandoned the committee process itself. It shunned the input of experts, raced to bring their shoddy, sloppy work to the House floor, and shut down, by virtue of what we are doing, any possibility of meaningful debate by denying any amendments whatsoever. 
   Mr. Speaker, the most unfortunate part is that far from being an anomaly, this process, as was evidenced by the last rule that we just debated, is emblematic of what this Democratic majority has been doing. 
   Now, as my friend, the gentleman from Dallas (Mr. Sessions), said in management of the last rule that was just before us, the Democratic majority has considered twice as many measures under closed rules as the Republican had by this point, July 30, in the last Congress. 
   I say that because we, as Republicans, were constantly maligned and berated because we had closed rules. Yes, we did have closed rules. Some were warranted. Do you know what, Mr. Speaker? We may have overreached in some of the closed rules that we had. But I find it very interesting that as we saw that level of criticism leveled at the Republican majority, a promise was made to the American people that there would be greater openness and opportunity for more deliberation and a degree of accountability the likes of which did not exist when Republicans were in charge. 
   What is it that has happened, Mr. Speaker? We now have twice as many closed rules as we had at this point, July 30, at the beginning of the last Congress. 
   This rule seems to keep up that new philosophy that the Democratic majority has articulated more than once last week in the Rules Committee. The statement was as follows: if you don't support the bill, you shouldn't be given the opportunity to amend it. If you don't support the bill, you shouldn't be given an opportunity to amend it. That is what has regularly been propounded by our colleagues upstairs in the Rules Committee. 
   Apparently, you have to be a ``yes man'' if you want to have an opportunity to be heard or participate in the legislative process. You have to make an absolute commitment that you are going to support the legislation if you want to have a chance to improve it. That is exactly what happened in an exchange with the distinguished former chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, the now ranking member, my California colleague, Mr. McKeon. 
   Of course, they tried to conceal their bad policy and sloppy work by claiming this bill is about ending discrimination in the workplace. As I said, we all want to ensure that we end discrimination in the workplace. We are all horrified by any instance of discrimination in the workplace. They claim that it is about righting wrongs, that the Supreme Court overturned long-settled protections in the Ledbetter case and that this bill simply restores the proper legal precedent. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, those claims are patently false. This bill would introduce utter chaos into the courts. Utter chaos. It is so vaguely and so poorly constructed that it would open the floodgates of dubious, dubious claims and frivolous lawsuits. 
   The distinguished ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee simply tried again to offer an amendment that would have dealt with this vagueness and that would have addressed the sloppy assembly of this legislation. And because he didn't make a commitment that he would support the legislation at the end of the day, he was denied, as was every other Member who wanted to have an opportunity to amend the legislation, they were denied a chance to do that. 
   The result of what it is that they are doing would be to obfuscate real cases of discrimination. Again, we want to ensure that any instance of discrimination is addressed. But what they are doing here, Mr. Speaker, would obfuscate real cases of discrimination and cripple business owners, who are the job creators in our economy. 
   Now, this may be a trial lawyer's dream, but it would be a nightmare for any small business owner, not to mention anyone with a legitimate case of workplace discrimination 
   Again, we want anyone who has a legitimate case of workplace discrimination to be able to come forward and to  address that grievance. Obviously, preventing discrimination and punishing it when it happens are critical goals of our labor laws. We all share a commitment to combating discriminatory treatment of any worker. It is precisely with this goal in mind that our laws have been designed to deal with discrimination in a timely and expeditious way. No one benefits when we allow violations to continue on indefinitely with a completely open-ended potential for years or decades to go by before the issue is addressed. 
   Virtually no statute of limitations at all is the potential problem with this legislation. By the same token, Mr. Speaker, we have to guard against an unlimited window for the introduction of those claims. As I said, frivolous, unfounded complaints are already a huge drain and take focus away from the very legitimate and important cases that are out there. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found reasonable cause last year in a mere 5.3 percent of the 75,000 complaints it received. Again, I believe that Lilly Ledbetter was absolutely right when she talked about the need to ensure that those who face discrimination in the future, in fact, do have an opportunity to have their wrong righted. 
   The EEOC, by its own numbers, receives 20 times as many unreasonable complaints as legitimate claims. Let me say that again: the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has stated that they receive 20 times as many unreasonable complaints as legitimate claims. Furthermore, it found absolutely no cause whatsoever in over 60 percent of the cases that have been brought forward. This means that a large majority of its work is already wasted in investigating entirely unfounded complaints. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, the tragic thing is that with this legislation, the waste and abuse will increase exponentially. We have already seen the impact of frivolous lawsuits on competitiveness of American entrepreneurs and business owners. I am sure we have all read about the District of Columbia, the D.C. ``pants suit,'' the family-owned dry cleaner that faced a $67 million lawsuit over a pair of pants. That family has been nearly ruined by hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal bills, even though they won their case. This is the ultimate nightmare for any business owner, let alone the small family-run business that bolsters our economy and our communities, as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill protects neither those who suffer from discrimination nor the innocent who are wrongly accused. Furthermore, the claim that long-held and long-settled legal precedent was reversed by the Ledbetter ruling is utterly spurious. The very plaintiff, the alleged victim in this case, Mrs. Ledbetter, asserted her case based in part on the wildly disparate rulings on the legal matter at issue in her lawsuit. Her attorneys argued to the Supreme Court that there was ``considerable conflict and confusion.'' Again, in arguing on her behalf before the United States Supreme Court, her attorney said that there was ``considerable conflict and confusion.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, what is more, this legislation goes far beyond the limited scope of the Ledbetter case, far beyond that case. While that case dealt solely with the issue of intentional discrimination, the underlying bill expressly removes this distinction and in fact opens the floodgates on nonintentional disparate impact discrimination cases as well. The bill's authors admit as much in their own committee report. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, when the Democratic majority claims this bill simply restores the precedent that was reversed by the Supreme Court, they are wrong. When they claim this bill will give greater protection to those who suffer from workplace discrimination, they are wrong. 
   This bill is wildly ill conceived, based on specious claims. It would turn discrimination litigation into the Wild West of jurisprudence. It would inflict irreparable harm on countless businesses and take precious resources away from real cases of discrimination. 
   I will say again, Mr. Speaker, we want to do everything that we can to ensure that everyone who is victimized has their opportunity to be heard. But this legislation would take the resources to allow that to happen away from those who really face discrimination. 
   Unfortunately, but predictably, this is the kind of bad policy that inevitably comes from bad process. By irresponsibly and hastily throwing this legislation together, the Democratic majority has concocted a bill that would accomplish none of what they claim it will. Instead, it would unleash a flood of unintended consequences that will hurt the very people they purport to help. They will be hurting the workers of this country. They will be hurting the people that they purport to help. Once again, that sloppy work has produced very, very dangerous policy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, and, just as was the case in the last measure, I am going to, as Mr. Sessions did, encourage a ``no'' vote on the previous question. Why? So that we will be able to do something that I know they will argue, as Ms. Castor did when we were debating the last rule, is completely unrelated. 
   What it is we are going to offer if we are able to defeat the previous question is a chance for us to take steps to ensure that terrorists do not have the tools to kill Americans. By that, I mean we are hoping, if we can defeat the previous question, to ensure that the very thoughtful legislation that has been introduced by our colleague from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson) will be able to be considered. 
   What does that do? It finally gives us a chance to modernize the nearly three-decade-old, very antiquated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. We have seen such tremendous, tremendous changes in technology. On a daily basis we see that. We all know about those changes. Moore's Law made it very clear that you see in a 6-month period all kinds of equipment being outdated and antiquated. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, we have seen terrorists have the ability to take advantage of the tremendous changes, and all we are asking is that the recommendations that have been put forward by the Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, by the Director of the CIA, Mike Hayden, by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, that we see a chance for the concerns that they have understandably raised on the inability to make sure that we can monitor the actions of foreigners in foreign countries, that we have the ability to do that. That is all we are asking. 
   I am going to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question, Mr. Speaker, so we will be able to make that in order, and to ensure that as we look at this legislative process and move forward, that we don't continue with this very, very dangerous pattern that we have had. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to join with my colleague from Santa Barbara in saying that we are absolutely committed to doing every that we possibly can to ensure that there is no case of discrimination when it comes to the issue of equal pay for equal work. Obviously we want to do everything possible to make sure that someone like Ms. Ledbetter, who I believe was wronged, does not face this kind of difficulty in the future. That is exactly what Ms. Ledbetter said she wants to have happen. 
   The problem is this bill has been so poorly put together it creates the potential to actually impinge on the ability of people to bring cases forward. While my friend from Worcester talked about the issue of the Congressional Budget Office's analysis and the lack of an increase in cases, if you look at the mere fact that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has said that 60 percent of their cases do not warrant even moving forward, and that is why this creates the potential for even more of these horrible cases, based on the arguments that have been brought forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Dallas (Mr. Sessions), my hardworking colleague on the Rules Committee.

   I am going to be exchanging, engaging in a colloquy with my friend from Albuquerque. I was just talking with her about the rule and the underlying legislation. She said to me, as we get ready to talk about our quest to address the previous question issue, that she wanted to offer some thoughts.

   Mr. DREIER. Reclaiming my time, I would like to actually say that clearly the gentleman from Santa Clarita (Mr. McKeon) is going to be about talking about this issue, assuming we do move to the bill. 
   But I will say that we are going to, as we did in the case of the last bill, seek to defeat the previous question so that we will have a chance to deal with an issue that is critically important, critically important to the security of the United States of America and our allies. 
   We, for literally months, have been saying that we need to take the very antiquated, 1978, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and have a chance, have a chance to improve and update that so that we could bring that three-decade old legislation into the 21st century with the tremendous technological changes that have taken place. 
   We have been imploring Members of this House to move legislation so that those who are in the intelligence field, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Homeland Security, will simply have the opportunity, have the opportunity to monitor foreigners on foreign soil without going through the long process of seeking a court order to not, not in any way, engage on the monitoring of telephone conversations of Americans, but of terrorists on foreign soil who want to kill us. 
   Mr. Speaker, since my colleague from Albuquerque has authored legislation, we will seek, if we can get our colleagues to vote against the previous question, to make this critically important legislation in order, rather than waiting until, rather than waiting until after the August recess. 
   Tragically, we have just gotten news that the scheduled briefing for the Intelligence Committee that was to be provided at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning by the Director of National Intelligence has just been postponed until after the August recess, more than a month from now. I believe that we have created some very serious problems here. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield further to my colleague for some remarks on this.

   I would just like to inquire of my friend, as she began this explanation of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, as it is called, as we look at where we were in 1978, the way she has just explained it is that if you look at the fact that what we are trying to do is ensure that we can go after foreigners in foreign countries to ensure that we are protected, why in the world would we in any way want to actually restrict our ability to go after foreigners in foreign countries who are terrorists and trying to do us in? We are today restricted because of the existence of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act from doing that?

If the gentlewoman would further yield, Mr. Speaker, I know that the goal that Mr. Sessions has just put forward here is the one that managers in the minority in the past have, and that is we are urging all of our colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we will be able to take the very thoughtful piece of legislation that the gentlewoman from New Mexico has introduced and make that in order. After delaying for months and months and months, after these warnings that have come not only from Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, but from the Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary Chertoff, who has talked about the fact that the chatter level is unusually high, and we all know that he said that rather famously in an interview before the editorial board of the Chicago Tribune, so we have continued to receive these warnings; yet because of the fact that this Congress has failed to act on our need to update that nearly 30-year-old law when we have seen such dramatic changes take place in technology over the past three decades, we have been forced to this position where we have to continually try to urge our colleagues to defeat the previous question so that we can make this legislation in order.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON H.R. 2419, FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this motion. 
   My friend has outlined very clearly exactly where we are. And I will tell you from the perspective of the House Rules Committee, while we have not been enthusiastic supporters of this PAYGO procedure, I will say that while my friend used the tax analogy, as I listened to the exchange between the distinguished Republican whip and the majority leader, I couldn't help but think about the gasoline price issue. It would be tantamount to one of our constituents or any of us being able to go up to a gas pump and say, ``You know what? I'd like to pay the price of gasoline as it was 6 months ago as opposed to where it is today.'' This is not the way this should be done. 
   I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to come together in support of this motion.  
   I rise in support of this motion. We don't actually know what's in the Farm Bill Conference Report, because the Conference Report has yet to be finalized, which is precisely why we are here seeking to instruct the conferees on the part of the House. But if press reports are accurate, the Conference Report could be in violation of clause 10 of Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, known as the PAYGO rule. Now, I am not a supporter of the PAYGO rule. Ostensibly it is intended to impose fiscal discipline--a worthy goal that I share. But in reality it does nothing more than mandate tax increases. If the Democratic Leadership were to recognize this reality and propose a rule change to eliminate PAYGO, I'd support it. So far, they have not yet recognized the error of their ways, and PAYGO is a rule of the House. 
   At issue here is the number that is used as the baseline for determining deficit neutrality. The rules of the House are unambiguous. The most current baseline estimate must be used. Clause 10 of Rule XXI provides: ``the effect of a measure on the deficit or surplus shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget relative to the most recent baseline supplied by the Congressional Budget Office.'' 
   This does, after all, make perfect sense. If out-of-date and irrelevant numbers can be used, the rule would be a complete farce, even to those who support it in principle. In the case of the Farm Bill, the most up-to-date estimate was released on March 3, 2008. And yet it has been rumored that the Farm Bill's authors may choose to use the fiscal year 2007 numbers. 
   This would be akin to pulling up to the gas station and rather than having to pay the current 2008 price of $3.62 per gallon, you tell the gas station attendant that that price doesn't apply to you, and you get to pay the 2007 price of $2.97. 
   If Democrats insist on following this path, their bill will be in violation of PAYGO. And if the Rules Committee chooses to waive PAYGO, I suspect they would have trouble garnering enough support to pass such a rule within their own caucus. While the Democratic Leadership has proven they have no qualms about breaking House rules, or circumventing them altogether, a number of their Members are committed to the current incarnation of PAYGO. The Democratic Leadership knows that failure to comply with this rule is a non-starter for a large bloc of their caucus. 
   So if their solution was to simply cook the books, pretend their bill was PAYGO compliant, and hope no one noticed, then I'm sorry to say, we noticed. To all of my colleagues who support PAYGO, and to all of my colleagues who oppose PAYGO but also oppose budget gimmickry and backroom deals to thwart the rules of the House, I urge you to join me in supporting this motion. Let's send the Farm Bill conferees a strong message that a budgetary shell game will not get them their 218 votes. And let's send a message to the Democratic Leadership that they can't piously claim to follow the rules, while perpetrating an end-run around them.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I thank my very good friend from California, the ranking member of this very important Trade Subcommittee, and I congratulate my good friend from Michigan for moving forward this very important 10-month extension. 
   Obviously, it is clear that we are using this time to talk about the importance of coming together in a bipartisan way, working as Democrats and Republicans, to ensure that we are able to proceed to deal with both the economic as well as the national security implications of ultimately seeing us put into place the Colombian Free Trade Agreement. 
   One of the great misconceptions around here and one that unfortunately has been spread very widely, Madam Speaker, is the fact that many people say that the Government of Colombia has been involved in killing labor leaders. I have heard that said on many occasions. I think it is very unfortunate that that and things close to that have gotten out there, when in fact we have seen since 2002 a 50 percent increase in the level of funding for the Fiscalia, the entity spending a great deal of time prosecuting those who have been responsible for killings of those labor leaders. 
   Similarly, it is important to note that there are roughly 1,500 labor leaders who get protection provided by the Government of Colombia. They are working to ensure the safety of those labor leaders, number one; and, number two, they are working to ensure that they bring to justice those who might be responsible for any of those killings. 
   There is no desire on the part of the government to do that. The government has done everything it possibly can to demobilize the paramilitaries, the FARC, the ELN and others who have been involved in the narcotrafficking and other criminal activity that has taken place in the country. 
   There is no nation on the face of the Earth that in a 5-year period of time has gone through a greater transition than Colombia has, and the leadership of President Uribe and so many others in his country who are dedicated to the future of that nation have, I believe, laid the groundwork for us to ensure the strength of the relationship between our two countries and to deal with the national security implications. 
   I have to say in closing, Madam Speaker, that I truly do believe that this will help us stabilize this very important part of the Western Hemisphere.

<TEXT>
    Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I have always been a strong supporter of the Andean Trade Preference Act. These preferences have been critical in encouraging both development and liberalization in a key region. But as we look at where each of the four Andean nations stands today, we see that they are all at very different stages, with preferences having significance for different reasons. 
    Peru is a country that has made tremendous strides in its economic liberalization process while remaining a close political ally, and we have propelled our trade relationship forward through ratification of a free trade agreement (FTA). As we go through the implementation process, preferences are still necessary to provide continuity until the agreement is fully realized. But Peru has clearly graduated beyond one-sided preferences, and our engagement will only grow exponentially. 
    In the case of Colombia, once again, this is a country that has made outstanding progress on economic and political fronts, and has negotiated an FTA with us in good faith. We have left this agreement in limbo for far too long, and should vote to pass it immediately. I have supported repeated extensions of our preference system for Colombia, because it would be unfair to punish them for our inability to make progress. But this is a critical agreement that will help to lock in great gains, and we cannot afford to allow the U.S.-Colombia FTA to languish any longer. 
    Bolivia and Ecuador, however, have not made the great progress in liberalization that their neighbors have. Our trade preferences in these two countries are critically important, but for very different reasons. It is important for us to continue to engage with them, to encourage both economic and political liberalization. Preferences can help workers in these countries reach that first rung of the economic ladder. And with new opportunities come rising living standards, and momentum for greater reform. 
    However, there can be no progress without the rule of law. Both countries are facing great challenges on this front, with justice systems that are unable--or perhaps at times even unwilling--to uphold the law and create an environment that supports free markets and accountable governments. In some instances, there have been egregious abuses in the courts, punishing those who have invested in the economy and creating a powerful deterrent to other prospective investors. Both Bolivia and Ecuador have much to gain by focusing on strengthening the rule of law, and much to lose by neglecting to do so. Without an improved legal environment, our trade preferences will be of little value. 
    Furthermore, failure in this regard will erode support in Congress for preferences altogether. I believe the fact that we are considering only a ten-month extension of the program is a reflection, in part, of grave concerns  that many Members hold for the direction Bolivia and Ecuador are heading. It is my hope that ten months from now, when we again address the issue of preferences for the Andean countries, we will be witnessing a renewed commitment in these two countries for the reform and liberalization that are essential to eliminating poverty and improving the standard of living for every Bolivian and Ecuadorian.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Dallas for yielding, and I want to buttress his argument, which is a very clear one. Obviously, we want to ensure that every American pays their fair share of taxes. 
   We have had a dramatic increase in collection success by virtue of this program, and here we are gutting it because a very small group of people seems to oppose it. It happens to be union opposition. 
   As a taxpayer, I pay my fair share of taxes. I want to make sure that every other American pays their fair share of taxes, and that is exactly what this 10-year-old program has done, and has done with success. 
   Mr. Speaker, I really am very, very puzzled as we begin today with the debate on two rules that will lead to legislation being considered here on the House floor. The reason I am perplexed is we are dealing with two very important issues. 
   The majority leadership clearly has its right and its responsibility to move their agenda. They want to do what they are planning to do now on this issue of private sector collection of taxes, and they want to dramatically expand housing programs. Those are the two things that the majority is planning to move to the floor today. But I just don't understand, Mr. Speaker. I just don't understand why it is that we are doing what we are doing. 
   My friend from California, Mr. Cardoza, just described how the Rules Committee was run when I had the privilege of serving as chairman of the committee. He said we have what is a customary closed rule, I think is the term that he used. Is that the term? I would be happy to yield to my friend.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3056, TAX COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for clarifying that. He described it as a traditional closed rule. 
   I will say that it is true that on tax bills both parties recognize that the notion of completely opening up a Tax Code measure in the Ways and Means Committee is not the wisest thing to do, so neither party has done that. 
   But I will tell you this, Mr. Speaker: We, when we were in the majority, regularly ensured that the ranking minority member, Mr. Rangel, had a substitute that he could offer. In fact, on numerous occasions we offered Mr. Rangel the chance to propose a sight-unseen substitute to measures that were coming forward, and I will admit, I will admit that on occasion, but a very rare occasion, we did not provide that substitute to Mr. Rangel. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will say when that happened, Mr. Rangel clearly let us know how unhappy he was that he did not have a substitute. 
   We all know that at the beginning of this Congress we had this document put forward by the new majority called ``a New Direction for America.'' In this document, the item titled ``Regular Order For Legislation'' under ``A Congress Working For All Americans,'' paragraph 2 reads as follows, Mr. Speaker. It says, ``Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate, consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the rights to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.'' This is the commitment that was made to the American people under ``A New Direction for America.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I recognize that having a completely open rule on a measure that emerges from the Ways and Means Committee is not the wisest thing for us to do. But, Mr. Speaker, what we are doing here today on this rule is absolutely outrageous and a complete violation of this commitment that was made at the beginning of this Congress for a new era of openness, transparency and accountability.     
   Mr. Speaker, in fact, as I said last night in the Rules Committee, we have now almost completed the first session of the 110th Congress. Our target adjournment date is October 26, just a couple of weeks away. On not one occasion in this entire session of Congress has the distinguished ranking minority member of the Ways and Means Committee, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. McCrery), been offered the chance to propose a substitute to any measure that has emerged from the Ways and Means Committee. 
   I will say, Mr. Speaker, as we regularly get criticized for when we were in the majority, we never did anything close to that. 
   Now, I am saddened greatly by the fact that we are not only doing this on this rule, Mr. Speaker, but on the next measure that we are about to bring up. It is going to be another item that will have come from the Committee on Financial Services. It's a plan to dramatically increase housing. 
   Last week we had a measure that came from the Committee on Financial Services and it was a flood insurance bill. Not a terribly partisan issue, a measure that has impacted Democrats and Republicans on the gulf coast, Florida, along the eastern seaboard and other parts of our country. Democrats and Republicans. 
   As we all know, last week in the measure that emerged from the Committee on Financial Services, the Rules Committee had a wide range of amendments that were proposed by both Democrats and Republicans. In fact, the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services talked about a commitment that had been made to allow a number of Republican amendments to be considered, so those Members withdrew their amendments when they were debating this in the Committee on Financial Services on flood insurance. 
   The day before the committee reported that out, we happened to have unveiled, as Members of the minority, our report providing an assessment of basically the first 9 months of the Pelosi Speakership and the way the Speaker's Rules Committee has been run. This report, very brief, lots of graphs in it, 10 pages long, I would commend it to my colleagues. They can get a copy by going to rules-Republicans.house.gov. I would recommend that they look at this, Mr. Speaker, and the reason is, if you compare this performance, whether it is denying Members a chance to even submit amendments to the Rules Committee, which is something we would have never comprehended, to having double the number of closed rules as we did at this point in the 109th Congress, you will see, Mr. Speaker, that this report shows that the performance of the first session of the 110th Congress has been 180 degrees from what was promised the American people. 
   So last week when we had this flood insurance measure that came forward, as I said, an agreement had been struck between the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and a number of Republicans on that committee to have their amendments considered. And what happened? There were 13 amendments made in order, Mr. Speaker. Not one single Republican amendment was made in order. Not one single Republican amendment was made in order. This is not just a party thing; this is the American people who are not allowed to be heard because these representatives represent people along the eastern seaboard, the gulf coast, Florida, areas impacted by floods and hurricanes. We have flooding in California and all across the country. 
   Here is what happened. The American people whose representatives had thoughtful proposals, and the chairman of the committee thought those proposals should be heard, were denied by this Rules Committee, and it just happened the day after this report which we hoped would lead the new majority to help keep the promises made in a new direction for America. And what happened? They did even worse. 
   And so where do we stand today, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. Sessions has just pointed out what has happened in this rule. Again, not one chance in this entire Congress for the ranking minority member of the Ways and Means Committee to offer a proposal. 
   And in the next bill we will have before us, unfortunately, there is not a single Republican amendment made in order. Yes, there is a substitute, the Neugebauer substitute; but not one Republican amendment made in order,  and all seven of the amendments that the Democrats proposed have been made in order. 
   Now, I had an exchange with the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, and while he did not support most or any of these amendments that I know of, unfortunately what happened was, when the committee chairman said we ought to consider some of these, the committee chose to completely shut out Members of the minority from having an opportunity other than the Neugebauer substitute. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me say I am puzzled and I am saddened, both, as I look at this performance. When we are promised a new direction for America and greater transparency, disclosure and accountability, and generally a full and open debate, including a substitute, which is the exact wording that Speaker Pelosi had in this new direction for America, and here we are doing the exact opposite. 
   Now, on this measure itself, I hope very much we will defeat the previous question so the very thoughtful work Mr. English has done dealing with relief for the American people from the onerous burden of the alternative minimum tax can be addressed. Unfortunately, that is not allowed. But I do believe if we defeat the previous question, we can allow the American people to have a chance to have some kind of relief from the onerous alternative minimum tax. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me so much time, but I felt compelled to make these arguments on this bill and the next bill that will be coming forward. I hope, and I am very sincere about this, as an institutionalist, I hope and pray that we will do better for the American people when it comes to structuring and allowing full and fair and free debate on the House floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time until my colleague from Washington has made his closing statement. -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this disgraceful rule. To illustrate just how bad this rule is, and to provide some context, I'd like to discuss a few telling numbers. I'm just going to throw these numbers out there for consideration: 12, 7, 4 and 9. That's 12, 7, 4 and 9. 
   These numbers are significant, and let me tell you why. The first number is 12. The House has 12 appropriations bills that it must consider in order to fund the Federal budget; 12 bills to consider in order to responsibly exercise our constitutional power of the purse; 12 appropriations bills that cover the priorities that are first and foremost in Americans' minds. 
   We've now reached the final week of July and the Democratic majority has brought up its adjournment resolution. Traditionally, this is the week when the House wraps up its versions of these 12 appropriations bills, or at least a majority of them. The idea is to finalize or make significant progress in our most important duty as legislators before adjourning for a month of recess in August. 
   So now that we have arrived at the end of July, how many appropriations bills remain for the House to consider? Twelve. Every last one of them. Today we are considering our very first one of 12. The Democratic Majority thought, what the heck, why not squeeze one in before heading out of town. So, we're starting our job right about the time we've traditionally tried to finish it. 
   And speaking of tradition, one of the longest-held traditions in this body is the practice of considering all regular appropriations bills under a completely open process. This is one of the few opportunities in the House where all Members, majority and minority, have the unfettered ability to offer any amendments they see fit. These amendments are of course subject to points of order, and ultimately a vote. But Members have had the opportunity to offer them and make their case. 
   Which brings me to the second number on my list: the number 7. We would have to go back 7 years to find any example of restrictions on a general appropriations bill. 
   In 2001, the Rule providing for consideration of the Foreign Operations bill had a pre-printing requirement. This restriction was entirely unopposed. Not one voice of opposition was raised, and the Rule passed by voice vote. 
   And what was the reason for this restriction? We had a very busy week, in a very busy month, and we all agreed--Democrats and Republicans--agreed to expedite the procedures. Considering we passed 9 of 13 appropriations bills prior to departing for August recess that year, I suppose you could say the unopposed restrictions were justified. Seven years passed before any restrictions were again imposed. 
   Until today. Today the Democratic majority is apparently exhausted by their efforts to name post office buildings and avoid meaningful action to bring down energy costs. They are in such a rush to get out the door for a 5-week recess that they insist on bringing up their very first appropriations bill under a restricted Rule. They are denying Members the ability to freely bring their amendments to the floor and have their voices heard. 
   And to add an element of the absurd, they are actually calling this an open rule. With straight faces, no less. 
   What's the reason for this closed process? I don't doubt expediency plays a part. When you're rushing out the door, you prefer not to get bogged down by open, substantive debate. But the full explanation lies in what the Democratic majority hopes to avoid--any possibility that Republicans will seek to offer energy-related amendments to the underlying bill. 
   Which brings us to the third number on my list: the number 4. Americans are paying an average of $4 for a gallon of gas. The mutually reinforcing trends of high gas prices and high food prices have strained working Americans enormously. They know Government policies bear much of the blame, and they rightly expect this Congress to do something about it. 
   Republicans have tried every means possible to force this Democratic majority to consider real solutions to our energy crisis. But we have faced nothing but roadblocks. 
   And now, the Democratic majority is using every trick in the book to get out of town without ever scheduling a meaningful vote. And on their way out the door, they are trampling on the rights of Members to an open and fair appropriations process. 
   And this brings us to the fourth and final number: the number 9. The latest polls show Congress' approval rating at an abysmal 9 percent. All but 9 percent of the American population thinks we are failing at our job. Frankly, I'd like to know who this 9 percent is who supports what we're doing. Under the  Democratic majority, we are failing in our duty to address Federal spending. We are failing in our duty to find a workable and effective solution to the energy crisis we face. We are failing in our duty to have open and honest debate on the challenges we face. And just this afternoon, we had a vote on a resolution to adjourn, despite all of these failures. Mr. Speaker, the numbers don't lie. I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4351, AMT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I just don't get it. I just can't figure this thing out. Under the Democrats' logic, they're saying that we have to increase taxes to avoid a tax increase. We have to increase taxes to avoid a tax increase. That's what the fiscally responsible thing is for us to do. 
   Madam Speaker, last Saturday morning I had the privilege of riding in the Glendora Christmas parade. Glendora, California, beautiful, ``pride of the foothills'' they call this city. As I arrived, I happened to run into a guy called Marshall Mouw, who is a former city council member in that great city. He worked for the U.S. Postal Service for many years. The first thing he said when he looked at me is, what are you going to do to make sure that we're not victimized by the alternative minimum tax? And I told him, we have tried time and time again to do at least what's called a 1-year patch, a 1-year patch, which would ensure that 23 million Americans aren't going to be saddled with this unfair tax. And personally, I would like to flat out repeal completely the alternative minimum tax. 
   Now, let's remember what the alternative minimum tax is. Back in 1969, the Democratic Congress found that there were 155 Americans who were millionaires, and they weren't paying their fair share of taxes. They, of course, were doing things legally. They had all kinds of investments. They were creating jobs. But they weren't paying their fair share of taxes, so-called. And so the alternative minimum tax was put into place to go after those 155 Americans who many believed were cheating somehow and not paying their fair share. 
   What has happened? Well, due to bracket creep, we now see 23 million Americans. I would like to describe this, Madam Speaker, as unintended consequences. It's one of the things that we often don't think about in this institution when we try to pass sweeping legislation, well-intentioned but sweeping legislation. And that's one of the reasons that the framers of our Constitution, James Madison especially, wanted the process of law-making to be very, very hard; very, very difficult. 
   I see my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations here, Mr. Obey, and I will say that it's very clear that Madison's vision, I guess, is working now, when you look at how hard it is for us to get our work done, how hard it is for us to get through this appropriations process. I'm very, very relieved that many of the things that this new majority would like to put through, which I believe in many ways undermine what the American people want, like putting into place a massive tax increase to avoid a tax increase, can't happen, and they're not going to happen. 
   As the distinguished ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means, Mr. McCrery, said yesterday, all we need to do is take the last debate that we had on AMT, paste that thing in, and then we'll see exactly what happens. 
   We know that our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol are not going to accept this. And so what we need to do if we in fact are going to ensure that the American people are going to get that much needed relief from the alternative minimum tax, it's very important for us to do everything that we can to try and come to an agreement as quickly as possible. We know what that agreement is. We know what we're going to agree to. We're going to agree to what we've done in the past, a 1-year patch to ensure that these 23 million Americans don't get this massive tax increase. 
   Madam Speaker, as I listened to my colleague, I was just told by one of our staff members that they've been talking about how horrible the last 6 years have been, how awful the last 6 years have been. I would like to remind our colleagues of the fact that we got a report 2 weeks ago of the third quarter gross domestic product growth rate that we've had in this country. It's 4.9 percent. I would like to remind our colleagues who continue to wring their hands over the deficit, yes, I'd like to see the deficit lower, but as a percentage of our gross domestic product, the deficit today is $81 billion lower than had been projected in February of this year, putting it at $164 billion. 
   Now, people don't often think about the fact that the United States of America has a $13.3 trillion economy, clearly the strongest, most dynamic economy that the world has ever known. 
   Do we have problems? Of course we do. I mentioned at the outset one of the communities I represent in Southern California, the subprime issue is something with which we're trying to contend and to work through. If you look at the value of the currency, if you look at lots of other issues out there, we do have problems. But this notion of claiming that the last 6 years have been a living hell for all Americans is preposterous. 
   What we need to do is we need to make sure that we do everything that we possibly can to rein in wasteful Federal spending, make sure that we pursue opportunities to open up markets around the world for U.S. workers to be able to export into those markets, and we need to make sure that we continue cutting taxes so that we can see the kind of economic growth that we've been enjoying in the past. That's why it's silly for us to be sitting around wasting our time, wasting our time doing exactly what we did last week on this so-called alternative minimum tax when we know exactly what is going to happen here.  
   At the end of the day, we're going to have, Madam Speaker, a 1-year patch to ensure that 23 million Americans don't face a massive tax increase. Let's reject this crazy notion that we've got before us and move ahead with what we know can be agreed to in a bipartisan way.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule. And I want to begin by complimenting my friend from Miami for very cogently pointing to the December 6, 2006, words of our friend from Worcester who has, once again, stood before us and tried to make an argument for completely rebuffing all of the promises that were made in 2006 and the years before that. 
   Now, my friend has just referred to the fact that we had a continuing resolution a year ago right now when we were considering this. The fact is, in the last Congress, while it wasn't a model by any means, there were more appropriations bills passed through both Houses of Congress than has been the case in this year, the first year of the Democratic majority's control of this place. 
   Now, when we think back to those promises that were outlined so well when my friend from Miami was carrying forth the arguments propounded by Mr. McGovern, I think about what we've gotten this year compared to last year. In fact, this year, there have been more bills rewritten in the Rules Committee than in any other Congress we've had before. Eleven of the appropriations bills last year were passed, and only one this year, the Defense appropriations bill. And so as I listen to my friend malign the record of the last Congress, we have to remember the fact that 11 of the bills were passed last year. 
   But let me further add that in this calendar year there have been more bills rewritten by the Rules Committee than ever before in any Congress. Madam Speaker, in this Congress there have been more closed rules preventing any Member, Democratic or Republican, from having the opportunity to offer an amendment than in any Congress in our history. 
   And one of the other things that I remember, as we consider this bill, Madam Speaker, is the fact that we were promised a 24-hour period to look at measures. In fact, I remember the Speaker, in ``A New Direction for America,'' said that we would do this. And my friend, in his December 6, 2006, statement, talked about a new sense of fairness and openness. He said that twice in his statement, Madam Speaker. And yet it was 12:55 this morning when the Rules Committee received this 3,000-page omnibus appropriations bill. And here we are, at now 5 minutes past 6 in the evening, having gone through the Rules Committee and brought it to the floor. It is, again, 180 degrees from what was promised by this new majority. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, I will say that my friend and I are the two Members of the minority who are here on the floor, we have consistently stood, as have all of our colleagues, prepared to work in a bipartisan way to deal with these issues. 
   And I was really somewhat surprised when I heard my friend mention the issue of veterans benefits, making sure that we have the resources needed for our Nation's veterans. Well, Madam Speaker, last summer, we could have gotten a bill to the President's desk with bipartisan support, Democrats and Republicans, again, coming together, which is what we want to do, we want to work together. And that's what the American people regularly say is, yes, you've got different visions, but can't you deal with areas of agreement and, in fact, pass Public Law on that. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, I will tell you that I believe the Democrats and Republicans in this House, at least from everything I've heard, want to provide much-needed assistance to our Nation's veterans. Democrats and Republicans want to provide assistance to our Nation's veterans. And, Madam Speaker, last summer we had an opportunity to do that. Our colleagues in the Senate, the other body, they appointed the conferees so that we could report, it was a bipartisan agreement, to report out and get the much-needed veterans relief to the President's desk for a signature. We could have done that last summer. And yet, Madam Speaker, unfortunately, there was never, by the Speaker of the House, an appointment of those conferees. So we've gone for half a year at a cost of, it's been as high as 13 or $18 million a day, if I remember the numbers, that it has cost with this constant delay. 
   And so I was really shocked that my friend from Worcester would raise the issue of veterans benefits when we could have, again, with Democrats and Republicans alike agreeing, we could have gotten that bill to the President's desk and signed last summer; 6 months ago it could have been done. 
   So I've got to say again, Madam Speaker, that we were promised this great new sense of openness. I was encouraged by that. And I will admit, in  the position that I held in the last Congress as chairman of the Rules Committee, I didn't do it perfectly. I made mistakes. I know my friend from Miami would acknowledge the same thing. We never held ourselves up as a perfect model, but we were constantly criticized. And I know that regularly our friends on the other side of the aisle will say, well, you did this, so that means we should do this. No, Madam Speaker, it wasn't about what we did. It was about what this new majority promised they were going to do. 
   Twenty-four hours to look at legislation, and yet this 3,000-page omnibus appropriations bill was made available at 12:55 this morning. A new sense of openness and fairness. More closed rules in the first session of the 110th Congress than in any Congress in our Nation's history, and more bills rewritten in the Committee on Rules than we've ever seen happen before. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe that those of us in the minority have a responsibility to hold this new majority accountable to those promises that were made, not to us, I mean, I'm not complaining about us, it's the American people. It's our constituents, Democrats and Republicans, who have been denied this opportunity. 
   And so it is sad that we are beginning to wind down the first session of the 110th Congress in the way that we are when, again, we would very much like to work in a bipartisan way. We're going through this measure now, Madam Speaker, that the President has said he would veto in its current form. We know that the Senate is going to end up doing the right thing, ensuring that we have the necessary funds to support our troops as they seek to prosecute this war against radical extremism, and yet we deny it in this measure. 
   So I, of course, will be voting against this bill as it now is. And I guess it gives some Members cover. They get an opportunity to say that they're voting against the war in Iraq, which some people want to do. I mean, we all want this war to come to an end. As I just said upstairs in the Rules Committee a few minutes ago, the President of the United States stood here last January, nearly a year ago, and he said, I wish this war were over and that we had won. This is not an endless war. We've been getting positive reports from a wide range of sources, even some of the harshest critics, including one particularly prominent Member of this institution, who was a very harsh critic, has acknowledged that the surge has worked and that we are seeing signs of improvement. 
   Now, I don't know if that's going to bring the war to an end. No one knows. I don't know if it's just a lull. It may be. But I do know this, these are positive signs that need to be recognized. And it would be a horrible mistake for us to pass this omnibus 
   appropriations bill which would deny the needed resources. 
   Whether you supported our going into Iraq or not, we are where we are, and I think Members of this body need to recognize that. Unfortunately, this omnibus appropriations bill fails to do that. 
   And I know I've offered this quote on numerous occasions here on the House floor, Madam Speaker, but my constituent, Ed Blecksmith, a very proud former marine, lost his son, his son that was in the battle of Fallujah in November of 2004. And his father said to me, Ed Blecksmith said to me, ``If you don't complete our mission in Iraq, my son, J.P., will have died in vain.'' And that's why I believe that it is critically important, as unpopular as this is, for us to make sure that we complete our mission, which means ensuring that the Iraqi security forces can defend the country and that the government can govern. It took us 13 years, from July 4, 1776 until April of 1789, nearly 13 years for us to put our government into place. 
   We have challenging and difficult days ahead in both Iraq and Afghanistan, but this measure would be an absolutely horrible, horrible signal to send to our troops and to those who are so courageously, Iraqis, people of Afghanistan, who are fighting on behalf of this cause for freedom. 
   And so, Madam Speaker, I will say again, it's a process that is not what was promised to the American people, and it is a product which is clearly flawed. So I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule and against the underlying resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (COLOMBIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, thank you very much. It is true that today is the day that the American people have their obligation to pay taxes for the American government to continue to function. And obviously, there are many good things that the Federal Government does, and there are many not so good things that the Federal Government does. 
   But one of the things that I think is very important for us to focus attention on, especially as we deal with a challenging economy, is the need for us to ensure that, as stewards of those taxpayer dollars, those dollars fund this institution, the greatest deliberative body known to man, and we need to ensure that we put into place policies that will encourage strong, dynamic, economic growth and to make sure that there are opportunities for every single American. And Madam Speaker, we're going to talk about that this evening. 
   I have to say that my original intentions for this special order were a little different than they are going to end up being tonight. I'd planned to join tonight with several of my colleagues who have spent time in Colombia. I'd planned to talk about what I've personally witnessed there, and I'd invited many of my colleagues to do the same. 
   I'd hoped to make this a bipartisan endeavor, and I extended invitations to several of my Democratic colleagues to participate this evening. And I will say that I still do hope that we might have a chance to do that. And one of our Democratic colleagues did come up to me and say that he had hoped to participate. 
   I thought that this was very important, because I knew that when the President sent, a week ago today, when he sent the implementing legislation for the U.S/Colombia Free Trade Agreement, a 60-day clock, under trade promotion authority, would begin. We would have 60 legislative days to hold a vote on the agreement. This meant that the House of Representatives would face a vote on the U.S./Colombia Free Trade Agreement some time in probably late July. That would leave us 3 months for debate, discussion, education, and enlightenment about what this agreement would mean to the American people. 
   However, despite the ample time granted under trade promotion authority, I knew that many of my colleagues, particularly my Democratic colleagues, remained deeply ambivalent on the trade agreement itself. We certainly saw that as we had this debate last week. 
   For this reason, it was my hope that this special order this evening would be opening the 3-month discussion in a bipartisan way, and what I wanted to do was I wanted to shift the focus away from the free trade agreement, and I'd hoped that a group of Republicans and Democrats who've gone to Colombia could come together here on the House floor to simply share our experiences and describe what we've seen in Colombia, over the past year, or at least a half a year. 
   I knew that much of the free trade agreement debate would hinge on the current situation, as it exists in Colombia, what progress has been made, what steps has the Colombian government taken. 
   I wanted this debate to stay grounded in facts and a full understanding of the Colombia, of 2008, not a caricature of the Colombia past. I'd thought that bipartisan, firsthand testimony would further that goal of allowing the American people and our colleagues to understand the changes that have taken place in Colombia. 
   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, the landscape here in the House was drastically altered last week when my California colleague, Speaker Pelosi, took the unprecedented step, never before had this been done, but it was a step of changing the Rules of the House in order to block a vote on the free trade agreement. 
   In one fell swoop, she ended 3 months, what would be the beginning, and tonight would have been part of that, of substantive, bipartisan deliberation before it even had the chance to begin. Apparently, she didn't like her odds in what would clearly have been a fair fight, so she changed the rules in the middle of the game. 
   The condemnation from around the country came swiftly. Now, I have control of the floor now for an hour, and I could easily fill the entire 1 hour simply by reading the scathing editorials that have come about over the past week reproaching the Democratic leadership for their petulant act. The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, hardly mouthpieces for Republicans or President Bush. And even Speaker Pelosi's hometown newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle. All, Madam Speaker, have had the harshest of words for the dangerous and unprecedented action that was taken here last week. 
   Now, I'll read just a few of those highlights. I mentioned Speaker Pelosi's hometown newspaper, the San 
   Francisco Chronicle, a paper that I actually enjoy reading myself, but again, far from being a Republican mouthpiece. They accuse Speaker Pelosi of ``pandering'' and ``playing politics.'' 
   It points out that the decision to block a vote on the agreement is especially egregious, considering that she represents a region that heavily depends on exports for its economic competitiveness and job creation, particularly through its ports. 
   My hometown paper, the Los Angeles Times, stated it very plainly, and I quote. ``Halting the vote wasn't about the U.S. economy and wasn't about Colombia. It was about politics.'' That's what the Los Angeles Times, again, hardly a Republican mouthpiece, had to say. 
   It points out that the FTA creates quite a bind for the Democratic leadership because what is good for their party is bad for the United States of America. 
   It highlights the current imbalance in our trade relationship. We have an open market, yet face barriers in Colombia. 
   I'll say that again. And Los Angeles Times pointed that out, Madam Speaker. We allow the rest of the world, including Colombia now, under the ATPA, the Andean Trade Preference Agreement, we allow them access to the U.S. consumer market. All this agreement that we had hoped to be debating now, but the clock has stopped on that. All this agreement would do was level that playing field and allow  U.S. workers to have a chance to send their products into Colombia. 
   The New York Times, in its editorial, Madam Speaker, emphasizes not just the economic consequences but the foreign policy implications as well. It declares that last week's actions ``reduce the United States' credibility and leverage in Colombia and beyond,'' adding that it ``serves human rights in Colombia no good'' whatsoever. The cause of human rights, about which many of our colleagues rarely talk, and which we're all concerned about, would do no good by not proceeding with consideration. 
   The New York Times is certainly, as I said, no knee-jerk supporter of the agreement. Actually, they, last year, in the New York Times, proposed postponing the consideration. And that was last year. And yet this year they are strong proponents of our moving ahead with this. 
   The Washington Post, Madam Speaker, was the quickest of all the major papers to condemn Speaker Pelosi's decision, equating the move to telling Colombia to ``drop dead.'' That's what the Washington Post had to say, and calling into question the Democrats credibility and judgment. 
   The message from around the Nation has been clear and unequivocal. The unprecedented rule change was a grave mistake that should be corrected immediately by proceeding with a vote. The damage described in those editorials is twofold, economic and international. Now, I would add an additional level to that that really hasn't been pointed to in a lot of these editorials, the institutional damage that has been done. 
   Now, first the economic damage. As I said just a moment ago, the Andean Trade Preferences Act, which Congress renewed just a few weeks ago, allows all Colombian goods, virtually all Colombian goods to enter the United States duty free. They have full access to our market, and we don't get the same treatment today. American goods face an average of 14 percent tariff on goods that we are sending into the Colombian market, with agricultural products facing particularly steep barriers. 
   These preferences, like all of our preference system, have enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. So Democrats and Republicans have come together to say that we should allow these Colombian goods to come into the United States, their products, whether it's coffee, cut flowers, bananas, it allows them to virtually tariff free come into United States. So Democrats and Republicans alike said that's good for our consumers. 
   And yet, this free trade agreement, which would end the imbalance and extend that same preferential treatment for American exports, is opposed by the Democratic leadership. 
   It's a bizarre quirk of American politics. The Democrats always support trade as charity. They'll gladly give away one-sided trade without a second thought. But as soon as we propose to make it reciprocal and create a direct benefit for our own workers as well, they cry foul. To add to the absurdity, they do it in the name of protecting American workers. 
   Now, we're in a time, as I said, today is Tax Day, April 15. We're dealing, unfortunately, with an economic slowdown, and there is a great deal of economic anxiety throughout the United States of America and in other parts of the world. You might think that we could finally put politics aside and make the rational, logical decision to give American workers equal treatment and to protect American exports by creating new markets for U.S. goods and services. But unfortunately, and bizarrely, that's apparently not the case. By blocking a vote on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, the Democratic leadership has blocked a clear win for our exports and the workers who produce those exports.     
   The second form of damage that has been done is in the international arena. Again, we wander into the absurd. Time and again, I hear my Democratic colleagues decry what they call our diminished standing in the world. President Bush has, in fact, diminished our standing and in fact is a big part of the presidential campaign. 
   They accuse the administration of unilateralism and a disregard for our allies. They say that that has hurt our leadership and our credibility in the international community. And in the presidential campaign, they promise, Senators CLINTON and OBAMA, they promise to restore our prestige. 
   And yet the Democratic leadership raced to sabotage our relationship with our best and closest ally in South America with what could only be described as reckless abandon. Following a mere 1 hour of debate, they chose to treat our close democratic friend in our very own hemisphere, a slap in the face is the way this was described by the Vice President of Colombia, or as the Las Vegas Review Journal put it, a stab in the back. That's how the action that was taken here last week has been characterized. 
   Colombian democracy has grown steadily stronger under the courageous leadership of President Uribe with whom I spoke today. His popularity has soared above 70 percent and stayed there because he took his country from the brink of a failed State and put it back on the path of peaceful and prosperous stability. He's strengthened democratic institutions, not least of which is a Justice Department that has aggressively tackled the culture of impunity for murderers. 
   Under Uribe's presidency, crime has plummeted, largely because he has aggressively pursued the eco-terrorist guerillas and the equally murderous paramilitaries. The former have been pushed from their stronghold, and the latter have been systematically dismantled and their leadership imprisoned. The rank-and-file are beginning the long and difficult process of rehabilitation and reintegration into society with the help of government-funded social programs. The same has been offered to rank-and-file guerrillas who wish to surrender their arms. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity to witness the real-world implications of these demobilization efforts. When I was in Colombia last August, several of my colleagues and I had the chance to sit down with former paramilitary members. These are young men and women, and I do mean young, teenagers in most cases, who had heart-wrenching tales to share with us. We heard from one young man who described his parents' murder right before his eyes. In his grief and anger, he turned to vigilantism. Like so many Colombians spanning multiple generations, he experienced the horror of violence, and he turned to violence himself. 
   The leaders of these paramilitary groups, like their guerrilla counterparts, committed heinous acts of violence and are now paying their debt to society. As remarkable an achievement as that is, the much harder part is bringing these young men and women, like those who I met, back into society. 
   I met them at a vocational training facility where they are learning the skills that will allow them to provide for themselves and become responsible members of society. They're learning to leave their violent past behind them and contribute to a peaceful and prosperous Colombia. 
   These efforts undertaken by President Uribe's government are already serving as a model for other post-conflict countries that have faced similar challenges. The process, Madam Speaker, of demobilization and reconciliation is not easy. There is still a great deal of work that needs to be done. While most paramilitary groups have been dismantled, there are still vigilantes in the jungle. There are still violent leaders at large who must go to jail. The guerrilla groups have yet to lay down their arms. And even as demobilization goes forward, the work of reintegration will take years. 
   But, Madam Speaker, I saw firsthand, as I know my colleagues who are going to be participating in this Special Order have. Tough work is being done, and it is being done with great success. 
   At the same time this transformation is taking place, Colombia has also faced a formidable foe of democracy on its border. We all know very well. Hugo Chavez has long been working to dismantle democratic institutions and free markets in his country of Venezuela and to export his authoritarian designs throughout the region. He suppressed dissent, trashed the Venezuelan constitution and squashed free  enterprise. He's interfered with the elections of his neighbors and drawn Ecuador and Bolivia into his orbit. 
   He keeps company with Daniel Ortega, Fidel Castro, and Mahmoud Ahmedinejad. His anti-democratic institutions for this hemisphere are no secret, and he is as openly hostile to the region's bulwarks of democracy as he is to the United States of America. Just weeks ago, he sent troops to his border with Colombia in a naked act of hostility. Flush with oil money, we all know that Hugo Chavez poses a grave threat to Latin America. 
   President Uribe, facing enormous challenges within his own borders and on the front lines of this ideological battle, is standing up. Colombia, under his leadership, is actively countering the influence of Hugo Chavez by acting as a model of the great gains to be made in a free and transparent democracy. 
   With seemingly little thought for the cause of democracy or U.S. interests, the Democratic leadership has disregarded both with last week's vote. Only time will tell the extent of the damage to our relationship with Colombia or our struggle to rein in the influence of Hugo Chavez. The damage to our credibility may be even more durable, unfortunately. 
   We have now sent a clear message to our partners: our word at the negotiating table is cheap, and if we don't like how things are going, we will just change the rules in the middle of the process. The implications extend well beyond trade. The United States is engaged in a great many negotiations on a great many issues: Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, nuclear nonproliferation, regional diplomatic efforts for Iraq. If our word to our close friends can't be trusted, how will we effectively engage around the globe? 
   Our credibility, Madam Speaker, and our leadership in the international community can hardly endure when they are so casually disregarded by this body. 
   This was the main thrust of the criticism from editorial boards across the country. But to economic and foreign policy damage, I would add institutional damage. Ironically, the vote to kill the free trade agreement succeeded because the Democratic leadership effectively argued to its membership that it was in the House's interest, this institution's interest to do so. They appealed to that institutional and party pride. I have already discussed the issue of party pride, Madam Speaker, as the L.A. Times editorialized, it's no secret on this issue, Democratic party interests run counter to our Nation's interest. 
   But the claims of institutional prerogative are utterly specious. During the rule debate last week, I went through the administration's requirements under 
   Trade Promotion Authority chapter and verse, and I won't belabor them here. Suffice it to say, the Trade Promotion Authority was not ambiguous in its demands. I was involved in the negotiations in putting trade promotion authorities together. It is very, very rigorous because I believe in the first branch of government, I'm a believer in this institution, and I believe that we have very important rights. 
   The requirements for any administration under Trade Promotion Authority are laid out very clearly, and as my colleagues who are here on the floor know, this administration followed those directives to the letter in both spirit and in letter. They followed it to a T. These requirements were designed to ensure that Congress is consulted at every single step of the way. This goal was demonstrably and unequivocally achieved. 
   But under Trade Promotion Authority, there are two sets of processes: There is the negotiating process, which closely involves Congress but is led by the administration, and there is the congressional process. Both processes are unambiguously defined by very strict timetables. 
   The first timeline was followed. The second timeline was abrogated. One side followed the rules in good faith; the other side cheated. The Charlottesville Daily Progress outlined the implications of these actions perfectly, and they said, ``If rules of procedure mean nothing, then the legislative process can be warped, and moreover, it can be warped at the discretion of a single powerful person. This is not the way democracy should work. The effort to change the rules after the process was under way dishonors Congress.'' 
   Those are not my words. Those are the words of the editorial written in the Charlottesville Daily Progress. 
   Madam Speaker, so much for institutional pride. The message the Democratic leadership has sent is that the ends justify the means. And what lofty goal did they sacrifice institutional integrity for? Killing an agreement, killing an agreement that extends preferential treatment to American workers and strengthens a key democratic ally in our own hemisphere. 
   No wonder the condemnation came so swiftly, and my staff has done a great deal of research. We have yet to find an editorial that is in support of the actions of the Speaker. As I said, her hometown paper, the New York Times, the Washington Post, on and on and on, we're going to discuss some of those further in just a minute. It is not too late though, Madam Speaker, it is not too late to correct this. 
   We were supposed to have a 3-month process of debate and deliberations. We can still have it. We were supposed to have a vote at the end of that process. The Democratic leadership can still commit to do it. 
   I mentioned the fact that I spoke with President Uribe a few hours ago. He's patient and he's optimistic. Frankly, he has no choice other than to be patient and optimistic. Madam Speaker, I call on Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer to make a commitment to hold a vote on this very important Colombia Free Trade Agreement prior to the August recess. I call on them to quit demagoging this issue and let their rank-and-file Members vote their conscience. 
   I will say that I completely disagree with the statement made by Speaker Pelosi here last week. She said that one of the reasons she didn't want this vote is that she was afraid it would go down to defeat. As I look at my colleagues who have joined me here, we've been working in a bipartisan way, and I'm not going to state the names of any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle; but the fact of the matter is, in going through this 3-month process, I have every confidence that a bipartisan majority of this institution would recognize that helping American workers, strengthening a democratic ally, doing everything that we can for the word of this institution, would be the right thing to do. I know that because, frankly, more than a few Democrats have told me that they want to have a choice to vote for and support this measure. 
   Passage of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement is clearly in our economic and our foreign policy interest. Blocking it is clearly not. And changing the rules in the middle of the game because you're afraid of a fair fight is not defensible. It's time for us to exert true leadership as an institution and make sure that we pass this agreement. 
   So those are my prepared remarks, Madam Speaker. And I'm so proud that I have been joined by a number of my colleagues, all of whom have been great champions in this effort and have worked on the notion of expanding opportunities for U.S. goods and services to be sold all around the world. 
   And one of the great leaders who has been pursuing this, specifically in this hemisphere for many, many years and was a great champion of the Central American Free Trade Agreement and a wide range of other free trade initiatives, comes from a State, by the way, that is the headquarters for Caterpillar, and we know that by not passing this free trade agreement, we are preventing good, hardworking Caterpillar employees from having an opportunity to duty-free sell their very important equipment into Colombia. And I'm very happy at this time to yield to my very, very good friend who I'm saddened to say will not be joining us in the 111th Congress because he's chosen to retire to spend time with his wonderful, wonderful and very young family, but I'm happy to yield to my friend from Illinois (Mr. Weller).

   Mr. DREIER. If I could reclaim my time, I would like to pose a question, if I might, to my friend. 
   As we hear this 73 percent support level in Colombia, we know that the opposition here in the United States to this is being led by the AFL-CIO and organized labor. Now, I'm sure that my friend has seen in Colombia, as I have, that the private sector unions in Colombia are strongly supportive of this agreement. Is that the case or not?

   When my friend began discussing the fact that a delegation came from Colombia of union leaders to the United States, I thought that you were going to mention the fact that a delegation of Members of the United States Congress went last week to Colombia. One of those who went was the distinguished secretary of the Republican Conference, our very, very good friend, Judge John Carter, a gentleman from Texas. And I would love to hear his thoughts, having just been in Colombia a week ago, on his trip. And I am happy to yield to my friend.

   Mr. DREIER. Medellin was the murder capital of the world, clearly the most dangerous spot in the world. And now Medellin has a murder rate that is too high. We have a murder rate that is too high in the District of Columbia. We have a murder rate that is too high in the United States of America. But the transformation of Medellin under the great Mayor Sergio Fajardo, with whom I'm sure you met, has been so dramatic. His leadership and the leadership of President Uribe has just transformed that city. Is that what my friend found?

   Mr. DREIER. Absolutely. My friend is absolutely right. And I will tell you, these meetings are always, for me, I've participated in several of them, very emotional. As I said in my opening remarks, I remember very vividly seeing this young, I mean, a kid, he said he was 18 years old when he watched the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the FARC, which we all know that acronym, they came in and they murdered his mother and father right in front of him. And of course he was, like any of us would be, so angry and so bitter that he joined with the paramilitary and began being, as you said so well, Mr. Carter, a guerrilla fighter. And he was able to become productive because of the trade schools that have been put into place. 
   And the patriotism that these young Colombians have for their country and their desire for a peaceful nation is so great. They were forced into this because these narcoterrorists in the FARC were resorting to murdering their parents. And so many others have been tragically murdered there. To see this take place and to hear those individual stories, they are very, very emotional. In fact, as you listen to these people, I mean, I'm getting emotional thinking about it because of the fact that these young people who have been forced into this are now becoming productive members of society. And the notion of our not doing what we can to bring about peace and stability in this hemisphere is, I think, very, very distressing. 
   I am happy to see that we're joined by the very distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee on Trade of the Ways and Means Committee, my California colleague, Mr. Herger. And I would be happy to yield for some comments to my very good friend.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, let me express my appreciation to my friend for pointing to these editorials because, as I said a few minutes ago, we've done a great deal of research. We've been trying desperately to find an editorial anywhere in this country that has been written in support of the egregious action taken by the Democratic leadership in this institution, undermining the ability to open up this very important new market for U.S. workers, agricultural products and manufactured goods. We hear from California and Illinois and other States as well. And I actually have, I think, about 15 of these editorials here with some incredible quotes that are pretty damning. And again, these come from publications that are hardly considered Republican mouth pieces. 
   You know, we had this very harsh criticism level at the President of the United States, and he somehow was trying to ram this thing through and rush it. We know that this agreement, the negotiation began 4 years ago, it was completed 2 years ago, and a year and a half ago it was signed. There have been constant attempts to bring this up; 27 meetings held with the Democratic leadership by this administration, and yet, as has been pointed out in these editorials, this terrible action was taken. 
   I'm very pleased that one of the great free traders in this institution who represents the very important port town of Houston, Texas, has joined us, another hardworking member of the Ways and Means--I guess we've got three members of the Ways and Means Committee here, so I'm particularly pleased to have members of that very, very important committee with us, including my good friend, as I said, from Houston, Mr. Brady.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for his very thoughtful contribution, Madam Speaker. 
   And one of the issues that has come to the forefront, and I would be happy to yield to any of my colleagues who would like to comment on this, has been this notion that the Colombian Government is somehow murdering union leaders. We have continued to hear this. And it is true. In the past it's been absolutely outrageous to see the treatment. 
   But in the last several years under the leadership of President Uribe, very important steps have been taken to bring to justice any of those who have been responsible for the heinous act of murdering these union leaders. And the government has done something which is totally unprecedented. The government does not want to see union leaders killed; so what do they do? There are 1,500 union leaders who enjoy full security protection paid for by the Government of Colombia. And yet we continually hear arguments put forward by our friends at the AFL-CIO that ``the Colombian Government is murdering our brothers.'' I mean I've heard that chant over and over and over again. Because, of course, as these very thoughtful arguments that my colleagues have put forward are there, the only response that they can have is the Colombian Government is murdering, is murdering, our brothers. 
   I would be happy to further yield to my friend.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I would like to reclaim my time so I could propound a question to my friend, and I don't mean to interrupt his very thoughtful statement. 
   But as I listened to the arguments that have been made by Speaker Pelosi and others against this, they said we have an economy that is weakening. We all know that is the case. Our economy is facing very serious challenges. Here again, this is Tax Day, April 15, and it is hard for people to make ends meet. It has become more difficult. So the argument has been made. I hear Speaker Pelosi regularly say we need to focus on American workers and their concerns rather than some kind of agreement, and so we should put off this agreement until our economy is stronger. 
   And I just don't quite understand that. And I wonder if my friend might enlighten me on exactly what the point of that statement is. 
   And I further yield.

   Mr. DREIER. So basically this would best be described as a win-win all the way around. It's a winner for the cause of democracy and freedom and the rule of law in South America, which we all know is very important. It's a winner when it comes to stopping those drug traffickers who are selling drugs, poisoning our children and grandchildren. And then we look at the opportunity created for the United States of America, our workers. They're greatly benefited by this. 
   And that's why I continue to try to figure out why it is that anyone would oppose this. I mean we use the term ``no brainer'' to describe this. It really is a no brainer. We used that in the debate last week. I know that the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. McCrery, and a couple of others have said this is a no brainer. 
   And these editorials that have been written, I think we probably should share some of the words of these publications that often criticize Republican policies who have come forward with this. I know a number of things have been put forward. But one thing just today, the Wall Street Journal had an editorial that was in strong support of a letter, an open letter, that came from former senior administration officials from the Clinton administration and Democratic Members of Congress, and it was signed by 35 of them, former colleagues of ours who are Democrats. And it includes people, by the way, just some of the signatories of this letter, the former Commerce Secretary William Daley, who is from Mr. Weller's State that we talked about; Stuart Eizenstat, a very prominent brilliant economic mind; General Barry McCaffrey; our former colleague who was a Republican Senator but went on to be the Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration, Bill Cohen, signed this. So a lot of people have signed this letter. 
   It says: ``We believe this agreement is in both our vital national security and economic interests. We feel that the treaty should be considered as soon as possible.'' I remind people it's not actually a treaty; it's an agreement. ``We feel that the treaty should be considered as soon as possible and that any obstacles be quickly and amicably resolved.'' 
   The letter cites ``an overwhelming national security imperative'' and that ``President Uribe has been a strong and faithful ally. To turn our back on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement would be a severe blow to that relationship and would send a very negative message to our friends in a volatile region? 
   The letter praises Colombia for its ``dramatic improvement in security'' and for being ``a model of open market democracy that supports fundamental U.S. national interests'' and points out that these are ideals that many in the  region ``openly scorn,'' of course, referring, as my friend just said, to Hugo Chavez. The letter goes on to praise Uribe personally for his ``great personal courage'' in aggressively going on the offensive in fighting narcoterrorists and dramatically increasing drug interdiction and eradication of criminals to the United States, or extradition of criminals. Eradication of criminals too, we want to do that. It also praises his substantial progress in the issue of violence against trade unionists, pointing out that Uribe has provided special security protection to some 9,400 individuals. This number says including 1,900 trade unionists. I said 1,500, and this letter that these officials of the Clinton administration and former Democratic Members of the United States Congress said 1,900 trade unionists have been able to receive this kind of protection. 
   And that's why I implore my colleagues in the Democratic leadership to bring this up for a vote. 
   Mark my words, and I would ask any of my colleagues who are here if they disagree with my assessment, if after we go through these arguments, which we have begun talking about tonight and we talked a little bit about last week, is there any doubt that we would have strong bipartisan support with many Democrats joining with us in support of this?     
   I would be happy to yield to any of my colleagues who have any thoughts or comments on that at all. I suspect you might agree with me, but if you have any thoughts on it, I would be happy to. 
   Mr. Brady, you look like you would like to cast your vote.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, my friend is absolutely right. And it is very interesting. We have heard the Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, talk about the need for trade adjustment assistance, a second stimulus package. And Madam Speaker, I would argue that the Colombia free-trade agreement, which will create an opportunity for more U.S. workers to sell their goods and agricultural products into Colombia is, in fact, trade adjustment assistance itself. And I would argue that this agreement, job creating, is in fact an economic stimulus package in and of itself. So if the commitment is to trade adjustment assistance and economic stimulus so that we can create more jobs in the United States of America, the answer is, pass the U.S.-Colombia free-trade agreement. 
   I would be happy to yield to my friend from Texas.

   Mr. DREIER. My friend makes a very good and important point here. And I was talking to my colleague, Dan Lungren, who served here, I was pleased to serve with him during the 1980s when we were in the midst, and I know my friend from California came in 1986 to this institution. We have spent time, energy, resources and weapons in dealing with the expansion of Communism in Central America as we were providing resources to the Democratic resistance in Nicaragua known as the Contras. And we regularly hear criticism from Democrats that what we should be doing in Iraq is we shouldn't be using weapons, we should, in fact, be engaging and using trade and other things. 
   And what is it we have here? We have Democrats, the Democratic leadership, unfortunately, saying that as we seek to build a stronger relationship with a country that is standing up to narcoterrorists, that is standing up to the expansion of Hugo Chavez on their borders trying to extend into the country, and they are saying ``no'' to this. They are saying ``no'' to this because somehow they believe it is going to hurt U.S. workers. 
   To me it is absolutely outrageous that this has taken place. And Madam Speaker, let me express my appreciation to my colleagues for the time that they have spent here this evening. And I hope very much that Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leadership will, in fact, schedule a vote on the U.S.-Colombia free-trade agreement before the August recess.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend from Rochester, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strongest opposition to both this rule and the underlying conference report. 
   Mr. Speaker, this conference report implements a policy of failure. It is nothing more than a cheap attempt to score political points at a time when the American people have understandably become very weary of war. Rather than offering the American people a  policy that allows us to complete our mission in Iraq and bring our troops home, which we all want to do, this bill simply offers them a charade. 
   The President, Mr. Speaker, has made it very clear that he will veto this policy of failure, which does not have enough support to override his veto. We will be right back here in a matter of days voting on another supplemental. And while this political charade plays out, Mr. Speaker, our troops will be left waiting for the funding that they need to do their jobs, and our country trapped in a political quagmire created by the Democratic leadership in this Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, this very dangerous game of ``chicken'' could have been avoided entirely. The Democratic leadership may be bereft of ideas, but I know for a fact that this entire body is not. Had we considered the original bill under an open process, which, as we all know, is the tradition for wartime supplementals in this House, we could have had a real debate. We could have considered the worthy ideas of Members in this body. 
   Instead, Mr. Speaker, all but a very few were shut out of this process entirely. Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives alike, were denied the opportunity to participate in this process. We didn't get any of their ideas, their expertise, their suggestions in bringing this measure to the floor. And what did that very small group in the Democratic leadership come up with? A constitutionally dubious attempt at micromanaging the Iraq war into inevitable defeat; a cynical political ploy that will leave dire consequences for the region and our own security in its wake. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Constitution lays out a very clear system of checks and balances derived from the ideas of the very brilliant and inspired Framers of our Constitution. James Madison I am thinking of, as I look to my friend from Virginia, Mr. Moran, obviously a native of Virginia. And I will tell you that that Madisonian spirit of giving the three branches of government distinct roles, allows us to guard ourselves against tyranny from any one branch. 
   The President must seek the support of Congress in order to wage war; it is Congress that has the power to authorize; and, as we all know very well, it must be this institution that funds a war. But, Mr. Speaker, once funding and authorization are granted, the President of the United States serves as the Commander in Chief, with the authority to execute the war. 
   This conference report ignores the intentions of our Founding Fathers and attempts to turn the Constitution on its head. 
   I mentioned, looking to my friend Mr. Moran, the father, the author of the Constitution, James Madison. Well, Mr. Speaker, in Federalist No. 51, Madison wrote ``that in framing a government that is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control the governed, and in the next place oblige it to control itself.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, Madison recognized the inherent challenges in designing a government that is both effective and limited. He knew that without checks and balances, tyranny would ensue. 
   Mr. Speaker, this conference report, like the bill before it, attempts to diminish these checks and balances. It tries to turn Congress into 535 Commanders in Chief. 
   This legislation of micromanagement is based, Mr. Speaker, on a disastrous strategy. Its authors fund the war, and then mandate its failure. They seek to tie the hands of our military commanders, and then force them to retreat when they are unable to meet impossible timetables. We heard in a briefing today from General Petraeus, from Secretary England, from Secretary Negroponte and others that the notion of timetables in fact clearly will undermine the potential for success. 
   Mr. Speaker, that leadership also knew it fell hopelessly short of the necessary support within their own party for passage. But rather than opening up the process so that real ideas and solutions could be considered, they just loaded it up with billions of dollars in unrelated spending. This conference report trades victory for potential electoral gains. 
   Mr. Speaker, what would the consequences of defeat be? The National Intelligence Estimate, the 9/11 Commission, our people on the ground and those who briefed us today, have all made it very clear that a precipitous withdrawal would have disastrous consequences. Violence will spill out across the country and spread to the entire region. 
   We heard about Iran and Syria today and the challenges that exist there. In our absence, Iran and Syria will be utterly unfettered in their ability to incite a regional war that threatens global security, with enormous casualties suffered by the people in the region. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I have said, and I know this very well, and I join Americans who have been very discouraged by this war; it has been ugly, it has been difficult, it has been very painful. We all, Mr. Speaker, feel the toll it has taken and are keenly aware of the price that we are paying, especially in a human sense. 
   I know as I look to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that every single one of us has had the challenge and the difficulty of looking into the eyes of constituents whose family and friends have made the ultimate sacrifice in this war. Their pain is very real, and we all know that their loss is profound. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, we do not honor those who have sacrificed by abandoning their mission. I have regularly quoted my very good friend, a man who has become a friend of mine, a former marine called Ed Blecksmith, whose son J.P. was killed in the battle of Fallujah 2 years ago this past November. He said that if we were to withdraw, his son will have died in vain. 
   Mr. Speaker, we do not honor those in the field who are fighting as we speak by tying their hands and depriving them of the means to succeed. We will honor them by winning the war in Iraq so that our men and women come home having completed their mission. 
   We know that their mission will not be complete in the immediate future. That was pointed out today by General Petraeus and others. As President Bush and General Petraeus have both acknowledged, success will take months, not days or weeks. But to abandon our mission would be disastrous. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject the policy of defeat and the potential return of terrorism to our homeland. I urge my colleagues to reject this political charade that leaves our troops in limbo, and let us instead have a real debate with real ideas for a real solution in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I include the following article from the Sunday Times for the Record.  
   Al-Qaeda `Planning Big British Attack'  
   Al-Qaeda leaders in Iraq are planning the first ``large-scale'' terrorist attacks on Britain and other western targets with the help of supporters in Iran, according to a leaked intelligence report. 
   Spy chiefs warn that one operative had said he was planning an attack on ``a par with Hiroshima and Nagasaki'' in an attempt to ``shake the Roman throne'', a reference to the West. 
   Another plot could be timed to coincide with Tony Blair stepping down as prime minister, an event described by Al-Qaeda planners as a ``change in the head of the company''. 
   The report, produced earlier this month and seen by The Sunday Times, appears to provide evidence that Al-Qaeda is active in Iran and has ambitions far beyond the improvised attacks it has been waging against British and American soldiers in Iraq. 
   There is no evidence of a formal relationship between Al-Qaeda, a Sunni group, and the Shi'ite regime of President Mah-moud Ahmadinejad, but experts suggest that Iran's leaders may be turning a blind eye to the terrorist organisation's activities. 
   The intelligence report also makes it clear that senior Al-Qaeda figures in the region have been in recent contact with operatives in Britain. 
   It follows revelations last year that up to 150 Britons had travelled to Iraq to fight as part of Al-Qaeda's ``foreign legion''. A number are thought to have returned to the UK, after receiving terrorist training, to form sleeper cells. 
   The report was compiled by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC)--based at MI5's London headquarters--and provides a quarterly review of the international terror threat to Britain. It draws a distinction between Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda's core leadership, who are thought to be hiding on the Afghan-Pakistan border, and affiliated organisations elsewhere. 
   The document states: ``While networks linked to AQ [Al-Qaeda] Core pose the greatest threat to the UK, the intelligence during  this quarter has highlighted the potential threat from other areas, particularly AQI [Al-Qaeda in Iraq].'' 
   The report continues: ``Recent reporting has described AQI's Kurdish network in Iran planning what we believe may be a large-scale attack against a western target. 
   ``A member of this network is reportedly involved in an operation which he believes requires AQ Core authorisation. He claims the operation will be on `a par with Hiroshima and Naga-saki' and will `shake the Roman throne'. We assess that this operation is most likely to be a large-scale, mass casualty attack against the West.'' 
   The report says there is ``no indication'' this attack would specifically target Britain, ``although we are aware that AQI ..... networks are active in the UK''. 
   Analysts believe the reference to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where more than 200,000 people died in nuclear attacks on Japan at the end of the second world war, is unlikely to be a literal boast. 
   ``It could be just a reference to a huge explosion,'' sald a counter-terrorist source. ``They [Al-Qaeda] have got to do something soon that is radical, otherwise they start losing credibility.'' 
   Despite aspiring to a nuclear capability, Al-Qaeda is not thought to have acquired weapons grade material. However, several plots involving ``dirty bombs''--conventional explosive devices surrounded by radioactive material--have been foiled. 
   Last year Al-Qaeda's leader in Iraq called on nuclear scientists to apply their knowledge of biological and radiological weapons to ``the field of jihad''. 
   Details of a separate plot to attack Britain, ``ideally'' before Blair steps down this summer, were contained in a letter written by Abdul al-Hadi al-Iraqi, an Iraqi Kurd and senior Al-Qaeda commander. 
   According to the JTAC document, Hadi ``stressed the need to take care to ensure that the attack was successful and on a large scale''. The plan was to be relayed to an Iran-based Al-Qaeda facilitator. 
   The Home Office declined to comment.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. I will yield to my friend some additional time. 
   I just entered into the Record, and I didn't mention this in my opening remarks, an article that was in the Sunday Times of London last, this past Sunday, ``Is al Qaeda Planning a Big British Attack?,'' and this is a report on intelligence that has just come forward of a massive, large scale terrorist attack on Britain and other Western targets with the help of supporters in Iran. According to a leaked intelligence report that came forward, they talk about this attack being on a par with Hiroshima and Nagasaki in an attempt to shake the Roman Empire. And I have entered this article in the Record that was in the Sunday Times, and I think it is very important that this be related to the remarks the gentleman has made. And I thank him for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago we lost a very dear friend of mine, one of our Nation's great former leaders, a woman who was a lifelong Democrat, and in 1984 she became a Republican when she addressed the Republican National Convention. Her name was Jeane Kirkpatrick; she served as Ronald Reagan's ambassador to the United Nations. 
   I will never forget the speech that she delivered at our party convention in 1984. She quoted the contemporary French writer, Jean-Francois Revel, who said, ``Clearly, a civilization that feels guilty for everything that it is and does will lack the energy and conviction to defend itself.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I was struck with that because that was at a time when there were many people who were maligning the United States of America; they said that we had gone to hell in a handbag. They were attacking all of the policies of Ronald Reagan, tax cuts which were ruining the country. And I have to say that on a regular basis, Mr. Speaker, I continue to hear the same kind of criticism, and yet we have what is obviously the greatest Nation the world has ever known. 
   Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed through 13,000. We saw last month 185,000 new jobs created, an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent. It is amazing that during this very difficult time in which we are trying to successfully prosecute the war on terror, we are enjoying such success because of the greatness of the United States of America and because of our people. 
   I am very proud of the record that we have put forward, and I am saddened regularly when I hear people malign us. And now we have this debate, we have this debate, which led, as was said by my friend from Marietta and by the gentleman from Dallas, the statement by the majority leader of the United States Senate that this war has been lost. I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, I believe that the American people are convinced that we can be successful. 
   I know that there are many who today are critical of the fact that we have gone to war. People are very upset about the fact that we have gone into Iraq. I happen to still at this moment believe that we did the right thing, but I know there are many people who have said that it was the wrong thing. And I've had constituents who have come up to me. In fact, just over this most recent district work period, I was at numerous meetings in California and a number of people came to me and they said, you know, I didn't support our going into Iraq, I think it was a mistake, but the fact of the matter is we are where we are. We have our men and women in uniform who are in Iraq. 
   We have seen elections take place in Iraq. We know the threat that continues to exist from Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, Hamas, al Qaeda, you can go right down the line. And people have said we want to figure out a way for victory. I've had people who said we shouldn't have gone into Iraq say to me, we need to figure out a way that we can be victorious. And the word ``victory'' is one that unfortunately we really haven't heard from the other side of the aisle. In fact, one of the questions asked today at the briefing with General Petraeus is, how do we define what victory is? Well, it is really twofold. It still is. It is, Mr. Speaker, an Iraq that can defend itself. And General Petraeus said to us today that there are members of the Iraqi Security Forces who are fighting and dying for their country, those are the exact words that he used, and an Iraq that can govern itself, Mr. Speaker. 
   We understand the fragility of this government, with the Shia, Sunni and Kurdish populations and the challenges that Prime Minister Maliki faces, but we do believe that we can be successful because we have to be successful. 
   Now we have gone through this process and we have heard people say on both sides of the aisle that we want to make sure that we get funding to our troops. Mr. Speaker, the best way for us to get funding to our troops is to defeat this rule and defeat the conference report. Why? Everyone has acknowledged that the President of the United States will veto a bill that guarantees failure, which is what this bill would do by establishing these arbitrary deadlines for withdrawal. So we have all acknowledged that the President is going to veto the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, why don't we make sure that our troops have the support that everyone has said that they need by not going through the challenge of the Presidential veto, the time-consuming process of the Presidential veto, having this bill go to the other body to be considered tomorrow. Let's defeat it right now, defeat the rule. And if we don't defeat the rule, at least defeat the conference report itself so that we can immediately get down to work. When we do that, Mr. Speaker, I hope very much that we won't have a small cadre of individuals within the Democratic leadership preventing Democrats and Republicans from participating in this very important process to make sure that we have everything that is necessary so that the American people, who want victory, can in fact see victory achieved. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I want to begin by expressing my great appreciation to the very able and distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, my dear friend from Rochester (Ms. Slaughter) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   And I will say, Madam Speaker, that I stand here with somewhat mixed emotions. While I am happy that we are going to finally ensure that our men and women in uniform who are on the front lines ensuring the safety of our fellow Americans are going to have the funding that is necessary, I'm saddened that we are here at this juncture considering this measure under a process which was not at all necessary. 
   Madam Speaker, if we had, literally months ago, months ago, come to this point, we could have, under regular order, very easily provided the necessary troop funding that is out there, dealt with the issue of unemployment benefits, which is going to be addressed, and ensure that we're not going to put into place a massive tax increase on job creators here in the United States.     
   So I will say, Madam Speaker, that we want to do everything that we can to, as expeditiously as possible, meet the demand that has been set forward by our leaders on the frontline in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   I hope very much that my colleagues will join with me. It's not normal that I would support this structure that would allow for same-day consideration of the measure, but I believe it is imperative that we get funding to our troops, and I believe that the measure that we're going to consider in just a little while from now will allow us to do that. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

   This measure that we are going to be considering later today is one that I believe we can have support from the United States Senate on and support from the President on. And we know full well that had that measure passed this House that we would have ended up right where we are today because the President would have vetoed the bill if it had gotten there, and most likely, would have not gotten through the Senate.

   Mr. DREIER. If I could ask my friend to further yield, I will say absolutely not. I will tell you that what I was talking about was the tax that is imposed on those people in upper income brackets, 82 percent of whom are small business owners in this country. That's the tax that we were talking about in the last measure, and that played a big role in leading those of us who want to ensure that we get this economy growing again that we would not, in fact, impinge on that by imposing that tax increase. 
   So I will say to my friend, let's move ahead. Let's make sure that we get the important funding to our troops so that we can be successful in ensuring our safety, and I thank my friend for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO HOUSE AMENDMENTS TO SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2642, SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I want to begin for the second time today by expressing my great appreciation to my very good friend and colleague, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was interestingly enough on February 5 of 2007, February 5 of 2007, which is exactly 500 days ago--500 days ago President Bush made a request of this Congress to provide supplemental funding for our troops to ensure that they have all the tools necessary to prosecute these struggles going on in both Iraq and Afghanistan, 500 days, a long period of time. But Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say that I believe that we've finally gotten there. 
   As I listened carefully to the statement of my good friend from Rochester, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, I have to say that I completely concurred with the first third of her statement in which she went through a very accurate description of exactly what this supplemental appropriations bill consists of. I could not disagree with her more on the second third of her presentation, and on the last part, I have sort of a mixed view. 
   When it comes to the first third, I will say that, again, I completely concur. This measure is designed to ensure that we get to our men and women in uniform the tools that they need, the resources that they need to continue this struggle. It ensures that the request and the directive by Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, raising very serious concern about the prospect of not being able to have the resources necessary is addressed. 
   She also in her remarks talked about the need to deal with the economic challenges that we face, and I completely concur. When we saw the largest increase in the unemployment rate in 22 years, a half a percent increase in the unemployment rate, it's clear that we want to ensure that those Americans who are very much in need are going to be able to have their concerns addressed by providing with that 20-work week requirement, which we've gone back to and which we supported in the early part of this decade in 2001 and 2002, that that requirement will  continue to be in place. So I wholeheartedly support that effort for the 13-week extension. 
   And she also talked about the need to ensure that we provide the resources for the veterans. For those men and women who have been engaged in this struggle and have come home, it is absolutely crucial that we do everything that we can to provide those very important resources for those brave and courageous men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, when it came as I said to the second third of Ms. Slaughter's presentation, I could not disagree more vigorously. She referred to the term ``political progress'' as being one of posturing. Well, I've got to say if we look at the independent assessments that have been provided by even some of the most harsh critics, some of the harshest critics of this war, there has been acknowledgment that this surge has worked. 
   All one needs to do is this week look at lead articles in both the Washington Post, hardly an entity that has been sympathetic with this effort, and the Associated Press. Both of those entities have strongly come forward and pointed to the tremendous progress that has been made not only, not only militarily but the political progress which has been made as well. 
   And so I have to say, Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleagues who have worked in a bipartisan way. I see Mr. Obey here. He just testified before the Committee on Rules and talked about his concerns, and he talked about the need to make sure that we move forward. 
   Our Republican leader, Mr. Boehner, has also worked very, very diligently on this, and I have to say it's interesting as we mark today the 500th day since the President made this request for supplemental funding for our troops, it's fascinating that this all came together within what is just about a maybe 28-, 29-, 30-hour period of time. 
   So I think that it's important for us to get this done. It's important for us to address these concerns which include the much-needed relief to those victims of the floods in the Midwest and the strengthening of the levees following Hurricane Katrina, and I believe that we have a wonderful indication of bipartisanship at its best here.  
   I am very pleased to finally take up a Rule for a Supplemental Appropriations bill that is based on bipartisan compromise that gets our troops the funding they need. And most important, it is a bill that the President can actually sign. I just wish we could have done this months ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, the request for supplemental funding for our troops came to us on February 5th of 2007--exactly 500 days ago. Since that time, we have heard hours of testimony from our military commanders, warning us in clear terms of the strains on our troops from the failure to fund them. For months, we have heard of impending layoffs of military contract employees. Of vital programs getting cut off or put on hold. The message was very clear: our armed forces in harm's way needed emergency funding in order to effectively continue their jobs. 
   But what did they get from the Democratic Leadership? Endless political posturing. Funding bills that were purely political documents, with no hope of being enacted. I find it very troubling that this partisan process could drag on for so long. 
   I find it very troubling that it took so long before there was an attempt at bipartisan negotiation to craft a good bill that provides for our troops and will be enacted into law. 
   After months of posturing, once the Democratic Majority finally reached across the aisle so that real progress could be made--how long did it take to reach a workable compromise? Mere hours. Once the dialogue began, Republicans and Democrats quickly came to a solution--a bill that funds our troops, while also addressing other priorities in a responsible way. 
   Today's underlying bill fully funds our armed forces. It will provide a new education benefit to veterans, without raising taxes. And it will extend unemployment insurance in these uncertain economic times, without eliminating key provisions to prevent fraud and abuse. This is a compromise that Republicans and Democrats can support, fulfilling our duty to the men and women who are in harm's way. This is a duty that we as a body must take far more seriously than the last few months have demonstrated. 
   When we are bogged down by the Democratic Majority's political gamesmanship, there are real-world consequences to these actions--or lack of action. 
   As we have heard from our military commanders over the past weeks and months exactly what these consequences are, one of the most troubling revelations came just last week. Adm. Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified that our commanders had run out of funds to pay for development projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is perhaps the most perverse outcome of the Democratic Leadership's failure to fund our troops. 
   Regardless of where you stand on the war, we all know and agree that the fight against extremism demands more than a purely military solution. Our armed forces are working to provide a security environment that allows for development to take place--and they are succeeding. But if we squander this opportunity, we will never succeed in the long term. We will fail to win hearts and minds, and we will fail to provide an alternative to terror and extremism. 
   The people of Iraq and Afghanistan need to see that our fight is not against them. They need to see that we support democratic institutions and the good governance that ensures peace, liberty and opportunity. Without our development efforts, our military efforts can have no hope for sustainable success. By stonewalling the troops' funding, the Democratic Leadership not only shortchanges our troops, they are blocking our efforts to assist in the development of the foundation for lasting peace. 
   This is an unconscionable policy. Especially at the very time that the seeds of reconciliation are starting to take root. For months we have known that the surge has succeeded in reducing violence. Even the war's harshest critics have begrudgingly conceded that violence has been significantly reduced. But they called it an empty victory, saying that the improved security situation has failed to bring about political progress. 
   But today, that is changing. Monday's lead AP story was ``Iraqi violence down, confidence in government up.'' 
   Tuesday's Washington Post announced ``Calm in Iraq Spurs Debate; Decline in Violence, Focus on Politics May Signal Turning Point.'' These are stories not just of reduced violence. They tell of the political reconciliation and progress that is now being made possible by the increased security. Iraqis are gaining faith in the Maliki government. And minority Sunni parliamentarians are heartened that a Shiite government would go after Shiite terrorists with the same zeal they go after Sunni terrorists. 
   Of course, this progress is fragile. Tuesday's terrible attack in Baghdad reminded us that while violence is diminishing overall, the danger of large-scale attacks remains very real. Furthermore, the political progress is still in its infancy. The Post story goes on to say ``analysts question whether the limited political accommodation among Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds can be sustained if the U.S. withdraws its forces quickly.'' It points out that Iran would love to fill any void that we create, and that Iraqis fear today's calm is simply the calm before the storm. Clearly, our mission is not complete. 
   But demonstrable progress is being made. After years of terrible violence, setbacks and enormous challenges, many of us have become desensitized to any signs of progress and improvement. But they are there. The tragic part is that any delay in providing critical funding puts this fragile progress in jeopardy. Today's underlying bill is urgently needed. While I am deeply sorry it has taken this long, I am truly pleased to finally have a bipartisan bill that will deliver our troops the vital resources they need.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was February 5, 2007, February 5, 2007, exactly 500 days ago, that President Bush made a request for supplemental funding for our men and women in uniform to ensure that they have the resources necessary to successfully prosecute this war. That is what we are here doing this evening now. 
   We are here because we have actually seen, based on reports that have come from some of the harshest critics of this war, that we are making progress. All one needs to do is look at the Washington Post the day before yesterday, the Associated Press story that has been referred to by a number of my colleagues. Time and time again we hear of the success that is being made in our effort to ensure that we are able to continue to enjoy our freedoms and that we have a world that has a greater degree of stability. Only the United States of America, only the United States of America, is in a position to do this.     
   Sacrifice has been made. Time and time again our colleagues have talked about the number of lives that have been lost. 
   As I listened to my friend from Chicago (Mr. Emanuel), he was referring to one of his constituents, I was immediately reminded of one of my constituents whom I refer to on a pretty regular basis here. 
   It was in the battle of Fallujah in November of 2004 that J.P. Blecksmith tragically was killed. His father, who was a former Marine from San Marino, California, has, on repeated occasions, to me said if we don't complete our mission, my son, J.P., will have died in vain. 
   War is an ugly thing, but it's not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing worth a war is worse. Those were the words of a very, very famous writer who wrote them following the Civil War. We are in the midst of a painful struggle. 
   But on this issue, I am very happy that we have been able to come together in a bipartisan way to deal with this. I congratulate my colleagues, Messrs. OBEY and LEWIS, for working together on this, and Mr. Boehner, who has provided great leadership in this effort. 
   We need to ensure that our men and women in uniform not only have everything that they need to successfully prosecute this war, but we also need to make sure that they have the tools necessary as they come back into our society. We have for years seen great warriors come back to the United States of America and work to make their country an even better place, and I believe that the provisions that we provide in here with these GI benefits will go a long way towards doing that. 
   The American people are hurting. We saw, as has been repeatedly said, the largest increase in 22 years in the unemployment rate, going up a half a percent. That's why, again, we have come in a bipartisan way to ensure that those who are truly in need, those who through no fault of their own, have lost their jobs, are able to see an extension in their unemployment benefits. 
   Again, I think that what we are going to be doing here in the next few minutes is we are going to be casting a bipartisan vote which will be done in the spirit of what the American people want us to do, and that is to get things done, deal with very, very important issues and problems that we face. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. RES. 734 EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CORRUPTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my very good friend, a new member of the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for his statement that was very thoughtful. But it actually in many ways buttressed the argument that I was making in the Rules Committee yesterday, that Chairman Waxman countered, that this resolution is little more than an attempt to try and appease this sector of the House of Representatives that wants this immediate withdrawal from Iraq, represented by more than a couple of my colleagues who are here right now. 
   I rise, Madam Speaker, in strong opposition to both this rule and the underlying resolution. Once again the Democratic leadership has shut down the normal, open legislative process in order to bring their substantively flawed legislation to the floor, and once again they must resort to a complete distortion of facts in order to advance their agenda. 
   They have the formula down pretty well, Madam Speaker. First, you pick an issue that no one could possibly oppose. In this case they have bravely come forward and taken a stance against corruption. Well, it is very impressive. Obviously we are all opposed to corruption. 
   Next, they slap together a resolution that ostensibly advances this position, but, in reality, twists the facts such that the issue is actually abandoned for purely political potshots; then shut down regular order so that no dissenting voice can be heard. 
   Finally, when all due process and substantive deliberation has been thwarted, attack those who expose their sloppy work by calling them ``pro-corruption,'' or ``anti-poor children,'' or whatever dark and sinister trope we are exploiting this week. 
   This is a well-worn approach that has been, unfortunately, standard operating procedure in this 110th Congress. What makes it so troubling this time is that it came from a committee whose  chairman and ranking member have generally worked in a bipartisan way, despite the Democratic leadership's very heavy-handed approach on so many issues. 
   The ranking member, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis), has been very eager to work constructively with, Madam Speaker, our California colleague (Mr. Waxman) who chairs the committee. They have worked together on a number of issues. And it was the same way when our friend from Fairfax, Virginia (Mr. Davis) was the chairman of the then Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, now the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, when Mr. Davis was the chairman and Mr. Waxman was the ranking member. 
   Mr. Davis has not shied away from taking a very, very honest and fair approach to oversight and speaking very frankly about the problems that are exposed. He has always concerned himself only with the facts, not the party affiliation of those who have come under scrutiny. 
   So why is it, Madam Speaker, why is it that the majority did not so much as share the text of this resolution with the minority before introducing it? Why did it not go through the regular committee process to vet the language? What exactly do they fear by allowing just a little bit of sunshine in their work? 
   Madam Speaker, when the Republicans on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform finally got to have just a little peek at this resolution, what they found were half-truths, distortions and blatant omissions. 
   Our friend from Virginia (Mr. Davis) offered a substitute that would modify the resolution by adding the critical information that the majority had omitted and correcting what was mischaracterized. The majority shamelessly but predictably shut out the amendment, in an apparent attempt to suppress any effort to expose the glaring flaws to their resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, all we have asked is to have a debate based on facts rather than on phony narratives and biased misinformation. I have no doubt that their side will continue this charade of a debate and pretend that this resolution is simply about exposing corruption and those who try to cover it up. 
   Madam Speaker, they can have their charade, but this side is going to actually talk about facts today, something that we are proud to regularly do, and, unfortunately, doesn't emerge too often from the other side of the aisle. 
   We will start with the issue of corruption in the Iraqi Government. It is a huge problem. It is a huge problem, corruption in the Iraqi Government, Madam Speaker. We all recognize that. The Iraqis recognize that. Today in The Washington Post a representative from the State Department made it very clear that the issue of corruption within the Iraqi Government is a serious one. The entire world recognizes the fact that there is corruption within the Iraqi Government. 
   Through a number of U.S. departments and agencies, including the State Department, we are funding a wide range of programs to find, root out and prevent corruption; to build the capacity of the Iraqi Government to fight corruption within its own ranks, which is what our goal is, making sure we fight corruption. We want to strengthen the democratic institutions that must be strong, transparent and enduring, so that the rule of law can prevail, and those who break the law will, in fact, be brought to justice. 
   That is what our goal is, Madam Speaker, and that is something that I believe we could address in a bipartisan way if Mr. Waxman and Mr. Davis had, in fact, had the chance to come together. Mr. Davis very much wanted to, but apparently he was rebuffed. 
   This is the primary goal of our policy, ensuring that we take on and root out and eliminate corruption within the Iraqi Government. And our efforts would be highlighted in this resolution, if its authors had not systematically struck the positive comments made by the very experts quoted in their text.     
   For example, they quote Judge Radhi Hamza al-Radhi as saying, and I quote, Madam Speaker, ``Corruption in Iraq today is rampant and has infected virtually every agency and ministry.'' That is what is in the resolution, Madam Speaker. They unfortunately in this resolution cut out the rest of the quote. 
   Judge Radhi went on to tell the committee, and I quote, Madam Speaker, ``The Iraqi people would hope that you continue your support to them, otherwise they will be suppressed by the neighboring countries.'' He went on to say, ``I believe if you help the Iraqi people to be managed and governed by an honest government, I believe that the problem will be over.'' Now that's the full quote from Judge Radhi Hamza al-Radhi. 
   To this key point, the very people that came before the committee to testify on Iraq's corruption problem also highlighted our attempts to combat it; and they begged us, they begged us, Madam Speaker, not to abandon them. A number of other key quotes were cut short in the resolution resulting in a skewed view of testimony. 
   They suppressed testimony from the Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction citing that the Iraq Government fully recognizes its corruption problem. They cut out the Comptroller General's testimony that this is an internal Iraqi problem which does not involve U.S. funds, and that the Iraqis face enormous challenges following decades of a dictatorship where, and I quote, ``corruption was woven into the very fabric of governing.'' 
   It is all there in black and white in the alternative that Mr. Davis presented to us up in the Rules Committee. 
   Of course, that full litany of the facts will never come to a vote in this House because of a decision that the majority leadership has made. They would rather cherry-pick quotes and give a distorted account of the facts. 
   Madam Speaker, the resolution's second major premise, which also suffers from being disassociated with the facts, is that the State Department has tried to cover up Iraqi corruption and has withheld pertinent information from Congress. Again, the majority can continue their pseudo-debate if they would like; but, Madam Speaker, on this side of the aisle, we are just going to stick to the facts. And the fact is that a portion of an unfinished, unvetted document was inadvertently leaked. When the report was ultimately finalized, portions were deemed classified in the interest of protecting sources whose lives would be threatened for their anticorruption efforts and to protect private conversations stemming from diplomatic efforts. 
   We can accuse the State Department of sloppiness because of the leak; we can play Monday morning quarterback and say that they shouldn't have bothered to classify information no matter how sensitive after it was inadvertently leaked. But to accuse them of trying to cover up information is a blatant mischaracterization of the facts. 
   Furthermore, Chairman Waxman has declined to release the transcripts of interviews with State and Justice Departments officials on the very issues raised in this resolution. State has also offered classified briefings to answer any and all questions that can't be addressed in an open setting. Now, Madam Speaker, according to the State Department, Chairman Waxman has declined that offer. It would appear that the authors of this resolution may not actually be interested in gathering this information. 
   In fact, it is ironic that a resolution accusing government officials of withholding information would cherry-pick quotes from testimony and suppress an amendment that tells the whole story. And it is ironic that its authors make these accusations while refusing to release the transcripts of its own proceedings and deny the opportunity for a full classified briefing. If they were truly interested in combating corruption or the full disclosure of information, they would have gone through regular order that developed legislation within the context of a full debate that includes the facts in the situation. 
   I would ask them to take the issue of corruption more seriously, Madam Speaker. This is an issue that has plagued our own government. We have wrestled for years over ethics reform, and we still haven't got it right. We are trying right now to bring to the floor earmark reform. We have a discharge petition in the well and we have encouraged our colleagues to sign that to deal with what clearly has been a bipartisan issue. It is an issue that has been wrought with corruption in the  past. We are trying very hard to address that. Unfortunately, the majority leadership refuses to allow us to bring to the floor earmark reform that would simply bring us to the standard that we passed in the last Congress. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, as we look around the world at democracies old and new, we see that no one has been able to completely root out the problem of corruption. I have the great privilege to work with my colleague, David Price, and 18 other of our Members as part of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. Our commission works directly with legislatures in developing democracies all around the world, and corruption tops the list of challenges every single time. 
   In every one of the 12 member countries that we have within the House Democracy Assistance Commission, this problem of corruption comes to the forefront. Endemic corruption threatens the very survival of real democracy, and that is why we are tackling the problem across the globe; and, Madam Speaker, Iraq is no exception. 
   Unfortunately, rather than furthering our efforts, the Democratic majority would rather sit in the cheap seats taking shots at the Iraqi Government awash in righteous indignation over trumped-up charges of a coverup. I would call on them instead to offer a meaningful bill that addresses the very serious issue of corruption and take it up under regular order. I would call on them, Madam Speaker, to allow their work to stand before the rigors of scrutiny and deliberation. 
   Madam Speaker, I am quite confident that we could all come together to work on a universally supported issue of combating corruption. As I said, we have these great models of Henry Waxman and Tom Davis who traditionally in a bipartisan way have worked together. I believe we could do that again. But, unfortunately, Mr. Davis was completely rebuffed when this resolution was introduced, as our colleague from Pasco, Washington (Mr. Hastings) said, in the Rules Committee last night, was introduced last Friday with no markup whatsoever, and then we brought it up last night in the Rules Committee. 
   Let's work to have a constructive, meaningful debate on this issue based on facts that actually attempt to do something grander than the political posturing that we are seeing with this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I look forward to yielding to my friend from Worcester if he would like to engage in a colloquy with me on this issue. 
   Now, my friend has basically stood here basically buttressing the entire argument I made in my opening statement. Who is it that's a proponent of corruption? My friend has argued, Madam Speaker, that if you are opposed to corruption, you have no choice but to support this resolution. 
   Here's the thing that concerns me greatly, and I'd be happy to yield to my friend if he would like to challenge me on this at all. Here's the thing that troubles me greatly, Madam Speaker. 
   As we stand here at this moment, we regularly have Members of the other side of the aisle accusing this administration of not coming forward with all the facts. And what is it that this resolution does? This resolution actually ignores the facts, and I will go through again the quotes from Judge Radhi Hamza al-Radhi who, in fact, said time and time again that the issue of our support for the effort of rooting out corruption in Iraq is one that must continue, and unfortunately, all we're doing is pointing a finger of blame here. 
   I would say to my friend that, as we look at this issue, why not seize the opportunity that the State Department has offered to make sure that you can have a full classified briefing and then make the determination as to whether or not something should or should not be classified? That's the way it should be handled, rather than this broad brush, sweeping approach saying that if you, Madam Speaker, are somehow opposed to corruption you have no choice but to support this resolution. 
   Of course we support the effort to ensure that we don't have corruption, but to see this ploy trying to paint people in a corner with just a little bit of the facts is, I think, a great disservice to our quest to root out corruption. And I believe very strongly, Madam Speaker, that it is essential for us, on behalf of the American people and on behalf of the model that we are trying to provide that corruption is bad, to make sure that this resolution provides all of the facts as we move forward.

   Mr. DREIER. Reclaiming my time, and I'd like my friend to continue because I'll yield to him in a moment, but for him to claim over the last 4 years that this administration has been indifferent to the problem of corruption is an outrage because the problem of corruption is something that has existed for years. 
   This administration and this Congress have been dedicated to rooting out corruption in Iraq. We've worked in a bipartisan way on it, and it's very tragic and I think a disservice to those who want to address the issue of corruption that we somehow are told that we only accept this resolution, that does not engage in providing all of the facts, that we somehow are tolerant of or supportive of a policy of corruption. 
   I'm happy to further yield.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, what I would like to do is to share with our colleagues some of the things that have been done over the past 4 years. 
   My friend mentions the fact that this administration has turned their back on the issue of corruption in Iraq. Let me just state, there has been technical training to build capacity, judicial reform. The National Endowment for Democracy has provided grants. There are international programs involved. The Iraq Reconstruction Rehabilitation Fund has increased the capacity of the Commission on Public Integrity by training, mentoring and providing equipment for the Commission on Public Integrity investigators, and aiding in corruption prevention programs, implementing financial management systems that remove some of the opaqueness that enables misuse of public funds to occur.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   It is very, very unfortunate that we are here trying to tackle the issue of corruption in Iraq and we are failing to look at the facts. The distinguished former chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, our friend from Fairfax, Virginia (Mr. Davis) has worked long and hard in a bipartisan way on the constitutionally mandated responsibility of legislative oversight of the executive branch. It's an issue which he takes very seriously. 
   He represents northern Virginia. He represents a lot of people who work in the executive branch, a lot of people who work in the legislative branch as well. He's an expert on these issues and he's been proud to work in past Congresses and in this Congress in a bipartisan way. 
   He's done that with my good friend and California colleague with whom we share representing the Los Angeles area (Mr. Waxman), the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. And traditionally, we've seen these two, while they've obviously had a different perspective on issues, we've seen their arguments propounded very, very thoughtfully on a regular basis, but they have been able to join on a wide range of issues. 
   And here we have Mr. Davis, who did have his staff last Wednesday get a copy of this resolution, but Madam Speaker, as you recall we had the funeral of our colleague Mrs. Davis, and we were not in on Thursday and on Friday we were not in session. And the members of the staff on the minority side were told on Wednesday that they were not to share this information, to wait until it was introduced on Friday. 
   Madam Speaker, it was introduced on Friday. We had not been in session for 2 days then, Thursday or Friday, and then all of a sudden this is brought up in the Rules Committee, no markup held whatsoever, no attempt to even get the briefing from the State Department. We've been told by the State Department that the chairman of the committee turned down the offer to have this briefing. 
   And so what can we conclude, Madam Speaker, other than the fact that there is gross politicization of this issue? Who is opposed to tackling the issue of corruption? I mean, it's motherhood and apple pie, and yet we somehow, because we want to get all the facts on the table, because we want to have an opportunity for a free-flowing debate, because we want the very respected ranking minority member to have a chance to have his substitute voted on in this House, we are somehow being told we are pro-corruption, we want to be part of a coverup. It is absolutely outrageous, Madam Speaker. It's a disservice to Democrats and Republicans of this institution to have this kind of treatment. 
   Madam Speaker, I have some closing remarks that I'd like to make, but we've just been joined by our very thoughtful colleague from Bridgeport, Connecticut, who is a hardworking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
   Madam Speaker, may I inquire of the Chair how much time we have remaining on each side?

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I am happy to see the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules has joined us here on the floor, and I have to say, Madam Speaker, that I am going to encourage our colleagues to defeat the previous question on this rule. Why? Because this resolution is all about tackling the issue of corruption. 
   One of the things that we tragically learned is there has been corruption not only in Iraq, and we all, including the State Department, recognize there has been serious corruption in Iraq. But there has been corruption right in this body as well. It has been widely heralded; it is bipartisan. We have had problems on both sides of the aisle. 
   We want to take on this issue of corruption. And there was a promise made last fall that we would in fact see a great new day when it came to the issue of earmark reform. I was very proud, Madam Speaker, that last October we were able to pass legislation that provided full transparency, disclosure, and accountability on all earmarks, appropriations, authorization, and tax bills. 
   Now, we were told that that measure that passed last year, Madam Speaker, was in fact a sham. And, Madam Speaker, I have to tell you that we have passed earmark reform in this Congress, but unfortunately it doesn't go nearly as far as the bill that we passed in the 109th did on the issue of transparency, accountability, and disclosure. Why? The disclosure we have today only deals with the issue of appropriations. It does not, as we did in the last Congress, have full transparency, disclosure, and accountability on authorization and tax bills. Meaning, Madam Speaker, that the structure that we have now, unfortunately, creates the potential for corruption right here in this body. 
   That is why, since we have in this resolution an attempt to take on the issue of corruption in Iraq, the vote on the previous question that we are going to be offering to defeat the previous question to make in order the resolution, that we have as a discharge petition that our Republican leader (Mr. Boehner) has offered in the well of the House. We hope colleagues will sign because that hasn't come forward. But what we are trying to do with the defeat of the previous question is to make in order that measure so that we can take on the issue of corruption in this institution. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we are able to make in order that measure. 
   I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record just prior to the vote on the previous question the text of the amendment and extraneous material.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to respond to the very distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules and say that the issue of corruption is one which we have taken on both in Iraq and in this Congress with great enthusiasm. And I would say to my friend that if she believes that somehow this nonbinding resolution, which does absolutely nothing, is going to somehow allow us to tackle the issue of corruption in Iraq with greater enthusiasm, that is preposterous, absolutely preposterous, Madam Speaker. 
   What we need to do is we need to have a fair, free-flowing debate that allows us to bring all of the facts forward. And that is what we have been attempting to do here; and, unfortunately, it just is not happening. Why? Because as my friend from Connecticut, a very thoughtful Member (Mr. Shays) has said, we are observing political posturing here, and I think it is a very sad day. 
   Let's take on the issue of corruption in this institution by defeating the previous question so we can bring forward real meaningful earmark reform, something that the new majority promised but not only has failed to deliver on but failed completely in getting us to even the standard we had in the last Congress. So vote ``no'' on the previous question and ``no'' on the rule. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, in this 30 seconds what I am going to say is we witnessed something that is virtually unprecedented here. The manager of the rule made it clear that he was the  last speaker and there was no one else. Now, I recognized the first time that I was enthused about hearing from the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules. And I exhausted the time allotted to us for our debate on the minority's side, and this is what we have gotten, a repetition of the same thing. 
   The issue of corruption, Madam Speaker, is something that we all want to take on; we want to take on with all of the facts before us. Our colleagues need to get the classified briefing and this information. I am going to continue to urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question and the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Let me begin by expressing my appreciation to my very good friend, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, the gentlewoman from Rochester, Ms. Slaughter, and I rise in opposition to this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are in week 4 of the National Football League season. The Washington Redskins have just defeated the Dallas Cowboys, the Kansas City Chiefs have just defeated the Denver Broncos; and we are, as a Nation, facing one of the most serious financial crises that we have ever faced. In fact, it's a crisis that only a few of our very, very senior Members who lived back in 1929 have ever experienced. 
   And what is it that we're doing here right now, Mr. Speaker? Well, we're considering a measure that will allow us to bring to the floor any item whatsoever for same day consideration, but in fact, we're not using this measure that is before us to deal with the very serious and important legislation that the American people very much want us to address. 
   I am vehemently opposed to any measure that would provide a blanket guarantee to bail out the people on Wall Street who have engaged in outrageous behavior jeopardizing the credit structure that exists here in the United States today. 
   And we know the kind of impact that it's having on our markets, we know the kind of impact it's having on the global economic markets, and we know that some action must be taken. 
   And what is it that we're doing here? Well, we're considering a same day rule. And I should say to the distinguished Chair, my good friend from Rochester, that I appreciated her compliment on my fine work in the 109th Congress, and I find it fascinating that my work product from the 109th Congress is now being held up as a model for the action that is taking place right here this evening. 
   I guess we're going to consider under same day something that's being discussed upstairs in the Rules Committee right now, the so-called tax extenders legislation. And it's legislation that we could very easily dispense with. We could dispense with it, Mr. Speaker, by virtue of taking up a measure that by a 93-2 vote passed in the United States Senate. Seems to me that a 93-2 vote would be pretty bipartisan, nearly a unanimous vote, to deal with the very important issues that the American people want to address when it comes to the tax side. 
   The outrageous alternative minimum tax that began in 1969 to go after 155 millionaires has now expanded to include 22-plus million Americans, and they are being unfairly taxed. They want us to address that measure. 
   My State of California is very important when it comes to the issue of looking at technological advances, and making sure that we extend the research and development tax credit is critical. Pursuing alternative energy sources like wind and solar, biodiesel, the kinds of creative green crude, the notion of looking at algae and utilizing that through present oil refineries today to try to bring down the cost of gasoline for the American people and for those around the globe who are seeking to decrease energy costs. 
   Well, I will tell you, we could deal with every single one of those items if we were to simply take that measure that has passed the Senate by a 93-2 vote. We could bring it up, and it would pass nearly unanimously, I believe, in this House if we were to do it. But instead, rather than focusing our attention on this very important credit crisis that needs to be addressed based on analyses provided by virtually everyone so that we are able to bring about the kind of stability that is necessary, or at least attempt to do that, whether it's from Wall Street to Main Street, from San Dimas Avenue, where I live, to 5th Avenue and every area in between, we very much need to do that, Mr. Speaker. And instead, we're going to be addressing--and the Rules Committee, as I have said, right now is holding a hearing on an item that will never go anyplace. 
   So that's why it's a real insult to the American people that we are here right now doing what we're doing. 
   But unfortunately, it is a pattern that we have seen in the 110th Congress. And while again, I'm proud that my record has been held up as a model, whatever criticisms that may have been leveled towards my record in the 109th Congress, the activities that we've seen in the 110th Congress really, really, really go beyond the pale. 
   In fact, I just read a speech that was delivered by our Rules Committee, the second ranking member behind Ms. Slaughter, our good friend from Worcester, Mr. McGovern, who, on the 29th of September, 2006, virtually 2 years ago, he gave a very strong speech right here on the floor in which he began to level criticism about the number of closed rules, the number of restrictive rules, the lack of open rules that existed in the 109th Congress. 
   I would like to say, Mr. Speaker, that this 110th Congress has transcended dramatically the number of closed rules, the fact that there are fewer open rules, the increased number of restricted rules. In fact, right now we're on the 65th, headed towards the 66th closed rule in the 110th Congress, Mr. Speaker. Again, while we were criticized harshly in the 109th Congress,  today what we're seeing is the highest number of closed rules in any Congress in the 230-year history of this great institution of ours. 
   So I have got to tell you that I am not about to support any kind of package that provides a blank check of $700 billion to those people on Wall Street who are responsible for the outlandish, outlandish behavior that's gone on and the problems that have existed. But I do believe that action does need to be taken. Action needs to be taken so that we can, in fact, stabilize the credit markets and bring about stability. 
   That's what we should be doing at this moment, Mr. Speaker. That's what we should be doing right now. We should not be wasting time on this kind of effort when we can very easily get a measure that by a 93-2 vote has passed the Senate and that the President of the United States is prepared to sign so that we can provide AMT relief to those 22 million Americans who desperately need it, so that we can make the research and development tax credit extended, so that we can have creative, new ideas, so that we can deal with incentives for alternative energy sources to play a role in bringing down the costs to the American people and those around the world who are looking for alternative energy sources that will be generated right here in the United States of America. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, I will say that I am very saddened that we're taking the action that we are, and I hope very much that we can defeat this rule so that we'll be able to bring up that proposal that, again, will provide that kind of relief, and it will get the measure to the Senate, it will get the measure to the President's desk. 
   And we know very well the Democratic majority leader, the majority leader in the United States Senate, our colleague from Nevada (Mr. Reid) has made it clear that he's not about to take up this measure from the House because they've passed, by a 93-2 vote, the item that the President of the United States is prepared to sign so that we can meet the President's goal here. 
   So I hope that we can defeat this rule. 
   And with that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Let me yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me say again that I believe that it is a mistake for us to be here imposing this martial law rule at a very precarious time in our Nation's history as we're dealing with the serious challenges that lie before us. 
   I'm going to urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question. And if the previous question prevails, I will urge them to vote ``no'' on this rule so that we will be in a position where we can bring up the very important item that will allow us to get AMT relief, allow us to provide incentives for alternative energy sources, and allow us to deal with things like the research and development tax credit, which are so important to this country.     
   And while we do everything that we can to ensure we do not give a blank check to those on Wall Street, I do believe that the American people want us to take action that will responsibly deal with the very important credit crisis so that automatic teller machines will be able to get cash to individuals; so that the small businessmen and -women throughout the United States of America will be able to have access to credit so that they will be able to continue to thrive as businesses; so that the American people who, in fact, have met their obligation in paying their mortgage, that they won't be saddled with the responsibility for people who have been less than responsible. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, and as I said, if in fact the previous question does pass, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it's important to note that a year ago this coming December, the structure that passed the United States Senate with this so-called not paid for is exactly what this Democratic Congress did to extend the alternative minimum tax, the R&D tax credit, and these other items 1 year ago. And so this is actually a change from what the Democratic Congress did a year ago to deal with this issue, and I thank my friend for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, like most of my colleagues, I'm mad as hell that we are here. This is a very troubling moment in our Nation's history, and it's taken an awful lot of difficulty for us to get to this point. 
   I'd respond to the remarks offered by my good friend by saying that there is enough blame to go around. I'm angry at Wall Street bankers. I'm angry at mortgage brokers. I'm angry at individuals who have chosen to live way beyond their means, creating an anger level among those very responsible Americans who are paying their mortgages, meeting their car payments, and their other responsibilities. And I'm angry at Washington, D.C., all the way around. 
   Mr. Speaker, the underlying financial rescue bill that is before us this morning is the product of very difficult negotiations to address extremely challenging economic circumstances. Our economy, as we all acknowledge, is under tremendous duress right now, and it can be felt all across America by individuals and families from all walks of life. 
   While the dire circumstances of recent weeks have dominated the headlines, working Americans have been witnessing our national economic woes for many months. Long before the fall of large investment banks or high profile bailouts, they felt substantial economic pressure. They have faced steeply rising energy and food prices, while fearing for their jobs and their homes. As housing markets have crumbled and the credit crunch has ensued, the gulf between Main Street and Wall Street has never seemed so huge. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, the reality is the two have never been more closely entwined than they are right now. Foreclosures on Main Street caused the  value of many Wall Street assets to plummet. The resulting credit crunch has paralyzed growth at businesses, large and small. 
   This, in turn, has stunted job creation and driven up unemployment. The falling stock market threatens working Americans' pensions, retirement plans, and savings. 
   From the very beginning of this process, Republicans have known that we needed to craft an effective rescue package that returns our entire economy to sound footing. We knew that we simply could take an approach that pits Main Street and Wall Street against each other. As housing prices have collapsed, job creation has stagnated and the stock market has fallen, we have all suffered. 
   An effective economic plan is badly needed to restore our economy and create opportunity and prosperity for all Americans. We simply don't have the option or ability to save Wall Street without creating opportunity on Main Street and vice versa. 
   This is not a battle of us versus them. Mr. Speaker, we have to remember that we are all in this together as Americans. 
   Republicans also knew that we had to find a way to balance two powerful but opposing forces: the urgent need to act expeditiously, and the imperative to act prudently and effectively. We understood the urgency of our economic circumstances, but we also know that rushing into a flawed approach would benefit no one and risk plunging our economy into deeper turmoil. 
   From the outset, we demanded strong protections for taxpayer dollars. We demanded transparency and accountability. We demanded that the financial burden of any assistance not ultimately lie with the taxpayers. We believe, Mr. Speaker, very strongly that these provisions had to be the pillars of any financial rescue plan, and we knew that we had the backing of our constituents in our efforts. 
   Over the past week, like all of my colleagues I'm sure, I've received hundreds of calls, e-mails, and letters demanding that the taxpayers do not foot the bill for the poor choices of troubled businesses. I have to say that the most interesting thing about the concerns that were expressed to me was that they were clearly growing out of a true grassroots movement. There was no advocacy group motivating those who were contacting us. There was no organized effort on the part of special interest groups. 
   I was hearing from hundreds and hundreds of working Americans who have been following the news reports and the negotiations. They felt very strongly that the initial proposal was simply unfair to the taxpayers. They told me in no uncertain terms that any deal without taxpayer protections, accountability and oversight was totally unacceptable, and with that, I'm in complete agreement. 
   Mr. Speaker, for several days our Democratic colleagues proceeded with negotiations without any regard for exactly these kinds of provisions that Republicans were insisting on. As a result, the negotiations went nowhere. Republicans were resolute in their insistence that any deal must not leave the taxpayers on the hook for this $700 billion rescue plan. 
   We are here this morning with a bipartisan package because we, as Republicans, remained committed to our principles and were finally given a seat at the table. The deal that has been crafted will allow the Treasury to unclog the financial markets and help begin the process of restoring our economy's strength and vitality, but it does so without providing a taxpayer-funded windfall for Wall Street. And I want to repeat that, Mr. Speaker. This package moves ahead without providing a taxpayer-funded windfall for those on Wall Street. 
   This bill requires companies to pay-to-play. There's no free lunch here. Any company that comes to us for assistance must cover their risk by paying insurance premiums, and their executives will not be able to walk away with extravagant compensation at taxpayer expense. This bill caps severance pay for participating companies. In the case of a total takeover, golden parachutes are banned entirely. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, the Federal Treasury will also get equity in the companies that ask for help so that the taxpayers will reap the benefits of their assistance. There will be bipartisan oversight of this process every step of the way, so that Republicans can continue to ensure full transparency and accountability. 
   Most important of all, the overwhelming message that has come from my constituents is that there must be no blank check. Treasury must report to Congress in order to keep the assistance program going; and, Mr. Speaker, after 5 years, if the taxpayers have lost a single penny in this process, the President will have to submit a plan to Congress to recoup the funds from the participating companies. 
   In short, the taxpayers have a 100 percent guarantee that they will not be left holding the check for this rescue plan, and we felt very strongly about ensuring that safeguard. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, we are all dismayed that we must take action at all. I don't believe any of us ever thought that we would face the grim reality of our current economy or the prospect of crafting a plan to rescue our financial markets. Because we, as Republicans, stuck to our guns, we have before us today a bill that will help to get our economy back on track without putting the burden on the backs of the American taxpayer. 
   With strong oversight, accountability and a guarantee that the Federal Treasury will be fully repaid, we can restore confidence in our economy. We can put ourselves back on the path to growth and job creation. 
   And perhaps most important, we can demonstrate to the American people that, when bipartisanship prevails, their demands are heard and implemented. 
   I have to say that as we listen to these messages which have come from our constituents, as I said first and foremost, there has been this very strong and compelling argument that the taxpayer not be responsible for shouldering this responsibility, but there were a wide range of other concerns that came to the forefront. 
   I have an e-mail that came into our office from a man in Arcadia, California, who wrote, I am writing to express my strong request that, with respect to the current financial ``bailout'' bill, you vote against it unless there's a provision that has been made to assure that those executives of companies that will receive funds in exchange for their under-performing mortgages, they are restricted in their ability to use government funds to pay excessive compensation. 
   And, two, that you assure that proposals to load union representatives onto the boards of these companies as a condition of receiving funds is removed from the legislation. There is absolutely no reason to add union representatives to public companies. If the unions want representation, they should purchase enough stock to be able to elect a board member. 
   This is a message that has come through consistently, and I'm happy to say, in this package, there is not going to be this government or union representation provided onto the boards of these companies. 
   There was also, Mr. Speaker, great concern raised by many of my constituents that the organization known as ACORN, which is a very, very controversial organization under very harsh criticism for improprieties, was initially going to be receiving funding, and I'm very happy to report to our colleagues that not one penny will be going to that organization known as ACORN. 
   There was another provision that had been included in the bill, Mr. Speaker, the so-called ``cram down provision,'' whereby we would see bankruptcy courts actually establishing something that the marketplace should do, that being the interest rates that are paid by those who hold mortgages. That is not provided. That is not going to be allowed under this provision. 
   And, also, I have to say that there's a so-called mark-to-market accounting structure, which has dramatically diminished the value of properties, and I personally believe that the mark-to-market accounting structure should be completely abandoned. This legislation calls for a study which I hope very much will lead to that because it has played a role in creating some of the tremendous inequities that we see in our economy today.     
   And as I mention in my statement, the notion that those on Wall Street,  who are in many ways responsible for this, would somehow be able to continue receiving these golden parachutes, multimillion dollar packages of benefits, the fact that we will prevent that with this legislation is something that I think is very, very important as we proceed. 
   And so, again, first and foremost, taxpayers, Mr. Speaker, should not be saddled with this responsibility. And this bipartisan package guarantees that they will not be saddled with this because of the fact that within this 5-year period of time the President, if one single penny of taxpayer dollars is found to have been utilized, there is a provision whereby the President of the United States must come to us with a package which will most likely call on those institutions which have been the direct beneficiaries of this program, will be forced to repay to the taxpayers those dollars. 
   So let me say that, as we look at this package, Mr. Speaker, there have been very understandable concerns. We all hate, we hate the fact that we are standing here dealing with this. And again, I will say there is plenty of blame, plenty of blame to go around. I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will want to expend time and energy blaming the deregulation and the policies that have been propounded over the past several years, but in the exchange that I had with the distinguished majority leader--now last night since it's 12:31 in the morning here in Washington--when I was last night in this exchange with the majority leader, we were talking about the challenges that existed in the post-depression era legislation that was moved forward. 
   And frankly, we, in the past several years, have been living with very antiquated, post-depression era regulation, and we have even seen the marketplace change dramatically. And over the past couple of decades we have seen a band-aid approach to respond to much of that depression-era regulation with which we still contend. 
   What is needed, Mr. Speaker, is a 21st century regulatory structure to deal with the freedom that exists in this 21st century marketplace. And that's why, while adequate accountability, transparency, supervision, and oversight is essential, I caution my colleagues who believe that with passage of this legislation they can embark on this very, very zealous quest to dramatically increase the regulatory burden on the marketplace. 
   The rest of the world has recognized that freedom is the answer; freedom is the answer and free markets are the answer. And that's why I hope that, as we move forward from this package, we do not in any way take a retrograde step in our quest to ensure that we pursue that. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute, and I do so to respond to the statement of my good friend from Houston, and that being that, when I said that there are some who have been living beyond their means, I know that there are people who, in fact, have been lured into particular products which have encouraged them to live beyond their means. And that's why, when I talked about adequate supervision and oversight to ensure that this doesn't happen, that's very important. 
   But I will say that, as I listen to my constituents, a message which has come through very loudly and very clearly, Mr. Speaker, is that people are upset when there are those who clearly have lived way beyond their means, when taxpayers who are paying their mortgages, meeting their car payments and other obligations are forced with the prospect of shouldering responsibility. And that's why I'm very, very pleased that we've stood forward, and that this package will not, in fact, thrust that responsibility onto the American taxpayer.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I do so to remind my California colleague, my friend from Sherman Oaks, that the fact of the matter is when we look at the way the premiums are handled today through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that guarantees that our constituents who have up to $100,000 in those accounts with the full faith and credit of the Federal Government behind them, if in fact that FDIC fund is in any way diminished, what is it that happens? There is an increase in the premium spread among those financial institutions. 
   Similarly as we look at the prospect and the guarantee in this legislation that the taxpayers will not be shouldering the responsibility of that $700 billion, what we have done is we have in place a mechanism whereby through the CBO reporting, the President is required to submit to Congress a plan which calls for an actual increase in that, primarily to be spread most likely among those who have benefited from the program. 
   And with that I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   And let me just respond by saying that the anger level among the American people reflected in those of us who are elected representatives is such that there is no way in the world that we would allow, that we would allow the United States Congress to thrust on to their shoulders this responsibility. And I am convinced that within 5 years as we look at those institutions that have been the direct beneficiaries of this program that if in fact there is one penny of taxpayer dollars exposed here, I have little doubt that just as is the case with the increase in premiums the banking institutions shoulder through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, this institution will make the taxpayers whole by saying to these institutions that have been the beneficiaries of this program that they must pay for that. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, as I said, there are a wide range of reasons that we are all angry that we're here. I am very, very angry that I am here. I know that my constituents are angry that we're here facing the challenge that we are. 
   But there is one thing that everyone will acknowledge: the United States of America faces a credit crisis. There is a crisis of confidence. And I want to make sure that throughout the coming weeks, months and years that when people who have deposits in financial institutions go to their automatic teller machines and seek to withdraw, that those dollars are there. Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure that when the hardworking, diligent, small businessmen and -women on Main Street are seeking an opportunity to take a brilliant and creative idea that they have and to get access to capital, that they are able to do that. I want to make sure that when people are seeking the American Dream of homeownership and they want to step forward and responsibly take on that obligation, that they are able to have access to that credit. I want to make sure that as we deal with this global economy, and the fact of the matter is, we, the United States of America, are shaping this global economy, and it is imperative that we continue to shape that global economy, so that we can pry open new markets for U.S. goods and services around the world. As we do these things, Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that we have a responsibility to put into place policies which will diminish the pain that we are facing today and play a role in instilling the confidence that is necessary to ensure that we have the credit that the American people deserve and desperately need. 
   Now, when this package came forward, there were a wide range of provisions that led my constituents to be understandably outraged. And I'm very grateful that as we stand here at 1 o'clock this morning--in just a few hours we will be voting on the previous question in this rule--I am very pleased that there are a number of provisions in this package which will make it acceptable to many. 
   First of all, I'm glad that we are not mandating that union leaders all of a sudden automatically be granted positions on boards of directors. I am very pleased that the very controversial organization known as ACORN is not going to receive one single penny from this program. I'm very pleased that we will not see the so-called cram-down provisions whereby judges would be able to distort the marketplace by completely reestablishing interest rates on mortgages. And I'm very pleased that under this package, we will be able to see that executives, executives who have heretofore been the beneficiaries through these so-called golden parachutes will instead get concrete shoes which will take them to the ground. 
   And I also have to say that as we look at the overall executive compensation packages, the fact is that we will not see companies who are part of this program continue down the road of very, very high levels of compensation.     
   I also have to say that, as we look at the structure, the existence of an inspector general and the work of the Government Accountability Office and as we look at the dramatically increased role that the United States Congress will play in oversight, it will go a long way towards ensuring the kind of accountability that this institution has to the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm going to call for a defeat of the previous question, and I  intend to offer an amendment to the rule which will make in order an alternative offered by my good friend from Virginia (Mr. Cantor). This alternative will stabilize the markets through privately funded mortgage insurance, using risk-based premiums with increased transparency. It will empower private investors to bring private capital off the sidelines to help us resolve this crisis. Most importantly, it will put in place strong oversight reform and corporate accountability. 
   Many of these provisions were developed as part of Mr. Cantor's working group, and some but not all were included in the final package. By defeating the previous question, we will be able to consider the working group's complete package as an alternative.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Dallas for yielding me the time, and I want to thank him for the very thoughtful arguments that he has made. 
   It's no wonder that we have the lowest approval rating among the American people in the history of this institution. I don't know where it stands right now, maybe it's 12 percent, I remember seeing several weeks ago, maybe a couple of months ago, that the approval rating for this institution was at 9 percent, 9 percent. 
   I think that this measure right here is a perfect indication as to why the American people have such a low opinion of the United States House of Representatives and the Congress overall. 
   We have been presented with a measure which would allow us to provide incentives for alternative energy sources, an opportunity to address the very, very unfair tax that has been imposed since 1969, started out taking on 155 people, now it's over 22 million Americans who are unfairly facing the alternative minimum tax, mental health parity, the research and development tax credit, which is very important to my State, a litany of important items. Unfortunately, we are not doing that. 
   How do we do it? Just as our friend from Dallas said so thoughtfully, the majority leader of the United States Senate, Harry Reid, was able to move through the Senate by a 93-2 vote, 93-2 vote, the measure that would have allowed us to address these very important issues. 
   Unfortunately, we have decided to pull a stunt, and it really can only be described as a stunt, because we know that what we are doing here is going nowhere, and we are doing this at 9:22 when the Philadelphia Eagles are playing, and we have got people focused on a lot of other things. But most important for this institution, we have the responsibility of trying to deal with the very serious credit crisis that exists in this country. We have chosen to waste time on something that is going absolutely nowhere, as everyone knows. 
   Now, I will say that I feel very strongly about the need to ensure that we do not provide a $700 billion blank check to those on Wall Street who have played a big role in exacerbating the credit crisis that we have in this country. I have been hearing from the people whom I am privileged to represent in Southern California, and they join me in expressing their outrage, as I know Americans all across this country do. 
   Why? Because there are people who are responsibly paying their mortgages. There are people who are responsibly meeting their financial obligations. To take their hard-earned tax dollars and utilize those dollars to bail out people who have been less than responsible is something that is outrageous. 
   That's why, when we know it is essential that we take action and do something to deal with this credit crisis, we need to do it in a very deliberative nature, and we need to ensure that there is accountability, transparency, disclosure. We need to make sure that a blank check is not provided to those people who have engaged in such terrible, terrible behavior. 
   That's what we should be dealing with at this moment, rather than proceeding with this measure that is going nowhere. I have to say that even as we look at this measure that is going nowhere, it is flawed in an important way. It's flawed in an important way in that it actually ignores a very important energy alternative. 
   What is it that I have got in this vial? I would say to my friend from New York, it's something called green crude, green crude, which was developed by some professors from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, through a company called Sapphire Energy. Frankly, over the last couple of decades, a lot of effort has been put into looking at the development of algae as an energy source. 
   Our colleague from San Diego, Mr. Bilbray, has just provided this to me. We have the potential to take algae, what people see growing in swimming pools, if those swimming pools aren't being cleaned, algae, and turning that through existing oil refineries, into gasoline to power automobiles to deal with the environmental challenges that exist out there. Guess what: This bill has no incentive whatsoever for pursuing the very important alternative energy source the people of California, and I believe the people around the country would like to see us pursue, that being so-called green crude. 
   My point is, we have a very flawed measure before us, a very flawed measure, but at least we should be able to deal with the alternative minimum tax, the research and development tax credit, and some incentives for alternative energy, and mental health parity, by taking the measure that has passed the Senate by a 93-2 vote and just be done with it and expend our time and energy and effort deliberating over the very pressing credit crisis that exists in this country. 
   My friend from Dallas is absolutely right when he says that we are going to call for a ``no'' vote on the previous question. The reason that we want to defeat the previous question is that we will be in a position, if we defeat the previous question, to do exactly what 93 of our colleagues in the other body have chosen to do, and that is take up a clean tax extenders measure. 
   Now, I know, and I had an exchange with the distinguished majority leader, my friend from Maryland, a couple of days ago and the fact that there is a desire, even though Mr. Reid has said that he does not want to take up the measure out of the House, to deal with having this tax extender bill paid for.  But the fact is, exactly 1 year ago, this coming December, when we looked at the extension of the alternative minimum tax, what happened, we chose to proceed basically as the United States Senate has today. 
   I know that time and time again we hear arguments about how measures should be paid for. Yet if you look at what has been paid for and what hasn't been paid for, it's fascinating. The farm bill, for example. No pay-fors whatsoever, as we proceeded with the farm bill. 
   If you look at the other items that have come forward, there is a pick-and-choose standard for what is going to be paid for and what is not going to be paid for. We know that the American people, 22 million-plus who are saddled with the penalty of the alternative minimum tax, very much want relief. We can do exactly what we did last year and take this unfair tax and make sure they are not saddled with that burden. 
   We also know that the majority leader in the Senate, Mr. Reid, has said very clearly that he is not about to take up this flawed measure from the House of Representatives. He has made it clear. I am standing here, as a Republican, making the argument that has been propounded by the majority leader, the Democrat, in the United States Senate. 
   What we need to do is defeat the previous question. When we do so, we will be able to bring up the Senate measure, and we will be able to send that then to the President's desk, because I am convinced that we will have strong bipartisan support for that measure to deal with these important issues, not just the alternative minimum tax, but tax incentives for alternative energy sources, wind, solar and other very important items that my constituents in California and people across the country want, mental health parity, another important issue. Then, again, in our State of California, I know in the State of Maryland and other States in the country, all kinds of innovative, creative ideas are coming forward, and that with a measure that by a 93-2 vote passed the Senate to deal with the research and development tax credit, we will be able to move forward.     
   Then we will be able to expeditiously proceed with the very important question of dealing with our Nation's credit crisis. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join with the gentleman from Dallas, Mr. Sessions, in this quest to defeat the previous question. If by chance the previous question passes, then I do urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Let me just say, and I know that's obviously the position of the majority leader, but I would hope very much that if we would agree to bring that measure up under suspension of the rules, that we would be in a position to have that bill. And I know the majority leader would be able to do that. 
   Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, that on the issue of regulation, which my good friend from Maryland raised, there is a lot of talk about the fact that there has not been enough regulation. I will say that I believe that oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is something that was very important and has played a role in exacerbating the economic challenges that we have, number one. 
   Number two, my friend referred to Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression. And we, today, Mr. Speaker, continue to live with what is little more than a Band-Aid approach to dealing with very antiquated, early, 20th century regulation that was put into place following the Great Depression. And much of that regulation played a role in exacerbating the Great Depression. And while we have attempted, Mr. Speaker, to deal with changes, it is very, very apparent that the marketplace has moved dramatically ahead of the regulatory structure. 
   And so what we need, and I know what Senator McCain and what we believe is essential, is that we have a 21st-century regulatory structure to deal with the 21st-century economy and 21st-century markets that exist  today. That is something that I hope will be the silver lining to emerge from the very dark cloud of the economic challenges that we have today. 
   And I also have to say in response to an argument propounded by the distinguished majority leader, that if we believe that the economy is in great shape today, take no action. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend, the majority leader, that no one, no one believes that the economy is in great shape today, and we all are trying to work in a bipartisan way to make sure we deal with this credit crisis. And while I am virulently opposed to any measure that would provide a $700 billion blank check to those on Wall Street who are, in many ways, responsible for this problem, I do believe that it is essential that some action be taken to ensure that ATMs are able to get their cash out, so that small business men and women will be able to have credit so that their businesses can thrive, so that we are able to get our economy growing again. 
   So I will say, Mr. Speaker, that economic growth is absolutely essential. And it is true that we are in the midst of an economic slowdown today, but it is also apparent that, following the tremendous challenges that existed in the early part of this decade that began with the tragedy of September 11 of 2001, we have enjoyed strong, bold, dynamic economic growth up until recently. 
   And so the notion of arguing that all of the policies that have been put into place, tax cuts that have stimulated economic growth are somehow responsible for the economic slowdown today is preposterous.     
   We need to look at the fact that we have had an antiquated regulatory structure that should have been providing adequate oversight in dealing with this issue, and I join with my colleague in urging a ``no'' vote on the previous question so that we can bring up the Senate bill. And if that passes, a ``no'' vote on the rule.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) for yielding me time. 
   I thank Mr. Clay for his management of this measure. And I join with my colleagues, Ms. Lofgren and the Republicans who have joined as cosponsors of this very important resolution. 
   A week ago at this time, Mr. Speaker, there were no fewer than 14 major fires with hundreds of thousands of acres on fire in Southern California. As we know, nearly 2,000 homes were destroyed in those fires and we went through a number of very, very challenging days through last week. And while we still have fires raging, we have had a great deal of success. We have had a great deal of success in the aftermath of these fires due to the stellar leadership provided by Governor Schwarzenegger; by President Bush; and our Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff; the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, David Paulison; and a wide range of other local governments involved. And I have to say the leadership of our congressional delegation has really been a great example. 
   We are joined on the floor here by my friend from San Diego (Mr. Bilbray) whose district was impacted. And last Thursday I had the privilege of traveling with our colleagues, Senator Feinstein, and I see Congressman Filner is here as well from San Diego, and others who joined with the members of the San Diego delegation who were there to have the chance to see firsthand the devastation that was caused by these fires. 
   Brian Bilbray is someone who has, time and time again, stepped up to the plate to deal with challenges that he has faced in the San Diego area, and what we saw last Thursday was another example. He was able to take the Governor of California and the President of the United States to meet individually with those who had been victimized by the fires and for all of us to join with Mr. Filner and Mrs. Davis and Mr. Issa and Mr. Hunter in talking to those firefighters who have come from all over, not just the State of California but from around the country.     
   Now, Mr. Speaker, the State of California is the State that is best equipped to deal with the disaster of fires. And I say that because California has this very unique structure known as a Unified Command. Now, what that consists of is, rather than having these disparate firefighting organizations come into an area and take on the issue of dealing with fire, the Unified Command means that the highest ranking fire official, the fire chief in a particular area that knows that county, with the canyons and the valleys and the challenges geographically that they face, is there to provide the direction and the leadership. And that is the reason, Mr. Speaker, that we have had such success within the past week in dealing with what was described by a 36-year veteran battalion chief from San Diego as the worst fire that he has ever seen in California's history. 
   I also want to say that I express appreciation to our colleagues from all across the country. We have, again, firefighters who came from around California and around the country; and I know it was in large part due to the encouragement that our bipartisan Congress, that Members on both sides of the aisle of the Congress, from both the House and the Senate, have provided in encouraging these courageous firefighters to come forward and provide the assistance necessary. 
   There are going to be challenging days ahead, as my colleague, Ms. LOFGREN, said, Mr. Speaker. We obviously are going to have to deal with  continued fighting of the fires and also rebuilding. And there also will be, I believe, a very important debate as we look at the days and weeks and months ahead, and I'm talking about the challenge we face in dealing with disasters. 
   We know that fire is just one of the multifarious disasters that we deal with in California. There are disasters that hit other parts of the country. I think we need to have a debate on the role that the Federal Government plays in dealing with these disasters. I have talked with a number of people who are interested in now getting involved, the Center for Strategic International Studies, John Hamre there, I've talked to Director Paulison about this. 
   We have, again, a great deal of work, but at this time, this resolution is designed to focus on the fires in California and express our appreciation for the support that has been provided, and also our thoughts and prayers for those who have been victimized by this. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I thank all those who have been involved in supporting this resolution.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank the distinguished Republican leader for yielding. As the leader has said, this is a circumstance that does bring to mind the Deficit Reduction Act controversy which created a huge stir in this place and one with which we are still trying to contend. 
   I just heard that the Rules Committee was scheduled to reconvene at 6:30 this evening to report out the Duncan Hunter Defense Authorization bill, and I have been told that there's going to be some attempt made in the Rules Committee to deal with this issue in that rule. That's the word that we have been hearing over here. 
   I thank my friend for yielding. If he would yield to the distinguished majority leader, I would like to have us enlightened on the prospect of this.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   I would just like to raise one other point that should be part of those discussions. If I could remind our colleagues, one of the items that was debated vigorously during consideration of the farm bill happened to be the issue of the baseline numbers that were used. We are poised at this moment to bring up a budget resolution which will raise a question as to exactly what baseline level is used and what pay-fors might be out there. So I think that we have some very serious questions that are raised. 
   My friend from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg) just reminded us again that for us to conclude, as the distinguished Republican whip has said, that this bill somehow would have passed identically in the exact same form is a real stretch. For that reason, I think that we have lots of questions that need to be addressed before we do proceed. 
   I thank my friend for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise to express my appreciation to my very good friend from Massachusetts for yielding me the time and for his effort in getting us to the point where we are. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I do rise in very, very strong opposition to not only this rule, but the underlying legislation, H. Res. 78, as well, which, as the gentleman has said very clearly, will authorize the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote on legislation that is on the House floor. 
   I must confess that I am broadly disappointed in how we have arrived here. I am disappointed that we are here again debating a proposal which is, I truly believe, at its heart, unconstitutional. 
   While I have the utmost respect for my colleagues from the territories, and from the District of Columbia, if they want to vote in this body, Mr. Speaker, they should begin the statehood process, plain and simple. They should pursue that with great vigor and enthusiasm. And those who are the strongest supporters of it now have a majority in this House, which, I believe, should allow them to proceed with that effort if they so choose. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, reasonable people can disagree as to the merits of this proposal. We are going to hear an awful lot this morning. However, I am also disappointed that we find ourselves in a situation where my colleagues at the Rules Committee have, once again, rolled back the transparency that I was very proud to work so diligently on behalf of when I had the privilege to serve as chairman of the committee. First, it was the ability to enforce the rules regarding putting record votes in committee reports. Thrown out the window. Next, rather than following the example that I was privileged to set in the 109th Congress of conducting  actual hearings and markups of rule changes, we find ourselves, Mr. Speaker, without the benefit of hearings with outside witnesses, without a committee report explaining the committee's thinking, without any opportunity for the minority to have its views published as part of the legislative history. 
   And I understand full well, Mr. Speaker, this, for the average American, is seen as inside baseball stuff. But deliberative democracy is something that is very near and dear to the founding of this country, the very basis on which our Nation was founded. And last night we had a great speech from the President of the United States that was delivered here in which he talked about our goal of working together. 
   But more than that, Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed about how my colleagues are approaching the most basic tasks of the Rules Committee. The Rules Committee is the all-important committee of the House, the traffic cop through which every major piece of legislation must go before it is considered here on the House floor. With the exception of privileged resolutions and items that we consider under suspension of the rules, what we really do here, and the appropriations process, we have tremendous responsibility. I argue that the Rules Committee is the single most important committee that exists in this institution because of the very, very unique role that we play. 
   I am so disappointed in how I have seen the basic handling of this committee. Any of you who have had the honor to serve as Chairs of committees know the challenges of crafting an agenda, of building support and moving that support forward. But as chairmen, we have a basic responsibility to maintain those very basic workings of the committee to ensure that Members have the documents that they need to discuss and debate matters that are before them. 
   Now, I don't want to belabor this, Mr. Speaker, by going through the particulars of yesterday's meeting, but I have to say it is very, very disappointing. Let me just say that my colleagues failed, the majority failed, at the most basic responsibilities, which disappoints me even more. 
   The last time this body considered, Mr. Speaker, the issue of Delegate voting, it was as part of an opening day rules package. The rule was changed, despite bipartisan opposition. That rule change led the then minority leader, our friend Mr. Michel, to file a lawsuit against the House to stop Delegates from voting on the House floor.     
   Well, the courts upheld the rule. They did so only because of the parliamentary sleight of hand which makes the right conferred on our colleagues illusory, illusory at the very best. 
   Mr. Speaker, 14 years later, this body is made up of 299 Members, 299 Members who were not here, never had a chance to vote on this issue before. And as I said, even back then there has never been a hearing, never been a process for us to hear from the scholars who clearly, clearly would spend a great deal of time and energy considering whether or not we should proceed with allowing the people who are not Representatives from States to have a chance to vote on the House floor. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this is a very, very bad rule. It is a bad, bad, bad process. And what we witnessed last night in the Rules Committee was one of, if not the greatest, disservice to this institution that I have ever seen, it clearly is up there as one of the most pathetic and sad and disappointing things that I have ever seen. 
   As I said before, if my colleagues want the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to enjoy the benefits conferred upon Representatives of the several States, they should encourage efforts to achieve statehood. There is nothing, nothing, Mr. Speaker, to be served by moving this unconstitutional rule any further in the process. 
   And to the point that was offered by my friend from Massachusetts on this notion of a substitute provided, I was taught very early on when I came to this institution more than a quarter of a century ago that you do not amend a bad bill. There is nothing that can be done in the amendment process that could make this constitutional. 
   And this notion that we have gone the entire route, the United States Supreme Court has not considered this, Mr. Speaker. I believe that what we are going to do here today, if it in fact succeeds, what we are going to do is we are going to embark on another legal struggle just as we did 14 years ago. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule. And if the rule does prevail, I urge them to vote against the underlying resolution, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, my friend and classmate. We came together in 1981. I came a little before he did because he came in a special election, Mr. Speaker. He knows that I have the highest regard for him. We have worked very closely in a bipartisan way on a number of issues, and one of the things I was most proud of over the past several years was that my friend carried in his breast pocket quotes of mine on things that I said what we were in the minority about, the need for greater deliberation. 
   We considered, as my friend knows, a very noncontroversial issue, that being the extension of suspension days from Monday and Tuesday to Wednesday. We did that 3 years ago, a little over 3 years ago, and it had very little controversy to it. We began a very deliberative process. We had a hearing on that. Again, there wasn't much controversy. 
   And now I am going to take this opportunity to extend the quote of my friend, if he will indulge me, when he, on June 23 of 2003, at our Rules hearing on this said: ``The lack of free and fair debate on such important matters is an embarrassment to the Members who are privileged to serve. It demeans the House, it cheats the American people, and it offends our democratic traditions. Unfortunately, tactics designed to shut down debate are not an aberration; they are becoming the norm.'' 
   And, Mr. Speaker, all I would say to my friend is that the sort of unpleasant debate that we are witnessing right now underscores the fact that moving through the procedure that we have to the House floor without a single committee hearing, without the input of scholars who might talk about the impact on this institution, on the American people, on the rights of American citizens, is something that we should consider. And that is the concern that we have. And I believe what we should do is withdraw this measure from the floor and go through regular order. 
   I simply offered, as the ranking minority member now of the committee, an amendment in the rule that would simply say that if I could offer, as the ranking member, the committee of jurisdiction, a germane amendment, I would like to have a chance to do that. And I was voted down in that quest. 
   Let us do proceed with what the gentleman has argued passionately for. He and I are both institutionalists, Mr. Speaker. Let us do allow the kind of deliberation that is essential to consideration of such an important issue.

And that was, in fact, denied us on a party-line vote that we had in the House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, then I will yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, this has been a very, very sad debate. It has been a sad debate because of the lack of deliberation and the lack of the consideration. 
   The issue is, at best, controversial. I listened to the remarks of my very good friend, who, as I just told her, spends more time representing me now that we have this 5-day workweek than I do myself as a Californian because we spend so much time in the District of Columbia. Her remarks go right to the point of concern that we have raised about this process and why we are where we are at this juncture. 
   As I look at the other Delegates, and we have just heard from the Resident Commissioner, we obviously have the utmost respect for them, their service, and the great representation that they provide. And, over and above that, the issue that everyone has mentioned since the focal point of the State of the Union address delivered here by the President last night is that, as we prosecute this global war on terror, it is essential that we respect and revere every single life that has been lost in that struggle. And we know that there are many people who have come from the District of Columbia and from the other territories who have paid the ultimate price, and we are in debt to them for that. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, the thing that is very troubling to me is that we are at this point, without having ever given any kind of committee hearing, without any discussion or debate, and with a process upstairs that I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will acknowledge was really a great travesty and an injustice. 
   I want to express my appreciation to Mr. McGovern. Mr. Speaker, Mr. McGovern, when we were considering this rule upstairs, did make a good-faith effort in trying to offer a proposed compromise to this rule, and unfortunately he was denied the chance to do that.     
   As we look at the issue before us, many of us are troubled about the constitutionality of this, and our friends have basically just on the other side of the aisle discussed the court decision on this issue, Mr. Speaker, by saying what was stated by the circuit court. They used the word ``meaningless'' to describe this vote, and it was true, as I said, legerdemain, legislative sleight of hand, that they were able to at this juncture move through those two courts as they did with this measure. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, my plea to my very good friends and colleagues in the majority is simply let us go through the process of deliberation. Let us go through committee hearings. Let us hear from those very thoughtful scholars who so often testified before the Rules Committee in the past on a wide range of issues that we considered, and then after we go through that deliberative process, this process of democracy which we all hold near and dear, then I believe we could have a proposal that we could bring to the floor, if possible, to consider this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I said, I am very, very, very disappointed at the way this whole issue has been handled, and frankly, as my friend from Marietta said earlier, all of the closed rules that we have had on these measures that were brought before us, we were told that when we got beyond the Six for 2006, that things were going to be much different. 
   A professor at my alma mater, Claremont McKenna College, wrote in the Orange County Register yesterday that that is like saying, I will respect you in the morning. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have seen a continuation of a clamp-down of deliberative democracy, and what we are faced with here at this moment, offer of a substitute aside, has denied the deliberation that this very important issue deserves. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, and if by chance the rule does pass, I urge strong opposition to the underlying resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to House Resolution 78, which will allow the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote on the House floor. 
   My colleagues who support this measure will talk about how the vote granted under this change in the House rules is merely symbolic and the votes cast don't count. But, Madam Speaker, that analysis says that the value of a vote is worth little more than its ability to be used in a press release or a letter to a constituent. I value my vote. I consider it to be an extraordinary honor to serve here, and I believe that the Delegates and the Resident Commissioners should and would desire to value their votes as well. 
   Those who advocate granting the right in the Committee of the Whole have apparently forgotten the full name of that committee. Madam Speaker, we are in the House right now, but when we are in the Committee of the Whole, it is called the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. I underscore the word ``Union.'' We need to remember that. 
   The Union is made up of the several States, and only Representatives from those States may vote here on the House floor. That is what the U.S. Constitution says. 
   Yes, the Committee of the Whole finds its roots in the British Parliament, but the modern House of Representatives and the 17th century British Parliament used the Committee of the Whole for two vastly different purposes. 
   We use the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the purpose of allowing the House of Representatives to expedite the amendment process and to allow for a more free-flowing debate. We do not, and I underscore this, Madam Speaker, we do not use it to say that we are no longer the House of Representatives, and therefore allow us to close deliberations to emissaries of the Queen. That is not what going into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union is about. 
   Madam Speaker, my colleagues from the territories and the District of Columbia feel disenfranchised, and I understand why. They enjoy many of the benefits granted to the citizens of the several States. However, with the exception of the District of Columbia, their representatives are different. For instance, some pay income taxes differently; some not at all. Some are subject to the recently increased minimum wage; others are not subjected to the recently increased minimum wage. 
   This change in the House rules is an end run around the United States Constitution. The court said so when it upheld the rule. Because the Constitution limits who can wield legislative power, in order to pass muster the rule had to make it appear that Delegates and Resident Commissioners had none. 
   It is the ultimate in illusions, Madam Speaker. When your vote counts, it doesn't count; and when it doesn't count, it counts. I will say that again. When your vote counts, it doesn't count; and when it doesn't count, it counts. That is really what we are doing here. 
   But we all know that Member voting behavior is far more subtle than my colleagues have led on. A recent academic study of voting patterns in the 103rd Congress showed that while the Delegate voting rule was in place, there was a drastic increase in the number of votes retaken in the House. While there were only three automatic revotes pursuant to the Delegate voting rule, there were a total of 75 votes taken in the Committee of the Whole that were retaken in the House of Representatives. 
   Madam Speaker, on those revotes, the study shows there was an average of 31 switches per vote, and that out of the 435 Members, 403 switched their vote at least once, and that there was an average of 3.9 switches per Member. While the Democrats will argue that the Delegate voting rule had no effect on the switching, there is no doubt that the rule change drastically increased the number of revotes here in the House of Representatives. 
   Madam Speaker, if we want to grant the Delegates the right to vote, we have, I clearly believe, two options: Either they need to start the path towards statehood, or we need to change the United States Constitution. I know full well, Madam Speaker, that both of them are long, difficult paths, but they are clearly preferable to this parlor trick of a rule. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (SELECT INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT PANEL -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Let me begin by saying that I really am somewhat surprised at the remarks of my very good friend. First of all, if you look at the fact that we focused very enthusiastically on the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and implemented 39 of the 41, we had a challenge in dealing with the issue of jurisdiction. And I have got to say, Madam Speaker, that if you look at the question of jurisdiction and making very important changes in jurisdiction, it is one of the single most difficult things that is to be done. 
   And I will tell you, I see my friend from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) here, the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations; 13 years ago, he and I had the opportunity to serve on what was known as the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress. And we had a tough time looking at the issue of jurisdiction. 
   And you know what, Madam Speaker? After the work of that commission, and unfortunately, when the new majority was in power back then, none of the recommendations of that commission were put into place. None of the brilliant ideas that Mr. Obey propounded were put into place at that time. 
   But when we came to majority in 1994, Madam Speaker, I still have scars on my back to show how difficult it was to bring about major jurisdictional reform. And I have to say that it is a very, very difficult thing to do, but essential. At that time, we consolidated, basically eliminated three standing committees. I had Members on both sides of the aisle at that time come to me and say that the future of the Republic was jeopardized if we did not keep the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the District of Columbia Committee, and the Merchant Marine and Fisheries committee. My God, if we didn't keep that in the place, we as a Nation were going right down the tubes. 
   But guess what? We eliminated those committee. We reduced by 20 percent the number of subcommittees, and it was very tough. We were going through a transition, as we had Members who  were looking forward to taking on the gavels. 
   And then something that was equally difficult was dealing with the post-9/11 situation, the Department of Homeland Security. We had to put into place a committee structure here that allowed us to establish this committee on Homeland Security that we have today, taking jurisdiction from other committees. 
   Similarly, we had a very tough time when it came to the Energy and Commerce Committee and what was then called the Banking Committee, trying to bring that together. It is very tough work. And it saddens me that this great opportunity that is here, like the one we faced in 1994, is slipping away with the measure that we are considering right here. 
   For that reason, Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 35, this resolution that provides for simply a new oversight committee for national intelligence. 
   Madam Speaker, as we all know, the five most important words in the middle of the preamble of U.S. Constitution are ``provide for the common defense.'' Part and parcel of that responsibility is effective oversight of the Intelligence community, both to ensure its success and to protect our liberties. 
   Now, the 9/11 Commission correctly identified significant deficiencies in our national intelligence apparatus and, yes, our oversight of those agencies. The 9/11 Commission, as I said, made 41 separate recommendations. Through enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act, the Homeland Security Act, the 9/11 Recommendation Implementation Act, and I was proud to serve as a conferee in that effort, our majority took affirmative steps to implement nearly all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. 
   Is there more that remains to be done? Of course there is. We all acknowledge that. As long as America has enemies, Madam Speaker, we will need to re-evaluate and improve our Nation's defenses. 
   Does the resolution before us do that? Absolutely not. Unfortunately, it doesn't. 
   The 9/11 Commission recommended two options for intelligence oversight. First, a joint committee based on the model of the old Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, and second, a single committee in each House of Congress combining authorizing and appropriating authorities. The proposal in front of us today does neither of those things that were recommended by the 9/11 Commission. In fact, it goes in completely the opposite direction, Madam Speaker. Rather than consolidating oversight authority into a single committee that has both authorizing and appropriating authority, it just creates a new committee that has neither, doesn't have either of those powers. So while the 9/11 Commission recommended one committee, we will have three committees dealing with this very important issue. 
   Further, I am unsure as to what authority this committee actually will have. Having been in the midst of jurisdictional struggles, as I said, for the last decade and a half, I know what it means. As far as I can tell the only authority that this committee has is to write a report to the same people who serve on the committee. They could write a report and give it to themselves. 
   And the 9/11 Commission was very specific about who should serve on the committee. And I quote from the 9/11 Commission report, Madam Speaker, they said, ``Four of the Members appointed to this committee or committees should be a Member who also serves on each of the following additional committees, the Armed Services Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.'' 
   Now, Madam Speaker, where are the members of the Armed Services Committee, Judiciary Committee or the Foreign Affairs Committee? 
   Apparently, those aspects of our intelligence activities weren't important enough for the promised improved oversight. 
   Now, did the Republicans enact, as I said, every 
   9/11 Commission recommendation exactly as they wrote it? No, we didn't. But, we didn't promise to, and I quote from Speaker Pelosi, ``to make our Nation safer by implementing all of the recommendations of the independent bipartisan 9/11 Commission.'' 
   Now, Madam Speaker, Republicans made sure that there was good communication between the administration, our authorizing committees and Appropriations Committee on intelligence matters. That has made a difference over the last few years. We all know that very, very well. The fact that we haven't had an attack on our soil is, to me, evidence of the success of this administration and the role that this Congress played. 
   I don't believe that creating committees with both authorizing and appropriating authority, and we have the distinguished former chairman, my always chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my good friend from California (Mr. Lewis), here, and I know he would share my concern about this merger. But it is something that is worth considering. 
   Frankly, that notion concentrates a lot of power and erodes some of the very important checks and balances that exist in the committee system. But, frankly, it is very important to note that this resolution does away with even the pretense of bipartisanship. 
   I applauded enthusiastically when Speaker Pelosi talked about her quest for civility and bipartisanship. And it has been said time and time again, unlike our resolution in the 109th Congress establishing the bipartisan Katrina panel, I remember very well when we put that together, established it, and it did great work. Unfortunately, this resolution, the resolution on Katrina gave the minority the right to appoint its members. This resolution authorizes the Speaker, the Democratic Speaker, to appoint the Republican members of the committee, without any consultation with the Republicans at all. 
   The tradition in this House is that each party caucus is responsible for its own appointments. And this resolution, for the first time ever, does away with that precedent. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, unfortunately, I never got a chance to make those arguments where I should have made those arguments, with my very good friend from Fort Lauderdale (Mr. Hastings) where? Right upstairs in the Rules Committee. 
   As I argued here at the end of last week when we had this measure before us, we had, for the first time in the history of this institution, the first time ever, five closed rules brought up in the opening day rules package of the House. Unfortunately, the Rules Committee has been thrown completely out the window when it comes to this. 
   And last week, when we debated this, we had a total of 5 minutes to debate the opening day rules package and five closed rules, without bills being introduced, without committee hearings, without the process whatsoever and without even giving us, the struggling minority, upstairs in the Rules Committee the opportunity to have our amendments denied. We didn't even have the chance to have our amendments denied upstairs in the Rules Committee. 
   All I am saying, listen, I am loving my role here in the minority, Madam Speaker. It is really a great opportunity to be able to represent the people of California here. But I will tell you, Democrats and Republicans alike all across this country have been treated very poorly in an unprecedented way. 
   Now, I believe that many of the Commission's recommendations were right. That is why we implemented so many of them. But this resolution that we have before us is wrong when it comes to this opportunity that we unfortunately are allowing to slip through our fingers. We are not being given the chance to put into place the very, very important jurisdictional reforms that are needed to deal with this issue. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me at the outset say to my good friend from Fort Lauderdale (Mr. Hastings), one of my staff members encouraged me to have his words taken down when he accused me just a few minutes ago of being disingenuous when it came to the introduction of House Resolution 38. That resolution, as the gentleman knows from the parliamentary inquiry that I engaged in, was designed to simply point to the flaws and the way this measure was crafted. Now, that resolution in no way called for the merging of the authorizing and the appropriating process. I simply said at that point that that was a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. 
   I would be happy to yield to my friend if he can, in fact, point to me where in the resolution I introduced, House Resolution 38, it states that there should be a merging of both the authorizing and the appropriating process. And I am very happy to yield to my good friend from Fort Lauderdale.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I introduced the H. Resolution 38, and I support it much more so than I do the resolution that we have here. The reason being that I believe very much that there should, in fact, be consultation in a bipartisan way rather than having unilateral decisions made by the Speaker of the House over the minority in this Chamber, as Mr. LaHood said so well, an unprecedented action that has been taken. And my point is, there is nothing in the resolution that I introduced that does what led the gentleman to call me disingenuous. I, in the spirit of comity as set forth by Speaker Pelosi in her opening remarks, am not going to have the words of my friend taken down. I do not engage in name calling on the floor of this House, and even if people want to continue that towards me, I refuse to respond. 
   Madam Speaker, let me close by making a couple of remarks about what it is that is before us here. About 6 months ago in July, my very distinguished colleague, the new chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee of Appropriations, and he also will be serving as the chairman of the very important House Democracy Assistance Commission, and I am looking forward to serving now as the co-chairman, the ranking Republican on that committee; last July we went on our mission to help build democracies, build the parliaments in these fledgling democracies around the world. And I am very proud, Madam Speaker, that we have been able to do this in 12 countries. Last July, we were in Nairobi, Kenya, meeting with members of the parliament. When we were there, we had an opportunity to go and visit the site of one of the greatest tragedies to take place in our Nation's history, and that was before September 11, 2001. In 1998, our colleagues will recall that the embassies of both Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were brutally attacked by al Qaeda. We all know that that happened, and we know there was a response at that time. We finally got the news last night that we have been able to see, with regional support, support of the Ethiopians, support of the Kenyans, who very courageously have stepped up to the plate; we launched an air strike in southern Somalia against al Qaeda that was successful, successful in making sure that we make another blow against those who inflicted the worst attack in modern history against the United States of America. 
   Madam Speaker, I argue that that kind of success was not an accident. That kind of success in launching that strike against those who attacked the United States of America, both here on our soil and on our embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, was done because of our effective leadership in the United States of America in prosecuting this Global War on Terror.     
   Now, I believe that as we look at what it is that we are doing here, it is very admirable. We know, as Mrs. WILSON said earlier, a promise was made to implement all of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We are very proud of the fact that 39 of the 41 recommendations that were made by that commission have been put into place. 
   What we have before us is something that is very ill founded, and it is an attempt to respond to that promise. 
   But one of the things that I have learned, Madam Speaker, when you do something simply for the sake of doing something, it is probably the wrong thing. Madam Speaker, I do believe very fervently this is the wrong thing. 
   Now, I have here a copy of the rules of the House, and as I look through the structure that put into place the committee on which Mr. LaHood has served so proudly, the Intelligence Committee, it calls for membership from the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on International Relations, the Committee on the Judiciary, and it makes the Speaker and the minority leader ex-officio members. And it in fact does call for the Speaker to make the appointments. It traditionally is done in with consultation with Members of the minority. 
   Madam Speaker, it is important to note that is what the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is all about. We have virtually the identical structure being put into place for little more than a feel-good measure. That is really what it is. It is to be able to say, yes, we have this committee. 
   I am going to say, as I did when I opened this debate, Madam Speaker, Mr. Obey and I worked on that joint committee on the organization of Congress back in 1993. We had 37 hearings, and 243 witnesses during that 2-year period came before us. Those numbers have stuck with me because that was a great opportunity I had to serve, along with our colleague, Lee Hamilton, interestingly enough, who was the co-chair of the commission on the House side, and PETE DOMENICI and David Boren, the father of our colleague, DAN BOREN, co-chaired the committee on the other side. 
   We looked at a wide range of changes, many of which I am proud to say we implemented. We talked about the issue of jurisdiction, but we didn't come up with firm recommendations. But when we took over, before a single Republican Member got their hands on the gavel, we saw them put into place recommendations. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution, and I urge a vote for my motion to recommit that I will be offering forthwith. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, as virtually everyone is talking about the need for us to have an economic stimulus package, I am very proud today to be introducing what I think is the closest thing to a panacea to the economic growth challenge that we are facing. 
   This plan that I have introduced is the brainchild of my friends Bill Simon, Jennifer Pollom and Mike Boskin. It is a plan that is designed to allow people at the lower end of the spectrum on their first $40,000 in income to pay 10 percent, on income between $40,000 and $150,000, 15 percent, and on income above $150,000, 30 percent. 
   It also, Madam Speaker, goes to the notion of encouraging economic growth by cutting the capital gains rate from 15 percent to 10 percent and cutting the top corporate rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. Remember, we have the second highest rate in the entire world when it comes to corporate tax. We need to focus on the issue of economic growth. It will actually apply the death penalty to the death tax, and it will take the alternative minimum tax and index it and ultimately eliminate it. 
   Madam Speaker, this is what we need to do to stimulate our economy. This is what we need to do to empower the people who will move and propel our economy forward. I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to join as cosponsors of this very important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (EXPRESSING SORROW OF THE HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD, MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, let me begin by expressing my appreciation to both of my California colleagues, Ms. Watson and Speaker Pelosi, for their very thoughtful words, and, obviously I would, as all of my colleagues I know want to do, would associate ourselves with the very, very thoughtful remarks offered by Speaker Pelosi. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a very sad time for me personally, for a number of reasons. JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD was my friend and my neighbor. And she was my neighbor not only in California representing an adjoining congressional district, but my neighbor right here on Capitol Hill. We were next-door neighbors. So, Madam Speaker, I have to say that I had the privilege of spending a great deal of time with JUANITA.  
   As Speaker Pelosi said in her statement that she released yesterday, JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD truly was a trailblazer. She was an individual who showed amazing commitment throughout her entire life to her beliefs, and I was very happy that she as a Democrat and I as a Republican were able to work together and find areas of agreement. 
   I have to say one of the biggest challenges that we face in Southern California, I know my California colleague Ms. Watson understands this very well, is the area of transportation. The gridlock challenge, as is the case with many metropolitan areas around the country, is particularly bad in the Los Angeles area. JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD served on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and worked tirelessly to try and focus on those challenges, the difficulties that we faced. 
   There was one particular project that I was pleased to work with JUANITA on, and that was something known as the Alameda Corridor Project.     
   A huge percentage of all of the goods going to and from the United States, exports and imports, come through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. JUANITA represented large parts of Long Beach, and she understood the importance of international trade. So she was one of those in the vanguard in the quest to deal with construction of the Alameda corridor which allowed those goods to move from the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to the rest of the United States and, similarly, goods exported from America. I am very happy to see the distinguished Chair of the Transportation Committee, Mr. Oberstar, nodding in agreement. He knows how important this issue is, and he worked very closely with JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD and all of us who have been involved on that issue. I know she championed it with great enthusiasm. 
   I also would like to say she was a very proud alumna of the University of Redlands. She went to the University of Redlands at age 40 and got her degree from the University of Redlands. One of the reasons I am proud to point to that is the distinguished former chairman, now ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, Mr. Lewis, has specifically asked me to raise this issue. 
   As I said, we were neighbors. As Speaker Pelosi correctly pointed out, while a number of us knew that JUANITA had not been well, very few knew of the seriousness of her illness. I remember standing with my two California colleagues, Ms. Watson and Mrs. Napolitano, just last week, and we talked about making a video that we were going to provide for JUANITA because we knew she had not been well. 
   So her passing has come as a great shock to every single one of us. She is the first woman to ever chair the Committee on House Administration. She was a trailblazer on so many issues. Her passing is a loss to my State of California and to this institution and to the entire country. 
   Madam Speaker, at this point I am going to ask unanimous consent that my California colleague, Mr. Calvert, be able to manage the time from this point forward, and with that I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1908, PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding and I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to my friend from Miami for his very thoughtful and eloquent statement going back to 1790 and the role that patents have played in the very founding of our country. 
   I want to say also, as I look around the floor and think about the Rules Committee meeting that we had, I see the distinguished gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud) who was joined by Mr. Manzullo in the Rules Committee last night, my good friend from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), who was here on the floor. 
   What I will say is that there is bipartisan support for this bill, Mr. Speaker, as my good friend from California (Mr. Berman) correctly said, but there's also bipartisan opposition to this bill, Mr. Speaker, and it is for that reason that I believe it is absolutely imperative that we do, as Mr. Diaz-Balart has pointed out, have the most open and transparent process imaginable in dealing with what is seen as a very dull issue. It leads many people to doze off or their eyes to glaze over when talking about patent law, but it is a critically important issue when we think about the basis of the United States of America and property rights and all. 
   While I intend to support final passage of the underlying legislation, a great deal of concern has, in fact, been raised on a number of issues included in this bill, as I said, making it a perfect example as to why this fully open and transparent legislative process, which unfortunately this restrictive rule denies, is a mistake and shouldn't be done. 
   The underlying bill deals with a tremendously critical and fundamental aspect of our economy. It addresses a significant problem but in a way that has raised concerns, and it involves incredibly arcane and technical policy. For all of these reasons, we should be allowing a full and open debate, and I see my friend Mr. Gohmert here who I know has also joined in raising very grave concerns about where it is we're going on this issue. 
   We should be encouraging a greater flow of information, not cutting it off, and unfortunately, this restrictive rule does just that. 
   Ensuring both the protection and the quality of patents is absolutely essential in our high-tech, knowledge-based 21st century economy. A cursory glance at the state of patent litigation is all it takes to see that we haven't gotten it quite right. Patent trolls acting maliciously and bewildered juries facing impossibly technical cases have wreaked a great deal of legal havoc on many of our Nation's great entrepreneurs. 
   The result has been to stifle innovation, the lifeblood of our economy. We've seen some of the worst cases eventually reversed on appeal, but many others have not been. There's no denying that there is great need for reform in our patent law system. 
   However, the underlying bill before us today is not perfect. Real concerns have been raised by a number of innovators and research institutions, many of whom are critical, in this effort, from my State of California, but critical to our economy and our place as one of the world's greatest fonts of innovation and entrepreneurship. 
   We have to be very careful that as we address one problem we don't create another. We have to be very careful that we don't pick winners and losers in our patent system, but that we protect and uphold intellectual property of all kinds. 
   The creators of computer hardware, the developers of revolutionary medical treatments, for example, use patents in very different ways. A piece of hardware may include hundreds of patents, some of which will be obsolete practically before they hit the shelves. 
   On the other hand, a biomedical firm may spend $1 billion over a decade developing a single product using a single patent. Now, Mr. Speaker, these two types of innovators use patents in very different ways, but what they have in common is that intellectual property and innovation are at the very heart of their work, and they both contribute significantly to our economy and to our rising standard of living. 
   We must ensure that our patent system protects both kinds of innovation. While I strongly support the need to move this process forward, these are real concerns that must be fully aired and openly debated. I find it troubling that unlike previous legislation dealing with the issue of patent reform, this bill does not enjoy broad-based support among all types of intellectual property creators. Because consensus was not reached in the committee process, it is all the more important that our floor debate be conducted in an open and transparent way. 
   Yesterday in the Rules Committee, as my friend from Miami said, I proposed that we report out an open rule so that we could, in fact, have a full debate on these issues. Unfortunately, on a party-line vote, that proposal was denied. 
   We also heard, as I mentioned, from our colleagues, Mr. Manzullo and Mr. Michaud, who were requesting at least two hours of general debate, divided not just between Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, but between supporters and opponents of this bill. Again, as I said, it is bipartisan, the opposition, as well as bipartisan, the support, for the bill. That request unfortunately was also denied. 
   Absent a meaningful debate today, these concerns will have to be raised in the Senate and in the Conference Committee. It's unfortunate that our Democratic majority has so little institutional pride that they continuously deny this body an open debate and cede the hard work to another time and another place. 
   That is why I'm encouraging my colleagues to oppose this restrictive rule. We shouldn't be running away from a fair and honest debate of these tough issues. The underlying bill and the issues it addresses are too important for us to be shirking our responsibilities.  
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this rule, and let's have a real debate on this very critical matter. And I, again, thank my friend for yielding.

And I would like to, at this moment, mark the extraordinary service of a woman who has chosen to retire after nearly 50 years of working here in the Capitol.

She is someone who was working in this Capitol when President Kennedy was assassinated, and she regularly has shared with us stories about that. 
   She always showed up to work at 5 a.m. regardless of how late we were in the night before. We could be here, and she can be working downstairs midnight, 1 o'clock, but she was always back here coming in with our friend, Sally, at 5 o'clock in the morning. 
   She has provided extraordinary service and sustenance to so many of us. Janie, after a half century, has chosen to retire. I want to wish her congratulations, a very happy retirement, and a very, very merry Christmas.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2829, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to the rule. I know that this is a rule that follows the 200-year tradition that we have had of appropriations bills as privileged resolutions. They have the ability to come to the floor without a rule at all, but if items are protected in the bill, they have to provide waivers from the Rules Committee, and that is what has been followed here. We did this when the Republicans were in the majority and the Democrats are following suit here. 
   But there are a number of concerns that have come to the forefront. To me, the most important concern, Mr. Speaker, is one that I raised upstairs in the Rules Committee last night. 
   The Committee on Ways and Means had put into place a very important program in September of 2006 which deals with an issue that is near and dear to every single American who pays taxes. That issue is ensuring that every single American pays their taxes. I don't like paying taxes. But I do it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't like the fact that there are people out there who don't pay their taxes when they are supposed to do it. The challenge of collecting taxes is a very, very important concern of, as I said, every American who does pay their taxes. Collecting taxes is a very important thing, too. Making sure that people do comply with the law is, I believe, an imperative that we need to do all we can to enforce. 
   Unfortunately, this appropriations bill that we are bringing forward is one that actually eliminates a program that has been extraordinarily effective. It is a program, Mr. Speaker, that has been utilized now by the Federal Government and by 40 of the 50 States. What does it consist of? Simply contracting with private collection agencies, PCAs, to ensure that people who are deadbeats, who are not paying their taxes, actually pay their taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, this issue does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. I see Mr. Rangel here and other members of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. McCrery sent a letter to us in the Rules Committee saying that he believed that this rule should not allow protection for a point of order to be made against the provision about which I am speaking.     
   So, Mr. Speaker, I feel very strongly about the need for us to make sure that the Ways and Means Committee can have the jurisdiction, and, frankly, keep in place this collection process. So far, $19.4 million has been collected from people who have not paid their taxes by these private collection agencies, and the projection is that over the next 10 years in excess of $1.5 billion will be collected by the Federal Government from these people who have been deadbeats and have not paid their taxes. So I think it is very unfortunate that this bill proceeds with this, and the fact that this rule does not provide us with an opportunity to address that has led me to oppose it. 
   I also want to say, Mr. Speaker, that there is going to be an effort to defeat the previous question, and if that is done, our colleague from Nebraska Mr. Terry is going to offer an amendment to the rule that would make in order a provision that would allow for the rejection of the cost-of-living adjustment. 
   I know there is a lot of talk around here about that issue, so we are going to be having a vote on that. Our colleague from Nebraska, as I said, Mr. Terry will in fact be the author of that amendment if we did defeat the previous question on this issue. 
   Having said that, I do want to say there are a number of items in this bill that I think are very good and important. I am particularly proud of having worked for a number of years on the issue of financial literacy training for students and for adults as well. 
   We see this proliferation of advertising, Mr. Speaker, that continues to come down from a wide range of entities, and it can be confusing. Unfortunately, there are many young people today who really don't have the grasp of the financial instruments that are options to them out there. For that reason, I believe that something in this bill that is very good is the effort to focus on the increase of financial literacy training. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to praise my colleagues, especially Mr. Regula, who has taken on this responsibility here as the ranking member of the subcommittee, and Mr. Serrano, who is chairing the subcommittee. I praise them for working together in a bipartisan way on some other items that are very important. 
   As I said, I believe that interdicting illicit drugs is a very important issue. This drug trafficking issue was a topic of discussion in the last debate that we had on the Andean Trade Preference Act that we are going to be voting on later this evening, and I believe that there are, again, many, many other items that are included in this bill that are good and decent and appropriate measures. 
   But I just am very, very concerned about this issue, as I said, Mr. Speaker, of this notion of people abusing the tax provisions and not, in fact, paying their fair share of taxes. So I feel strongly that taking advantage of these private collection agencies is, in fact, the right thing to do. I know there is concern voiced about that, because people don't like being harassed. But you know what, Mr. Speaker? If they are not paying their fair share of taxes, I believe steps should be taken to try and get them to do that. So this is going to lead me to oppose the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my very good friend from Greensboro, North Carolina (Mr. Coble).

If a finger of blame is being pointed, I guess at our side, we have delayed the process of completing the appropriations work, all I am saying, Mr. Speaker, is that this was a commitment that was made at the beginning of the 110th Congress.

In fact, as we look at the rules that have been passed out so far through the appropriations process, in the last Congress, we made in order every single amendment that was proposed to the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, and as the gentleman knows, only three of 23 amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee when it came to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee bill were made in order which did in fact limit the debate. 
   All I would say, Mr. Speaker, is my friend from Sacramento has come forward and said she is going to offer an amendment to the rule. I am concerned about it, the fact that it was not included in the rule and it has just come to our attention. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would say to my very good friend from Wisconsin, welcome to the challenge of governing, as he knows very, very well. 
   The fact of the matter is there was, in fact, at the beginning of this Congress, a statement made. And what has been proposed by my colleague from Sacramento is an amendment to the rule to deal with the Budget Act. All of a sudden, we are going to just waive the responsibility here to deal with this question, and I just think that the procedure around which we are now taking this action on this amendment underscores that our colleagues are having a little bit of difficulty governing. 
   Let me just say that I am opposed to this rule for a number of reasons. I would like to restate the concern that I raised earlier. 
   I had a chance to speak with our colleague from New York, the distinguished Chair, of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel. I told him of a letter that was sent to the Rules Committee from Mr. McCrery which raised concern over the fact that there are people out there who are completely abrogating their responsibility to pay their fair share of taxes. They are not complying with the law. And in September of 2006, private collection agencies were enlisted by the Federal Government to begin the collection of taxes from deadbeats who are not paying their taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, 40 other States, 40 other States have enlisted private collection agencies, and they have been successful, and at the Federal level, we have, as of March of this year, seen $19.47 million collected so far, and the projection is that under these private collection agencies in the next decade, we will see between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion in taxes that are owed to the Federal Government paid. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, if we pass this rule, we are undermining the ability of the Ways and Means Committee to take on its responsibility for this issue. So I will urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule so, in fact, we will have an opportunity to do the right thing when it comes to this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE ACT EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this extension. I want to congratulate the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the subcommittee chairman, and of course my very good friend and fellow Californian (Mr. Herger) who joins with the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means Mr. McCrery in moving this effort forward in a bipartisan way. 
   As I listen to this debate, I heard my colleague from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) malign the issue of trade saying that she very much wants to see trade agreements that create American jobs. I could not agree with her more. I very much believe that as we look at trade agreements that we have put into place, recognizing that we have an excess of a third of a trillion dollars in cross-border trade between Mexico and the United States of America following implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, that has demonstrated that what we're doing here this evening is just a very small step in establishing these very important agreements with Peru and Colombia. We hope very much that we can do it with Bolivia and Ecuador, and we hope very much that we can do it with Panama. 
   And frankly, as we look at those agreements, what is it that those agreements will do? They will lower the tariff barriers that exist preventing U.S. workers from having opportunities to send their goods and services into those very important countries in this hemisphere. 
   I join with my colleagues who have underscored the fact that the threat of Hugo Chavez and other leaders in this hemisphere is a very serious one. The anti-American sentiment is high, and it's being fueled by Hugo Chavez. He is very much opposed to these free trade agreements. He is very much opposed to any opportunity to expand commerce within this hemisphere. And that's why, for national security reasons, for job creation reasons, and to benefit consumers right here in the United States of America, it is very important, Mr. Speaker, that we have strong bipartisan support for this effort. And let it lay the groundwork for us to pass these important trade agreements for our future.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. And I thank him for his very thoughtful statement, as always, in his management of the rule. 
   I want to begin by extending congratulations to all of those who have worked long and hard on this important conference report, Mr. Cardoza, and I see Mr. Hastings here, I know are strong supporters of it. And I know that there is, in fact, some bipartisan support for this measure, but I will say that I personally am troubled with it and I am going to be voting ``no'' on the conference report when we get to that point for a number of reasons. 
   I do feel very strongly that as we look at the international food crisis that exists with over a billion people on the face of the Earth facing either malnutrition or out-and-out starvation, it seems to me that we need to take very strong and bold steps to address that. I don't think that dramatically expanding the food programs and feeding is the solution to the problem of a billion people who are facing malnutrition and starvation. I happen to think there are a number of very important factors that unfortunately this farm bill doesn't address. 
   First and foremost, it's key, as we look at the fact that developing nations in the world have failed to open up their markets so that they can get onto the first rung of the economic ladder, they are preventing us from having the opportunity to address that crisis of starvation and malnutrition. Similarly, we in the United States and the European Union have unfortunately provided two-thirds of the farm subsidies that exist in this world. And guess what? That creates a great distortion and further diminishes the opportunity for those developing nations to address this very important malnutrition and starvation crisis facing one billion human beings. And so I just don't believe in any way that this measure effectively addresses that. 
   And I think, again, as a number of people have said, if we were to see the European Union diminish its level of subsidization, then we would do that. I was very happy in the Rules Committee last night that for the first time our good friend from Minnesota, the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee, did indicate that he would ultimately support that. In the past he hasn't, as I know he has said publicly and in conversations that I've had with him privately on that. 
   But nevertheless, it's imperative for us to show leadership on the issue of dramatic taxpayer subsidization of the agriculture sector of our economy. It is just plain wrong. And I hope very much that my colleagues, based on that, if they sincerely want to address this starvation crisis facing a billion people, they will oppose this measure. 
   Now, there was an interesting debate, Mr. Speaker, that took place earlier on and has been going on. And Mr. Hastings made a very, very compelling argument. Now, this is all inside baseball. I know our colleagues understand it, and there are maybe some outside of this Chamber who are following this debate. And it looks like it's very arcane. I mean, we've got copies of the rules manual and we're looking at this whole question of PAYGO and 2007 versus 2008. Well, this comes down to a very simple and easily understood issue, and let me put it this way: 
   Yesterday we had a debate on whether or not we should, in fact, prevent 70,000 barrels a day of oil from going into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And the idea behind that was, of course, if we do increase the supply of energy, prices might come down. Well, guess what? The people whom I represent in southern California would very much like to be able to pay maybe $2.50, $2.75 a gallon. And you know what? If you go to last year, they were able to pay significantly less than $4 a gallon for gasoline. 
   Well, how does that relate to the debate that we're having right here? Very simply. What is it that our colleagues in the majority are calling for? And that is, to use last year's numbers, to  use last year's numbers, not this year's numbers, in this debate. So that's what it comes down to, Mr. Speaker. It is just plain wrong. I would like to pay 2007 prices when I go to the pump and fill up, and unfortunately I can't. And you know what? This majority should recognize their responsibility in the exact same way. 
   Now, as Mr. Hastings said, last night in the Rules Committee I offered what I thought was a very thoughtful amendment to the rule. Everyone continued to say this is PAYGO-compliant, this complies with PAYGO. Well, in one single sentence in the report, Mr. Speaker, they, in fact, provide the most confusing explanation. It says, ``Therefore, while there is a technical violation of clause 10 of rule XXI, the conference report complies with the rule by remaining budget neutral with no net increase in direct spending.'' What does that mean? So it begins by saying there is a violation, and then it says there isn't. I mean, it is so confusing. 
   Now, the amendment that I offered said, okay, if the majority is, in fact, complying with the PAYGO requirements, what they should do is they should say that they don't need to protect the item, clause 10 of rule XXI, which very clearly states that they must be using this year's numbers. And so, Mr. Speaker, as you said in your ruling--or your predecessor in the Chair said, Mr. Pastor, who was serving as acting Speaker at the time, we're having a debate on this. And it's obvious that it can be confusing. But I bring it right back to the issue of the desire that the people who we represent, that they would love to pay last year's gasoline prices, but it can't be done. And in the exact same way this is being mishandled. It is just wrong. 
   And so procedurally we're bringing up a bad conference report. And so I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule, which, also, is a lockdown rule, I should say, and very, very unfair in its treatment of the rights of the minority--not that anyone cares about that. But procedurally and institutionally I think that there should be some concern about the fact that it's a lockdown rule, and if it does pass, it will allow us to bring up what I think is a bill that has some good things in it, but on an overall basis will not deal with the very important challenges that we face. 
   So I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and a ``no'' vote on the conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (GLOBALIZATION -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, when we look at the issue of globalization, inevitably the question of wealth and equity comes up. We see reports of massive payouts for executives, and the natural inclination is to question the fairness of this. 
   But the acquisition of wealth, we need to remember, is not a zero-sum game. If one worker brings in a big new client and gets a bonus as a result of that, that does not mean that someone somewhere else has to take a pay cut. The question we must ask ourselves is not are some individuals getting wealthier at a faster rate than others. The question is whether everyone is becoming more prosperous; is everyone's standard of living going up. If all individuals who wish to climb the economic ladder have the opportunity to do so, we are then on the right track. And the economic data show that that is exactly, absolutely the case in America today. With a workforce of 146 million, there are more Americans working today than ever before. 
   Unemployment is at an incredibly low 4.6 percent. Two million new jobs were created in the last year alone. Average weekly earnings grew by 4.8 percent over the same time period. And as we had reported last week, gross domestic product growth grew at an  annualized rate of 3.5 percent last quarter, propelled by a dramatic rise in what? Exports. We have been exporting goods and services from the United States, and that has played a big role in the GDP growth. 
   These are excellent numbers, Madam Speaker, and they demonstrate the strength and vitality of the U.S. economy. But to really understand what they mean for individuals and working families, we have to delve in a little deeper. We have to look at the broader context and the bigger picture. Let's focus on the issue of wages. 
   As I have stated, earnings are on the rise. This is obviously extremely important to working families trying to make ends meet. But even more important than growing wages is growing purchasing power. A bigger paycheck is meaningless if the government increases taxes and takes a bigger portion of that paycheck. That is why Republicans have focused so heavily on the issue of tax relief. 
   Because of the tax cuts we have passed in 2001 and 2003, after-tax income is up nearly 10 percent. That is extra disposable income that Americans have to pay college tuition, get their car fixed, or take a family vacation. 
   It is extra income, Madam Speaker, that Americans would not have without the tax relief that Republicans provided. Now, the cost of consumer goods also plays a major role in a family's purchasing power. That is why keeping our economy open to imports is so important. 
   A tariff on inexpensive clothes from Bangladesh, for example, is a tax on the American family. A tariff is a tax. A tariff on affordable furniture from China is a tax on the American family. What is more, tariffs and other protectionist barriers constitute a regressive tax because they hit and hurt working families the hardest. 
   It is not Italian leather bags or antique Belgian furniture that gets slapped with tariffs. It is the low-cost everyday items that families need to buy. The more we open up our economy, the more we increase the purchasing power of Americans who need it most. 
   Wages are rising, and that is essential. But we must remember that increased wages cannot be accompanied by a reduction in the purchasing power of those wages through greater protectionism and higher taxes. 
   Republicans have pursued an agenda of economic liberalization and embrace the great benefits of globalization. As a result, we can look at the question of whether everyone is growing in prosperity. And we can answer the question with a definitive and decisive, yes, they are. 
   Madam Speaker, I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue on this path. I call on them to reject any calls to reverse the course to saddle Americans with greater taxes and cut off their access to the goods they need at prices that they can afford; to reject any efforts to impose the regressive taxes of protectionism. Our economy cannot afford it, Madam Speaker, and we must recognize that those who are struggling most can afford it least.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to my very good new friend from Tampa (Ms. Castor) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and to congratulate her on her statement that she has just provided. But, Mr. Speaker, I rise to reluctantly oppose this rule. 
   This bill has lots of problems, and I understand the problems on the other side of the aisle. I am very happy to see the distinguished Chair of the Committee on the Judiciary, my very good friend John Conyers, here. 
   It was just a year ago, it was just a year ago this month, that we were on the floor with our own lobbying bill, and we faced many of the same problems and challenges that Chairman Conyers and others in the Democratic leadership are facing at this moment. Trying to address the concerns that our colleagues have on this issue is a challenge, a very challenging thing, and they have discovered the lesson that I learned long ago, and that is reform is very hard work. It is a constant work in progress. 
   I was reminded by one of my staff members that I had said at one point as we moved ahead with a reform bill, which I am happy to say we passed in the last Congress, I said, when we are done with that reform, what we need to do is work on more reform. 
   This is, again, a constant work in progress, and will continue to be. And I believe it is part of our responsibility to constantly look at ways in which we can reform and improve the operations of this institution.     
   But if the bill that this House passed in the last Congress was described as a ``sham,'' it is very unfortunate, and Mr. Conyers and Ms. Castor and others were there when I was describing this, the very distinguished chair of the Committee on Rules no fewer than seven times when we, a year ago this month, were debating this measure, described the bill I had, H.R. 4975, as a ``sham'' bill. 
   I have to say, as I listen to my friend from Tampa (Ms. Castor) talk about  this bill, she was going through the fact that we will have disclosure on the Internet of travel, and she went through basically the provisions included in H.R. 4975; it is basically the same bill. But, unfortunately, there are a number of important provisions included in H.R. 4975 that are not included in this measure. I find that to be somewhat troubling. 
   For instance, while starting out with a 2-year restriction on lobbying after Congress, the majority left that provision on the cutting room floor. They recognized, as we did, that the economics of attracting and retaining good staff, they don't work with that kind of restriction. But instead of retaining a provision which passed the House last year and would provide everyone with a degree of transparency about who was and was not under the lobbying restriction, and I am going to offer an amendment to add that back which I hope will be able to improve the bill. But this bill, as we have it, is not nearly to the level of what the new majority described as a sham in the last Congress. 
   While this bill provides important new criminal penalties for lobbying violations, it includes nothing, absolutely nothing, Mr. Speaker, to make enforcement more rigorous. 
   I offered an amendment in the Rules Committee to add a provision which again was included in the bill that we had passed out of this House last year which would allow the House inspector general to randomly audit lobbying disclosure filings and forward cases of wrongdoing to the Department of Justice for prosecution. 
   The majority's answer to that proposal was, no, we don't want enforcement of our bill. Enforcement is always a challenge. We deal with that with the issue of illegal immigration and a wide range of things. It is easy to put all kinds of great ideas out there, but if there is no enforcement, it has no teeth and no chance of success. That is something that is very lacking in this bill. We had it in our lobbying reform bill that passed last year, and I offered it as an amendment at the Rules Committee. Unfortunately, my colleagues in the majority on the Rules Committee rejected it. 
   Mr. Speaker, last year, Mr. Castle added a provision on the floor requiring lobbyists to take ethics training. Is that provision in this bill? Nope, it's not. 
   Did the majority make Mr. Castle's amendment in order to consider that? Nope, they didn't. 
   My colleague, Dr. Gingrey, a former member of the Rules Committee, added an amendment on the floor dealing with the personal leadership of PAC funds. That was not included in the bill, and his amendment was not made in order. Last year, with bipartisan support on the floor, we amended our bill, H.R. 4975, to say that Members who have leadership PACs cannot transfer those dollars into their own account for personal use, which is what can happen today. It is not allowed for principal campaign committee accounts, but that loophole which allows Members to transfer money from their leadership PAC for personal use is still going to be allowed. And the attempt to even offer an amendment to close that horrendous loophole was denied. 
   That is to say nothing of the other creative ideas that were summarily rejected by the Rules Committee majority last evening. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the bill which I sponsored last year was a sham, and as I said the chairman of the Rules Committee, although last night she said she never said it, seven times it is in the Congressional Record when she was offering her motion to recommit, if it was a sham, then this bill can only be characterized at this moment as being ``sub-sham,'' and our efforts to raise it to the level of a mere sham were rebuffed, unfortunately, in the Rules Committee. 
   Which brings me to the rule for this bill, Mr. Speaker. For all of the criticism the Republicans take for the way we administered the House, and we hear that constantly up in the Rules Committee and down here on the floor, it is notable this bill makes in order fewer amendments than we did when we considered our bill last year. 
   The rule for H.R. 4975, our lobbying bill, made in order nine amendments. This year, only five amendments were made in order. And while it gives Mr. Van Hollen an up-or-down vote on his so-called bundling disclosure bill, it doesn't attach it to the lobbying bill going to the Senate, making it much more difficult to ultimately reach passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, this rule and these bills are not unlike many of the so-called reforms instituted in this Congress, which means all show and no substance whatsoever. 
   For instance, our Democratic friends take credit for adopting and supposedly improving Republican earmark disclosure reforms. As Mr. Flake found out just last week, when it comes to actually trying to enforce those rules, the Rules Committee eliminated every avenue for a Member to bring this question before the House. On top of that, Mr. Flake had several amendments addressing lobbying for earmarks. Mr. Speaker, none of those amendments were made in order. 
   In the end, there is little in this bill that is truly objectionable. My friend from Tampa went through and outlined the provisions included in H.R. 4975 that passed this House a year ago this month with bipartisan support. Again, there is little that is truly objectionable. There is very little that is in this bill that is beyond what we had in the last Congress; and, unfortunately, it doesn't include or even provide an opportunity to provide amendments to include many of the items that were so important in this effort. 
   This bill takes no risk, reaches no heights, and falls short of the lofty promises made by my newly minted majority colleagues. Unfortunately, the rule is unacceptable in its current form, Mr. Speaker, and I am going to urge its defeat. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to simply say to my friend, the example of allowing a public institution to provide meals and tickets and all kinds of things while a private institution cannot do that underscores the fact that this issue needs to be addressed in a broad bipartisan way. 
   Now, in the exchange that I had with the distinguished Chair of the Committee on the Judiciary upstairs, he was happy to give it back over to us at the Rules Committee. We should have had an original jurisdiction hearing on a wide range of these issues that have not been addressed. In the last Congress, we held four original jurisdiction hearings on this issue. This year there have been none. 
   So I think that the point that my friend from Mesa is making, very correctly, is that he made a bipartisan attempt to the new majority leadership to try and address this and was rebuffed. 
   Everyone has recognized, I believe, certainly on our side of the aisle, and we did so when we were in the majority, that the issue of reform needs to be done in a bipartisan way. I know that on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Smith, the ranking member, has worked with Chairman Conyers; but there are many of the rest of us who have been involved in this issue of reform who I believe should have been consulted, especially in light of a number of provisions that were included; and, in fact, one provision which is absolutely outrageous, no hearing whatsoever, it was literally snuck into this bill, dealing with the question of Members attending charitable events. No hearing, no consideration whatsoever. A piecemeal attempt to do this. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, on the 29th of March, nearly 2 months ago, the minority leader, Mr. Boehner, sent a letter to the Speaker asking that she deal with these important questions which impact every single Member of this institution with a bipartisan panel. Mr. Speaker, I am saddened to inform the House that Minority Leader Boehner has gotten no response to that letter that was sent nearly 2 months ago. So that is why we are concerned about this process. 
   Yes, the bill itself is one which included so much of what I was proud to include in H.R. 4975; does not get to that level. But I am urging opposition to this rule, as is Mr. Flake, as was Dr. Gingrey and others of my colleagues, so that we can try and improve this in a bipartisan way. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I am very concerned about the ramifications of this measure, and I talked about the concern that I have over this issue of charitable events, and that this item was in a piecemeal way stuck into this rule, and I raised the issue of the letter. 
   Mr. Speaker, I submit for printing in the Record a copy of the letter that was sent by Mr. Boehner to my California colleague Speaker Pelosi. Mr. Speaker, the reason I do that is that there has been no response to this nearly 2-month-old letter; and I hope that maybe someone on the Speaker's staff will read the Congressional Record and see this request for a truly bipartisan approach to this issue.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, if I might reclaim my time. And I do so to simply say, I was posing a question to my colleague, not asking for a campaign speech on what the American people sent us to do here in November. The fact is, Democrats and Republicans alike are committed to reform. I am very proud of the record we have had on reform, and I am honored to have had it praised by the distinguished Chair of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
   The question that I have is a very specific one: Why in this legislation did we go from the utilization of three words, ``negotiation for compensation,'' to this open-ended question of simply ``negotiation''? 
   I would be happy to further yield to my friend to elucidate us on that.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, if I could reclaim my time. My question, and I will pose it again to my colleague from Tampa. The issue of negotiation for Members of Congress, the debate that we are having now is not about the message that was sent last November, it is not about Medicare part D. It is a question about the issue of lobbying and ethics reform in this institution. And obviously my colleague doesn't really have an answer to this question. 
   What it does do is it underscores the fact that it is absolutely essential that we deal with this issue in a responsible, bipartisan way to try to bring about some kind of resolution in here. And so I am very, very troubled with the way that this has been handled in a piecemeal way.     
   And so, Mr. Speaker, it is true that the effort is a valiant one. I congratulate and praise those who have been involved in it. And as I said in my opening remarks, it's very clear that reform is a work in progress. And we need to do more on the issue of reform. It's just that this bill is nowhere near the level of the bill that was passed under the Republican Congress. And I will say, I hope very much this institution will pass a bill that is even better than the one that I was privileged to author in the 109th Congress. And I believe that we could do better than we did in the 109th Congress. It's just that this measure, after all of this talk of reform, after all of this talk about the message sent last November, falls short of where we were in the last Congress, and that's why we are very troubled by this. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm going to urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question, so that when we succeed in defeating the previous question, I will be able to make in order an amendment that was offered that specifically provides greater disclosure and transparency and accountability which, again, are the three buzz words that are used around here: transparency, disclosure and accountability. 
   If, in fact, a Member is asking for an earmark, if a Member has been asked for an earmark by a lobbyist, under the amendment that I hope that we will be able to make in order, that Mr. Flake has propounded and unfortunately it was rejected by the Rules Committee, it would simply require that lobbying entity to disclose the fact that they have, in fact, made that in order. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to, just before the vote on the previous question, have printed in the Congressional Record a detailed explanation of the amendment that would require that lobbyists who make a request of a Member, that they call for an earmark to be made, that that information be made public. I believe that that, in and of itself, is a very, very modest but responsible thing that needs to be done in this effort to ensure greater transparency and disclosure.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule, and I express my appreciation to my very good friend, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, the gentlewoman from Rochester, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have to begin by saying how greatly saddened I am by the opening statement that was just delivered by the Chair of the Committee on Rules. Using the word ``failure'' to describe what has taken place in Iraq is, to me, as we head into this Memorial Day weekend, an extraordinarily sad message for our courageous men and women who are on the frontline in this struggle against global terrorism. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have to tell you that we just got the news this morning of the death of Joseph Anzack who was one of the three troops in Iraq who was kidnapped, and as we think about this Memorial Day weekend, to say to those men and women who are there on the frontline that this is a failure, I believe, is a horrible, horrible message, and I'm greatly troubled that those words would emanate from the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has taken the Democratic leadership four tries, and as my very good friend from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren) said in his 1-  minute speech, more than 100 days since the President's request that they have finally agreed to vote on an emergency supplemental appropriations bill that gives our troops the funding they need without tying their hands and ensuring their defeat. 
   Mr. Speaker, no matter how many times my friend from Rochester, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, is saying that they have lost, saying that they have failed and saying that defeat is imminent, the passage of this funding bill will help very much to ensure that that is not the case. 
   I'm extremely proud that we have been able to hold the line on the disastrous proposal and this notion that somehow we have lost and we have failed in the struggle against terrorism. Unfortunately, though, at this point in the debate, we can't be totally certain about what it is exactly that we're agreeing upon, particularly in the case, Mr. Speaker, of the additional spending.     
   Now, let me explain why. For several years, there has been concern from both sides of the aisle about the lack of availability of the text of bills and conference reports. That concern has been raised by both Democrats and Republicans on a regular basis. 
   I would like to briefly, for our colleagues, outline a timeline for how this rule we are debating at this moment was produced. Last night, the Committee on Rules adjourned at roughly 8:45 p.m. after reporting the rule on lobbying reform, which we will be considering in a little while. 
   Then members of the Rules Committee patiently waited until 11 p.m., when we were notified the text of the supplemental agreement wouldn't be ready until the early morning hours and that the Rules Committee would hold an emergency meeting at 7 a.m. 
   The text of the Obey amendments were then circulated to the Rules Committee members at 5:39 this morning, just a few hours ago; 5:39 this morning, less than 1 1/2 hours before we convened the Rules Committee. The text of the amendments were not posted publicly on the committee's Web site until around the time we actually met. 
   Now we are here considering the rule, which makes in order language which spends $119.99999 billion, less than 4 hours after it was actually submitted. 
   I remember my very good friend from Rochester (Ms. Slaughter) regularly saying that we needed to be provided with 24 hours notice. This clearly is a far cry from what was promised at the beginning of this Congress. 
   This language may very well represent the agreement between the House, the Senate and the administration. However, there is no way for us to know this, because there has been no time to thoroughly read the language and verify. 
   Unfortunately, as most Members must at this point, I shall have to proceed under an assumption. I must say that I am very concerned about the negative impact the ongoing surrender debate has had in Iraq, both in terms of the morale of our troops and our credibility with the Iraqi people. I am concerned about the impact that this delay in funding has had on our military as well. 
   But, ultimately, we have succeeded in ensuring that this body has the opportunity to fund our troops without simultaneously handing the terrorists a date certain for our surrender. While this process, this political process has played out, I talked a great deal about what the consequences would be if we were to abandon the Iraqis to the terrorists. And, of course, al Qaeda has taken responsibility for the murder of Mr. Anzack, whom I mentioned, Joseph Anzack. 
   They clearly are in the midst of their drive. We also are hoping very much that we can see this fledgling democracy take hold. That is why what we are going to be doing here, providing that necessary support, helps us in that quest, but there is no need to take my word in this matter. We are hearing repeatedly, repeatedly from our people on the ground, from the Iraqi leadership and from the Iraqi people, that withdrawing before our mission is complete would have terrible consequences. 
   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Feisal Amin al-Istrabadi, has implored us not to leave. I would like to quote Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations. ``We are at war together,'' he recently said. ``We are allied at war together against a common enemy. We have one way forward: together.'' 
   In a recent interview with the New York Post, he talked about the troop surge and pointed to the progress that is being made because of it. At this critical juncture, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations believes we should be redoubling our efforts and pressing forward, not debating a withdrawal at the precise moment that progress is being made. 
   Every Member of this body knew at the beginning of this process that the President would never sign a withdrawal bill. The President said it, and the President says what he means, and he means what he says. 
   Unfortunately, as Mr. Lungren pointed out in his 1-minute speech earlier, the weeks and weeks of pointless debate on our surrender date have clearly taken their toll in Iraq. As Ambassador al-Istrabadi points out, and I quote, ``It's been very painful to watch the political process in Washington, because it seems to have very little to do with Iraq.'' He says that al Qaeda has been following this debate closely. The ambassador says, ``There are real enemies who are watching the debate, who understand what's happening here and who think they can affect the outcome of the debate.'' 
   He is baffled, as I am baffled, that the Democratic leadership could even consider playing right into the terrorists' hands. How on earth could we even contemplate giving them what they want and turning the country and the region over to them? 
   I understand many Americans just want this war to be over. I want this war to be over, too. I would like nothing more. I would like nothing more than to be able to tell the people whom I am honored to represent here that their husbands and wives and sons and daughters and brothers and sisters are going to be coming home tomorrow. 
   The problem is that, even if we were to withdraw from Iraq, the war would not magically be over. We can pick up and go home. We can turn off our TV sets and ignore what is taking place over there. But the war will still go on. The terrorists will continue their battle for Iraq and for the region; only, this time, we would not be there to stop them. 
   We would not be there to train and strengthen the Iraqi Army and police forces or to help strengthen those democratic institutions. 
   I have to say that I am particularly proud of the work that our House Democracy Assistance Commission is doing. DAVID PRICE of North Carolina has chaired this effort, and we are hoping to be able to include Iraq's parliament as we work in consultation to help them build this fledgling democracy. 
   Before long, I have no doubt whatsoever that the war would make its way to our doorstep once again. We ignored a growing terrorist haven once before, and we suffered the worst attack on our soil because of it. 
   I was very proud during the decade of the 1980s to work with a number of our colleagues in providing the assistance to the Mujahedin who were fighting to liberate their country of Afghanistan from the Soviet Union. When that was over, we left and did virtually nothing to help build a democracy. 
   Did Afghanistan teach us anything? Did September 11 teach us nothing? Burying our heads in the sand is not an effective defense. The consequences of abandoning our mission in Iraq would be even graver than the consequences of ignoring the growing terrorist threat that took place during the decade of the 1990s in Afghanistan. This time, not only would the terrorists establish another safe haven from which to operate their global terror network, they would, and I quote, ``erect a triumphant monument on the ruins of American power,'' as the American Enterprise Institute scholar Frederick Kagan said. 
   We simply cannot and will not strengthen the hands of terrorists who have made the destruction of America their number one priority. We cannot and will not abandon the Iraqis to be butchered by these terrorists in their midst. We cannot and will not abandon our mission just as real progress is starting to be made. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume and then I'm going to be yielding to one of my colleagues. 
   Let me say that at 7 o'clock this morning I praised the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, Mr. Obey. He knows that I have the utmost respect for him and his work. He is very, very diligent, and a very, very thoughtful Member. And I have been privileged to serve with him for the last more than a quarter of a century, as we were counting upstairs some of our former colleagues who are long departed, Mr. Dabo, Mr. Conte, and others. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me say that, with all due respect to my friend, I am not bellyaching about the process itself. I am not bellyaching about what it is that got us here. I am simply pointing to a promise that was made to this institution; and that promise, Mr. Speaker, was that there would be 24 hours to review legislation before it is brought to the floor. And I will acknowledge that when we were in the majority, we did not always provide that 24 hours. But, Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend from Wisconsin, it is not about what we did, it is about what this new majority promised they were going to do. And that commitment was that after this laborious late-night negotiating process that included Members of the other body, the White House, and Members of this body into the night, that there would be a 24-hour opportunity for Members to look at a $119.99 billion spending measure. 
   So I have to say that the process that led up to the creation of this is historically the process that does bring about bipartisan agreements. The gentleman is absolutely right, not everyone is happy with all the measures included in this bill. But the fact of the matter is we are where we are; we have gotten here under challenging circumstances. As I said, the Rules Committee adjourned at 8:45 last night. At 11 o'clock we were informed that we would have an emergency meeting at 7 o'clock this morning, and at 5:39 this morning it was made available to us.     
   And here we are just a few hours later considering it on the House floor. Now, Mr. Speaker, I'm hoping to go back to Los Angeles tomorrow morning, and I'd like to be able to do that. But I'm more than willing to help this majority comply with the promise that they made that on all major legislation, they would in fact provide the minority and, frankly, the majority Members with 24 hours to review the legislation. 
   And, finally, I just have to say that when we hear arguments that somehow  President Bush is playing into the hands of the terrorists and responsible for where we are, Mr. Speaker, September 11 of 2001 changed not only the United States but the world. The largest most important Nation in the history of mankind suffered an attack the likes of which we had never seen in our Nation's history. And so, taking on a multi-pronged approach, dealing with, as we have in both Afghanistan and in Iraq, and we all know that Iraq is the central front for al Qaeda, has been very important. You can raise issues like weapons of mass destruction and other items like that, but the fact of the matter is, we are where we are today. And I believe that it would be a horrendous mistake for us to take a retrograde step, which is exactly what those terrorists want. 
   And with that, I'm happy to yield 4 minutes to my very good friend from Sacramento, Mr. Lungren.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
   Let me begin by saying that I do have the utmost respect for the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Appropriations and, of course, for my Chair, the gentlewoman from Rochester (Ms. Slaughter). And I understand that there is great sincerity on their part in this quest here and I understand there is a desire to ensure that we have a process that works. I will just make a couple of comments on process here and some concerns that I have and then I have some other remarks on the overall issue of the war. 
   We have gone through, as we know, four incarnations of this attempt and now 110 days that has really prevented us from making sure that we have had an opportunity to get the funding necessary for our troops. Through that process, Democrats and Republicans alike have regularly said they don't want to do anything to prevent funding from getting to our troops. And I respect that. Again, Members on both sides of the aisle have pointed that out, Mr. Speaker. But we all know that from the outset, the President made it clear that he was going to veto anything that established an artificial timeline which he, and I agree with him, concluded would be a prescription for admitting defeat. And so he was very strong on that and unwavering. 
   So we've gotten to the point where we are at this moment, and that point is we have a 213-page package that is before us. My good friend from Wisconsin said that I was bellyaching about the process, and I will say again to my colleagues, I'm not complaining about what took place in the hours leading up to the consideration of this package. This is my 27th year here and I understand that negotiations among the Senate, the House and the White House are challenging and can often go into the night. The only point that I am making, Mr. Speaker, is that as we look at this process of having this 213-page measure before us, we were promised by the new majority that we would be given 24 hours before consideration of major legislation here on the House floor. And, as I said, and I am really somewhat confused on this because, I would say to my friend from Wisconsin, I look at the time stamp on this. The time stamp on the measure that we are voting on is 9:38 p.m. last night. Yet he said that he was negotiating into the night, 1 o'clock in the morning. I mean, I didn't follow all of the incarnations of this, but I do know that we received this at 5:39 this morning, and that was less than an hour and a half before the Rules Committee was scheduled to convene at its 7 a.m. meeting this morning. And then we had it made public at about the time our group convened, the Rules Committee convened. And so that does concern me. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, I am going to be urging my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that I may amend the rule to allow Members to offer motions to strike earmarks which are undoubtedly going to come to the attention of Members the longer that this agreement is available. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my amendment and extraneous material be printed in the Congressional Record just prior to the vote on the previous question.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me just say, finally, we are going into this Memorial Day weekend. I have the honor of participating in seven Memorial Day events on Monday in southern California, and I will be meeting with family members. 
   Just yesterday, I met with the mother of a young man, Mr. Colnot, who lost his life over a year ago in Iraq. She said to me just yesterday afternoon, ``It is absolutely essential that we complete our mission.'' 
   I have regularly pointed to another one of my constituents whose son paid the ultimate price. A man called Ed Blecksmith's son, J.P., died over 2 years ago, 2 1/2 years ago, on the famous November battle of Fallujah.     
   And repeatedly Mr. Blacksmith has said to me, ``You must complete this mission or my son, J.P., will have died in vain.'' 
   So, Mr. Speaker, as we go into this Memorial Day weekend, I thank God that we are going to pass this measure that will be providing the essential support for our troops, so that General David Petraeus and the new leadership, with a new strategy to deal with uncertainty, will have the hope of victory. There is no guaranteed success, but there is a hope for victory because this is a struggle which is going to continue on and on and on as long as there are people out there who are going to try to do us in, to kill us, and to change our way of life. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question so that I can offer my amendment. And if by chance we are not successful on that, I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule because of the unfair process that we have. But if in fact the rule does proceed, I urge everyone, in a bipartisan way, to support the very important measure that will allow us to support our troops and allow them to complete their mission. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my very good friend from San Antonio for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I have to say, I was just downstairs listening to the remarks of my very good friend from Chicago (Mr. Emanuel). It really saddens me to hear the politicization of this issue. 
   The gentleman from Detroit, the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, has done a phenomenal job, from my perspective, in recognizing the challenges that we face, the fact that we're working to address this issue in a bipartisan way now, he has worked with Mr. Smith on this issue. We went beyond our debate on the rule issue, and I said that I believe that the legislation that we had that is before us is not nearly as strong as the legislation that we were proud to have worked on in the 109th Congress, but we are what we are today. 
   As I listened to my friend from Chicago (Mr. Emanuel) talk about this legislation as being the most sweeping reform since the Watergate era, I would encourage my friend to simply take a look at H.R. 4975, the legislation that we passed in the last Congress. It was dramatically stronger on the area of transparency, disclosure and accountability than the legislation that's before us. 
   I wasn't going to make these remarks, but it saddens me, as I listened to the speeches that have been given. Mr. Smith has spoken very eloquently about the need to address a wide range of these issues, as has the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
   If one were to listen to this debate, one could only conclude that the issue of ethics and the challenges of ethics in this institution are one-sided, that only the Republican Party has faced any ethical challenges. 
   Now, I am not going to get into enumerating and throwing out the names. We keep hearing the name Jack Abramoff talked about time and time again. And it's very easy, and the chairman of the committee knows very well, it's very easy for us to now stand here and begin pointing fingers and talking about blame on the other side of the aisle. But I think it's unfortunate. It's an unfortunate thing to see this gross politicization. 
   The 1994 class came here with a goal of changing the Congress, and, you know, they changed these individuals. All of that stuff is sad and tired political rhetoric and nothing more than that. We are in the midst of the legislative process at this moment. I think it's been widely recognized that the bill that is before us is not nearly as strong as the measure that we passed with bipartisan support, even though it was described as a sham in the last Congress. 
   I have been joking back and forth with the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, I see this bill as being sub-sham. I am going to vote for this bill at the end of the day. It basically doesn't have the teeth in it on transparency, disclosure and accountability that we passed in the last Congress. That bill was described by the Chair of the Committee on Rules, Ms. Slaughter, seven times in the debate that we had last year as a sham, and there were others in the Democratic leadership who described it as a sham. 
   I am not going to characterize this legislation in a disparaging manner, other than to say that it has not come up to that level. 
   I am happy to yield to my friend, if he would like me to yield.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Chairman, if I could reclaim my time. The time was yielded me by the gentleman from Texas. Let me reclaim my time by saying, I did not, in fact, describe the measure that is before us as a sham. 
   What I said was the legislation that I authored in the 109th Congress was characterized by the Democratic leadership, including the now Chair of the Committee on Rules, as a sham bill. 
   What I have said is that this measure that is before us does not meet the standard that we passed in the last Congress on transparency, disclosure and accountability. To argue that this is somehow the most sweeping reform legislation since Watergate is absolutely preposterous, because the legislation that was passed through the House in the last Congress went much, much further than this. 
   So all I am saying is, I want to work with Mr. Conyers. I want to work with Mr. Smith. I think that rather than pointing fingers and characterizing one political party as having ethical challenges or lacking ethics or having changed and transformed in that 12-year period, I believe that that's a mischaracterization. 
   While he may not say it, I have a sneaking suspicion that the very distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary may be inclined to agree with what I have said.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Chair, I thank my friend, the ranking member of the committee, the gentleman from San Antonio, for yielding. 
   I would simply say that when we look at what was passed in the 109th Congress and put that up against this measure, we can go through the litany. This notion of the K Street Project, the 1-year ban is present law. And, in fact, I offered amendments to enhance the transparency and disclosure. I hope very much, when we get to the amendment process, the amendment that I am going to be offering will be accepted by the majority. I suspect that it may be. I think it is a thoughtful amendment. 
   So we are working to enhance and strengthen this measure to the level that was passed by the House last year. And I just hope very much that, again, we can work in a bipartisan way, because I am proud to be an institutionalist. I believe in this institution. I am privileged to have spent now nearly a majority of my life as a Member of this institution. I revere it. And I hope very much that we can make it more accountable to the American people by putting into place very proper reforms that will enjoy bipartisan support.

   Mr. DREIER. Madam Chairman, I express my appreciation to the Committee on Rules for making my amendment in order. And I would like to say that this is an amendment which is designed, again, to simply strive in our quest to bring the level of this lobbying reform measure up to the standard that we had in last year's past bill, H.R. 4975. 
   The provision that was included in last year's bill allows for greater transparency and disclosure. It adds language, Madam Chairman, which simply creates a requirement that full disclosure of the starting and ending times for a person who is leaving the employment of the Capitol, what their lobbying constraints are. 
   Now, this bill originally had a 2-year ban on lobbying once someone leaves the Capitol. Chairman Conyers decided that, as the challenge we faced last year, making sure we have first-rate staff here is a challenge, so they pared back from the 2 years that was in the Senate bill and was initially in this bill back to the 1-year level. 
   I understand that, again, this is something that we did last year, but the thing that we did is we felt strongly about the need for disclosure as to exactly what those dates are; and so we called for a letter to be written which has the start times and the end times for the lobbying ban. That letter goes to the individual, and it goes to the office from which that person has left. And it goes actually a step further than we did in the past, and it calls for disclosure of that information on the Internet so that everyone knows, in fact, that there is a ban on that person from engaging in lobbying their former colleagues. I hope very much that my colleagues can support that. 
   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Judiciary, the gentleman from San Antonio (Mr. Smith).

And I'm not going to buy it back from the chairman since he's been so gracious. 
   So, with that, I'll yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (RECOGNIZING THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Boozman), for their very thoughtful remarks on this resolution. 
   I also want to join in expressing my appreciation to my fellow Californian, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lantos and, of course, the ranking Republican, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen.     
   I think both of the sets of remarks offered underscore something that is extraordinarily important, and that is that we thank and express our appreciation to our allies, no matter how  large or how small their populations, in dealing with the challenges that we face internationally. 
   But I will say I have a particular interest in the world's oldest republic because I am privileged to represent its namesake, the City of San Marino, California. 
   I had the privilege, Mr. Speaker, of leading the first bipartisan delegation to what, as my friend from New York correctly said, is the oldest republic on the face of the Earth, and we took this delegation back in 2004 to the Republic of San Marino. I had the opportunity to present to the Captains Regent, as was said, the co-heads of their state, of their government, a proclamation passed by the San Marino City Council expressing its greetings and appreciation for the friendship that they share. 
   San Marino, California, was named at its founding for the republic on the Adriatic Sea and displays in its seal Mount Titano, where the republic was first established. Today, like its namesake, San Marino, California, is known for its beauty. It is home to the Huntington Library and Gardens, one of Southern California's great treasures. But the relationship with the Republic of San Marino reaches far beyond beauty. It's my hope that this resolution will help to make us all more aware of the great bond the United States shares with this small, but very important, country. 
   The Republic of San Marino, as was said, was founded over 17 centuries ago by those who were fleeing the religious persecution of the Roman Empire. They founded a community based on liberty and tolerance 1,300 years before the Pilgrims would land on Plymouth Rock on a similar endeavor. Since those early days of the republic, San Marino has continued its strong tradition of democracy and freedom. 
   Our close bond, based on a shared commitment to these principles, was first, as my friend from New York said, recorded in history through an exchange of letters between President Lincoln and the Captains Regent. President Lincoln expressed in that letter his deep respect for the Republic of San Marino, saying, ``as one of the most honored in all of world history.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, he took encouragement from its example that any ``government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring.'' Those are the words of President Lincoln. Now, as our Nation faced a great crisis, Lincoln looked to the example of San Marino, which had endured for so long while standing with its small ``r'' republican foundation. 
   As the United States has faced new crises in the 20th and 21st centuries, it has again relied upon San Marino for its steadfast support within international institutions such as the United Nations. San Marino has been a close collaborator on a number of critical issues like combating international terrorist financing. This year we have honored their friendship and support, as was said, by elevating our relationship to the ambassadorial level. 
   My good friend and fellow Californian Ron Spogli, as the first U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of San Marino, presented his credentials to the Captains Regent in a ceremony in San Marino's Palazzo Publico on March 8 of 2007. And as my friend from New York said, the exchange was completed when on July 25 of this year, Paolo Rondelli, the first Ambassador of the Republic of San Marino to the United States, presented his credentials to President Bush at the White House. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we honor this exchange of ambassadors, and we honor the close relationship between our Nation and the world's oldest republic and the fundamental values that bind us. 
   And, again, I thank my colleagues for their support of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (CONGRATULATING NICOLAS SARKOZY ON HIS ELECTION TO THE PRESIDENCY OF FRANCE -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I thank my good friend from Arkansas, the cochair of the U.S.-French Caucus, and appreciate his thoughtful remarks as well as the remarks of my friend from New York. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise because I think it is really a great day that we are once again, after what could only be considered as somewhat of a hiatus in this institution, underscoring the importance of the relationship between the United States and France. It's very clear that there was a period of time when we were quite critical of France and, in fact, we all know that the sort of the politically correct thing to do was to engage in French bashing. 
   I always had a tough time with that myself. One of the reasons is that as we are here in this Chamber, the portrait just to my right is of the man who underwrote the American Revolution, Marquis de Lafayette. In fact, his portrait is the only portrait of a non- American that hangs anywhere in this great building, the U.S. Capitol. 
   For us to recognize, as my friend from Arkansas just has said in his remarks, the great new, renewed friendship with the election of President Sarkozy between the United States and France is, I think, a great thing. I am very enthused about 11 o'clock Wednesday morning when we are in this very Chamber going to hear the words of France's new President. 
   As my friend said, for Nicholas Sarkozy, before he became President, when he was a minister on the fifth anniversary of September 11, to go to New York and demonstrate his solidarity with those who stood up to the terrorists and, again, his great assistance in working with us in supporting the State of Israel, in making sure that we do everything that we can to diminish the threat of the potential nuclear buildup in Iran; of course, the kinds of missions that Nicholas Sarkozy has embarked on most recently to return the hostages of many conflicts around is something that, I believe, is to be heralded. We just had the news this morning that President Sarkozy personally was able to see the return of, I think it was seven nurses, who had been held hostage. 
   So his commitment to the cause of freedom and liberty, and I will say, yes, his underscoring the great importance of the relationship and the alliance between France and the United States of America is a great thing for us. I congratulate my colleagues for their support and urge everyone to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (EXPRESSING CONCERN RELATING TO IRANIAN REGIME AND MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I again thank my friend from Arkansas for yielding, and I thank the gentleman from New York for his very thoughtful remarks on this important resolution. I rise in strong support of it. 
   I think that both my friends from New York and Arkansas have underscored the grave concern that we have about Iran's entry into this hemisphere, and especially in the remarks offered by the gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Speaker, he underscored this nexus which has been developed by Hugo Chavez in Caracas, Venezuela and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. 
   Now, what is it that we have seen? Obviously there are a great deal of differences that exist when it comes to the vision that a Hugo Chavez would have and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would have. But they have rallied around one particular point, and that is, virulent opposition to everything that the United States of America stands for. Both of them have been hypercritical of the United States and our policies and the cause of freedom, quite frankly, based on what we've seen in both countries. 
   The thing that is most troubling is the fact that Mr. Chavez has had this pattern of inviting Mr. Ahmadinejad into this hemisphere and, basically, continuing to promote the anti-American sentiment. And it is cause for concern, and I believe this resolution is very important. 
   Mr. Chavez took Mr. Ahmadinejad to the inauguration of Rafael Correa in Quito, Ecuador. And again, as my friend from Arkansas has just said, the prospect of an Iranian Embassy opening in Quito is something that's very troubling. 
   Similarly, he took him to meet with Evo Morales, the President of Bolivia, again, a very, very troubling sign. And I will say, quite frankly, I am even concerned about, while we've heralded the election that took place a week ago yesterday in Argentina, I do believe that there is reason for concern of the potential for this linkage there that exists. I think it's very exciting to see Cristina Kirchner become the President, succeeding her husband in Argentina, but I do believe that we need to remain very vigilant in looking at this linkage between Hugo Chavez, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and others within this hemisphere. 
   I would also like to laud my colleague from Arkansas for underscoring the importance of continuing to build our economic alliances with those countries in the hemisphere that are committed to political pluralism, the development of democratic institutions, the rule of law and self-determination. 
   We are on the verge, this week, we're going to be addressing the issue of a U.S.-Peru free trade agreement. We also have on the horizon, as we all know, in this hemisphere both the Panama and the Colombia free trade agreements. 
   And so I will say, Mr. Speaker, I think this resolution is very timely. I congratulate my friends for underscoring the importance of this. And I hope that a by-product of it will be the recognition that working with our allies in this region to develop even stronger economic ties should be the next step for us to take. 
   Again, I urge strong support of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Let me just say that in the 109th Congress, Mr. Lewis and I joined together to offer an amendment to the Violence Against Women Act which actually authorized a level of $950 million for the reimbursement to the States for the incarceration of illegal immigrant felons. At that time, Madam Speaker, 414 Members of this House voted in support of that bill. Just yesterday, 338 Members voted in favor of the amendment that we offered which had an increase to a level of $460 million total for the issue of the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. It is literally a drop in the bucket. Even with this new level, State and local governments will, Madam Speaker, only receive 10 cents on the dollar that they expend for the incarceration of people who are in this country illegally and commit crimes. 
   I believe that it is absolutely essential, if we're going to allow State and local governments to work on the very, very important crime problem that  they have, that we should step up to the plate and take on the responsibility that only the Federal Government can address, and that is the security of our Nation's borders. 
   Madam Speaker, any Member who votes against this motion to recommit is, in fact, voting to not provide reimbursement to State and local governments for this onerous responsibility which we have thrust upon them by virtue of the fact that we are not securing our Nation's borders. 
   Vote to support the motion to recommit that Mr. Lewis is offering here so that we will have a chance to provide that very, very important support for State and local governments and the security for the constituents who we represent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and to the previous question. 
   Let me just say that as I listened to my friend from California talk about the fact that he looks forward, at the end of this debate when he is successful, to telling his constituents in California that the impossible has been achieved, I have to say that he may or may not be right at that point. 
   But I will tell you something that has been achieved with this, Mr. Speaker, and that is an end to bipartisanship when it has come to dealing with this issue of our farm policy. And to me, that's a very, very sad statement when you look at people who've been very committed to this bill, like Bob Goodlatte, the former chairman of the committee, now the ranking member who's going to be speaking in just a few minutes, and you look at so many others who because of the way this issue has been mishandled and because, in fact, there is in excess of a $10 billion tax increase. 
   Now, my friend in his opening remarks said, don't be fooled, don't let them claim that this is a tax increase. Well, I know that we are dealing with so-called tax loopholes. That's the way it's described. But the fact of the matter is, if you look at those, Mr. Speaker, who are impacted by this, great tax ``cheats'' out there like Toyota, Daimler Chrysler, Honda, the Bayer Corporation that makes the baby aspirin that's provided, these are people who are ensuring that our consumers have access to great products, and they obviously are complying with the law. And now we somehow are demonizing all of these people, calling it closing tax loopholes when, in fact, what we're doing is we're putting into place a dramatic tax increase, not just to deal with the farm issue, Mr. Speaker, but to deal with a wide range of programs that are not related to farmers whatsoever. 
   In fact, one person gave me a figure that only 11 cents of every dollar is actually being expended to help our farmers. 
   Vote ``no'' on the previous question and ``no'' on the rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH INDIA -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, today my very good friend Mr. Crowley of New York, in a bipartisan way, and I joined together, and we now have, I'm happy to say, our good friend from north Dallas, a great Member of the Rules Committee, Pete Sessions as a cosponsor of legislation, a resolution actually calling for free trade negotiations to begin between the United States and India. We introduced this resolution to highlight the tremendous benefits of deeper economic engagement between the world's two largest democracies. 
   While bilateral trade has spurred growth in both of our countries, we have not yet come close to realizing the full benefits of complete access to each other's markets and full liberalization of the Indian economy. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people are very focused on the economy right now, understandably. While growth remains strong and unemployment remains low, and we just this morning got the report of the drop in unemployment claims, the prevailing economic stories, however, in the news stir up a great deal of fear and concern among working families. The subprime mortgage crisis has dominated the headlines for months. The housing slump in many communities makes homeowners feel like their financial security is threatened. And as always, Madam Speaker, there is the natural anxiety that comes from the highly dynamic and fast-paced environment of the global economy.  
   At a time of economic anxiety, the most important thing is to ensure that growth remains strong, so that opportunities can be creative. If we look at what has been our biggest source of strength in recent months, it has been export-led growth. Over the last year, there have been dire predictions for GDP growth, and every single quarter the numbers have come out much stronger than has been anticipated because exports have made up for softer areas within our own economy. 
   At the same time, Madam Speaker, imports have ensured that working families have access to the goods they need at prices that they can afford. We are weathering these economic challenges because we are engaging in the worldwide marketplace. 
   India has been a very important component of that engagement. Our exports to India have doubled in the last 5 years. We are India's largest trading partner and largest investment partner. Trading with India has opened up new doors for American producers, service providers, workers and consumers as well. 
   But India still has miles to go in its reform process. Tariffs in many sectors are prohibitively high. The regulatory environment is absolutely Byzantine. American investors looking for opportunity in an otherwise ripe environment still confront significant roadblocks to successful investment. 
   If we are to maximize the benefits of trade with the world's second-largest consumer market, there must be broad, comprehensive reform. Free trade negotiations would provide maximum leverage for encouraging this kind of reform. Whether it's slashing exorbitant tariffs, which average 20 percent and range as high as 210 percent, Madam Speaker, that's a 210 percent tariff, protecting intellectual property, and another thing they have done is ensuring transparency in governance, a free trade agreement would provide the necessary impetus for comprehensive liberalization of their economy. 
   Many of our FTAs are negotiated with foreign policy concerns chiefly in mind. Our pending FTA with Colombia, for example, will solidify strong democratic institutions for a key ally in a key region, in addition to the economic benefits to both countries. 
   There are certainly foreign policy concerns associated with a U.S.-India free trade agreement as well. It would provide an opportunity to deepen and broaden our ties with a strong, stable Asian democracy that shares our fundamental values in a challenging region. 
   But Madam Speaker, the commercial benefits to such an FTA would be considerable. It would open up a tremendous opportunity to build upon our export-led growth and ensure that Americans can take full advantage of the more than 1 billion consumers in the world's second-largest emerging market. With all eyes on the economy, now is the time for the U.S. and India to begin to pursue comprehensive economic engagement with a free trade agreement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding, and I see we're joined here by a very distinguished member of the House Committee on Intelligence. I think we have been, for literally months, trying to make in order the legislation that has been introduced by our friend from Albuquerque (Mrs. Wilson), and we believe that that, in fact, is the answer to this problem. 
   The President of the United States, in the news conference that he held with Mike McConnell about an hour ago, made it crystal clear that he is going to ask the Director one question: If he gets legislation that emerges from this body, will it, in fact, enhance our ability to make sure that foreigners on  foreign soil who are trying kill us, if the legislation provides them with the tools to intercept those conversations and prevent them from having the ability to attack the United States of America? 
   Now, my friend from Dallas has just very correctly said, can we see the legislation that we're expected to vote upon today if this suspension rule is made in order that will do exactly what the President has said is necessary to ensure the safety and the security of the American people?

   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say that I have the highest regard for my California colleague (Ms. Harman). She knows that very well. We share representing Los Angeles County here. And I know that she has worked very hard on intelligence issues. 
   But I will say that I am very troubled with the exchange that I just saw take place between my friend from Albuquerque here, who has worked on this. She talked about the fact that we have legislation that was just rejected 36 hours ago by the Director of National Intelligence, Mr. McConnell. And my friend from California has just said something to the effect that she's not sure exactly what bill it is that we're looking at. I'm not an expert on this myself. 
   I would be happy to yield to my friend if she wants to respond at all on this.

Reclaiming my time, I know my colleague would certainly share this concern to support the rule, but we like the idea of seeing what it is that we're about to vote upon before we do that. I know that may be an unusual request under this majority, but I think that is definitely fair. And I will say that I think that it's right and correct that Members have a chance to see what it is that they're voting upon, rather than having something thrown upon them. 
   And we have Mrs. Wilson, who has legislation that we've offered probably a dozen times on our quest to defeat the previous question on rules so that we could at least allow consideration of this. And so that has led us, I believe, to this point. 
   But I think it is just absolute lunacy to believe that we are, at this moment, in a position to go ahead and vote upon something that we don't know what it consists of. And I know my friend would agree with that, that we really shouldn't have a pattern like that.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3773, RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pasco for yielding and congratulate the Hastings cousins for their management of this very, very important measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, yesterday afternoon eight of our colleagues sat before the dais of the Rules Committee with 27 different proposed amendments that  they wanted to offer to improve this very important measure, to work in a bipartisan way to improve it. Before they were able to utter their first words, they were told in response to a question that came from our friend from Pasco, Mr. Hastings, that this was going to be a closed rule. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, a closed rule means that no amendment is offered. No alternative proposal is allowed at all. We simply get the measure that is before us, and that is it. Now, that's when there were 27 different amendments that were proposed and, as I said, eight Members waiting to offer and discuss their ideas. They were completely shut out from that. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, it saddens me to report to this House that we, today, have achieved something that is not great for this institution. As of today, Mr. Speaker, in the 110th Congress, we have had more closed rules in a single session of the United States House of Representatives than we have in the 218-year history of this great institution. The sad thing about that, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that we were promised something much different, and this bill is critically important for our Nation's security. 
   One of the very thoughtful proposals to come forward made great sense. It's the idea of saying that when the government asked the private sector to help us work to interdict those communications taking place among people who are trying to kill us, terrorists who are trying to kill us, we should allow them to do that. We should allow them to have immunity from the threat of prosecution if that, in fact, is being utilized. But unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have failed to allow that proposal, for those people who were asked by the government to help us win the global war on terror, to make sure that Osama bin Laden and other terrorists do not have the potential to kill us. 
   And now what we've been told, and I heard countless Democrats say, oh, these people in the telecommunications industry, they've got enough money, they're making enough money, let them stand on their own. Well, Mr. Speaker, that is just plain wrong, and we, unfortunately, with this rule, are not even allowed a chance to debate that, which, to me, is absolutely outrageous. 
   What we have before us, Mr. Speaker, is a closed rule on a bad bill that can't become law. Tragically, that's a pattern that we have been facing for a while. The exact same thing has happened on the bill that we're going to be voting after it was sent here 2 weeks ago on SCHIP legislation. We're going to be voting on that tomorrow. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, let me just say again, this is a closed rule on a bad bill that can't become law. We've got to defeat this rule. We've got to make sure that those people who are working to keep this country safe have all the tools necessary to make that happen.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule, and I rise to express my appreciation to my friend from Hartland, Vermont, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation, H.R. 547, the Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act. I congratulate Science Committee Chairman Bart Gordon and Ranking Member Ralph Hall on their efforts; and I applaud my colleague, the Rules Committee Chair, Ms. Slaughter. 
   I extend my congratulations to my colleague, Ms. Slaughter, for granting such a fair and judicious rule. I am very proud to stand here extending that congratulations to my friend and colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, in his January 24, 2007, State of the Union address, President Bush called for the increased use of renewable and alternative motor fuels. As the 110th Congress begins, alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles have already received a good deal of attention, especially in discussions over U.S. energy security. The rising cost of oil, the country's dependence on foreign oil, the debate over global warming, and the concern with air emissions have led to a heightened interest in developing clean and alternative energy sources and facilitating their use by the American consumer. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the Congress is in the forefront of this research and our effort to look for alternative energy sources. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 547 is a good bill that authorizes $10 million for the Environmental Protection Agency to launch a research and development program aimed at making alternative fuels more compatible with the Nation's existing petroleum-based fuel infrastructure. 
   It also directs the EPA to develop portable, inexpensive, and accurate methods for fuel suppliers to test the sulfur content of diesel fuels. While biofuels such as ethanol are regarded as clean-burning alternatives to fossil fuels, it is clear that they can corrode or compromise pipes and storage tanks designed for petroleum products. 
   Now, unfortunately, retailers themselves often bear the cost of solving this problem and revitalizing the old infrastructure. This bill tasks the EPA with testing additive and other technologies to ease such problems. With new findings we will be able to mobilize the infrastructure necessary to distribute and dispense alternative fuels. With so much emphasis being placed on the development of these alternative fuels, it is only fitting that we develop the infrastructure that is necessary for us to handle those new alternative sources of energy. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, it is very important to point out that in the 109th Congress legislation that is virtually identical to this, H.R. 547, was introduced to help facilitate the marketing of alternative fuels to consumers. In fact, the provisions of H.R. 547 are, as I said, virtually identical to section 15 of H.R. 6203, which was introduced last year. 
   Now, H.R. 6203, the Alternative Research and Energy Research and Development Act, was sponsored by our colleague from Illinois, Mrs. Biggert. And, Mr. Speaker, I have to say that that legislation which is virtually identical to this was passed under suspension of the rules by a voice vote. It was passed unanimously. 
   Democrats and Republicans in the last Congress came together on the 29th of September, clearly a time where there was a lot of division, and yet we came together on this very important piece of legislation designed to help us find ways in which we can deal with the infrastructure challenges of putting new alternative sources of energy into the hands of consumers in this country. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, as I said before, I applaud this open rule. I commend Chairwoman Slaughter for her first attempt at beginning to open up this legislative process to all Members. Frankly, I was wondering exactly when it would happen. However, I feel it is necessary to point out, as I have said before, that this almost exact same bill did pass under what is know as suspension of the rules. I know that that is an inside baseball, an inside baseball issue here, Mr. Speaker. 
   Suspension of the rules means that there is little or no controversy to an issue. It is required to have a two-thirds supermajority vote with 20 minutes of debate on each side. So that is the way this legislation passed the last time. I mean, I think it is very safe to say that consideration of this measure, H.R. 547, could have been very appropriately provided for under suspension of the rules, or even as was requested by the distinguished ranking minority member of the Committee on Science, Mr. Hall. In his discussion with Chairman Gordon, the discussion was, why do we not bring this under unanimous consent? 
   I made the same proposal yesterday in the Rules Committee. I understand that the new majority does in fact want to have an opportunity to point out that we are going to be considering an issue under an open rule. I commend them for that. I am just saying that it is very, very easy to bring a noncontroversial issue that will likely have unanimous support at the end of the day under an open rule. 
   Now, while I think that the research and development of clean alternative energy sources is highly critical to our Nation, I hope that in the future, in the future that we can save productive, yet noncontroversial, bills for consideration under the provision known as suspension of the rules, or under unanimous consent agreements which we easily could have propounded. 
   I hope that we can grant open rules. I hope that we can grant open rules to pieces of legislation that are very crucial and frankly where there is disagreement, where we can see what James Madison envisioned as that clash of ideas, because that is really when the open amendment process is very, very worthwhile and we can engage in extensive and vigorous debate. I know we are going to have amendments that are going to be considered on the floor today.     
   I suspect that most of them will be passed, and I suspect that there will be bipartisan passage of those amendments. And so when I am talking about the future and open rules, I hope that when we do deal with that Madisonian clash of ideas, we are able to do it under an open amendment process. 
   Mr. Speaker, yesterday at the Rules Committee there were seven amendments that were offered by Members, which did require protection, point-of-order protection, which, as we all know, is something that the Rules Committee can do. One amendment would have doubled the tax credit for making biodiesel from recycled restaurant grease. Now this is an issue that came forward by Dr. Mike Burgess from Texas, and I know my colleague on the Rules Committee from Dallas, Mr. Sessions, is going to be talking about this amendment. 
   This is a very, very creative way which will help us address this issue of alternative sources, and it is being done privately. And the notion of providing a tax incentive to deal with the utilization of restaurant grease for biodiesel is, as I said, a very, very interesting and innovative concept, and we could have allowed it to be considered during the debate here on the floor. But to my disappointment, these amendments were not made in order. 
   As I said, the Rules Committee does have the power to do this. And I would say that as we look at this new-found openness and opportunity for debate, I hope very much that when we have creative amendments like this that could be considered, the Rules Committee would do what the Rules Committee often has done in the past, and can do, and that is waive points of order so that a creative idea like this can come forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am overjoyed to be here in strong support of this open rule. And as I said, I look forward to many, many more open rules as we deal with controversial questions that the American people want us to address in the future. The Democrats pledged regular order and a transparent and fair legislative process, and I am very glad, I am very happy and  very grateful to see it beginning at this point. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I congratulate my colleague Mr. Cardoza on his very thoughtful statement and want to say that I am very pleased that he and my other California colleague, Ms. Eshoo, are looking forward, through this open amendment process, to offering their proposal. He stated very correctly that neither of them serve as members of the Science Committee, but by virtue of having an open amendment process, they will have an opportunity to participate. So I join him in stating that I hope very much that as we look at issues where we see great controversy in the future that we will be able to have Members participate in a way that Members will be able participate today on this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, in light of the fact that my new friend from Hartland is prepared to close debate, I will do the same on our side. 
   I do so to simply say that I do rise in strong support of this open amendment process. I congratulate Mr. Gordon, I congratulate Mr. Hall, and the other Democrats and Republicans who have come together to do what we did in the last Congress, to pass this very important legislation which is designed to allow us to focus on the infrastructure challenges that we as a Nation will have to deal with as we pursue ethanol, biodiesel, all of the multifarious forms  that are alternative ways of our dealing with the energy needs of this country.     
   Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of representing the Los Angeles Basin, part of it, along with other great colleagues of mine on both sides of the aisle. We have very serious environmental challenges there; air quality problems are very great, and doing what we can to encourage these alternative sources has been a priority for my Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and for Republicans and Democrats alike. 
   One of the things that we like to argue is that Republicans and Democrats and Independents, everyone likes to breathe clean air. Everyone wants to have an opportunity to deal with the challenges that are out there, whether it is global warming or just the overall concern about environmental quality. It is very, very important for us to do that. 
   I believe that this is legislation that is going to pass, probably unanimously. I can't imagine anyone voting against it. I know that there are some thoughtful amendments that will come forward on this. 
   But I do want to also say, Mr. Speaker, that it is a new day. It a new day because we have seen a change, a change from what we have seen in the first several weeks of this Congress. 
   Now, I know that a number of people talked about the fact that we have had a vigorous discussion and debate over the issues that my friend from Massachusetts mentioned, the issues of college loans, stem cell research, the minimum wage increase. But we know that those are issues that enjoy broad bipartisan support among the American people. I was proud to have supported the stem cell research legislation, identical to what I voted for in the last Congress. There would have been no reason for me to oppose it. 
   But, frankly, I will say that as I looked at the other issues that were included in that 6 for '06 package, Mr. Speaker, I opposed them because they didn't allow for the kind of opportunity to improve the legislation that we are going to see today. 
   Now, again, it is hardly necessary, because this could have been done under suspension of the rules; and my challenge to my very distinguished colleagues is, as Mr. Hall said so eloquently, we don't need to simply have an open rule for the sake of an open rule on an issue that everyone agrees over. There is complete agreement on this issue. What we need to have is an open and vigorous debate when we have disagreement and, again, a clash of ideas, as James Madison envisaged it when he talked about the establishment of this great institution. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I praise my colleagues for putting together this effort. I congratulate once again my colleague from New York, Ms. Slaughter, the distinguished new Chair, the first woman to chair the Rules Committee. I congratulate Mr. McGovern, who so ably is carrying on his responsibility in the new majority on the Rules Committee. I look forward to working with my colleagues as we pursue our goals of making sure that we do the best thing for the American people, and that is to come together to address the very crucial public policy questions that confront us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise to express my appreciation to my very good friend from Rochester, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules (Ms. Slaughter), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
   I have to say that this is somewhat unusual for me. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule, but I rise in even stronger opposition to the underlying legislation. 
   Here we go again, Mr. Speaker. These bills bring us to round three, round three of the Democratic leadership's Iraq charade. 
   First they brought up a bill that they knew the President would veto. Then they called for a veto override that they knew would fail. And today we are once again considering the same defeatist policy that failed in the first two rounds plus, plus, Mr. Speaker, a call for redeployment, basically withdrawal, within 90 days, to begin withdrawal within 90 days. 
   Mr. Speaker, they may think that they made progress, but in truth we have, in fact, gone backwards. Kicking the pullout vote a few months down the road is not a solution. 
   Mr. Speaker, the closing remarks that were just offered by the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, I think were right on target in describing the exact goal that we have here. We want to make sure that the American people are secure. We want to make sure that our troops can be successful. We want to make sure that our troops come home. And we want to make sure that the Iraqi people can live with dignity. The one thing that I will add with that statement that Ms. Slaughter just made, Mr. Speaker, is that not only simply live with dignity but with the kind of self-determination that led to a 70 percent voter turnout in Iraq. So obviously we share the exact same goal that Ms. Slaughter just outlined. 
   But I am very, very troubled with the plans that we have before us. Frankly, Mr. Speaker, withdrawal that would begin in 90 days would undermine every single one of those goals to which Ms. Slaughter just referred. And this time, Mr. Speaker, it is not just the President's opposition that stands in their way of what it is that they are trying to do. Their own colleagues in the Senate have said that the House Democratic leadership's approach won't work on their side of the Capitol.     
   Senate Majority Leader Reid has criticized their punting strategy and acknowledged he has serious doubts that the House plan could actually get through the Senate. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, this policy of defeat couldn't prevail in April. It won't prevail in May. So it would appear the idea is to wait and hope for the best in July. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq is not a game. Funding our troops who are in harm's way is not a game. These votes may make my friends on the other side of the aisle feel good, but they aren't doing anything to get our troops what they need to protect themselves and to fight effectively against terrorists around the world. Mr. Speaker, that's what matters here. 
   Again, going back to the words of the very distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, Ms. Slaughter, we want to make sure that we are secure at home. The way to do that is to ensure that the troops have what they need. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation to have a serious, substantive debate to supply our troops with the funds they need to do their job and to demonstrate to the American people that we are doing what is necessary to win in Iraq and to bring our troops home. But rather than fulfilling our duties as responsible legislators, Democratic leadership has simply scheduled one more empty political vote under yet another totally closed process. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats go so far as to have three closed rules, two of them on appropriations bills. Now, we will consider four appropriations bills this year, and all of them, Mr. Speaker, will have been under a completely closed process. And we all know, under both Democrats and Republicans, the tradition is that when it comes to wartime supplementals, they be considered under an open amendment process, but that's been thrown out the door. 
   This is a far cry, Mr. Speaker, from the open and fair Congress that was promised to the American people. Worse yet, buried in the appropriations bill is yet another totally closed rule, completely and prospectively shutting out Republicans 2 months from now.  And they even go so far as to totally deny us a motion to recommit, something that we never did in the 12 years that we were in the majority. And those were tame restrictions when compared to what they tried to do to the Senate. 
   It has been said by my very good friend from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for whom I have the highest regard. I served with him for many years on the Rules Committee. I had the privilege for the past 8 years of chairing the Rules Committee, and during that period of time, Mr. McGovern would regularly say that the Rules Committee is the place where democracy goes to die. Mr. Speaker, I think that it is only fitting that it is the rule which provides for this bill, for his bill, that we will use to pronounce the time of death. And while this tactic fails to achieve a legislative success here at home, it is already producing disastrous results in Iraq. 
   Ryan Crocker, the very highly regarded new ambassador to Iraq, I've heard a number of leading Democrats, a number of leading outspoken foes of what it is that we are doing in Iraq speak very highly of Ryan Crocker. Ambassador Crocker said last week in an interview with Morton Kondracke of The Roll Call, that the Iraqis are watching the Democratic leadership's political games play out in Congress. They hear the calls to abandon our mission, and it is taking away any will to negotiate among political factions and achieve an effective government capable of bringing about a political solution to the crisis. 
   Mr. Speaker, as Kondracke puts it in his piece, and I quote, ``What is going on in Congress is hurting Crocker's ability to get the sides in Iraq to make agreements with one another.'' He goes on to say, Mr. Speaker, ``It hardens the sectarian divisions. They think we are going to leave, and instead of reaching across lines and making agreements with the adversary, they are getting ready to go to the mat.'' 
   Now, that is what Mr. Kondracke writes following his discussion with Ambassador Crocker, and it's very troubling. 
   What we do here and say here, Mr. Speaker, has consequences. And the report back from the new Ambassador to Iraq is that those consequences are not good. Those who would declare this war lost before the new strategy of, again, the very highly regarded General David Petraeus, who enjoyed unanimous support of the United States Senate, that means Democrats and Republicans on a recorded vote provided unanimous support confirming General David Petraeus. We are now basically, with what we are trying to do here with this effort, not even giving his new strategy a chance to succeed, and I believe that it is a huge mistake. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, like everyone in this institution and people around this country, I read the newspapers, 
   and I watch the news. I watch the pictures on television. And I know that the terrible images of violence that are broadcast every day permeate. And as we see those horrible pictures, I don't blame the American people for becoming extremely discouraged by what is being reported out of Iraq. And I will say that I am horrified by the pictures and the things that we see coming out of Iraq. But there is real and significant progress that is being achieved by our military. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Chicago Tribune editorialized just yesterday on one of the great success stories, that success story being the al Anbar province, which is the large province just to the west of Baghdad. Its capital city, Ramadi, was once described by the New York Times as the most dangerous city in Iraq and potentially the most dangerous city on the face of the earth. Today, Mr. Speaker, this former outpost for the insurgency is not only a secure city, it is a model for Sunni, Shia and American cooperation in the fight against the organization that was responsible for what happened on September 11, 2001, that being al Qaeda. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Chicago Tribune editorial said, ``al Qaeda's terrorists in Iraq now face a new enemy, Sunni tribesmen in the al Anbar province.'' Their editorial goes on, and I quote, ``These tribal leaders in the heart of the insurgency are now backing coalition and Iraqi forces against the terrorists.'' ``You want good news from Iraq,'' the Chicago Tribune editorial goes on to say, ``there it is, flashing in neon.'' 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, this editorial goes on to quote the New York Times report saying, ``The progress has inspired an optimism in the American command that among some officials borders on giddiness.'' ``There are some people who would say we have won the war out here,'' one Marine officer said. I am simply quoting, I would say to my friend, the chair of the Rules Committee, not something that a Republican said, but the editorial that appeared just yesterday. I would encourage all of our Members to look at that editorial in the Chicago Tribune. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, through the Joint Services stations that have been established, local Sunni police, Shia Army officers and U.S. military have worked hand in hand to take back the city and the province and drive al Qaeda out. With the full support and cooperation of the local Sunni leaders, the Shia Army has earned the confidence of the local population. Through their alliance, they are achieving our objective for the entire country, peace sustained by the Iraqis themselves through national unity. 
   Mr. Speaker, General Petraeus came here, as we all know, just 2 weeks ago to provide Members of the House of Representatives with a classified briefing on Iraq. Unfortunately, the Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, was unable to attend that briefing, but for those of us who were there, we were given a realistic picture from General Petraeus of what was taking place. He did not, and I don't know all of the Members who were there, Mr. Speaker, but I will say, General Petraeus did not sugarcoat the tremendous challenges that lie ahead in this war in Iraq. But, Mr. Speaker, he also described tremendous successes, such as this great success that I just reported on in Ramadi, what was one of the most dangerous cities on the face of the Earth and has now been stabilized in the al Anbar province. 
   General Petraeus described the Sunni Arabs who have turned against al Qaeda and have joined the Iraqi Security Forces. Our American and Iraqi forces have succeeded in detaining a number of key network leaders, getting critical intelligence on how various elements of al Qaeda operate in Iraq, taking apart a car bomb network that killed 650 citizens in Baghdad and destroying several significant car bomb factories. These are the kinds of joint efforts that are taking place at this very moment in Iraq, Mr. Speaker. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, General Petraeus has spoken publically about these successes, about the reduction in sectarian murders in Baghdad by two-thirds so far this year, about the tripling of seizures of weapons cashes this year, about the revival of markets and the return of displaced families to neighborhoods and cities that were previously totally uninhabitable because of violence. Mr. Speaker, these success stories are not meant to paint a rosy picture of Iraq. And I will say that again, Mr. Speaker. I'm not attempting to sugarcoat the situation in Iraq. I'm not attempting to paint a rosy picture of what is taking place in Iraq. I know how horrendous and what a difficult situation this is. 
   We all know the enormous challenges that our military still faces there and will continue to face for some time to come, not just to be solved by September; it will extend longer than that, we all know that. The other night I was with Ambassador John Negroponte who reminded me of the public statement that he made just as he left his ambassadorial post in Baghdad; he said it would be at least 5 years. So we all know that this battle and this struggle is going to continue. 
   But what these successes do demonstrate very, very clearly is that we have not lost this war. They demonstrate that our men and women, when they have the necessary resources, can achieve victory. We must give General Petraeus adequate time and adequate resources to build upon these successes and make his new strategy work. Setting a day for defeat, whether it is today, next week or at the end of July or September is simply not an acceptable policy. Rationing funding for our troops is not an acceptable policy. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I offered two amendments yesterday in the Rules Committee that would have stricken two of the most egregious elements of  this legislation. First, I proposed to remove the July cutoff date for the troops' funding. Our generals in the field have said that this limitation ties their hands and keeps them from doing even their near-term planning, which is absolutely essential if the successes that we have seen are going to continue. Wars aren't won in 2-month increments, and military victories aren't achieved by congressional decree. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, my second amendment would eliminate the requirement that the President make his reports to Congress on the Internet. Even in its unclassified form, this highly sensitive information would provide information to our enemies and the enemies of the Iraqi people. It would provide them with their blueprint for victory. The notion of providing this report from the President to the Congress, not in any kind of confidential way but on the Internet, is absolutely outrageous. There is no justifiable reason for us to give the people who are wanting to kill us and are responsible for the violence in Iraq this kind of information. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, neither of the amendments that I offered was made in order. They would have provided an opportunity to consider a troop funding bill that would actually be enacted and would actually fund the troops rather than simply staging one more meaningless vote allowing Members to posture. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I understand very well, having been in the majority for a while, I understand that the Democratic leadership is in a very tough spot. They want to be able to say that they are funding the troops. At the same time, they have to accommodate their Members who want to get out yesterday. They want to get out immediately, regardless of the consequences. So their political situation is to schedule vote after meaningless vote. They get their weekly opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to say, ``I support the troops,'' out of one side of their mouth, and ``Let's retreat'' and get out immediately out of the other side of their mouth.     
   But, Mr. Speaker, our troops and the American people deserve more than political gimmicks. We must stop playing dangerous games with the lives of the American people, our men and women in uniform, and the Iraqi people who have been struggling for freedom. We must get our troops the funding that they need and give our military commanders the means to win and to do what we all want, Mr. Speaker, to bring our troops home. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I listened to my very good friend from Vermont, my Rules Committee colleague, Mr. Welch, for whom I have the highest regard, he talked about the fact that the President was sticking his heels into the ground and was not willing to make any modifications whatsoever. 
   Well, I will acknowledge that the President has in fact, I would say to my friend from Vermont, Mr. Welch, stuck his heels in the ground when it has come to his quest for victory, to ensure that we keep the battle against al Qaeda and those forces that would want to do us in in Iraq. What he has done in recognizing that mistakes have been made, in recognizing that there have been challenges, as has historically been the case in war, we have seen a dramatic change. 
   I don't know if my friends have noticed, but there is a new Secretary of Defense, his name is Robert Gates; and there have in fact been a number of changes made. I don't know if people have noticed, there is in fact a new commanding general on the ground in Iraq. His name is David Petraeus. As I said in my opening remarks, he has enjoyed strong bipartisan support. 
   Obviously, these military leaders, the Secretary of Defense and other military leaders, are insistent upon giving a very sober assessment of what is taking place and not providing an unrealistic, rosy picture of what is happening in Iraq. And they have reported, they have reported that we have in fact seen success, especially, as I said in my remarks, in Ramadi, what was determined to be one of the most dangerous cities on the face of the Earth; and we have now seen stability there, and this alliance which exists, Sunni, Shia and American forces working together to bring about this kind of peace and stability. 
   So while I am not saying there aren't difficult days, weeks, months, and, Mr. Speaker, I hope not, but possibly difficult years ahead in Iraq, the fact of the matter is this President has made it very clear that he is willing to make modifications so that we can in fact ensure victory over those who want to do us in.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I had one Member who was hoping to come over, and I do not see him here. So I'm going to yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all know how painful the war in Iraq has been. As I said in my opening remarks and throughout this debate, no one is trying to paint a rosy picture of the situation there. 
   My very good friend from Wisconsin, distinguished Chair of the Appropriations Committee, has just told us that we should be fighting the war in the right place. Well, Mr. Speaker, one of the things that we have found tragically over the past several years is that al Qaeda can be found almost anyplace on the face of the Earth. 
   It was just a few months ago that we saw a successful effort by the Ethiopians going into Mogadishu, Somalia, to liberate that capital from the forces of al Qaeda. We know very well that on September 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacked us here in the United States, and we regularly go through the litany of the actions of al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah: the bombing of the two embassies, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya; the USS Cole; the Khobar Towers; the World Trade Center in 1993. 
   We can go on and on and on about al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. And guess what, Mr. Speaker, virtually everyone has acknowledged that the front line in the battle against al Qaeda is where they are mostly, and that is in Iraq. 
   Now, I just reported the great statement that came from our new ambassador, Ryan Crocker, in Iraq who has talked along with General Petraeus about the success that we have seen in the al Anbar province, in Ramadi in particular, one of the most dangerous spots on the face of the Earth until we saw this alliance develop among Sunni, Shia and American forces standing up against al Qaeda because, Mr. Speaker, al Qaeda is there in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I truly believe that fighting al Qaeda in Iraq plays a big role in preventing them from attacking us right here in the United States of America, which is obviously their goal. They have done it before, and they would love to do it again. 
   This process around which we are considering this measure is very unusual to say the least. In fact, my good friend from Rochester, distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee, described this rule as one of the most complicated that we have ever seen. 
   Now, my good friend again, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, just talked about the fact that we are going to give the President his chance to see this. Well, here is what we are going to give the President. We are going to give the President a bill that potentially calls for cut-and-run and immediate withdrawal within 90 days, beginning a pullout of our troops in Iraq; number two, a supplemental appropriations bill that has all of this redeployment that creates fits and starts, beginning and reduction, just incrementally putting it out, which has been harshly criticized by the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Gates; General Petraeus; Ambassador Crocker and others. So that is included in this measure, and then the agricultural appropriations provision. 
   Now, my friend from Wisconsin just asked how many Members will stand up and be supportive of the effort that I laud in dealing with something that we were not able to deal with in the last Congress as we struggled with the appropriations process, that, among others, being this agricultural appropriations issue, with the disasters that we have faced. And of course, there will be Members on our sides of the aisle who will support that. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I think we need to recognize that this is the most convoluted process because we are not allowing it to stand on its own. What we are doing with this rule is we are taking all three of these very separate items, linking them up, and sending them to our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol in the United States Senate, where the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, the one who's already announced that we've lost the war in Iraq, he said there's very little chance of success there. 
   That's why I have always considered myself, I like to have that Jeffersonian spirit of a healthy skepticism, as opposed to a corrosive cynicism, which sometimes we have seen more than a few people slip to around here. But I can't help but be skeptical. I'm not going to be cynical, Mr. Speaker, but I can't help but be a little skeptical as we look at the one, two, three punch of vote after vote after vote when we know full well it will most likely die in the Senate; and if it by chance, as this last bill did, ends up getting to the President, it's going to be vetoed by the President. 
   So as I said earlier, it allows our colleagues to stand up, as so many have, during this debate saying they support the troops, but at the same time they want to get out immediately and not provide the troops with the kind of consistency and support that they need for us to be victorious. 
   Again, one of the interesting things that we hear, as we juxtapose the debate that emanates from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and ours, is that we regularly talk about victory. We regularly talk about being victorious in this battle against Islamic extremism, the battle which we all united to fight on September 11, 2001. It is tragic that we have gotten to the point where we are not united on this. 
   And I will acknowledge that there were some who tried to exude the image that Iraq was involved on September 11, and I never said that and most people I know never claimed that Saddam Hussein was involved in command and control of what happened on September 11, 2001; but, Mr. Speaker, I will say this: Saddam Hussein had the exact same goal for the future of the United States as al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, and that's why we need to be prepared to fight them at any spot whatsoever. 
   I am going to offer when, I say ``when'' because I am going to be an eternal optimist, when we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer the amendment that I was speaking about earlier.

   The amendment that I am going to offer when we defeat the previous question, Mr. Speaker, is an amendment that will allow us to say that we will strike the provision that says that the report from the President to the Congress is provided on the Internet for the world to see. We should not be feeding our enemies, those who want to kill us, with this kind of information. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, I'm going to urge defeat of the previous question, and when we defeat that, I urge support of my quest to make the amendment in order that will allow us to prevent the President's report from getting on to the Internet for our enemy to see, and if by chance I am not successful, I urge defeat of the rule.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   I rise in the strongest possible opposition to the rule, recognizing full well that there are a wide range of views on the constitutionality of this question. 
   I have listened to Mr. Arcuri, the gentleman from New York, make his argument that he believes very much in the right to representation, which I obviously completely concur with. And the people of the District of Columbia, I think, are very ably represented here right now by our distinguished friend, my Delegate who represents me very well, since I seem to spend more time here than I do in California, Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton. But the fact is,  Mr. Speaker, as we look at this question, Thomas Jefferson was the one who said ``Two thinking men can be given the exact same set of facts and draw different conclusions.''     
   And so I recognize that there are some who come down on the side of believing that it is constitutional for us to proceed with this. I read the Constitution in a little different way. When I see those two words, the ``several States'' as being the criterion for representation here, or at least one of the criteria for representation here in the House of Representatives, it says to me that there need to be changes to the U.S. Constitution if in fact we are going to proceed with the action that the majority in this House, the majority leadership in this House, wants to take on. 
   So I recognize that there are disparate views on this, Mr. Speaker. The thing that troubles me most is the procedure around which we are considering this measure. And what I would like to do, I would like to engage my good friend from New York, Mr. Arcuri, the manager of the rule, in a colloquy, if I might, just to consider this procedure around which we are going to be debating this question. 
   Actually, from what I can tell, in our analysis of this rule, we are blazing completely new ground here when it comes procedurally to this institution. I have heard a lot of criticism over the years of the tenure that I had as chairman of the Rules Committee, and one of the points that I would like to make is it wasn't really about what we did, but it was about promises that were made about fairness, promises that were made about the way every Member of this House, Democrat and Republican, was going to have an opportunity to participate. 
   So the question that I have is, I know that under regular order, if the House agrees to a straight motion to recommit the bill to the committee, or such a motion with instructions that the committee promptly report it back with an amendment, the bill then, when that motion to recommit prevails, does in fact go back to the committee and it must naturally assume that the committee will follow the House's instructions. And I wonder if the gentleman could tell me if that is in fact going to be the case under our consideration of this rule that we are going to be voting on, the one that we are debating right now.

   Mr. DREIER. The rule contains two motions to recommit, one for each bill. 
   My question is whether or not the success of a motion to recommit would in fact send this measure back to committee, or would it in fact do something that has never, ever been done before, based on my reading of the rule: Would it in fact kill the bill itself?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Yes. But the point is if, for the first time ever, this rule actually takes a motion to recommit, Mr. Speaker, and it basically submits it to be laid on the table potentially, the bill to be laid on the table, therefore preventing the House from having the opportunity to work its will, never before in the history of this institution, Mr. Speaker, has this kind of sleight of hand been used. We know, Mr. Speaker, why it is that we are here considering this measure again. It is very simply due to the fact that a bipartisan majority, Republicans leading with Democrats voting along in support of the motion to recommit on this bill, led to what is clearly sleight of hand, undermining the long-standing tradition. 
   We, as the minority, on 47 different occasions in the years leading up to our winning the majority in 1994, were denied the opportunity have a motion to recommit. We were denied that time and time again, Mr. Speaker. Not every time, but we were often denied it. 
   So that is the reason that we made a decision when we won the majority in 1994 that we were going to guarantee that the minority had a right to offer a motion to recommit, at least one bite at the apple, and in most cases a substitute; so at least two bites at the apple in most cases. But we very, very firmly made that commitment to the motion to recommit. 
   Now, what is it that's happened? We lost the majority in last November's election.

   Mr. DREIER. I will yield in just a moment when I am done with my statement. I know the gentleman has plenty of time. I look forward to yielding to the gentleman, but I would like to explain why it is that we're here and how outrageous this rule is. 
   What happened last November, when we lost the majority, we got ourselves in a position where we figured, gosh, we will have only one bite at the apple, only one opportunity to allow the majority of the House to come together and address these issues. And what happened, Mr. Speaker? What happened is very clear. On seven occasions so far in the 110th Congress, the House has worked its will. A bipartisan majority of Republicans and Democrats came together and succeeded in passing motions to recommit, including on a District of Columbia bill that we are addressing here. 
   So what is it that happened? Because of the fact that the Democratic majority leadership, not a majority of the House, but the majority leadership decided they did not want us to do this, they have resorted to a procedure which unfortunately creates a scenario whereby if the House succeeds in passing a motion to recommit, the opportunity to have a bill laid on the table, which basically kills the bill completely, is put before us. And I think, Mr. Speaker, that that is a very, very unfortunate precedent that the new majority is looking at, and they are doing it simply to subvert the will of this House. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to yield to my friend.

   Mr. DREIER. If I could reclaim my time, since I'm managing the time here, Mr. Speaker, I could reclaim it by saying I have already spoken about the fact that I recognize Mr. Arcuri's belief that this is a constitutional bill, and I share his commitment to fairness of the bill itself. 
   I am not here talking about the bill. I am here talking about the procedure, which is blatantly unfair, that is undermining the opportunity for this House to work its will on this issue. When I yielded to the gentleman, it was to talk about our procedure here. I think that it is very, very unfortunate that for the first time in the over 200-year history of this institution, we are going to be taking this very precious right of a motion to recommit and killing legislation.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me just say at the outset that I am happy to yield to my friend from the District of Columbia at any time whatsoever, and I want to once again praise her representation and the passion that she shows in her commitment to this issue. 
   As I said, I spent a great deal of time residing here in the District of Columbia, and I feel she very ably represents the District of Columbia and I am proud to have her as a colleague, Mr. Speaker. 
   Now, let me say this. I feel that the passion that she has shown in arguing in behalf of the legislation itself is something that I recognize and revere. 
   I said to Mr. Arcuri, Mr. Speaker, that I believe there can be recognition that there are diverse views on this question. I have come down on the side of recognizing that those words in the Constitution, ``the several States,'' mean that if we are going to do this, we should do it through a different route than the one that we are pursuing.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I will say that obviously it appears, and the gentlewoman has already stated what she believes the outcome will be in this House; it be will be in the hands of those two Senators of whom she just referred, and we will see what happens, whether it is within the first branch of government or within the third branch of government. Obviously, the second branch of government will have a role in determining this. 
   The argument that I believe needs to be made, and Mr. Sessions just touched on this and has been arguing it throughout his management of this, the passion that is shown for the rights of the District of Columbia are very, very important, and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia, Mr. Speaker, recognizes those and represents them extraordinarily well. 
   But an equal passion for the Constitution of the United States and, Mr. Speaker, an equal passion for the job that Mr. Sessions and I and Mr. Arcuri and the other members of the Rules Committee have for democracy in this institution is something that is very, very important. 
   I would say, Mr. Speaker, to my friend from the District of Columbia, who argues so strongly on behalf of the need for representation here in the House of Representatives for the District of Columbia, that if we look at this rule, which is subverting 200 years of precedent in this institution, by saying that if a motion to recommit on either of these bills in fact prevails, the motion is laid on the table, never before in the history of this institution, Mr. Speaker, has this been done. 
   So I have to say that we have an equal passion for our commitment to the precedents and the responsibility of the greatest deliberative body known to man; and for that reason, Mr. Speaker, we are troubled with the procedure around which we are about to move ahead with this very important debate.

   Mr. Speaker, let me just say the thing that is most troubling is the decision to pull this bill was not a decision made by the minority. It was made by the majority leadership when that happened before this break. The reason that decision was made was that there was a sense that a majority in this House, a majority in this House might have been supportive of that motion to recommit that we were about to vote on. 
   Never before, never before had we seen, as general debate, as the debate had been completed, all of a sudden the bill was pulled from the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, as is very evident, this is a sad day and evening for the House of Representatives, and, of course, the Lantos family, and for all of the American people and all who are lovers of freedom. 
   ``Tom Lantos devoted his life to shining a bright light on dark corners of oppression.'' That was a quote from Speaker Pelosi in her official statement in responding to the tragic news of TOM's passing. 
   I am going to quote Speaker Pelosi once again, Madam Speaker. ``Tom Lantos devoted his life to shining a bright light on dark corners of oppression.'' 
   We have heard that TOM LANTOS is the lone survivor of the Holocaust to ever serve in the Congress of the United States. We know of his tremendous accomplishments. We know the  fact that 58 years ago this coming July he and Annette were married. And we know that he had an absolutely wonderful family. 
   His two daughters did provide those 18 grandchildren and two great grandchildren, and I have to say that I personally have had the opportunity to spend time with all of them. The reason is that I am one of Annette and TOM's neighbors here on Capitol Hill, and we always knew when the Lantos household was filled over at Justice Court, because kids were running around all over that area, and it was such a wonderful thing. 
   When I heard the Speaker say today what TOM's daughters said to him, the fact that he lost his family in the Holocaust would lead them to provide him with a family that he no longer had, obviously they did. I have known of no parent or grandparent to be prouder of their children and grandchildren than Annette and TOM LANTOS have been of their wonderful family, and having heard Speaker Pelosi's words, I now have an even greater understanding of the importance of the role that Annette and Katrina played in providing them with that family.     
   We got the news I read this morning in the paper that just last week the Prime Minister of Hungary was scheduled to present TOM with the highest honor that Hungary bestows on anyone; and, sadly, he was too ill to receive that honor. But we know that TOM regularly described himself as one who was born Hungarian, but was American by choice; and I think that underscores the extraordinary importance of immigration and the great importance of what it is that has made the United States of America as great as it is. 
   One of the things, I am the first Republican to stand up but I am going to be turning this over to the distinguished ranking member on the Committee on Foreign Affairs in just a few minutes, but as the first Republican to stand up, I have to say that one of the greatest things about Tom Lantos is that he regularly transcended political party. He was known for the wonderful working relationship that he had with the former chairman of his committee who, as we all know, passed away sadly last year, our colleague Henry Hyde. 
   And I regularly, as a member of the Rules Committee, had the opportunity to see Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos come together, arm in arm, working together on behalf of a very positive foreign policy for the United States. Now, don't get me wrong, there were more than a couple of occasions, especially in the last couple of years, where there was disagreement between Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos. But time and time again, both men demonstrated their extraordinary patriotism and their commitment to the greatness of the United States of America. 
   On January 2, just last month, our friend TOM announced that he would not be running for reelection. Of course, he had gotten the news of his illness. And in that statement announcing his retirement, Madam Speaker, he said, ``It is only in the United States that a penniless survivor of the Holocaust and fighter in the anti-Nazi underground could have received an education, raised a family, and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a Member of the United States Congress. I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country.'' 
   Madam Speaker, one of the things that I regularly say about the United States of America, and I think like most of the people who are here in this Chamber at this moment, we were born here; and people who were born here can have a tendency to take the greatness of the United States of America for granted. But I will say that Tom Lantos demonstrated fully, through every single aspect of his life, the profound appreciation that an immigrant has for something that many of us who are native born have a tendency to take for granted. And I regularly fight against that, and seeing someone like Tom Lantos has played a big role in inspiring me. And I know there are other great immigrants who serve in this Congress and obviously in this country as well. And I think that his life underscores that. 
   As I look over and see our distinguished majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, I am reminded of the great work that he did on the Helsinki Commission and, as has been stated on the issues that Mr. Stark raised, environment and other issues. But when it came to fighting on behalf of human rights, in 1983 Annette Lantos became the volunteer director of the Human Rights Caucus because of her extraordinary commitment to that cause. And, obviously, it was led by TOM through these so many years. 
   And I will just say that for me, personally, I was elected with TOM in November of 1980, 28 years ago this coming November; and this is a professional loss, but obviously for so many of us, a very profound personal loss. And I want to say to all of the family members how much I have appreciated the friendship. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. And the world is a better place, the world clearly is a better place for the life of Tom Lantos. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and ask unanimous consent that my colleague from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) be able to manage the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7321, AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by expressing my appreciation to my good friend from Rochester, the very distinguished and able Chair of the Committee on Rules, Ms. Slaughter, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and with that I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am in strong opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation. We have a very, very serious economic crisis in this country, as we all know. The crisis is demanding decisive action on the part of this Congress. The American people are expecting us to take action to try to mitigate the suffering that is there today. But we also have to be very smart about what it is that we do. Hundreds of thousands of workers have already lost their jobs or on the brink of losing their jobs. Hundreds of thousands of families have already lost their homes or are on the brink of losing their homes. We have a profound responsibility to make prudent decisions that will help to spur new economic growth, create new good jobs for American workers, and to strengthen the vitality of our economy. We need to restore that strengthened vitality that has been there and we know is going to come back, and it will come back quickly if we do the right thing. 
   But rushing into an ill-conceived bailout of an industry that has not yet proven it has a viable plan to remain solvent and competitive with the help of the taxpayer dollars of hardworking Americans who are suffering today won't save a single job. It won't save a single job. And you can look across the spectrum of Democrats and Republicans alike who have made it very clear that they don't believe that there is a viable plan that has been put forward. 
   I have to say, Mr. Speaker, that the proposed bailout that is before us has led many Americans to rightly question where will this end? How many bailouts are there going to be?     
   We know that the American people are today suffering from what can only be described as bailout fatigue. How many billions of our taxpayer dollars will be spent? What guarantees do we have that the money will be spent wisely? 
   Congress first took action to reverse the economic downturn in October. We considered a bill that was intended to thaw the frozen credit markets and to allow the wheels of our economy to begin turning again. I was deeply skeptical of that bill, Mr. Speaker, but I did support it reluctantly when key provisions that we fought for were added, provisions that banned golden parachutes and ensured scrutiny and accountability for the program. 
   The reason for taking this action, as we all know, is very simple. Our economy cannot function if the credit markets don't function. This was not a matter of picking winners and losers. This was not a matter of caring more about workers in the financial services industry than workers in other industries. 
   The fact of the matter was that our credit markets had frozen up, and this was paralyzing our economy across the board. Failing to deal with the financial industry would have left our entire economy crippled, including the very auto companies that are now asking for a bailout. A failed credit system means no one can get a car loan. The financial rescue that we did in October was, in fact, an auto industry rescue. 
   What has been the impact of that bill? Mr. Speaker, we simply do not know yet. A $13 trillion economy doesn't exactly turn on a dime. And, as we all know, half of the money has been utilized so far. 
   We also know, based on very important questions raised by the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, who is here, Mr. Frank, and Mr. Bachus and others, transparency in this whole process has been lacking. 
   I am joined with several of my colleagues in the Republican leadership in demanding that the Treasury Department provide clear answers on how taxpayer dollars have been spent. We are fighting to ensure that there is accountability every step of the way. This will be an ongoing process well into next year, and we may not know the full impact of this bill for many months to come. 
   It's quite possible that further responsible action to provide assistance will be necessary, but the bill before us today asks us to rush into a bailout for a single industry with billions more in taxpayer dollars on the line. It asks us to start picking and choosing winners in this very difficult economic time. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all have car dealerships in our districts. We all have thousands of constituents whose jobs are directly or indirectly tied to the auto industry. We know the figure of one in 10 jobs is tied to the auto industry. 
   But before we rush into a costly bailout, we have to consider a few things. First, we have to consider whether U.S. auto companies are prepared to transform themselves into an innovative and competitive industry. They made an attempt to answer this question in congressional testimony just last week, but they have a very long way to go. A nearly century-old industry doesn't transform itself overnight. We need a far more convincing plan from them on how they will do so in a matter of months.  
   Second, we need to consider our economy at large. Playing favorites with one industry over another is a dangerous game that won't necessarily put us back on sound economic footing. None of us wants to see autoworkers losing their jobs, but neither do we want to see workers in other industries lose their jobs. Our first and only economic priority should be pursuing a pro-growth strategy that provides new opportunity throughout our entire economy. 
   Finally, we have to consider the diverse and complicated landscape of the auto industry. The question of what is an American car used to be a very simple one. That's no longer the case. 
   Mr. Speaker, which is more American? The Ford built in Mexico or the BMW built in South Carolina? What about the Chevy built with Japanese parts and assembled in Canada? How do we pick and choose winners in a diverse industry that involves foreign investment, American workers and a global supply chain? 
   Is the Toyota plant worker in Kentucky less valuable to the U.S. economy than the Ford worker in Detroit? What about the auto parts supplier in Illinois that ships to Mitsubishi, Honda or Mazda, all of which create jobs right here in the United States of America? 
   This is a very complicated matter, and we must very carefully consider the consequences of our picking and choosing the winners and the losers. We certainly can't resolve the issue effectively by simply throwing money at our problems. Instead, we should be considering better alternatives, like creating tax incentives for car purchases, by enabling Americans to give the auto industry a boost so we can relieve the tax burden on families and help all workers in the industry. 
   Unfortunately, this rule, like so many of the rules that we have seen come forward in this Congress, completely shuts out the kind of real debate that we need. It's their way or the highway. 
   Unfortunately, their way offers nothing but wasted billions and false promises. 
   The American people want to know that we are working to restore our economy, but they demand that we act wisely, spend their tax dollars prudently and ensure accountability for every penny. This bill fails on all three of those counts. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I rise in opposition to this rule because it is a martial law rule which provides the opportunity for this measure to come to the floor at any time during the next 4 days. And it is unprecedented. And I know that the gentlewoman has pointed to the fact that at the end of the Congress, it is very often that measures like this are utilized. But there is not a strong bipartisan consensus for us to proceed with the measure that is being considered now. 
   This is, in fact, a $15 billion bailout bill that is not impacting just an entire industry, it's impacting three particular entities within that industry, and to do it under a completely closed process. The distinguished Chair of the Committee on Financial Services, Mr. Frank, acknowledged upstairs, as was stated by the ranking Republican, Mr. Bachus, this was a completely closed process, and we find this to be very, very unfortunate that we're here trying to do this in such a manner. 
   Now, when we were upstairs in the Rules Committee, one of the things that has come forward is the fact that the American people are hurting. We all know that. We very much need to take steps to ensure that we can get this economy growing, and there is a bipartisan consensus on the need to grow our economy. We've lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, as we all know, and in light of that, it is imperative that we take immediate action to try to create jobs for American workers. And that's the reason that my colleague Mr. Diaz-Balart, the gentleman from Miami, and I joined in the Rules Committee last night to do something that most people thought we were going to do last spring and we should have done last spring. And there was acknowledgment, bipartisan acknowledgment, by Members, including Members of the leadership in the majority, that we would, in fact, quite possibly consider this measure in a lame duck session. And I'm referring, of course, to the very important U.S.-Columbia Free Trade Agreement. 
   Last April 10, Madam Speaker, there was a rigorous debate here, and we for the first time ever saw the Speaker of the House take action which subverted the 1974 Trade Act. Basically sent a message that said the following: We as Americans want to embark on negotiations with the country, and under the traditional, what has existed since 1974, so-called fast-track authority, or what we refer to now as trade promotion authority existed, so that that measure would come back to the Congress and there would be an up-or-down vote. And for the first time ever in basically decades and decades, since 1974, we saw that plan completely thrown out the window. That promise that had been made was thrown out the window. But there was one hope left, and that hope was that after the election, in a post-election session, which is where we are right now, we would have an opportunity for a debate and a vote as to whether or not we would pry open the market in Colombia, 40 million consumers strong, and create an opportunity for U.S. workers in Indiana, in Ohio, in Illinois, all across this country to have a chance to sell their products into Colombia. That's really what this agreement is all about. It's all about opening up access to their markets so that we can create good jobs. 
   Now, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules last night was talking about the economic challenges that are faced, the economic difficulty, the devastation that exists in Rochester, Buffalo, and other parts of upstate New York. We recognize that very well. Kodak is one of her largest employers, Madam Speaker, and I believe that by virtue of passing this U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, we will be able to create more good jobs in upstate New York so that their products can be exported into Colombia. 
   Now, there are other States that have been particularly hard hit with this economic downturn that we're facing today. States like Ohio. We regularly hear from our colleagues in Ohio about the devastation that has existed there. One of the great companies in Ohio happens to be Whirlpool, and we know that right now the hardworking  men and women in Ohio at the Whirlpool Company want to have an opportunity to sell washing machines, dryers, refrigerators, and other products that Whirlpool manufactures. And guess what. Under the present structure, Madam Speaker, it's very unfortunate there is a tariff, a tax, on the work product from those American workers in Ohio who are seeking to get their product into Colombia. And what is it that we have had over the last 7 or 8 months? An indication from the April 10 decision that was made here to not proceed with the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. There was a sense that in this lame duck session we would, in fact, consider that. 
   Madam Speaker, I would argue that as important as it was for us to pass that U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement on April 10, it is much, much more important today. Why? Because we have seen hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans lose their jobs and we are here at this moment, at this moment, Madam Speaker, talking about the imperative of creating jobs right here in the United States of America so that they don't flee overseas. 
   And I will say that I mentioned Ohio. It's also important. We're talking about the automobile industry. There is a company called Caterpillar, which is headquartered in Peoria, Illinois. And Caterpillar workers are some of the most dedicated, hardworking, productive workers of any company in this country. And, Madam Speaker, because of the existence of that tariff, the workers who manufacture Caterpillar tractors are unable to sell those tractors into that very important 40 million-strong economy of Colombia because of the fact that we have been recalcitrant and not moved ahead with even a debate or a vote on the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I have to say that we have a great opportunity with this rule. Mr. Diaz-Balart and I, as I said, offered this amendment upstairs which would have allowed us to do what last April 10--we would have never thought last April 10, by the way, that we would be here dealing with the automobile industry as we are. But last April 10 there was an indication by many, including the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules, who said that at that point she was voting to delay consideration of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, today is the day. We all know and we hope and pray that this is the end of the work of the 110th Congress. The 111th Congress will be convening on January 6 and we will begin anew. But guess what. If we don't pass the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement right now, we have thrown years of negotiations out the door. We will see our governments have to start from scratch on this very, very important agreement. 
   And the one thing that I haven't mentioned that I know my friend Mr. Diaz-Balart will discuss is the very important strategic interest that we have in strengthening our strongest ally on the South American continent.     
   We all recognize that the modern history of Colombia has been horrendous, but I argue that the last 5 years have brought us the greatest transformation of any country in a 5-year period of time in modern history. The reason I say that is that if you look at the human rights violations, if you look at the actions of the FARC, the paramilitaries, and a wide range of other entities there, if you look at the murder that has taken place in the past of union leaders, and you compare that to the changes of today, it is important for us to realize that we have seen an amazing transformation. 
   Now, I acknowledge that in the past several weeks, some very unfortunate reports have come to the forefront, but I believe that the tragic murders that have taken place, and the resignation of military leaders and the firing of military leaders because of that, underscores how important it is for us to proceed with this agreement, which will strengthen the economic ties and, I believe, bring about a greater opportunity for the recognition of human rights in Colombia. 
   So we are here at this moment focusing our attention on how it is that we can deal with the automobile industry and create good American jobs. I believe that right now we have an opportunity to do this very, very important thing, and that is open up that market so that U.S. workers can sell their products into Colombia. I hope very much that we are able to see that action taken today. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, we are dealing with what is arguably one of the most difficult and challenging economic times in modern American history. We have seen the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs over the past several months. President-elect Obama has predicted that we are going to see more difficult days ahead than we have already faced, and the American people want us to act and they want us to do the right thing. 
   We all know that the automobile industry is a very, very important sector of the U.S. economy. It is one of the most important. We know that the housing industry is a very important sector of the U.S. economy. Just today, I have introduced legislation which is designed to encourage people to purchase homes by developing an incentive for them to have equity in those homes, because we have a huge backlog of homes that need to be sold all across this country. The measure calls for a tax credit, in fact a refundable credit, for people who make a 10 to 15 percent down payment on their home. 
   Now, why is that the case that we are offering this legislation? It is the fact that, unfortunately, because of bad government policy, and I underscore that again, bad government policy, we have encouraged people through subprime mortgages, the CRA, through abuse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as we saw in yesterday's hearing, we have encouraged people who could not afford it to get into homes way, way beyond their means, by putting nothing down, and at the same time paying subprime interest rates which were clearly going to be going up at a day in the future. So bad government policy created that, in large part because people didn't have equity in their homes. 
   That is why, to deal with this very important housing challenge, I have today introduced this legislation that provides a credit for people who will put a down payment and have a vested interest in their home and keep that home for at least 3 years.     
   I'm talking about that, Madam Speaker, because we need to use creative measures to deal with the challenges that we face today. I also believe that, as we look at this challenge of the automobile industry, we need to do the exact same thing. 
   This morning I met with a man named John Symes, who, in the next couple of weeks, will see his automobile dealership mark its 60th anniversary. They're located in Pasadena, California. Mr. Symes and I talked about the need for us to, again, look at creative ways in which we can encourage, through tax incentives, possibly a credit similar to the one that I just introduced today in the housing industry to deal with the backlog of automobiles that need to be purchased; so, rather than focusing on bailing out the industry, the idea of incentivizing our fellow Americans to get into the showrooms to have an opportunity to have some kind of credit, whether it's, once again, providing an interest deduction on the deduction for the interest on auto loans or the sales tax deduction, those kind of incentives, or some kind of credit. We're in the process of fashioning legislation that I will be introducing soon to deal with that. I know that there are other measures that have been proposed. 
   We need, Madam Speaker, to have a creative way to empower our fellow Americans, rather than all of a sudden taxing our fellow Americans and going through and expanding what is already existing today, and that is what I will describe as ``bailout fatigue'' among our fellow Americans. And it's very, very understandable. And the notion of having the Federal Government continue to expand more and more and more is just plain wrong. 
   I believe that we dealt with this issue, in part, with the measure that we passed in October. It was designed to thaw the frozen credit markets. And so a big part of that was for us to do everything that we could to unleash that. And I believe that if we had not passed that measure that we would be in more dire straits than we face today. 
   So we've already taken a step in trying to ensure that people can get into those showrooms. I do believe that more needs to be done, but I don't believe this is it. 
   And as I said in my remarks earlier, Madam Speaker, I also think that the indication that we had on April 10 of this year that we were going to have an opportunity, in a lame duck session, which is where we are today, to pry open the very, very important market of our strongest, closest ally on the South American continent, that being Colombia, 40 million consumers there, so that we can sell Caterpillar tractors manufactured by U.S. workers, hardworking Americans, in the State of Illinois and in other States, or Whirlpool refrigerators and washing machines and dryers that could be sold into Colombia creating jobs in Ohio; and we regularly hear our colleagues from Ohio and other parts of the country talk about the fact that so many of our fellow Americans have lost jobs. This agreement would do just that. 
   Colombian goods can be sold tariff-free in the United States today, Madam Speaker, coffee, cut flowers, other things that come in from Colombia tariff-free, so they've already got access to the American consumer. All we're saying is that when last spring we, for the first time ever, subverted the 1974 Trade Act, we have a chance to rectify that today. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this martial-law rule and, when we get to it ultimately, since I suspect it will pass, I urge a ``no'' vote on the next rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, what absolute lunacy; paying for a tax that was never intended. 
   I see my friend from New York. In 1969, when this tax was designed to go after 155 millionaires, was it ever anticipated that 23 million middle-income Americans would be shouldering this burden? Absolutely not. So we're supposed to pay for that? Well, the only thing that calls for paying for it is the budget that the new majority put into place. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people sent us here to make laws, not to play games. We know that this is not going to become law. So time and time again, whether it's with our veterans, whether it's with children's health, whether it's with the war in Iraq, and now with our attempt to completely repeal the alternative minimum tax, we see nothing but game playing from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   We do face economic challenges in this future, we know that. We've got some serious problems ahead. Ensuring that we keep this economy growing is essential. That's why we need to completely repeal the alternative minimum tax.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 99, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, as I listened to my colleague on the other side of the aisle, the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), speak about the need to expand spending in a wide range of areas, I could not help but think about why it is that I chose to run for Congress and why I know my Republican colleagues stepped up to the plate to run for Congress. We want a defense capability that is second to none, but we also, Madam Speaker, want to do everything that we possibly can to reduce the size and scope of government, encouraging individual initiative and responsibility. 
   One of the things that troubles me as I listen to the arguments propounded by so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is that they talk about a need that is there. We all want to make sure that we address the very important societal needs that are there. We want to put into place entitlement reform in the area of both Medicare and Medicaid. Why? Not only so we can save taxpayer dollars but so that we can ensure that the Medicare and Medicaid programs are more effective and provide needed assistance to those who are out there who truly are in need.  
   The problem that I have is, as they talk about all of these programs, it undermines, it undermines initiative and responsibility. What we want to do with our budget, Madam Speaker, is everything within our power, as Mr. Sessions said so well, to make sure that we keep taxes low. 
   One of the things that I find to be very troubling is that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle hate most, hate most the taxes that have actually created a surge in revenues to the Federal Treasury. 
   We all know that the budget that they are going to be bringing forward puts into place the largest tax increase in American history. We always held up the 1993 Clinton tax increase, that not one Republican voted for, as the largest increase in history; and I am proud that when we won our majority in 1994 we brought about major changes that, in fact, repealed large parts of that 1993 tax increase. But, Madam Speaker, that 1993 tax increase, which has been held up as the model, as the largest tax increase in American history, pales in comparison to this $392.5 billion tax increase that they are advocating in this budget. 
   Madam Speaker, when I say that they hate most the tax cuts that have created the greatest surge in revenue, I am referring, of course, to capital gains. I have been one who has long advocated a zero capital gains tax rate. One of the things that we found is that reducing the top rate on capital gains has not done what virtually every green eyeshade prognosticator looked at as what happened. They said there would be a loss in revenues to the Federal Treasury. 
   We found, of course, that there has been a surge in revenues to the Federal Treasury. Why? Because it has encouraged economic growth to the point where the deficit this year is actually $73 billion lower than it was last year. And that is as we have cut taxes, met the very important funding priorities of homeland security and national security, and we still have been able to actually reduce the Federal deficit. As a percentage of our Gross Domestic Product the deficit today, which everyone decries, Democrats and Republicans alike decry, is in fact lower as a percentage of the GDP than almost ever. 
   In light of that, Madam Speaker, I think it is very important for us to recognize we have a strong, vibrant, growing economy today. 
   I was very surprised when the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules last night, late last night when we were reporting out this rule, talked about how devastating the economy is. 
   Madam Speaker, I will tell you it is a devastatingly good economy. Just this morning, we got the report that there has been an increase in durable goods purchases. We have a 4.5 percent unemployment rate: 146 million Americans, more than ever in the history of our country, are working today. That is not an accident. We have gone through terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, the economic downturn; and, because of the policies that we put into place, we have the strongest, most dynamic, $13 trillion economy that we have ever seen in the history of the United States of America. 
   Madam Speaker, I talked to an economist last night who said to me, ``You know, I had no idea that they would move this quickly to increase spending and increase taxes.'' And that is exactly what they are doing, and that is why we need to reject this rule and clearly do everything that we can to reject the tax-and-spend budget that they have propounded and support Mr. Ryan's alternative.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (COLOMBIAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by associating myself with the very eloquent remarks of my colleague from Miami, Mr. Diaz-Balart. 
   Mr. Speaker, you never get a second chance to make a first impression, so the old saying goes that we've all heard. Once first impressions are made, it can be difficult to reinvent oneself. Circumstances may change, but assumptions and perceptions are very stubborn things. Just ask any Colombian. 
   People became familiar with the country of Colombia in the 1980s and the 1990s as the drug wars exploded. We didn't know much about the place, but we were familiar with the highlights: Bloody drug wars fought in jungles and on the streets of cities like Medellin, Bogota and Cali. And although we probably couldn't name many of the elected officials in Colombia, everyone knew the name of Pablo Escobar, the drug lord. 
   But over the course of this decade, a dramatic transformation has taken place in Colombia. The rule of gang lords has been replaced by the rule of law. The streets have become safe again. Armed terrorist organizations no longer operate in huge swaths of the country with impunity, and paramilitary groups have been dismantled with their leaders having gone to jail. 
   Funding for the Colombian Justice Department has nearly doubled, to ensure that criminal cases, old and new, are dealt with professionally and expeditiously, sending a clear signal that the days of impunity are long gone. Poverty has been cut dramatically, while social spending has increased. The Colombia of today is unrecognizable to those who knew it just a decade ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege of being there on several occasions and have been amazed by what I have seen. Nowhere is the transformation starker than in the city of Medellin. This city was ground zero for the Escobar drug cartel. Its murder rate rivaled the most dangerous places on the face of the Earth. Terror and violence ruled everyday life. 
   Today, the city tells an utterly different story. Violence has plummeted. New public transportation projects and schools have given hope to previously blighted neighborhoods. New jobs and development, especially in the apparel industry, have provided a path to that first rung of the economic ladder, and greater upward mobility which was totally unheard of just a few years ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, fair trade and specialty coffee industries have also provided new opportunities for well-paying jobs in the area. This thriving community is a shining example of the stunning turnaround that it has made since 2002. 
   And yet much of the world has failed to take notice. While hostages and explosions make for front-page headlines, the slow and steady work of rebuilding a country is far less flashy. But the very difficult and remarkable work that has been done deserves recognizing. Many of us in Congress are working hard to solidify the gains that have been made through the implication of a free trade agreement. This agreement is strongly supported by the private sector unions of Colombia because they welcome the jobs and opportunity that the agreement will bring. 
   I hope very much that the free trade agreement will be considered soon for a vote. But as this debate does go forward, I believe it must proceed based on facts, not assumptions, inaccurate perceptions, and outdated figures. When we talk about Colombia in the year 2008, we are not talking about the Colombia of Pablo Escobar. We are talking about a country transformed and on the mend. After the long, difficult struggle of the Colombian people, we owe them a little credit and recognition for the remarkable things that they have accomplished.

   I would say, Madam Speaker, that I believe this is a very good start. My personal preference would have been that we could have gone back to the provision that we had last year to allow the same kind of protection for earmarks when it comes to both authorization and tax bills. And I hope very much, Madam Speaker, that we are going to have an opportunity to work together. I look forward to working with the distinguished Chair of the  Committee on Rules and the leadership teams on both sides of the aisle to ensure that we can in fact pursue further transparency, openness, accountability and enforceability when it comes to the issue of earmarks.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   This is a very important piece of legislation, Mr. Speaker. We all know, and I was happy to hear my friend in Ohio talk about, the importance of our global competitiveness and we have to have the best educated people as we proceed to make sure that we can compete in that global economy. But I have to say, Mr. Speaker, that the process around which we are considering this very important legislation is just plain wrong. 
   We had 61 amendments that were submitted to us in the Rules Committee. Now, the last time that this was successfully authorized, as Mr. Hastings has pointed out to our colleagues, was 10 years ago. It was done under a modified open rule. 
   We had four Democrats sit before us on one of the panels last night, and they complimented the Rules Committee members for the hard work. And the very distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules proceeded to talk about how life was tantamount to a living hell when we as Republicans were in control versus this great new day that we have. Well, Mr. Speaker, let me tell you just a little bit about this great new day that we have. 
   There have been more than double, I repeat that, more than double the number of closed rules in the first session of the 110th Congress and during this month of January leading up to the first of February than we had in the first session and leading up to the first of February in the 109th Congress, more than double the number of closed rules. And as I said, the last time we authorized this bill was in 1998, and it was done under a modified open rule. Yes, there was an attempt two Congresses ago to do it, and when we had a structured rule, it failed. Why don't those colleagues of ours who are in charge learn from the mistake of having not done this under an open amendment process? 
   So though we continue to hear, Mr. Speaker, that this is a great new day and all these wonderful changes have taken place, we actually have had Democrats and Republicans, Democrats and Republicans, prevented from improving this bill. 
   Now, Mr. Hastings correctly pointed to the fact that the administration has raised a number of concerns, dozens of new programs that are duplicative that are included in this bill. The President wants to work with us to improve this legislation. Doing it under the structure that we have today undermines the potential to see that happen. 
   Reject this rule, and let's come back with at least a modified open rule so that we can proceed with something that in a bipartisan way we very much want to see happen.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2956, RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, here we go again. It has actually been several weeks now since we have had a meaningless vote on the issue of Iraq, and so I suppose we are overdue for another one. This Democratic leadership, Mr. Speaker, as we all know very well, still bereft of any real ideas, has been forced once again to resort to demagoguery, bringing up a bill that they know, they know full well, will not be enacted into law. And knowing that their proposal cannot withstand any critical scrutiny, they have once again shut down the process and brought this to us under a completely closed rule, not allowing any of the very thoughtful proposed alternatives to be considered whatsoever. 
   Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the Rules Committee, I offered an amendment that would have allowed us to have the opportunity to substitute their policy with the very thoughtful and responsible recommendations that were included in this bipartisan Iraq Study Group package of recommendations proposed by Mr. Baker and Mr. Hamilton, a group of Democrats and Republicans, very respected, authorized by this Congress. And they refused to allow us to have any opportunity whatsoever to even debate, much less vote, on the issue of the Iraq Study Group recommendations. 
   Now, just yesterday morning in an interview on National Public Radio, our former colleague Mr. Hamilton, who, as I said, was the co-Chairman of the Iraq Study Group, had a very eloquent and thoughtful interview on the need for us to implement the Iraq Study Group recommendations. Unfortunately, the Democratic leadership, I guess fearful that responsible policy would prevail and that this institution might, in fact, pass the measure calling for implementation of the Iraq Study Group, prevented us from having the chance to debate or vote on the Iraq Study Group recommendations. 
   The last time we went through this charade, they at least had the luxury of making dire predictions of failure for the new strategy in Iraq led by General Petraeus, and the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules once again basically talked about failure and said that we haven't met any benchmarks. Even then, Mr. Speaker, the strategy was actually showing early signs of success. But this time, this time, the counterinsurgency offensive is well under way and making clear and irrefutable progress. 
   I will say once again, Mr. Speaker, that we are seeing clear and irrefutable progress taking place. As one major newspaper recently editorialized, ``Demands for withdrawal are no longer demands to pull out of a deteriorating situation with little hope. They are now demands to end a new approach to this conflict that shows every sign of succeeding.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, U.S. forces, working side by side with Iraqi Army and police forces, have penetrated enemy strongholds in the belt surrounding Baghdad and are driving them out. They have cut off al Qaeda's supply lines and transport routes. They are destroying car bomb factories. Sectarian deaths have plummeted. Al Qaeda operatives are finding themselves increasingly isolated, their safe havens destroyed, and their ability to move freely between neighborhoods severely diminished. 
   Mr. Speaker, our efforts have been significantly bolstered by former Sunni insurgents who have joined the fight against al Qaeda. I am going to say that again. Former Sunni insurgents have now joined our effort in the fight against al Qaeda. Nowhere has this process been more critical than in the al-Anbar province.     
   Last year, a leaked Marine intelligence report conceded this province as completely lost. That was the report that came out. Today, Mr. Speaker, al-Anbar is our best success story, and a template for U.S. Forces working together with both Sunni police and Shia army forces to combat al Qaeda. 
   General David Petraeus, the man who has received bipartisan praise and was confirmed unanimously by a vote of 82-0 in the United States Senate as he began his work, he said to the New York Post, ``We are beginning to see a revolt of the middle against both extremes.'' 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, it is our commanders on the ground who have repeatedly pointed out that the tipping point didn't come until the tribal leaders sought a prolonged offensive by U.S. and Iraqi forces. 
   Now, let's think back to what life was like in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. After a quarter-century reign of terror by Saddam Hussein, Iraqis clearly would not immediately rise up against any force until that force has been driven into retreat. We had to demonstrate our strength and our commitment before we earned the trust of the tribal leaders and their support in the fight against al Qaeda. That is exactly what we're doing today in Baghdad and the surrounding areas. 
   The New York Times recently reported on the Anbar success and how we are currently applying it to the fight to secure Baghdad. According to a July 8 report, former insurgents in Sunni neighborhoods of Baghdad are now taking up arms against al Qaeda. Now, that is July 8th, a report that came out just 4 days ago. Now, it quotes Petraeus as saying, ``Local security is helped incalculably by local support and local involvement.'' 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, this success is so critical because it gets to the heart, it gets to the very heart of our twin goals in Iraq. First, that Iraqis will be able to provide their own security, that we have an increased ISF, the Iraqi Security Forces, and that they are trained adequately; and second, that this security will provide the environment that makes a political solution possible. 
   The quicker that Iraqis achieve security and a peaceful, stable democracy, the quicker our troops will come home. And as we listen to the speeches that will come following mine about the quest for our troops to come home, make no bones about it, I share the goal and the vision that is put forth by our friends, Mr. McGovern and Ms. Slaughter, and others, who will argue to bring our troops home. We all want to make sure that that happens. 
   Our new strategy, Mr. Speaker, has clearly brought us closer to that goal. And if our fight against extremism was not urgent enough, the Associated Press report that came out just late yesterday afternoon that al Qaeda's global network is again on the rise and has regained much of the strength that it had in September of 2001 is an important thing for us to recognize. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the terror network rebuilds and regroups, it seems absolutely preposterous that we would abandon not only a key front in the global war on terror, but a place where we have al Qaeda on the defensive and where we are diminishing their capabilities, especially in light of that report that came out just last night about their renewed strength. Yet, the Democratic leadership inexplicably wants to pull the rug out from under our military commanders. Well, Mr. Speaker, perhaps not so inexplicable if we consider that their planned withdrawal would be complete just in time for the 2008 elections. 
   But let's pretend that there is no election looming on the horizon here. Regardless of this bill's impact on American electoral politics, what would be the effects on Iraq? Now, Mr. Speaker, even the New York Times editorial board, which apparently doesn't often read its own news reports and is calling for an immediate withdrawal, acknowledges the inevitable dire consequences of its recommended course of action. In the very editorial calling for surrender, it outlines the overwhelming refugee and humanitarian crisis that would immediately ensue, how the fight would spill out all across the region. And Mr. Speaker, in the most callous way, it acknowledges the terror that would be inflicted upon  those Iraqis who worked with us because they believed our promises. How cold and cynical. How callous can we be to stand here and debate the notion of abandoning the Iraqi people, not only to genocide, but to the targeting of the very individuals who have bravely worked with us. 
   The Democratic leadership wants to wave a magic wand and make this war go away. I wouldn't mind a magic wand myself, and certainly the American people would appreciate a quick and tidy solution. But I'm afraid that this solution attempts to salvage nothing but party politics. The Iraqi people, Mr. Speaker, would not be quite so lucky. 
   Furthermore, NPR recently reported that the quick withdrawal time frame that the Democratic leadership dreamed up has no basis in reality. It would take a year or more to safely withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq, and it would take significant combat forces to protect the withdrawal. We would have to fight our way out all the way to the Kuwaiti border. There simply is no magic wand in this war, Mr. Speaker. 
   Perhaps the greatest irony of this bill is that it calls for detailed reports for a strategy in Iraq. Mr. Speaker, we have a strategy, and while it was only fully operational less than 1 month ago, it is already succeeding. The Democratic leadership, in their absurdist logic, want our military to abandon their strategy, go home and write a report about what they would have wanted to accomplish if they had stayed. And if that weren't cruel enough, Mr. Speaker, they would have to watch terror and genocide unfold as they retreated. Now, I cannot fathom a more disastrous policy for our security or the Iraqis'. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and the underlying bill itself. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I'm going to close the debate now, so I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me just begin by talking about procedure. We continue  to hear the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules talk regularly about an open amendment process, and I will say with absolute certainty, I had the privilege of chairing the Rules Committee for 8 years, and I will tell you that we have brought more rules to the floor of this House under a completely closed process during the first 7 months of this year than we did during any 7 months during the 8 years that I was privileged to serve as chairman of the Rules Committee. So much for a new and open process. 
   Now, let's look at what it is we're considering here, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, we know full well that this is a bill, unlike resolutions that may have been brought up under closed rules in the past, this is actually a bill, a bill that's scheduled to go to the President's desk. Everyone knows that this bill is not going to become law. 
   What we've found is gross politicization once again, a commitment made that every week we're going to have some kind of vote on Iraq. 
   We all know that the war in Iraq is very unpopular. We know that the President is a great punching bag on this for virtually everyone, but the fact of the matter is we are in the midst of a very important global war on terror, and as the President said in the past, you know, we all like to be loved, but I'd much rather be right than be loved. 
   The fact of the matter is, we want to bring this war to an end. The President stood right here in this chamber in January and said I wish that this war were over and that we had won, but we need to ensure victory. And, Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, we are not given the opportunity to consider any thoughtful, bipartisan alternative to this measure which calls for the withdrawal to begin within 120 days. I mean, how crazy is that when we're looking for a report to come in September and as we are looking at success that has begun even after only 1 month, 1 month of this plan having been put into place under the greatly heralded General David Petraeus? 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, as my friends from New Mexico and Michigan have said, I'm going to move to defeat the previous question. I'm going to move to defeat the previous question so that we can actually ensure that we have the tools to win this war on terror. We've had a number of anniversaries marked. We've spent a lot of time talking about them, but we fail to remember the success that we've had at preempting attacks on this country. 
   Just last month, we marked the first anniversary of the discovery of the proposed attack on the Sears Tower and the FBI headquarters in Miami. 
   Just last week, we marked the first anniversary of the proposed attack on the plan to blow up the Hudson River tunnel between New Jersey and Manhattan. 
   Just in May, we had a report of the plan, as you all know, to see some of these people go in and start killing our people at Fort Dix in New Jersey. 
   And then of course, just a few weeks ago, we had the plan to blow up JFK International Airport. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, we've been able to discover those, but we know full well from those in our intelligence operations and the Department of Homeland Security that we are, as Mr. Hoekstra said, blind and deaf, and I believe that we need to make sure we defeat the previous question so that we'll be in a position to amend this proposal so that we can ensure that we have the tools necessary to win this war on terror. 
   So vote ``no'' on the previous question. 
   Amendment to H. Res. 583 Offered by Mr. Drier of California 
   Strike all after the resolved clause and insert the following: 
   That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2956) to require the Secretary of Defense to commence the reduction of the number of United States Armed Forces in Iraq to a limited presence by April 1, 2008, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The bill shall be considered as read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) four hours of debate, with three hours equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services and one hour equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs; (2) the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in section 3 of this resolution, if offered by the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Hoekstra, or his designee, which shall be in order without intervention of any point of order except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI, shall be considered as read, and shall be separately debatable for two hours equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent; and (3) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. As I was just told by a distinguished member of the committee staff, we hope that the third time is a charm here. We have been pursuing this for quite a while, and I hope very much that we will be able to see final implementation of this. 
   I would like to recognize the leadership again on both sides of the aisle; the Committee on Natural Resources, of course, Mr. Bishop, who served with great distinction on the Committee on Rules. And I will say that we miss him upstairs in the Rules Committee. I especially miss the fact that we are no  longer in the majority up in the Rules Committee, but he is serving very ably now as an important member of the Natural Resources Committee and the Water and Power Subcommittee. And I want to thank, of course, on the majority side the distinguished chairman of the full committee, Mr. Rahall, my very good friend from California (Mrs. Napolitano) with whom I worked closely on this, and of course the ranking member on the subcommittee, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and of course the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Young. 
   I want to really underscore the great commitment and support that was provided in this effort by my California colleague, Mrs. Napolitano, who was an original cosponsor of this bill and has long been a great champion for many, many years of regional water solutions. I am also very pleased to have had the continued support and cosponsorship of other Southern California colleagues in a bipartisan way, Ken Calvert, Gary Miller, and of course I am pleased to see that we have just been joined on the floor here by my good friend, who represents the Inland Empire, Mr. Baca. And I should say, Mr. Speaker, that I just signed one of those cosponsor sheets and turned it in at the desk that will now include Mr. Baca's name as one of the cosponsors of this important legislation. 
   As many of you will recall, this bill was passed, as I said, by the last Congress; but it was held up in the other body over issues that were much larger regarding overall reform of the Bureau of Reclamation's title 16 program. And I do share the concern that the program, while hugely popular, successful and competitive, is oversubscribed and underfunded. That being said, Mr. Speaker, the need to reform the program shouldn't hold back good projects like this one. 
   The Inland Empire Water Recycling Initiative authorizes $30 million for the Inland Empire Utilities Agency and the Cucamonga Valley Water District to assist in constructing two water recycling projects. The projects will produce nearly 100,000 acre-feet of new water annually to the area's water supply. This initiative has the support of all member agencies of the Inland Empire Utilities Agency, which encompasses 240 square miles in Southern California. It also serves a number of cities that I am very honored to be able to represent, the cities of Rancho Cucamonga, Upland and Montclair, some of the fastest growing cities in our Nation. 
   These water agencies are using high-quality recycled water in many water intensive applications like landscape and agricultural irrigation, construction and industrial cooling. This allows fresh water to be conserved or used for drinking, which reduces our dependence on expensive imported water. In addition, by recycling water which would otherwise be wasted and unavailable, these agencies ensure that we wring the last drop of use out of water before it is ultimately returned to the environment. 
   It is imperative that we continue to approve measures preventing water supply shortages in the western United States. And, Mr. Speaker, this recycling initiative will help meet the water needs of the Inland Empire and begin a strategic Federal-local partnership to bring a significant amount of new water supply to this very important region in Southern California. This project has already been recognized nationally as one of the most cost-effective water reuse projects that we have. 
   The Inland Empire Utility Agency and the Cucamonga Valley Water District are innovative leaders in using high-quality recycled water in environmentally sensitive and creative ways. This allows fresh water to be conserved for drinking, reducing our dependence on expensive imported water. 
   The hard work of these two local water agencies should be recognized. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to specifically recognize the tireless efforts of Rich Atwater, the CEO of the Inland Empire Utilities Agency, and Robert DeLoach, the CEO of the Cucamonga Valley Water District. 
   I would also like to commend the boards of these agencies for their leadership in providing our region with safe, clean, and affordable water. And I will say, Mr. Speaker, that at a time when we are focusing constantly on the need to look at ways to recycle and focusing on the issue of environmentally sound planning for our future, meeting our needs, this measure is, again, a model that can be used for the rest of the country. 
   At this juncture, I would be happy to yield to my very good friend, with whom I am privileged to share representing part of the Inland Empire, Mr. Baca.

   Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, in closing that I think that this legislation underscores once again how the California congressional delegation continues, as it has in the past, to work in a bipartisan way addressing priority concerns that we have, whether it be transportation, dealing with the whole issue of base closure, dealing with the challenge of illegal immigration, dealing with this very important water resources issue, health care issues. California's delegation is working together in a bipartisan way to address them, and this legislation today is evidence of our great success at implementing the shared vision that we have for the constituents whom we are honored to represent in California. And I again thank both Democrats and Republicans on the Natural Resources Committee for their strong support of this important legislation. 
   And, again, as Mr. Baca said, I hope very much that the committee and others will utilize this very successful program as a model for future water recycling.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, it pains me greatly to stand here in the well and report to our colleagues that the Rules Committee late yesterday afternoon reported out what can only be described as the Hugo Chavez rule. 
   For the first time in the 34-year history of trade promotion authority, we have now decided that we are going to take the action of turning our backs on an agreement that we have made with our closest, most important and strongest ally on the continent of South America. 
   The Vice President of Colombia has described this action as a slap in the face. Hugo Chavez and the narcoterrorists in Colombia are celebrating this action. It is an absolute outrage that we would do this. 
   I have to say that this administration 4 years ago embarked on these negotiations, 2 years ago completed the negotiations, a year and a half ago signed the negotiations. Since August of last year, 265 meetings have been held with Democratic Members by members of the administration, cabinet officials and all, and 27 meetings have been held with the Democratic leadership. 
   It is time for us to complete this work. It's time for us to strengthen this very important alliance. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``no'' on the Hugo Chavez rule.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time to simply say that this has been a very interesting debate. Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side have put forward some, well, let's say some inaccuracies. The fact of the matter is that over the last 4 years, when this process began, the administration has been working very closely with hundreds and hundreds of meetings in a bipartisan way to come together so that we can do what both Democrats and Republicans alike have said that they want to do, strengthen our ties within this hemisphere and do what we can to ensure that we bring about an agreement which will work to create jobs right here in the United States. 
   The distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee has just reminded me of the fact that every country with which we have a free trade agreement, every single country, we enjoy a surplus of trade, a trade surplus. So the notion that pursuing these FTAs somehow costs us jobs is preposterous, and the facts don't hold it up. 
   One of our friends on the other side of the aisle, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), talked about the fact that we were the manufacturing giant in 1974, 34 years ago, when fast track authority was put into place. And I will tell him that today we are still the world's manufacturing giant. In 1974, we had a $1.5 trillion economy; today, we have a $14.1 trillion economy. 
   So as was said by the Republican leader, Mr. Boehner, this is a no-brainer, as Mr. McCrery said, this is a no-brainer economically. We need to recognize that if we as a Nation are going to maintain our leadership role, we have to shape it. 
   Vote ``no'' on this horrible Hugo Chavez rule, Mr. Speaker. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES FACING AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Madam Speaker, last week the House went on recess to spend time in our districts commemorating our independence as a Nation. These celebrations every 4th of July are always a time to remember and honor the history of this great country. We think of the great moments when the United States of America shone as an unparalleled leader in liberty and achievement; the brave men who stormed the beaches of Normandy, followed by the Marshall Plan and the Berlin airlift; the Wright Brothers becoming first in flight; or, of course, Neil Armstrong taking that giant leap for mankind. 
   Perhaps above all, though, Madam Speaker, America's great moments have been expressions of great ideas. Our Nation was born out of the ideals of the Declaration of Independence. It established an enduring national philosophy based on the truth that we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights. 
   Since that beginning, bold ideas have defined our Nation; the idea that government must be of the people, by the people, and for the people; the idea that checks and balances must be built into the very structure of government to ensure its responsiveness to the American people; the idea that every man, woman and child has the right to freely practice their faith; the idea that all ideas should be allowed to be freely expressed. This is our history and our heritage. 
   But Independence Day is not just a time to reflect on our past. It is also an opportunity to consider where we are headed. I believe that today, we as Americans are currently grappling with very fundamental philosophical questions, and answers to these questions will present complex challenges in their implementation. 
   A central question is how to apply our core principles to the new challenges that we face. How do we secure ourselves against new threats without diminishing the civil liberties that we hold dear. How do we wage a war against Islamic extremism without appearing to treat those of the Muslim faith with the very intolerance that fuels extremism. How do we end the scourge of illegal immigration, while continuing to be that shining city on the hill to the many legal immigrants who have always helped to make this country the great Nation that it is.     
   How do we engage in the worldwide marketplace while ensuring that Americans can successfully compete in a very dynamic economic environment? 
   Madam Speaker, there are those who say that America is bitterly divided today over these questions. It is certainly true that there is great diversity of opinion in how to address the security and economic challenges that we face. But if we are willing to engage each other in honest and open debate, this diversity of opinion is our great strength, not our weakness. 
   We as a Nation are facing substantial new challenges that demand a great clash of ideas, just as our Founders intended. Unfortunately, the recitation of inflammatory talking points has supplanted sincere and honest debate. The shrill voices of talking heads are no substitute for true engagement. 
   I believe Americans have grown weary of politics as usual, of the endless fighting that takes place here in Washington. But not because of the existence of opposing views. Americans have grown weary of the obstinacy, the hardened positions and intolerance of differing opinions, the refusal to truly engage in an open and substantive way. 
   Madam Speaker, in a country of over 300 million people, there will never be uniformity of opinion, but there can and should be a deep respect for that clash of ideas and an interest in reaching broad consensus on the great issues of our day. This is the essence of the United States of America, and it is the essence of why we last Friday celebrated our Nation's independence, the freedom of ideas, all ideas, to be debated, debunked, or developed in this messy process of democracy. 
   Madam Speaker, I truly believe that our country will rise to the challenges we face today, just as we have always done. And we will accomplish this through open, sometimes heated and passionate, but always respectful debate. The celebration of our independence is always at least a temporary unifier of America. But this year, we cannot afford to confine this unity to one day, the Fourth of July. I believe we should use this time to renew our belief in a country that is bound together, not driven apart, by the clash of ideas out of which our great country was born.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   I have to say that it is very sad that we are here at this point, having gone through the past several Congresses with the then-minority maligning us for not having completed our work. In the last Congress, I am happy we were able to actually pass out of the House 11 appropriations bills. In this Congress, one appropriations bill, this session of Congress has passed out of the House. It is unfortunate having been maligned so viciously for such a long period of time that here we are using a structure which is one that was used only once in the 109th Congress, and it is a structure that denies any Member an opportunity to provide even the slightest opportunity for an amendment. No motion to recommit, no substitute, no amendment at all. 
   This is actually concurring in a Senate amendment with an amendment which is a procedure that has now been used 15 times in this Congress to completely subvert the rights of the minority to do anything, to have, as I say, one bite at the apple. It saddens me that we are doing that again. 
   And I think back to the promises that were made 2 years ago right now when we were in the midst of the 2006 campaign. We were promised that if we in fact allowed Nancy Pelosi to become Speaker of the House of Representatives, it would be a whole new day and the kind of horrible action that we had seen in the past would be history. 
   What we were told, Mr. Speaker, is we would not see closed rules. This happens to be the 63rd closed rule that we have had in this Congress, the largest number of closed rules, again preventing any Member from having any opportunity to offer any amendment at all. Not one single amendment allowed, and this is the 63rd closed rule. Mr. Speaker, never before in the 230-year history of the Republic have we had the number of closed rules that we have had in the 110th Congress. 
   And then you look at the promises for things like not meeting after 10 p.m. in the Rules Committee. Last night we met right up until midnight. You look at all of these promises that were made, and it is sad that the only statement that I regularly hear from my good friends on the other side of the aisle is how horrible we were. 
   I was privileged to serve as chairman of the Rules Committee, and we continue to hear, well, you did this and how horrible it was when you were chairman of the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, they never once talk about the promises that were made to be different. I never, never thought that they would be as bad as they have been when it comes to this process of deliberation. Frankly, where we are right now with this rule for consideration of this measure is exactly that, denying any opportunity whatsoever. And again, it is the 15th time in this Congress where we have concurred in a Senate amendment with an amendment which again shuts out--and, by the way, we never, we never contemplated doing this, Mr. Speaker, in the consideration of an appropriations bill. Appropriations bills, as we all know, are regularly considered under by and large a completely open process.  
   Having said that, I will say, and we had our exchange with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee last night, there are some things in this bill that I am very, very happy about. My distinguished colleague from North Carolina, VIRGINIA FOXX, along with our colleagues MIKE PENCE, TOM PRICE and others, and I was privileged to be here on one occasion, they were here virtually every single day during the month of August. Why? Well, to refresh the memories of our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, and yours as well, at the very end of the month of July just as Congress was getting ready to leave for the month of August, we were arguing that we should in fact have a debate and a vote on considering a wide range of proposals that the American people had said that we should at least have a vote on that would allow us to see the price of gasoline come down, that would allow us to see the cost of the price of natural gas come down, and allow us to vigorously pursue important alternative energy sources--wind, solar, biodiesel, green crude, nuclear. We said in late July that we should have a debate and we should not leave the Congress, we should not leave Washington until we completed that. 
   And so on the last day, by a one-vote margin, the minority was denied an opportunity to be able to even speak, to even address this issue. So we all know what happened right after. Even when the gavel came down and by a one-vote margin the majority chose to cut off specials orders that would have simply been an opportunity to talk about the need for looking at alternative energy sources and allowing for exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf and ANWR and other areas, what happened, well, Members on our side of the aisle took to the well, when the lights were dim and there were only tourists who were here in the Chamber. Mr. Speaker, that went on during the entire month of August. During the entire month of August. 
   And the American people were able to come in, fill this Chamber, even though the lights were out and the microphones weren't working, and Members on our side, led by VIRGINIA FOXX and the others whom I have mentioned, they talked about the need for us to have an all-of-the-above solution to the problem of high gasoline prices and overall high energy prices. 
   We are still dealing with that serious problem. I see my fellow Angeleno, JANE HARMAN, here. In Southern California, we pay very high prices for gasoline and people drive great distances. I know that her constituents, just as mine are, are very, very concerned about high gasoline prices. They still want to see the cost of gasoline go down and do what we can to get gasoline costs down and deal with transportation and a wide range of other issues.     
   I was really struck when, over that August break, Santa Barbara's County Board of Supervisors--Santa Barbara, California, and to refresh your memory, Mr. Speaker, 39 years ago, one of the most horrendous oil spills took place off the coast of Santa Barbara. Seals, birds, it killed, all kinds of devastation, because of this horrible oil spill that took place 39 years ago. 
   And yet, Mr. Speaker, what has happened is the members of the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors have recognized that the technology that exists in 2008 is dramatically advanced from that that existed 39 years ago when we saw that horrible oil spill. They know that today we have safety valves and lots of other advances that have been made that will work to ensure that we would not see that kind of accident. 
   And so what has happened, even in Santa Barbara County, California, the County Board of Supervisors voted to allow exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf. They said that they don't have the power to do it, but they voted in favor of doing that. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, I've got to say that one of the good things in this measure is that we are going to, with its passage, see the expiration of that moratorium that was put into place following the Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969. It's existed for a long period of time, but the American people recognize that we can, in an environmentally sound way, in a safe way, engage in this kind of responsible exploration. 
   I also want to say that as we look at this overall energy issue, there are many other things that need to be addressed that are not being addressed. Yes, we are taking some of these things in a piecemeal way. Why? Because both Democrats and Republicans alike have heard from their constituents about the need to deal with high energy costs and so some of these things are being addressed. 
   But we have been arguing, Mr. Boehner and others, that we need to have this all-of-the-above solution. And so I want to say again to my colleague, Virginia Foxx, and to the others who virtually every single day during the month of August, came here, stood in a dark Chamber without the benefit of a microphone talking to a place filled with tourists who were here and getting a very, very positive response, thank them for continuing to keep this issue in behalf of the American people on the forefront, in the forefront in this debate. 
   I will say that again there are other items in this measure that are important. But one thing that I find particularly troubling is the date at which time this continuing resolution will expire. I happen to believe that, as we look at the economic challenges that we are facing, and we all know that we've had meetings with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and a wide range of other people who are involved in trying to responsibly deal with a rescue package that we are going to have to face, I have grave concerns about what I've seen, but it is an issue which we need to address. Creating American jobs and getting the economy growing is the single most important thing that we can do to deal with the fiscal crisis that we face right now. Economic growth is the key. And that's why I'm troubled with this March 6, 2009, expiration date, Mr. Speaker. 
   Why? Because by virtue of our taking this action, we, I believe, will, for all intents and purposes, not have a chance to vote on a very, very important agreement, a trade agreement that is designed to pry open new markets, to create jobs right here in the United States of America. And I'm talking, first and foremost, about the very important Colombia Free Trade Agreement. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, we all know that the State of Ohio is a State that has suffered from the economic slowdown. There are great products that are made in Ohio, in Illinois and other States that have been suffering. Caterpillar tractors, Whirlpool washing machines and refrigerators and all. Those things could be sold in great numbers to the 40 million consumers in Colombia, tariff-free, if we were to actually pass the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Unfortunately, extending this continuing resolution to March of next year, I believe, will play a big role in diminishing the prospect for a so-called lame duck session that would allow us to do that. 
   This is a slap, not only at Colombia, our strongest ally on the South American continent, but at all of Latin America, and, Mr. Speaker, it is a slap at any country in the world that might be contemplating embarking on negotiations with the United States of America in its attempt to deal with this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for her very thoughtful contribution, and let me just respond to a couple of points. 
   First and foremost, I place human life first, at the top. And so I think it's  absolutely essential, I would say to my friend from Ohio, that she know that that is priority number 1. Human rights are priority number 1. And the fact is, we have seen Colombia, as a nation, in a 5-year period of time, go through a more positive transformation than any nation in modern history. And the fact that the Colombian Government, under President Uribe, has stood up and fought very, very vigorously in behalf of bringing to justice those who have been responsible for any killings. The demobilization, taking people who have been part of the FARC and the paramilitaries and bringing them into society, Democrats and Republicans alike have seen that time and time again as I have in two recent trips that I have taken to Colombia. 
   I want to say, Mr. Speaker, the reason I mentioned the State of Ohio is that I want to do everything that I possibly can to create more good jobs for the constituents of Ms. Kaptur and other Ohioans throughout the State. Whirlpool is a very important Ohio company, and this agreement will allow workers for Whirlpool to create products that can be sold into Colombia. 
   And so all I'm arguing, Mr. Speaker, is that by virtue of having this date, it is a slap at the American worker and it is undermining our chance to get this economy growing again by prying open these new markets so that we can export our goods and services into the country. 
   Mr. Speaker, again, there are good things in this measure, but I am strongly opposed to this rule, the structure around which we are considering it.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend, and say that all we're asking for is a vote on this issue. I understand that the gentleman has a different view on this question, Mr. Speaker. It's very clear that he does. 
   I happen to believe that humans rights are very, very important, and we should recognize that enhancing the economies of both the United States and Colombia will help in that effort. 
   All we're saying is that we've been denied a vote, something that has never happened since the 1974 Trade Act was put into place under this structure, and by virtue of having this March 6, 2009, date, we're denying even a chance for a vote because I suspect we won't have a lame duck session.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by saying that I suspect that after many decades of stellar public service, this will be one of the last times that we see our good friend from Buffalo (Mr. Reynolds) who served ably as a member of the Rules Committee for many years and now as a member of the Ways and Means Committee actually manage a measure on the floor. I would like to thank him for his wonderful public service and to say that we are very pleased to be here with this very important measure. 
   I don't want to be the skunk at a picnic, but I have to point to a couple of very, very important issues. I listened to my good friend from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) talk about the fact that Mr. Neal has moved forward with a measure that is paid for. The fact of the matter is we are waiving PAYGO on this provision which will allow us to deal with this patch for the AMT relief. 
   We all know back in 1969, 155 millionaires were the target of the alternative minimum tax, as was pointed out by my friend from Houston (Mr. Brady). The fact is, the indexation has created a situation whereby millions and millions and millions of Americans are now saddled with this responsibility. 
   Madam Speaker, what we heard time and time again was that in this new Congress, we were going to have everything paid for. I find it interestingly ironic that here, as we deal with the alternative minimum tax, this measure, we have suspended the rules and waived PAYGO on this. Yet we did not choose to do that when we dealt with the very important issue that the American people wanted us to try to address, and that is to bring gasoline prices down with a responsible energy bill. 
   We chose to waive it for the farm bill. Unfortunately, again, on the gas issue, we didn't waive it there, and we are waiving it again here. 
   I would also like to point to the fact that my good friend from New Jersey talked about the fact that his State, I guess, has the third highest number of people impacted by the alternative minimum tax. The issue of repealing the alternative minimum tax is a high priority for many of us. I believe that it should be completely eliminated.

   Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend. 
   Let me say that I believe it's important for us to remember that a very short 8 years ago, in 1999, the House and the Senate passed a repeal of the alternative minimum tax. Unfortunately, President Clinton at that time chose to veto that measure. 
   We can get into the issue of paid for or not paid for, but it's interesting that the measure we are considering today is basically under the same structure that we in 1999 passed the repeal of the alternative minimum tax out under and President Clinton chose to veto it at that point.

But if we had, in fact, in 1999, when President Clinton chose to veto that bill 8 years ago, if we had had that passed, we wouldn't be here dealing with this issue as we are today. I just wanted to make that clear for the record. 
   Thanks again, and congratulations to my friend from Buffalo.

<DOCNO>Mr. DREIER. (COMMITTEE FUNDING RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my great appreciation to my very distinguished friend from Rochester, New York, the Chair of the Committee on Rules, Ms. Slaughter, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in strongest opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation, House Resolution 202, which provides for the expenses of certain committees of the House of Representatives in the 110th Congress. While I consider the funding of the committees of the House a very, very important priority, I, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, oppose this rule since the resolution goes far beyond, far beyond the very important task in one respect, and, unfortunately, it falls extraordinarily short in another task. 
   Mr. Speaker, on March 1, the Committee on House Administration ordered reported House Resolution 202, a clean committee funding resolution. If passed by the full House, the resolution will provide approximately a 2.6 percent across-the-board increase in House committee budgets between the last session of the 109th Congress and the first session of the 110th Congress. While most committees can make do with that very modest increase, we have one committee that absolutely cannot. It is called the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. 
   Mr. Speaker, on the opening day of the 110th Congress, Ms. Slaughter and I both stood here as we debated and then ended up supporting a very important part of the opening day rules package. On that day, we asked the Ethics Committee to take on substantial new responsibilities. 
   They are now responsible, Mr. Speaker, the Ethics Committee, based on what the passage of the opening days rules package imposed on them, they are now required to pre-approve all trips. They are required to issue guidance on rules that they were not involved in drafting at all. As I said, we imposed that on them. They are required to provide training for every employee of the House on the new ethics rules that we have just put into place and forced them to implement. And they are still in a position where they have to now provide timely advice to every single Member who makes a request for the application of this rule. 
   On top of that, Mr. Speaker, they have the responsibility of investigating allegations of wrongdoing whenever they do occur.     
   Now already, I understand, the Committee on Ethics, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, is falling behind. Appropriation season is well under way, and we have absolutely no guidance whatsoever about the new ethics standards for earmarks. We have new travel and gift rules, but those regulations created as many questions as they answered; and the Ethics Committee is already months behind in its correspondence with Members. 
   We are going to hear from a number of our colleagues who have been dealing with this very difficult situation. The chairman and the ranking member, the chairman and the ranking member of the Committee on Ethics appeared before the Committee on House Administration. In fact, Ms. Slaughter and I were both there because our testimony followed them. Mr. Hastings and Mrs. Tubbs Jones, Republican and Democrat in a bipartisan way, they came to plead their case to provide an increase beyond that 2.6 percent so they can deal with this massive new mandate imposed upon them. It was a large request, but the members of the Ethics Committee need it because they want to do their job and they need the resources to do it. 
   What the House Administration Committee did, and we were there during that testimony, they expressed great sympathy with their plight. And at the end, they felt they could do a little more. That decision leaves every single Member of this House in jeopardy, and it is one that we cannot let stand. 
   That is why, as I said, Mr. Hastings, the former chairman of the Ethics Committee and Mrs. Tubbs Jones, the new chairman of the Ethics Committee, took the very unusual step of just yesterday appealing to us up in the Rules Committee to correct this problem. 
   Now my Rules Committee colleague, Mr. Hastings, has the dual responsibility of serving not only as the distinguished ranking member of the Ethics Committee, but also he serves on the Rules Committee, and he sat before us and asked that we simply allow the House to debate this issue. He didn't argue that we have to do it. I happen to believe we do have to do it, but he simply was making the request that the Rules Committee make in order a chance for this House to discuss this very important ethics issue, one with which we are all very familiar. He was joined in this request by the distinguished Chair of the committee. She wasn't there, but I know she has supported his request for us to have an opportunity to debate this issue, and I know she strongly supports the effort, as she did in her testimony before the Administration Committee asking for the additional resources so the Ethics Committee, Mr. Speaker, can in fact do their job. 
   This is particularly important given the other aspect of this rule. This rule self-executes an amendment establishing the new Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, about which the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee was just speaking. 
   Without impugning the necessity or desire to establish that select committee, my colleagues got to hear me explain at the Rules Committee yesterday exactly why this process was so outrageous and why this is the wrong way to go about establishing a select committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, never mind that the minority was never given the language creating this select committee until we literally walked into the room yesterday at 2 p.m., and never mind the fact the Democratic majority is denying us a motion to recommit with instructions which would have been made in order if the privileged resolution came to the floor, never mind that the Rules Committee never held a hearing or produced an original jurisdiction committee report on the establishment of this select committee, something I believe is totally unprecedented. 
   With all of the committees established in the history of this institution, I am convinced that never before has this process been used, and never mind that the House is completely side-stepping regular order by self-executing this amendment. 
   Mr. Speaker, never mind all of those horrible procedural outrages that have been imposed. I am not going to talk about those. The most troubling part of this whole episode is that this self-executing amendment grants the new select committee some $3.7 million over the course of this Congress. So if we can find an additional $3.7 million to fund this new select committee that will have no legislative power whatsoever, I don't understand why we can't fund a mere $1 million to fully fund the bipartisan request that was made before the Rules Committee to provide the necessary funding for our very hardworking colleagues, Mr. Hastings, Mrs. Tubbs Jones and their colleagues on the Ethics Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the end of this debate on this rule, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so I may amend the rule to make in order the bipartisan Tubbs Jones-Hastings amendment so that the 430 Members that supported the new ethics rules may live up to the commitment that they made right here on opening day.  
   Mr. Speaker, if you think we needed new ethics standards, if you believe that the Ethics Committee should do its job, then you have a moral obligation to defeat the previous question and allow the House to work its will by at least considering the chance to make sure that Mrs. Tubbs Jones, the distinguished Chair of the Ethics Committee, and Mr. Hastings, the ranking member, have the resources they need to do what we, 430 Members, told them they had to do. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, obviously there has been a great deal of thought and talk, and it has been understandable about the issue of ethics and lobbying reform. Last year, Speaker Hastert and I initiated a package that we passed through the House but, unfortunately, we were not able to come to an agreement in the Senate. On the opening day, 430 Members voted to put into place unprecedented ethics reform, unprecedented ethics reform. 
   Why? Because the American people know we should be held to the highest possible standards. Now, there is an expression that I think is a very important one, and that is ``put your money where your mouth is.'' Now the very distinguished Chair of the committee on ethics, my good friend Mrs. Jones, talked about the fact that she wants to address this as concerns come forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is the committee funding measure that we are bringing to the floor. We are doing some other things to it, self-executing establishment of a committee, but we are providing for that committee that will have no legislative authority whatsoever, $3.7 million. All we are asking, Mr. Speaker, is that we have a chance, a chance to debate the issue of funding for the Ethics Committee here on the floor. 
   That is why I am going to urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question. Why? Because while this new committee that will have no legislative authority whatsoever will receive $3.7 million, we are simply asking for what is being denied, and that is a chance for $1 million to be provided so that our Members will not be facing the weekend situation that Mr. Lungren just described where he sent a letter to the Ethics Committee, asked for a response about going on a trip, and he didn't receive approval until a week after the trip was to take place. 
   Mrs. Jones and Mr. Hastings came before the House Administration Committee and made this request for additional funding; and Mr. Hastings, representing Mrs. Jones before the Rules Committee, asked that this amendment be made in order. 
   Mr. Speaker, any Member who votes for the previous question is denying this institution the opportunity to consider implementing the resources that are necessary to hold us to the highest possible ethical standards. Vote ``no'' on the previous question. 
   Amendment to H. Res. 219 Offered by Rep. Dreier of California 
   At the end of the resolution, add the following: 
   Sec. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, after conclusion of the time for debate on the resolution it shall be in order without intervention of any point of order to consider the amendment in section 3, if offered by Mr. Hastings of Washington or his designee. The amendment shall be considered as read, shall be separately debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be subject to amendment or demand for division of the question.
