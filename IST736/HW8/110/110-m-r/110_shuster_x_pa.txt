<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, today Congress can finally do something positive when it comes to energy, the energy situation in this country, and that is to pass this landmark legislation, The Passenger Rail Investment Improvement Act of 2008. 
   With gas prices today at $4 a gallon, we, on both sides of the aisle, can join together and move to improve passenger rail in this country. And it is, as I said, something that will be a positive for the energy situation. 
   When you look at the airlines, they consume 20 percent more energy per passenger mile than Amtrak does to move a passenger. Passenger cars consume over 27 percent more energy per passenger mile than Amtrak. Amtrak is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people in our country today. So this is going to help with the energy situation. It's a positive step in the right direction. We still need to do much more but this is a positive step. 
   The other situation that we're facing in this country is a growing population. It took, we just recently crossed over the 300 million threshold in population in our country. It took us 65 years to go from 200 million to 300 million. It'll take us just 35 years to go from 300 million to 400 million. 
   And if you look around the country, and what I have is a chart that shows these corridors throughout the country. This is where the population density is going to get even thicker and more dense throughout this country. And this is where we're talking about down the road expanding high-speed rail across the country to help move passengers, to get people out of their  cars, to move them efficiently, to get them into our major urban areas and get them out again and get them between major urban areas. 
   So, as I said, as the population grows, Amtrak can be there with intercity travel helping us to move people. And people are desperate to get out of their cars, I believe, especially when you're traveling to and from. I know in Pennsylvania we've had a fantastic partnership between the State and Amtrak to establish the Keystone line. It travels over 100 miles an hour, and gets you from Harrisburg, the State Capitol to downtown Philadelphia in about an hour and 35 minutes, an hour and 40 minutes; no messing with traffic, no congestion. 
   Once again, the American people, I think, will get out of their cars and get on this intercity travel if we establish a system that works, a system that moves people fast and conveniently. 
   Three provisions in this legislation that I'm very pleased to see we've put in here. First, a private partnership with Amtrak, the Department of Transportation, identifying two of the worst performing lines in the country and putting them out for bid, allowing the private sector to come in and take those lines over and have a hand at trying to make them more efficient, trying their hand at finding ways to improve rail traffic, to decrease costs. So I'm very pleased that that's in here. 
   Second, a private partnership that we're looking at is, as my colleague from Florida stated, to re-establish a line that has been abandoned by Amtrak, that's no longer in service, to have the private sector come in and around the country see where one of those lines are and to re-establish that. 
   And third, as the gentleman from Florida talked about the Northeast Corridor, putting a request for a proposal in to have private industry come in in a partnership to look at how much it's going to cost us to take the Northeast Corridor and truly make it a high-speed rail corridor from New York City to Washington, D.C., traveling in 2 hours or less, which is something that, once again, I believe that the American people will embrace. 
   So for my colleagues that we've debated on this floor, I've watched debates for the last 20 years on this floor. There's always been an argument; can the private sector do it better. No, the government has to do it. Well here we're going to have some tests. We're going to have I believe some positive results in a public/private partnership that we'll be able to look to be able to expand passenger rail in this country. So I'm very pleased with that. 
   One thing I do want to point out in this that I've heard a lot of talk, that this legislation does not change Davis-Bacon law. There are people running around town here saying that this does change Davis-Bacon law. It does not change Davis-Bacon law. So for any of my colleagues that wish to have a discussion with me on that, I'm happy to do that. But I want to make sure that that's been pointed out here. 
   And finally, I want to say thank you to the chairman for his goodwill and his allowing me to put some of my ideas in this legislation. Also Chairwoman Brown and our partnership on the subcommittee. I appreciate her leadership. I thank you both very much. 
   And also to Mr. Mica for giving me the opportunity to be the ranking member and also including me deeply in all the discussions as we were able to craft this legislation. 
   So I would encourage all my colleagues to support this today. This is something positive we can do for America, a positive step we can take to help with our energy situation. And I think it's just a win/win for everybody in America today as we move forward to establish some high-speed rail corridors around this country.     
   I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I appreciate the gentlewoman from Ohio bringing this issue to the forefront. We had discussed this in committee while putting this legislation together, but it is not addressed in the underlying legislation, and I certainly believe it's an important issue that needs to be resolved; and I will be pleased to work with you and other members of the committee to try to address this situation.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of this amendment. And I am not going to run down through. The chairman did a good job of going over all the provisions in this manager's amendment. But we have reached a bipartisan agreement between Mr. Oberstar and Ms. Brown, Mr. Mica and myself, so we support the amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to close by talking directly to my colleagues who have over the years been on the floor arguing against Amtrak, arguing to cut Amtrak. I think that this agreement we have here today, there are two important reasons to support this. 
   First, because of the energy situation in our country. Amtrak does provide a positive alternative to get people out of their cars and to travel, inter-city travel around this country. So that is the first point. 
   Energy, it is a positive thing we can do for America for energy, and we haven't done anything positive in the last 18 months. Here is something positive we can do on that front. 
   Second, my colleagues who argue against Amtrak talk about the private sector and how they can do things. Well, this bill has three provisions in it that allow for pilot projects for the private sector to come in to take over underperforming lines, to reestablish lines that are no longer in operation by Amtrak and reestablish them, and to demonstrate what the private sector can do in passenger rail service. 
   After these lines are taken over, we will have concrete evidence as to what the private sector can do. I feel confident they will be able to perform very well and we will no longer be on the floor theoretically debating. We will say, look what the private sector has done on this line. Look what they have done on the other line. We will have that evidence and have real world facts before us, and that is a positive thing. 
   So those are two things that my colleagues that have been down here opposing Amtrak today can come to the floor for. I urge them to support the manager's amendment and I urge them to support the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I just wanted to say that the situation highlighting the situation is certainly important, and I understand why the gentleman is highlighting it. 
   It would have been covered, it is covered in the underlying bill I believe. But as I said, I understand why the gentleman wants to highlight the situation. And this report to determine the cost of uncompleted infrastructure maintenance is extremely important, and we need to tend to that. This Northeast Corridor is extremely important and, as I said, I do not oppose the amendment, and would accept it. 
   I yield back my time.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, our enemies are listening, and they are planning on our actions today, just like the North Vietnamese did decades ago. And don't believe me, but listen to the words of Colonel Bui Tin, who served on the general's staff of the North Vietnamese Army and received the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975. 
   In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in 1995, he drew some important parallels to the debate today. When asked how the North Vietnamese intended to defeat America, Colonel Tin responded, ``by fighting a long war which would break their will to help South Vietnam.'' He went on to quote Ho Chi Minh, who said, ``We don't need to win military victories, we only need to hit them until they give up and get out.'' Colonel Tin said the American antiwar movement was essential to their strategy. He said it represented the conscience of America and the conscience of America was part of its war-making capability, and we were turning that power in our favor. 
   Through protests, America lost its ability to mobilize a will to win. That is what this supplemental does here today. Let's listen to the past and not repeat its mistakes. Let's pass a clean bill and give our soldiers what they need to win.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, for the past 2 months, myself and others have been coming to the floor to talk about the impending tax increase that we face in this country if the majority doesn't act in something just under 1,400 days, and we will see this huge tax increase and all the majority has to do is run out the clock. They have to do nothing to see this tax increase be put back in place when the tax cuts that we passed in early 2001, 2002, 2003 will expire. 
   But tonight we are coming to the floor, and we think it is fitting to talk about the fourth anniversary of Iraq and what is happening in Iraq and, most importantly, what is going to happen on this House floor we think this week but maybe not until next week. 
   It was fitting tonight that we had a moment of silence for our men and women in harm's way. It was very fitting. But it is also fitting that the United States Congress is very clear to the men and women in harm's way that we support them. And we don't just support them in standing up on the House floor talking about it, but we support them in a concrete way, and that is making sure that they are getting the funds that they need, making sure that the United States Congress is sending a message to our enemies around the world that we are behind them; that we are not going to shortchange them; that we are not going to pull the rug out from under them; that we are not going to put a time line in place that is going to allow our enemies to know when and what we are going to do, we let our enemies know that they just have to run out the clock. 
   And if they run out the clock, that we are going to be gone and they are going to be able to be back in Iraq, they are going to be back in other places around this world doing harm to many people, including Americans. So it is absolutely important that our men and women know, and this supplemental is going to be the key. It is going to be the key for our men and women to know that we are behind them. And what the majority party is putting forth, at least we think what the majority party is putting forward, has created a confusing and inflexible timetable for the Americans' withdrawal from Iraq. 
   From what they have said, and we only know in press accounts and I will read many of those press accounts, and I would encourage you to go to www.gop.gov and see last week's press conference with the leadership of the majority party, the Democratic leadership talk about their plan, and just watch it for about a minute and you will see just how confusing it was to not only the American people but to the leadership of the majority party. 
   As I said, they have put in place timetables for withdrawal, with forces leaving as early as July 1 and concluding their removal no later than August 2008. Now, we can talk and talk and talk, but our enemies see that, and they will just go back into the shadows and they will just wait until we are gone to be able to wreak havoc on Iraq and the Iraqi people. 
   An example of what is in the supplemental, at least that is what we have heard, we are not sure but this is what we have heard: that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available in this or any other act may be used to deploy any unit of the Armed Forces to Iraq unless the chief of the military department concerned has certified in writing to the Committees on Appropriations and on Armed Services at least 15 days in advance of deployment that this unit is fully mission capable. 
   Now, if that is not micromanagement, I don't know what is. I think the lessons of Vietnam have been lost on the majority party. That is micromanaging the war. That is what caused us great detriment in Vietnam. 
   The next thing is: the President certifies in writing to the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Armed Services that the deployment to Iraq of a unit that is not assessed fully mission capable, he is required to fill a report detailing the particular reason or reasons why that unit's deployment is necessary. If that is not micromanagement, I don't know what is.  
   We have one Commander in Chief, clearly stated in the Constitution, not 535 commanders looking to micromanage a war. This requirement ties the hands of the President in committing more troops to fighting required by red tape and lengthy explanations, cost of time, and the risk of lives. That is micromanaging the war. I think it is very, very clear. And, again, I would urge anybody that is interested to go to the Web site and see the Democratic House leadership's press conference last week, and you will see just how clearly they are confused. 
   So how can the American people not be confused? How can our men and women in harm's way not be confused about what this Congress, what this House is about to do? 
   Just a couple of press accounts talking about the supplemental. The Washington Post, The Washington Post described the Democrat plan as: an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard to the war itself. Micromanagement. The Los Angeles Times. The Los Angeles Times called for the bill to be vetoed. Imagine that. And I quote the Los Angeles Times saying this, not me: It is absurd for the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat, San Francisco, to try to micromanage the conflict and the evolution of Iraqi society with arbitrary timetables and benchmarks. The Los Angeles Times is saying that; it is not the Washington Times. If it were the Washington Times, my friends on the other side of the aisle would say that is a conservative paper. But it is the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post saying this. 
   Now, my friends on the other side like to talk about the Iraqi Study Group, and the bipartisan Iraqi Study Group did not advocate, I repeat, did not advocate a firm timetable for withdrawal in its December 2006 report, because those folks knew that it was a bad idea to give our enemies a time certain as to when we would be out of Iraq. 
   The National Intelligence Estimate released in January warned of the perils of an early troop withdrawal. And it said: If Coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate, we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq. More death, more destruction. 
   Now, you can't have it both ways. You can't stand up and quote the Iraqi Study Group and the National Intelligence Estimate and pick out bits and pieces of it. There are certainly things in there that they said that we all need to pay attention to, but these are extremely important statements that were made. 
   I am sure I can go on and on quoting newspapers around this country that say similar things that The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times are saying. And, again, I want to remind people what the Los Angeles Times said: It is absurd for the House Speaker to try to micromanage the conflict and the evolution of Iraqi society with arbitrary timetables and benchmarks. It is absurd for us to give our enemies a timetable for them to know when to lay back so they can regroup and wait until we leave, so that they can go back into the country of Iraq, set up bases, and wreak havoc on the people of Iraq. 
   The other thing about this supplemental that is distasteful to me and I believe others on the other side is that they have loaded this supplemental with spending. They have used our troops as a bargaining chip to increase domestic spending. Now, our troops deserve better than that, not to be used as a bargaining chip. This is a supplemental. This is for emergency spending, this is for the war, this is for something that our troops need. And I hope that those on the other side that have talked on the this floor night after night about irresponsible domestic spending, that they won't stand for it to be put in a supplemental that is to be used for emergency spending on this war. 
   Republicans rejected last year $14 billion of domestic spending not related to the war. We had a clean supplemental. And I hope my friends on the other side will reassess what they are about to do and use this supplemental, use our men and women in harm's way as a bargain chip.

Because I was under the impression that the Speaker and the leadership of the Democratic Party campaigned that they were going to have open rule after open rule, and they weren't going to put bills on the floor that didn't give the minority their rights.

But, when the United States Congress is going to make an attempt to micromanage a war, that is going to be a comparison to Vietnam, and the same outcome is going to be not a good outcome. And like you said, the disaster that occurred, what happens after we leave and there is a disaster, human disaster of people, mass exodus from the country? So I just wanted to make that point.

I think it is absolutely right, and I think the gentleman is right to point out that is really going to be a defining moment for many Members of this body, especially our colleagues on the other side, who, as you quite eloquently pointed out, that the choice is either stay and fight and have a strategy work to help the people of Iraq or get out. 
   So I hope the folks that come down here, and there were some here tonight that have come down night after night and for the last several months have talked about the need, the desire to get out immediately, we are going to see. Are they going to stand up and be true to what they have been talking about to the Nation on this House floor for the past several months, or are they going to bend to the will of their leadership? 
   As well there are other Members on the other side of the aisle that have said they will not stand for micromanagement of the war, they will not stand for putting timelines in to give our enemy the ability to fight a different kind of war and hurt and kill our soldiers. So this is going to be a defining moment.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I wanted to talk a little bit more about the politics of this. And, again, I want to read something that The Washington Post wrote on March 13. I took bits and pieces out of there, but I think it is pretty consistent throughout the whole editorial. And again to remind my colleagues if they have forgotten, The Washington Post is no friend of the Bush administration, and it is no supporter of Republican causes. But I will give The Washington Post credit that it takes a position, thinks about it, and comes down many times on the different side of the issue, or at least they are thoughtful about it. 
   And this Washington Post editorial, ``The Pelosi Plan for Iraq, it makes perfect sense if the goal is winning votes in the United States. 
   ``The only constituency House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi ignored in her plan for amending President Bush's supplemental war funding bill are the people of the country that the U.S. troops are fighting to stabilize. The Democratic proposal doesn't attempt to answer the question of why August 2008 is the right moment for the Iraqi Government to lose all support from U.S. combat units. It doesn't hint at what might happen if American forces were to leave at the end of this year, a development that would be triggered by the Iraqi Government's weakness. It doesn't explain how continued U.S. interests in Iraq, which holds the world's second largest oil reserves and a substantial cadre of al Qaeda militants, would be protected after 2008. In fact,'' The Washington Post says, ``it may prohibit U.S. forces from returning once they leave. 
   ``In short, the Democratic proposal ..... is an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself. 
   ``Will Iraq collapse into unrestrained civil conflict with `massive civilian casualties,' as the U.S. intelligence community predicts in the event of a rapid withdrawal? Will al Qaeda establish a powerful new base for launching attacks on the United States and its allies? Will there be regional war that sucks in Iraq's neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey? The House legislation is indifferent. Whether or not any those events happened, U.S. forces would be gone. 
   ``Ms. Pelosi's strategy leads not toward a responsible withdrawal from Iraq but to a constitutional power struggle with Mr. Bush, who has already said he will veto the legislation. Such a struggle would serve the interests of neither the Democrats nor the country.'' 
   And, again, that is coming from The Washington Post. So don't listen to a Republican Member of Congress from Pennsylvania, a conservative Republican from Pennsylvania. Listen to what The Washington Post has to say. And they are pointing it out over and over again: this is a bad plan; this is a bad war supplemental. And, again, I believe that it uses our men and women in harm's way as bargaining chips and it makes it more dangerous for those men and women in Iraq. 
   And it also is going to destroy their morale. If they find out they are going to be pulled out in 2 months or 6 months or 18 months or whatever the Democratic proposal is, which we are not quite sure, what is going to give a young marine or ranger the will to go kick in a door where the bad guys are when he sits back in his quarters and says, Well, I could be out of this place in 3 months or 6 months. I mean, it is going to destroy the morale of our men and women. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio. 
   And I think you are right. I think it is important. I think that one of the things that we learn as citizens, we learn here in Congress, is your word. Your word is what matters, and if your word is good, then people trust you and people know they can count on you. And I think that is exactly your point. If we pull out in Iraq, our word to not only our enemy, our enemy knows that if we pull out that our word is no good to stay there and fight them, but our friends around the world are going to say you can't count on America. And I think that is an extremely important point, and that is maybe the core of this. We need to stay and make sure the Iraqi people have control of the security on the ground. And I think that while it is too early to tell if the new strategy in Iraq will succeed, there are tangible indications that it is working. 
   The joint U.S.-Iraqi security crackdown is fulfilling its primary objective to reduce violence in Baghdad. Bomb deaths have gone down 30 percent. Execution-style deaths have decreased by nearly half in the last month. Iraqis are taking on an increased role in security of their country. Nine of the Iraqis' 10 army divisions are taking the lead in areas of operation. And today almost 329,000 Iraq security force members are working to secure their country. And the political benchmarks are being met. Last month the Iraqi Government approved a budget, approved a national hydrocarbon law, and just last week they convened a regional conference of 13 nations to discuss these concerns. So things are moving forward. There was a poll out, the largest poll done in Iraq in the last couple of years, the London polling firm Opinion Research Business found that in a survey of over 5,000 Iraqis that by a 2-1 margin, Iraqis prefer living under the current system than they did under Saddam. So there are positive signs there. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I think the gentleman makes an excellent point. This country, there are people in this country, the political discourse, we agree, we disagree, we debate, but the wonderful thing about it is we can do it, and people aren't tortured and drug off to prison and killed. 
   As a matter of fact, I was on the Mall last week in the morning with another colleague of ours, and we went up to the war protestors. They had their tents up and their signs up. It was really quite a magnificent picture of the war protestors, and behind it was the United States Capitol. 
   I started to talk. We were talking about why they were opposed to the  war and why I wanted to continue to support our troops there. I said, you know, in some countries of the world, Iraq, Iran, many of those countries, almost all of those countries in the Middle East, you cannot be doing this. They wouldn't allow you to do this. In fact, they would kill you. They would take you off and kill you possibly. And you would be lucky if you were killed because most of the time they would torture you before they would kill you. 
   So this country is a great country, and what we are doing over there is we are trying to help a nation stabilize, trying to help a nation build a democracy, and that is not easy. That is difficult. As our colleague from Ohio pointed out, the Revolutionary War in 1776, it took 13 years for the Constitution. 
   A story I like to tell, because it happened in my district, during the first year of George Washington's second term, we had already got a Constitution, we elected a President, George Washington, not once, but the second time. In that first year, the Whiskey Rebellion occurred in western Pennsylvania. The farmers in western Pennsylvania didn't like the tax, so they revolted. So George Washington, it was the only time that a Commander in Chief mounted up on a horse and took the soldiers into the field, had to ride up into western Pennsylvania and put down that rebellion. 
   We as Americans sometimes forget that it took us a long time until we were able to establish democracy. So it is not easy. We need to remember our history, that it takes time. It takes time especially when you are a nation that has never known democracy; never known democracy, but certainly has that feeling, has that sense of wanting freedom. 
   I think that there is no doubt that the Iraqi people, as well as any person, any people in the world, or every people in the world, want freedom. They have a desire for freedom.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman for joining me and appreciate that report on the revenues to the government. Once again it proves that tax cuts do work. It increases the economic activity in this country, which generates more revenue not only for the government, but for the good people of America that are out there working hard every day. They are able to put more of that money into their pockets instead of sending it to the bureaucrats in Washington to spend it. 
   I think it is important on this fourth anniversary that we did speak about what is happening in Iraq, and most importantly what is going to happen on this House floor. 
   The American people, I was told by Colonel Walt Piatt in Afghanistan when I visited there a couple years ago, and I was talking to Colonel Piatt, who is from my district, and we were talking about the effort and the needs of the troops and the military equipment, and he said to me, you know, America's power is not its soldier, it is not its weaponry, it is not the bombs we create. The strength in America is the will of the American people, because if the soldiers know that the people are behind what they are doing, in support of what they are doing, they can accomplish anything. 
   I think what is going to be said here on this House floor, because the House, we are the people elected, we are the leaders elected from our districts, 435 districts, and what we say here is going to go a long way in whether we are going to be successful in helping the Iraqis building a democracy, in stabilizing that country and helping long term what is going to happen in the Middle East. 
   So it is going to be very critical what is said here on the floor in this war supplemental. Are we going to use it as a political ploy, use it as a bargaining chip, use our men and women as bargaining chips to get spending to things that don't belong in this war supplemental, or are we going to do the right thing, and that is you support our men and women with the funding that they need? Are we going to support them? 
   That is going to be a large step in proving to them that we are with them, that we are behind them and that we are not going to put in arbitrary deadlines that are going to give our adversaries and our enemies a leg up on us. 
   So this is going to be an absolutely critical week for America. It is going to be a critical week and a defining moment I believe for the majority party, because I don't believe, and I think it is pretty clear, the American people don't like conflict, don't like war, don't like death, don't like destruction. Nobody likes that. But the American people do not want to lose in Iraq. I think that is very clear. And this war supplemental, putting in these arbitrary timetables, is a prescription for that. 
   It is micromanaging this war by the politicians in Washington, just like many on the other side of the aisle say is what happened in Vietnam. That was wrong in Vietnam, and yet they are standing up on the House floor this week and the past couple weeks proposing that we do just that, micromanage this war. 435 Members of the House, 100 Senators, they are not the Commander in Chief.  
   The Constitution is clear. When you are fighting a war, you need one leader. When you are fighting a war, you leave it to the professionals, you leave it to the generals, you leave it to the colonels, you leave it to the men and women that are trained to do this, not bring it on the House floor. And as I said and as The Washington Post has said, trying to micromanage this war is the wrong thing to do for the Iraqi people, it is the wrong thing to do for the American people, and it is the wrong thing to do for the men and women that are in harm's way. 
   So I hope we are able to come together on this House floor and strip out many of those things that are in here that just make it unworkable and bad for the American people and the military.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHUSTER. (COMMENDING THE JUNIATA COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE NCAA DIVISION III WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Lady ``screaming eagles'' of Juniata College on winning the 2006 NCAA Division ill Woman's Volleyball Championship. 
   In a thrilling win, the Eagles found themselves down two games to one to Washington University. Down, but not out the Lady Eagles came storming back with a brilliant offensive effort to capture the Title 3-2. The Eagles found their momentum in the fourth game where the team went on a 4 to 1 run. After claiming the lead, the Eagles never looked back. At the end of the day, the Eagles walked away with 90 kills and a championship. 
   Juniata College's Volleyball Team's championship is a great example of sportsmanship and achievement in college sports. Over 30 seasons, Juniata's volleyball program has built a 1,100 win and 172 loss record. The team's coach, Larry Bock, has the most wins of any coach in the history of NCAA women's volleyball. Also, during their championship season, senior player Stephanie Kines was named Division III Women's Volleyball Player of the Year. Stephanie is the second Juniata player to earn that honor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate all of the players and coaches of the Juniata College Women's Volleyball Team: Erin Albert, Brittany Carr, Cassie Dickmann, Kristi Fitzsimmons, Jess Fox, Paige Johnston, Stephanie Kines, Beth Kozak, Megan Lamens, Mariel Little, Michelle Morchesky, Aly Pompeani, Jessica Ritchey, Rachael Schatz, Megan Sollenberger, Molly Sollenberger, and Amber Thomas Head Coach Larry Bock, and assistant Coaches Heather Pavlik, Casey Dale and Erin Dodson. To all of the Screaming Eagles, congratulation on most successful season and a well earned championship.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHUSTER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, ``So they go on in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent.'' The words of Winston Churchill on the eve of World War II ring true today as clearly as they did decades ago describing our state of affairs. 
   I am disappointed with my colleagues in the majority. They spent the time and effort solidifying their caucus against the war in Iraq. They devised a number of plans to withdraw our troops. They made Iraq the focus of their agenda in November and not staying the course their slogan. However, they stand today, as Churchill said, resolved to be irresolute in their position on Iraq. 
   The resolution we debate in the House today is based on flawed logic. The resolution states that Congress supports the efforts of our troops in mind but not in body. The fact is, this resolution is framed upon the idea that the current state of affairs in Iraq is beyond recovery and should be abandoned. 
   Instead of offering any real alternatives, the Democrats have drafted a nonbinding resolution that rejects the President's plan to reinforce our troops and give the Iraqi Security Forces the assistance they need. This resolution does not bring us one step closer to victory. This resolution does nothing more than reinforce the status quo. 
   This resolution does show the American people that yet again, the Democrats, for all of their rhetoric, have no plan, no alternative to fight the threat of Islamic jihad. They instead have chosen, amazingly, to simply stay the course. 
   I will be the first to admit that, despite the outstanding jobs that our troops on the ground have done, progress in the war is slow and frustrating. We overthrew a violent despot, only to see a new and dangerous threat emerge. But we can not be fooled into thinking that by leaving Iraq this threat will melt away. 
   By the very admission of the Islamic fundamentalists we fight, this war is  only part of a larger power play to consolidate power and form a jihadist Islamic state in the center of the Middle East. 
   In a speech released this month, Ahman Zawahiri praised al Qaeda's master plan for Iraq. He asked Allah to consolidate Iraq so that it unites all our Muslim brothers in Iraq and sets up an Islamic state which will proceed to liberate Jerusalem and take steps towards reestablishment of the Caliphate. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is a grave mistake for us to not take our enemy at their word. The jihadists do not want peace. They want capitulation. We ignored their threats in the 1980s and they bombed our Marine barracks in Beirut. We ignored their rhetoric in the nineties and they bombed the World Trade Center and our embassies in Africa. We ignored their threats in the days leading up to September 11, and our world was changed forever. 
   Democratic Presidential Candidate John Edwards described this resolution best when he compared it to a child standing in a corner, stomping his feet. This resolution may draw headlines, but it will not change a thing. 
   We have one Commander in Chief, not 435 separate executives. What the Congress does have is the power of the purse and the ability to cut off the funding for the war. Let's be honest. This resolution is the first step in that direction. 
   If cutting off funding is the Democrats' plan, and I believe it is, then let them state it openly. They are no longer the voice of the opposition in Congress. They are the majority, and they have an obligation to govern. It is time for them to create a plan, a real course of success. The American people are waiting.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, this is one of the most difficult and complex issues I have had to deal with in my 8 years in Congress. I am proud of my no vote on Monday against the original rescue plan. My no vote enabled me to push this legislation forward towards an improved and positive bill. This is a different bill. It is an improved bill. 
   I have pushed as far as I can and we are at the point where the only two directions we can go from here are backwards or nothing. Neither is an option. 
   I share the anger of my constituents that we have been forced into this economic crisis by Wall Street greed and irresponsible lending by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. But we cannot let our anger cloud our judgment. 
   Over the past 5 days, I have been hearing from more and more of my constituents who are beginning to feel the pain of the economic crisis we are entering. I am convinced that my constituents will feel that pain grow if we do not act, and that pain will be felt in job losses. 
   Therefore, I have decided to support this economic recovery effort. Make no mistake, this bill is a far better deal for American taxpayers than what was originally brought to the House floor. My colleagues and I fought hard to include additional taxpayer and market driven protections that will restore trust in our banks, including raising the FDIC insurance limit to protect my constituents' bank accounts. My vote is the right decision for my constituents and America, not for political popularity.

   Coached by Coach Mark Moschella, the team is graduating six seniors, led by senior forward Mary Forr, a 1,000-point scorer. 
   Also playing their last game were Courtney Carroll, Heather Craig, Ashley Helsel, Rachel Sullivan, and Dani Williams. 
   And special note, Alli Williams, a freshman on the Lady Marauders, scored 13 points and finished with 10 rebounds in the championship game. 
   I am extremely proud of the hard work and dedication of these young women from Bishop Guilfoyle and congratulate the team, the coaching staff, and their fans on a story-book year and a deserved championship.

Also playing their last game in the purple and gold were Courtney Carroll, Heather Craig, Ashley Helsel, Rachel Sullivan and Dani Williams, who finished the championship game with 11 rebounds. 
   Rounding out the championship team were; Danielle Filer, Teresa Mull, Ashley Fulare, Nicole Ciambotti, Christine Conrad, Shannon Hite, Tiffany Seasoltz, Chelsey Neugebauer, Kaylee Keagy, Brooke Stayer, Rachel Rea, Erin Brennen and freshman sensation Alli Williams, who shared the winning season on the court with her sister Dani. Alli, the only freshman on the squad, led the Lady Marauders with 13 points and finished the championship game with 10 rebounds. 
   The Mountain Athletic Conference Champion Lady Marauders finished undefeated in league play with a record of 14-0. During the regular season they defeated District VI champions Altoona (AAAA) and Lewistown (AAA) and District VI runner-up Bishop McCort (AA). Their only loss was to Delone Catholic in December; however, since that game, they won 23 straight including the District VI Championship and the PIAA Class A State Title. 
   The Lady Marauders proved their dominance on their way to the championship, defeating Rockwood in the first round of the PIAA playoffs 58-20; beating Lancaster Country Day 66-16 in the second round; following with a 57-46 win over Nativity BVM in the State Quarter-Final match-up; a 46-34 Semi-Final victory over Bishop O'Reilly and culminating with the State Championship win against North Catholic 43-38. 
   The team, known for its prolific defense and extraordinary teamwork, will cherish these accomplishments long after they have graduated from Bishop Guilfoyle. I am extremely proud of the hard work and dedication of these young women from Bishop Guilfoyle and congratulate the team, the coaching staff and their fans on a storybook year and a deserved championship.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman, and I just want to echo what he said about the Capitol Hill Police and what they do every day, protecting us, making sure the grounds are safe, not only for us but the people who do business here, the visitors here. So we owe them a great debt of gratitude. 
   I would urge all of you, while not all of you were able to get out to the game and not all of you were able to play in the game, but I would urge all of you, when you see a Capitol Hill Police officer out there, thank them. Thank them for what they do for you, for your family and for, as I said, everybody that uses this great Capitol Hill complex. 
   The game, as HEATH pointed out, didn't end up the way we thought it would. Some thought we gave better than we took. Some thought that the Capitol Hill Police could have scored 56 on us. That will remain to be seen, but nobody was hurt during the game. Everybody played. We all had a lot of fun, and we raised some money for the benevolent fund that goes to the kids of the Capitol Hill Police. So it was a great success. 
   I appreciate all those that participated. Practices were early. HEATH and John Booty and Ken Harvey, who really ran the show, did a great job of getting us out there in the morning. 
   I also want to thank the Members that showed up to the game. Some of you came out: HENRY BROWN, MIKE CONAWAY, STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, JESSE JACKSON, GREGORY MEEKS and LINCOLN DAVIS. Thank you guys for coming out there to the game. I think that's extremely important that when you are out there, we're out there, leaving a little skin on the field, a little blood, but all of it's for a great cause to the Capitol Hill Police. 
   Sergeant at Arms, Bill Livingood, thank you. The Chief of Police, Philip Morse, thank you for all your help. And also a special thanks to Vardell Williams, who's now become the voice of the Longest Yard Classic. Thank you. He works here for the superintendent, but he volunteered to be out there to be the voice of the Longest Yard Classic. 
   So again I thank everybody, and congratulations to the Capitol Hill Police. 
   The following is our team roster. 
  Member name   State  Jersey Ðnumber   Kendrick Meek   Florida   0     Zach Wamp   Tennessee   1     Pat Murphy   Pennsylvania   3     Jim Jordan   Ohio   4     Joe Donnelly   Indiana   7     Anthony Weiner   New York   9     Charlie Dent   Pennsylvania   15     Brad Ellsworth   Indiana   18     Heath Shuler   North Carolina   21     Jason Altmire   Pennsylvania   24     Sam Graves   Missouri   27     Jack Kingston   Georgia   28     Jim Gerlach   Pennsylvania   30     John Sullivan   Oklahoma   39     Dean Heller   Nevada   42     Jeff Flake   Arizona   44     Todd Tiahrt   Kansas   45     Michael Arcuri   New York   58     Thaddeus McCotter   Michigan   65     Rick Renzi   Arizona   67     Gresham Barrett   South Carolina   76     Paul Ryan   Wisconsin   80     Bill Shuster   Pennsylvania   00     Kevin McCarthy   California   11*

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Texas for taking control of the time. I have got a bad wheel, but I did not want to miss this. I think it is so important. 
   I want to start off by just echoing your sentiments about what happened here in the capital this week. I mean, a bunch of anarchists, they pushed forward on the Capitol Police, as you said, and the Capitol Hill Police let them come through and deface the United States Capitol. 
   And I heard that they were saying, that they were chanting it was their  right to. But they have no right to deface the United States Capitol. This belongs to all of the Americans. And nobody has a right to do what they had to. I really want to know, and I hope there is an investigation, there should be an investigation to find out why the Capitol Hill Police did not resist them, and you know the party that is in the majority needs to answer, needs to stand up and be held accountable, because they are in charge, they are the ones that are giving the instructions to the Capitol Hill Police. 
   I want to know if the majority party said, we do not want you to confront them; let them do whatever they want to do. Because it is outrageous. And all Americans that are watching tonight, I do not know how widely it has been reported. I have heard a few reports. But, you know, it should have made top news that a group of anarchists spray painted their symbols on the Capitol. I heard the report was that there was no incident. Well, there should have been an incident. There should have been an extreme incident of resistance by the Capitol Hill Police to not allow someone to deface what I consider, this is the crown of America, this is the people's House and nobody should ever be allowed to do that. So I am outraged by it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, some of them have given their lives up to protect this building and Members of Congress. I agree with you, I cannot imagine that they did not get orders to stand down from the highest level. 
   Once again, the party in the majority runs this place. They need to be held accountable. They need to stand up and say what they did do, what they did not do. But in the future, if there are going to be, I am certain there will be, as there has been throughout our history, protests throughout the capital, and people have a right, absolutely have a right to protest, but they do not have a right to do it violently; they do not have a right to deface property that belongs to all of the taxpayers. So the questions need to be asked and we need to have answers from the majority party. 
   Back again to why, the main reason we are here tonight, is to talk about the 1,433 days from now, if the majority, the Democrats in Congress, do not act over the next 4 years, or 1,433 days, we are going to see an over-$200 billion tax increase on Americans, on the American family, on small businesses. 
   And that is going to significantly hurt this economy. And you just have to look at the facts. Over the last 4 years, 7.2 million jobs were created in this country because of those tax cuts. Just in December, 167,000 jobs were created. The unemployment rate at 4.5 percent, the lowest average it has been in five decades. 
   If we do not extend them, if we do not do what is responsible, then money, real dollars are going to come out of the American people's pocket. A family of four, making in the $40,000 range, they are going to see a tax increase of about $2,000. 
   Now, to some in this body, $2,000 may not seem like a lot of money, but it is to a hardworking American family. $2,000 is a nice down payment on a new car, $2,000 will buy you a new washer and a dryer. $2,000 helps you put your son or daughter or yourself through college or to get educated or trained on something. 
   So I hope that the American people that are watching tonight, whether you are Republican, you are a Democrat, there are lessons for us all through history, recent history, on why tax cuts work, why they are a good thing for the economy, why Americans should be allowed to keep their hard-earned dollars. You have to go back to the 1960s. 
   President Kennedy, he cut taxes. What did he see? The economy came on strong. Revenues to the Federal Government increased dramatically. We saw that in 1980. And today we are seeing it at record levels. As the gentleman from Oklahoma pointed out, there are a lot of things in this economy that are happening because of those tax cuts, and we need to make sure that they continue. 
   It is startling to me. Although, I watched and was obviously very keenly aware of what the Democrats were saying during the last campaign. And the first thing that they basically said, when you listen to the incoming chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, he basically told the American people that he did not see one of those tax cuts that really had merit and that everything was on the table. So the American people should not be surprised when they see these tax cuts. 
   And just 11 days ago was the first Democratic tax increase. They changed the rules of the House to make it a simple majority. When we put it in place as the majority party, it had to be three-fifths of votes to increase taxes. They made it a simple majority, because they knew how difficult it is going to be to get a majority in this House to raise taxes on the American people.     
   So, once again, if we don't stand up and fight, and I hope my Democratic colleagues who aren't here tonight, the Blue Dogs who come down and talk about fiscal responsibilities, if they don't join with us to fight these tax cuts, they are going to take part in this huge tax increase that is going to occur on the American people. So I appreciate the gentleman tonight hosting this hour.

And you know, an omnibus is like a Christmas tree; they hang everything on it that they want to get through.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to relate two stories that I came across concerning these tax cuts. 
   Jim Tracy from Shelbyville, Tennessee, who is the owner of a small insurance agency, he said because of the tax cuts, he was able to use the $7,200 that he would have otherwise spent on taxes, and he bought seven new computers for his business and he hired a fourth employee. That is just one of many. 
   There is another story here. Kenneth Leupp of Archbold Refuse Service in Archbold, Ohio, he says, ``The tax cuts, changes in depreciation schedules and increases in dollar amount we can expense off are very welcome changes. We have made purchases we wouldn't have made under the old laws. We've saved money on taxes, increased efficiency, lowered maintenance costs, and helped stimulate the economy.'' 
   Those are just two of thousands and thousands of experiences out there because of these tax cuts. Our purpose here tonight, although I may be repeating myself, I know that people watching C-SPAN tune in and out, but I just want to remind them that in 1,443 days, it is the countdown to the Democratic tax increase. All they have to do is run the clock out. They don't even have to act on them. 
   So on January 1, 2011, there will be a $200 billion tax increase to the American people. The death tax will expire, capitol gains tax, tax on dividends will expire in January of 2009. A record number of Americans are invested in the stock market with mutual funds and retirement funds. The child tax credit will be cut in half over the next couple of years. The marriage penalty will be back in place, and low-income  taxpayers will go from a 10 percent tax bracket to a 15 percent tax bracket if we don't act. 
   The American people need to be aware of this. And in less than 4 years, if they don't communicate to their Members of Congress that they want to see these tax cuts extended, their voices need to be heard.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding to me. 
   It's a great honor and privilege for me to be on the House floor tonight, coming to the well to talk about a very good friend, a dear friend, JOHN PETERSON. And I have to tell you about, we go back 12 years, and very little known to Members of this body, but JOHN PETERSON ran for Congress in a primary against my brother for Congress. And many would say, well, how can you say, ``your dear friend'' when a guy like JOHN PETERSON ran hard and defeated your brother in a primary? But JOHN PETERSON and I and my family quickly after that primary election became very close and got behind JOHN and supported him to become the Congressman from the Fifth District. 
   But JOHN, when I first came to Congress, was one of the first people to come to me and offer me advice, and I took it readily because of his long career in the State Senate and his years here in the House, listening to JOHN and, as I said, becoming very, very good friends. 
   JOHN is one of my very close and best and dearest friends here in Congress, and it's because JOHN and I share the same principles. We share the same values. We share a similar background, coming from a small business. 
   JOHN ran a grocery store in the Fifth District of Pennsylvania. He worked extremely hard, and as he worked his political career through the House and the Senate of Pennsylvania, anybody you talk to, whether it's here in Washington or whether it's in Harrisburg, talk about JOHN's hard work and his tenacity. He's one of those guys that my colleague from Lehigh Valley said, you know it's JOHN when he sinks his teeth into something, he doesn't let go. He fights and he fights and he fights, and his career has been an example of that, for the 20 years he served in the State legislature and the 14 years he's served here in Congress. 
   And he is one of the hardest working Members of the House of Representatives. I go back to, I remember JOHN before I came to Congress on television going to Russia, fighting to get the release of one of his constituents who was arrested because the Russians at the time thought he was a spy. But it was JOHN PETERSON on national television, in Russia, pounding and fighting to make sure that his constituent was released. And you know, JOHN PETERSON, with that tenacity, that hard work, was able to do that, and that family is grateful to him. The people of his district are grateful for his hard work and his expertise. 
   I think it's been mentioned here tonight by different colleagues about his expertise on a number of issues, and JOHN really understood the issues of rural America. In his role as the chairman of the Rural Caucus for a number of years, he was out there always fighting for those issues. Whether it was health care, whether it was education, economic development, JOHN PETERSON understood it as well or better than any Member of Congress, those issues for rural America, and he was a tireless advocate for those issues. 
   As well as here in the last several months on the House floor, it was JOHN PETERSON and his knowledge and expertise on energy. JOHN PETERSON knew energy. Being a representative from the district that the first well in America in 1859 was sunk in his district, JOHN took that issue and made it his own issue, and he was able to talk about that issue with great authority. Many of us went to JOHN to try to understand, try to get the knowledge from JOHN when it came to energy issues. Whether it was OCS, whether it was biomass or renewables, JOHN PETERSON knew those issues. 
   Also, a little known fact is that JOHN's family owns a business that sells furnaces, that sells heating apparatuses that use alternative energy. Whether it's corn, whether it's  wood, it's JOHN PETERSON who is up there in the weekends selling those products, talking to people about them because he understands them.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHUSTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3074, TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule for the Department of Transportation, HUD and related agencies appropriations. 
   The ranking member of the Transportation Committee, Mr. Mica, has made compelling and passionate remarks regarding the objections shared by many members of the committee on both sides of the aisle. Numerous provisions in the underlying bill constitute  legislating on an appropriations bill and fall within the jurisdiction of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 
   As the ranking member of the Railroad Subcommittee, pipelines and hazardous materials, I would like to voice my opposition waiving points of order under clause 2, rule XXI, which is the rule against authorizing on appropriations bills. 
   In House Resolution 558, I'm especially concerned about the language that places all Amtrak contracts and leases that make them subject to the Washington, D.C., law. This language should be removed from the bill because it is authorizing on an appropriations bill. 
   This provision was apparently intended to help resolve a pending Amtrak negotiation with the State of Maryland. That negotiation involved a dispute of a disputed clause in the MARC commuter railroad operating agreement. Amtrak wants all disputes handled under D.C. law, but Maryland State requires that it's handled under their jurisdiction, which is appropriate. 
   Instead of a narrowly tailored provision, this provision is unlimited in scope and states that all leases and contracts entered into by Amtrak shall be governed by D.C. law. This could be construed to include all D.C. laws, including building codes, environmental permits and security deposits, et cetera, et cetera. 
   In addition, Amtrak trackage agreements with computer railroads such as the New Jersey Transit, Long Island Railroad, Virginia Railway Express and freight carriers would ultimately be placed under D.C. law. This could lead to many unintended consequences such as changing the law on all rail leases, contracts and perhaps rail labor contracts. 
   Again, I voice my opposition for House Resolution 558 and the waiver of the point of order based on clause 2 of rule XXI. 
   Since the Democratic majority has taken over the House, we've seen a chipping away of the authority and the jurisdiction of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. So I would urge the chairmen of the committee to join together in a bipartisan fashion to oppose this rule which continues to erode the jurisdiction of the Transportation Committee and thus, I believe, sets a precedent for all committees in the House, all authorizing committees, to continue to see their authorities and their jurisdictions to erode and given away to the Appropriations Committee. 
   So again, I rise in opposition to this rule and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand for the continuing erosion of our authorities and our jurisdictions to these committees that were given historically to these committees.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about and make the American people aware that we have 1,446 days counting down to the tax increase to the American people which will occur on January 1, 2011, if the new majority, the Democrats in Congress, don't act to extend the tax cuts that the Republicans put in place in 2001 and 2003. 
   So in 1,446 days, we will see that tax increase. The Democrats don't have to act, all they have to do is run out the clock. Run out the clock, and we will see a $200 billion tax increase. It will be money taken out of American people's pockets between now and January 1, 2011, if they don't act. 
   Those tax cuts as I said were enacted in 2001 and 2003. And what we have seen is an expansion in our economy, a great expansion that continues to this day that has created over the last 4 years 7.2 million jobs. Just in the month of December, 167,000 jobs were created in this country. The unemployment rate is down to 4.6 percent. It is the lowest average we have seen in 4 decades, and that is directly attributable to the tax cuts that we passed in this Congress in 2001 and 2003. 
   Again, if we don't extend them, which I believe is the responsible thing to do so we see this economy continue to grow, we are going to take money right out of the pockets of the American taxpayers. 
   Mr. Speaker, we will be debating tomorrow a tax increase. It has not taken longer than 20 days for the new Democratic majority to increase taxes. There will be a great debate here, and there are many in this country who think we should increase taxes on our oil companies. But it is the reduction in the tax on our oil companies that has allowed them to go out and look for new oil reserves to decrease our dependency. Yet the Democrats are, as I said, in less than 20 days, are going to put a bill on the floor that is going to increase taxes already on a segment of our economy. We will talk more about that later this evening. 
   If we don't extend those tax cuts that we put in place in 2001 and 2003, you are going to take money right out of the American taxpayers' pocket, anywhere from $2,000 to $4,000, right in that middle income of America. That is money that they can save to put away for their children's college. They can save to put a downpayment on a car, or buy a new washer and dryer. But the most important thing is if we take that money out of the American taxpayers' pockets, it will be some bureaucrat deciding how to spend that money, and not an American family. 
   We removed 10.6 million low-income Americans from paying taxes in this country all together. We need to make sure that those people stay in that position, that they are not paying taxes when they are low income. We lowered the tax rates on small businesses and employers, the critical employers in our Nation that create the jobs. 
   I hope that those on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, will take a lesson from history from one of their own. Jack Kennedy, President Kennedy decreased taxes in the 1960s. What happened, there was increased revenue to the Federal Government. President Kennedy in the 1960s did the right thing. As I said, the revenues to the United States Government increased. 
   Ronald Reagan did that in the 1980s, and revenue increased to the Federal Government. Once again, history repeats itself. In 2001 and 2003, we cut taxes and what has happened is the levels of revenue the government has received are at greater levels than ever before in our history. That is what happens when you cut taxes. 
   By raising taxes, all we will do is stifle economic growth in this country. We will take money out of our small businesses; we will take money away from the American taxpayer. Once again, this economy will stop growing. It will stop creating the jobs it has created over the last several years. 
   I know I am joined here tonight by one of my colleagues who is a former small business owner and a former Army Ranger. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Davis).

   Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman. It is interesting to note, as we heard, that they are going to increase taxes in less than 20 days being in the majority. So it is going to be very interesting to see how many of our colleagues vote. I was interested to hear one of our new colleagues, Mr. Wilson, talk about change in America.     
   I don't disagree that the American people voted for change, but I don't believe that I heard anybody in my district that voted for me or against me, and I would be willing to wager that in Mr. Wilson's district in Ohio, a Southern conservative Ohio, that anybody there voted for a change to see our taxes go up. 
   I cannot wait to join with the Blue Dogs when I see what kind of budget they get an opportunity, if they get an opportunity to introduce a budget in this Congress. I know over the past 6 years that I have been in Congress the Blue Dogs have been able to introduce a budget. I voted for the Republican budget, but I think, and I hope we get an opportunity to vote for the Blue Dogs budget. If they get a chance in this new majority to offer one, I think their budget will be much more reasonable, much more fiscally responsible than the Democratic majority's budget. But once again, I don't believe the American people, at least any American I have spoken to, wants to see their taxes go up. 
   So once again, I would point out to those Americans that may be joining us here tonight, there are 1,446 days before there will be a $200 billion tax increase imposed on the American people. And all that has to happen is that the Democrats have to run out the clock, and we will see many of those tax increases that my friend from Kentucky mentioned tonight, the child tax credit and those types of tax cuts we put in place that really will affect middle-class America if we don't act. 
   I would yield to the gentleman from Kentucky if he has a further comment.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Well, that is absolutely as you mentioned. In Pennsylvania, in its coal fields, we need to unleash our companies in America, whether they are coal companies or companies developing biodiesel or ethanol or wind. And even our oil companies, we have to encourage them to go out there and to continue to look for new oil fields. 
   Tonight was a bit of a surprise, but very appropriate that we heard that the Rules Committee has put out a rule we will debate tomorrow for our very first tax increase under the new Democratic majority. 
   We are joined here tonight by Mr. Conaway, another colleague of ours, who happens to be not most importantly a CPA, which I think is important because he understands the language of business, understands the balance sheets and income statements which many people in this body I do not think understand, but also he comes from the gas and oil business in Texas. 
   So with that I would like to yield to Mr. Conaway.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Well, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding back, and I don't think anybody should be surprised at what we are seeing. I put a quote up here by Representative Rangel from New York, who is now the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Before the election he vowed to put all of President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts on the chopping block. 
   Here we go, 20 days into it and this is the start of it. This is the start of what we will see over the next 2 years, which is an increase in taxes. And some of them they won't even have to enact. They will just expire.     
   But I wanted to ask a question to the gentleman from Texas who knows the oil and gas business much better than  I do. But, you know, basic economics, if you take away, if you actually disincentivize, put a disincentive to a company to go out and explore for oil, when we see that, the oil companies and the wildcatters and the small business entrepreneurs who are in the oil and gas business, not going out there and finding new sources of oil and gas, when we see the supplies go down that is going to cause prices to increase. And I wonder if the gentleman from Texas would comment on that.

   Mr. SHUSTER. And we are seeing right now, I think the latest thing I read was the price of a barrel of oil was down to $51 a barrel of oil. Average gas prices going down. And some of that is a direct response to the supply people out there finding oil. It is also in response to some of the demand has cooled off. People are trying to use less.

   Mr. SHUSTER. And I think we mentioned earlier, Mr. Davis mentioned about pushing it off to other countries in the world. We are going to penalize our own domestic production, and those folks around the world that aren't necessarily our friends, Iran being one of them, they can bring up that crude out of Iran. And it is a scary situation what has happened. I know that the President of Iran was down in Venezuela. Iran has no refining capacity or not much to speak of, and Venezuela is one of the largest refiners. So what we are going to see, I believe, is Iran making a deal with Venezuela, that they will pump the crude in Iran, and another one of our enemies, Venezuela, will refine it for them. So this is a national security issue. It is not just about taxes. It is about making sure that our domestic producers are out there looking for oil and keeping our reliance, lowering our reliance on foreign oil sources.

   Mr. SHUSTER. You are absolutely right. This tax increase that is going to occur is going to have a ripple effect throughout the economy. There are those on the other side that think they are going to punish the oil companies. They are not. Plain and simple, it is going to punish manufacturing, it is going to punish people that are employed in this country, people that are paying taxes in this country. 
   But once again, we should not be surprised. Nobody in America should be surprised when we see, I was corrected, 14 days into this Democratic majority, when you have the new chairman of the Ways and Means, Mr. Rangel from New York, who said back in an interview before the election, back last spring, actually, that the tax cuts that President Bush put in place were beyond irresponsible, and he also said he cannot think of one of those tax cuts in the first term of President Bush that deserves merit. 
   Does that mean the R&D tax credit, which I think we successfully extended, does that mean that they will repeal that and repeal some of those R&D tax credits for alternative fuels? When you think, I see Geoffrey here, you told me he is 8 years old. If a family of four has their taxes increased, that is going to be about $2,100 a month. 
   Well, if you had that $2,100 a month, which you do today, and you took the $2,100 and invested it every year in the banks, so that Geoffrey, 8 years old, 10 years from now to go to college, he would have $30,000 in the bank. That's a great nest egg for your children to help put them through school so when they get out of school they don't have debt. You know, we talk about all these government programs, when, in reality, let the American people keep more of their hard-earned dollars so they can save that money for 8-year-old kids like Geoffrey so that he can go to college in the future.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I agree with you the American people didn't vote for a change of this economy. They didn't vote for a change to increase taxes. We are in deficit not because we tax too much; it is because we spend too much. 
   You know, our colleagues from the Blue Dog Democrats side, they are right when they talk about fiscal responsibility. They are right about controlling spending. I think their number one of their 12 points is to have a balanced budget except in time of war or in a time of recession. Well, that is what we had in early 2001, 2002. We are still at war. We are not in recession any more. But the way to solve this problem is to control spending. 
   As I said earlier, I am eager to see what the leadership of the Democrats allows the Blue Dogs to propose. I know that over the last 12 years, I think the Blue Dogs, every year, produced a budget that was voted on here on the House floor. 
   Once again, I am eager to see what the Democratic leadership allows the Blue Dogs to do, because I think they will propose a responsible budget more so than I think the Democratic leadership will. Again, we are going to wait and see what happens. 
   Once again, I don't believe that the American people want to see us increase taxes. If we don't act, if the Democrats don't act in the next 4 years, we are going to see a slow expiration and an increase in the taxes the American people pay to the tune of $200 billion by the first of 2011.

   Mr. SHUSTER. It is the equivalent, it is one thing if you own a business to have more sales; but what we do, you raise the price, and when you are in business and in trouble and in deficit, you can't just go out and say, oh, I am going to raise the price of the car, raise the cost of the washer or dryer. That usually doesn't work. Usually what happens when you raise the price, the market, the demand is not great enough, it will drive down your revenues. 
   What we are doing here is raising the price. It will drive down revenues, as it always does. As we said earlier, whether it is President Kennedy in 1960 or Ronald Reagan in 1980 or President Bush in the early 2000s, when you cut taxes it spurs the economy, and it creates more revenues.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank both of you gentleman for joining me, Mr. Davis and Mr. Conaway, for your thoughts tonight. You pointed out rightfully so that the government doesn't create jobs, the government doesn't create wealth, it is people out in America, working hard, day in and day out, saving their money, investing their money, sweating at a job, and it is just wrong for us here in Congress to take more of their money than we should. 
   I put up 1,446 days to remind the American people that they are going to receive a tax increase unless we act, and that is a little less than 4 years. I am so grateful that the gentleman from Texas is a CPA and got my numbers right, that it is not 20 days into this new Congress, it is only 14 days, and we are already starting to hear about the first tax increase that the American people will see coming out of this Congress.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to call out to the American people to ask them to take notice of what's happening here on the floor. When the majority party took control in January, they promised a new direction. But the only direction they've received is to go backwards. Here it is November, and the President has not received one appropriations bill on his desk. 
   The Congress has not moved this slowly in 20 years, and the reason is purely political. They want to drastically increase social spending, and they can't get a bill passed on social spending without coupling it and holding hostage our veterans bill. 
   Our veterans deserve better. Our veterans deserve the funding that they need. 
   I hope every veteran in America is listening to this debate today. I hope they realize that the veterans funding is being held hostage. 
   The President will veto the social spending the Democrats propose and thus delay the funds needed to go to our veterans around this country. 
   I urge the majority party to stop this charade, give the veterans a straight up-or-down vote, and it'll pass this House overwhelmingly. 
   I thank the Congress for listening. I thank the American people for listening to me.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHUSTER. (SALUTE TO STEELERS' ALL PRO RUNNING BACK AND LEGENDARY COACH DICK HOAK -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the great contribution Coach Dick Hoak has made to professional athletics, the game of football, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the people of western Pennsylvania. 
   Coach Dick Hoak recently announced his retirement from the Steelers' organization on January 1 of this year. As he ends an impressive career, Dick Hoak can look back on his 45 years of history as part of the Steelers' organization. This is an unprecedented run and a shining example of consistency in a business best known for its instability rather than longevity with one team. 
   The first 10 of Dick Hoak's 45-year tenure with the Steelers were not spent on the sidelines but, instead, on the playing field. Dick Hoak was drafted by the Steelers in 1961, after an impressive high school career in football, basketball, and baseball that included a WPIAL football championship, and a single-game scoring record of 39 points and playing 4 years for Joe Paterno's Penn State Nittany Lions, where he led the team to a Liberty Bowl victory and was named the MVP. 
   Throughout his playing career with the Steelers, Dick Hoak time and time again showed he was a talented athlete and a dedicated teammate. He led his team in rushing three times and today is the fifth ranked rusher in Steeler history, with 3,965 yards rushing. Dick Hoak also accumulated an impressive 146 receptions, 33 touchdowns, and a Pro Bowl appearance. 
   For many players, the culmination of such an impressive record would have been enough on which to end a career. However, Dick Hoak, his commitment to Pittsburgh and the Steelers would not end there. Only one year after retiring from the National Football League, Dick Hoak turned down an assistant coaching job at the University of Pittsburgh and rejoined the Steelers' organization, this time as an assistant coach under Hall of Fame Coach Chuck Noll. During this time, Coach Hoak coached the running backs, including the great Franco Harris, through four Super Bowl victories, a championship legacy he would later recapture under Coach Bill Cowher. 
   Under Dick Hoak's leadership as an assistant coach, the Steelers dominated the league in rushing yardage. Over the 15 seasons Dick Hoak coached for Bill Cowher alone, the Steelers rushed for over 30,000 yards and led the league in rushing three of those 15 seasons. His excellent coaching also added in no small part to the Steelers' Super Bowl win last year. The Super Bowl win not only capped Dick Hoak's career; it made Hoak one of three people in the Steelers' organization, and possibly the only coach in NFL history, to have six Super Bowl appearances and five Super Bowl rings with one NFL team. 
   Throughout his accomplished career in football, Dick Hoak never let Pennsylvania out of his thoughts. Of course, over his long career, Coach Hoak was offered positions away from his home State. However, his commitment to create a stable environment for his family, and his undying loyalty to his team and the owners of the Steelers, the Rooney family, kept him in Pennsylvania. He never left to accept an offensive coordinator's job with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers; he never left the Rooney family to coach the USFL's Pittsburgh Maulers. Coach Hoak put his family first and remained devoted, loyal, and committed to his team in western Pennsylvania. 
   Coach Hoak was born in Jeanette, Pennsylvania, and continues to live in nearby Greensburg in a house he has owned since his early days in coaching. His commitment to the Pittsburgh Steelers gave his family stability and western Pennsylvania a steady hand at the helm of a winning offense. Now that his storied career with the Steelers is behind him, Dick Hoak can look forward to another winning team: his family. I know his wife, Lynn, his children Kelly, Katie and Rich, and his seven grandchildren, including my nephews Michael, Jonathan, and Daniel Shuster, are happy to have more time with their Pap-Pap. 
   Dick Hoak represents the best attributes of sportsmanship, hard work, and commitment. Those are the values that translate from the football field to everyday life, and he embodied them with class. Not only that, Dick Hoak represents the American Dream. He is an American success story who shows if you work hard enough and remain dedicated to your goals, you can succeed beyond what you thought possible, into excellence and legend. 
   I am happy to say congratulations on a great career, and thank you for being there when we needed you, Coach Hoak.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHUSTER. (THE COUNTDOWN CREW -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman from Kentucky. I appreciate your leadership down there on the floor, and I appreciate everybody that has been here tonight. As always, with those of us down here on the Countdown Crew, we all come from business backgrounds, most of us, if not all of us, small business backgrounds. I ran a business that employed between 30 and 40 people. And many, many Americans, small business owners, know just how difficult it is to meet payroll every month, to pay your bills. 
   There are many people here in Congress that talk about the escalating costs of health care and how difficult it is. But there aren't that many, there are few that are in Congress that have experienced that, like Mr. Davis has, I know Mr. Kingston or THELMA DRAKE or myself. We saw it happen year after year, and it is something that we are all concerned about. It is something that we all want to make sure we find an answer to, seeing that health care costs don't continue to climb. 
   But the answer is not to raise taxes. That works just the opposite. And I am very, very concerned that the American people are not aware, that was one of the reasons that getting together with Mr. Davis and Mr. Kingston and Mrs. Drake and others, we came up with this idea to talk about the countdown to the tax increase, because we are concerned about it, and because the Democrat majority does not have to do anything.     
   They have to run out the clock, and if they run out the clock on 1419 days, there is going to be the largest tax increase in American history, over $200 billion. That does not occur all at one shot. It is going to occur over the next 4 years. 
   In 2008, there are certain tax cuts will expire; in 2009, 2010; and then January 1, 2011, all the tax cuts put in place will have expired, and we will see our taxes go up considerably. 
   If you are at home thinking about what your tax liability is going to be in the future, you need to realize that the Democrat majority, as Mrs. Drake and Mr. Kingston pointed out and discussed about the difference between the three-fifths and the simple majority, the Democrats changed those rules in the very first days of the Congress so that they can raise your taxes. 
   The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the gentleman from New York, said before the election that he did not know of any of the Bush tax cuts that he thought were worthy of continuing or extending. 
   So they have made it quite clear from their leadership, to the fact they changed the rules, that they intend to raise taxes. Why they keep talking about the deficits and deficit spending, and that is the answer to it, well, I believe just the opposite. It is not the answer to it. 
   If you look at the revenues in 2006 to the Federal Government, they increased by 9.7 percent in 2006. The deficit is down 50 percent of where we projected it to be in 2005. The 2006 deficit is down 50 percent as to where we project it to be, and why is that? That is because the revenues are coming into the Federal Government in significant numbers. 
   In 2005, there was an over 14 percent increase in revenues. That is because the economy is growing. That is because the Republican majority tried to hold the line on spending. We did not do enough. We need to do more, but the worst thing to do is to put a halt, put a hurdle on this economy, put a bump in the road to stop this economy from growing. 
   As many have said tonight, talked about the facts, the numbers, in December alone, there were 167,000 jobs created in this country; in January, 111,000 jobs. To date, over the last 4 years, there have been 7.3 million jobs created in America, and those are due to allowing the American people and small businesses to keep more of their hard-earned dollars in their own pockets so that they can go out and buy new things, whether it is a washer and dryer or whether it is a downpayment on a new car or saving money for college, putting that money away, $2,000 at a clip; and that is what the average American with a family of four and making between $40,000 and $50,000 a year, if these tax cuts are not extended, they are going to be hit with about a $2,000, $2,200 tax increase. If you take that money, $2,000 a year, and put it in a bank account at 5 percent interest over 10 years that grows to $30,000. That is a nice downpayment on a house. That is a nice downpayment on your kid's education. It is your money. It should not be sent to Washington. We want to keep it out there in the families of America and the small business of America. 
   As I said more of those numbers, we are at 4.6 percent unemployment, and it is the lowest rate on average over the last 4 decades. Cutting taxes drive this economy in a positive way. And others have said here tonight, and just to remind people that we are not the first to use tax cuts to move this economy forward, Ronald Reagan did it in the 1980s, and this economy grew by leaps and bounds. And President John F. Kennedy did it in the 1960s, cut taxes to spur this economy on, and that is what we need to do. 
   As I said, there are millions of Americans out there today that are depending on these tax rates to stay low. There are millions of small businesses which are the backbone of this economy that are counting on us keeping these tax cuts in place. There are millions of small businesses and farmers in this country hoping that we will extend the death tax so that they can plan for their future, so they can do the financial planning necessary because the alternative is it will expire at the end of 2010. The alternative is, if you cannot plan properly for expansion, for the future, you certainly do not want to die so that your family gets that tax, the tax break that we put in place. 
   So this is extremely important, as I said, to Americans across the spectrum, across this Nation from Arizona to Pennsylvania to Washington to Florida. I know millions of Americans, actually 10.6 Americans, low-income Americans, that are not paying taxes at all today because of the tax cuts we put into place in 2001 and 2003. 
   As we have been talking about for the last month this countdown to the tax increase, 1,419, dies, if Mr. Davis will put that chart back up, not the chart but our e-mail address. We have the CountdownCrew@mail.house.gov. We would love to hear from across this country how Americans have utilized these tax cuts, whether it is the child tax credit, whether it is the accelerated depreciation or any of the decreases in the marginal income tax rates. If you have utilized the Tax Code in a positive way, we want to hear about that. We want to be able to talk about that on the House floor. 
   One story that I have, back in central Pennsylvania, Dr. Greg Pyle is the president of Oil Surgery Associates. His practices are in Bedford County and Blair County, Pennsylvania, which are in the Ninth Congressional District of Pennsylvania. He has seen steady growth over the past 10 years, some of the most impressive growth being in small Bedford County. It is about 45,000. According to Dr. Pyle, medical practices usually plateau financially from 5 to 8 years. However, Dr. Pyle's medical partnership, which has been in business for 12 years, has seen some of  its greatest growth just in the past couple of years. He attributes that directly to the reduction in taxes and that people have more money in their pocket that they can come in and utilize his services that he provides to them in central Pennsylvania. 
   Again, we have many, many other stories, but I just want at this point to yield back to my good friend from Kentucky (Mr. Davis).

   Mr. SHUSTER. I appreciate that. You made a very important point about the minimum wage. I think you and I both voted at the end of the last Congress to increase the minimum wage, but it failed in the Senate. It was not able to get through in the Senate. 
   What is happening here today is that our friends on the other side, they stand up on the House floor and claim that they have raised the minimum wage when, in fact, all they have done is pass it in the House. It is not law yet. It takes both bodies to pass it. 
   Thank goodness for the United States Senate. They are putting back in those tax cuts for small business. They are absolutely critical for small businesses.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I agree with you on that. 
   There is a small amusement park in my district, Lakelawn Park, and I was talking to the general manager of Lakelawn Park, and he told me the increase in the minimum wage is going to cost him between $130,000 to $150,000 to the bottom line, and what they employ are mainly high school kids in the summertime to run those rides. He said that kids starting out at minimum wage, if they had been there for a period of time they certainly make more than that.     
   But without any kind of tax decrease or other kind of tax benefit, that is going to cost them $130,000. It is going to cause him to hire less kids to work in the summer because he is not going  to be able to afford that kind of hit to his bottom line. So we passed it here in the House, we know, and unfortunately the national news media, unlike in 1995 when the Republicans took control, I remember it well. The first 100 days, every time the Republicans would pass something the national news media was quick to point out, Well, they haven't done anything yet, they just passed the House. 
   And that is all that happened here in the first 100 hours, is we passed the House. Minimum wage has not gone up. It will go up with probably a lot of Republican votes if the Senate comes through with the tax measures that they proposed. And I know the House, Johnny-come-lately to the tax cut for small businesses, we are going to hopefully pass something here this week to offer some of those tax cuts, but not near enough what small businesses need. Our small business owners are out there every day creating jobs, meeting payrolls, working long hours, and giving back to the community. 
   The community I come from, when you look at who are the people that are contributing to the charities and the different civic organizations, it is the small business owner, giving back to its community to make it a better place to live. So I think it is so important that we put tax breaks in, we make the ones permanent that we passed in 2001 and 2003. 
   And I just have another story of a small business owner from my district, Greg Rothman with RSR Realty in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, which is Carlisle, Pennsylvania, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He has seen a massive increase in his business due to the economic policies that were put in place over the last several years. The lower tax burden has trickled down, and houses are being sold and houses are being built, more attractive for the consumers to buy throughout Pennsylvania, and especially in central Pennsylvania in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, and employment rate is about 3.3, 3.4, 4 percent, one of the lowest in the State. 
   Reductions in capital gains tax have allowed many empty nesters to enter the housing market to buy homes, to improve what they are living in, or downsize into nicer places. It has helped his realty business grow. And since becoming a partner in RSR realty in 1999, Greg has seen it grow from 20 Realtors to 60, which is an increase of 40 jobs in about the past 7 or 8 years. And it is these economic policies that we have put in place that have caused this to happen; and Greg said that he has seen the highest sales volume since he has entered the industry. 
   And I think that is important to tell those kinds of stories. Those are real people; those are real jobs. And I want to remind people that we would like to hear those kinds of stories; we want to hear from all across America. At the countdowncrew@mail.house.gov, you can send us in that story, your success story, and how you utilized those tax cuts that have been put in place in the early 2000s and why we need to keep them in place. So we would love to hear stories from business people, small, medium-sized, and large all around the country. We certainly would appreciate that. 
   At this time I will yield back to the gentleman from Kentucky.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. I appreciate that. And I think the point you made is worth repeating, because I know you and I believe this and many of our colleagues believe this, especially on this side of the aisle, that government doesn't create jobs. We can only create  an environment to give people the opportunity to create jobs, small entrepreneurs and business people across this country. And our fiscal problems in this country, our financial problems with the government, isn't that the government taxes too little. It is that we spend entirely too much. And I know the coming weeks, I know especially the new Members of Congress are going to be put to the test to stand up and be accounted for, because there are many people who say that America voted for a change in November, and they did. 
   But I know there is nobody in the Ninth Congressional District and nobody that I have come across as I travel this country that wanted to change from a lower tax system to higher taxes. Nobody wants to do that. And our goal is, in the Countdown Crew, to make the American people aware that the Democrats don't have to do anything; they can run out the clock, and on January 1, 2011, they will have the largest tax increase in American history, over $200 billion. And I believe it is our duty to make sure that we are talking about it so that the American people know what the majority intends to do by changing the rules on their first couple of days of Congress from a three-fifths majority to a simple majority to raise taxes, they have made it a lot easier to raise taxes. 
   They put PAYGO into place which only deals with new spending, and it really does nothing to address the deficits we have today. So PAYGO really should be TAXGO, because that is what the American people are going to see. 
   So, again, we urge you to e-mail us at countdowncrew@mail.house.gov, because we want to hear your stories about how you have put those tax cuts into use to create jobs and make America a more prosperous place.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHUSTER. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. I appreciate the gentleman yielding me time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise with great concern and in opposition to H.R. 1401. 
   I think there are many provisions in this bill that are positive, that will enhance security, but I am concerned about the strategy as we move forward. Do we have one to move forward, spending billions of dollars? 
   In addition, there are a couple of provisions in this bill, section 124, which would require carriers to ship along the most secure routes. That sounds good, but when you put in there shipping along these routes without concern for safety, you may decide that when you look at what may be to some secure, you have serious safety considerations, whether the track is safe or what the weather is going to be like, and what is the first responder capabilities? Those are things that we have to consider when we are deciding on which route to take different shipments. 
   Also, the background checks. Section 120, I believe, weakens the background checks and it appears to me may pressure private industry to hire people, hire felons that we don't want working on the rail system that could further jeopardize our security. 
   The whistleblower protection. I believe it already affords adequate whistleblower protection for our workers. Keeping it under its current law under the Federal Rail Administration I believe is much better than moving it over to the Department of Labor. The Department of Labor hasn't had the experience in working with rail and rail labor, where the FRA has great experience. So I think we need to leave it there instead of moving it to an agency that, as I said, has no experience. 
   Most importantly, I rise today to oppose the manager's amendment. For decades, the Federal policy has given the U.S. Department of Transportation preeminent jurisdiction over rail safety under the Federal Railroad Safety Act. Section 3 of the manager's amendment would destroy that Federal preemption.     
   Under current law, States may enact safety laws as long as they address unique local safety hazards. 
   As I said, section 3 of the manager's amendment will change all of that. This would balkanize our rail system and subject railroads to a hodgepodge of State and local regulations. Railroads could face different rules every time they crossed a State or county or municipal border. Imagine, 50 States, 50 different jurisdictions, or more, when you talk about the different counties in America. And they could regulate on braking systems, the number of people on the trains, and the types of trains that we use or the tracks we use. In fact, in California there are proposals out there that they want to change the track standards, they want to change the types of locomotives. 
   This is going to destroy the efficiency of the national rail system that we have created, a successful one over 20 or so years. And I repeat, this is not a security issue. It does not belong in this bill. And I hope the chairman of the full committee joins me in opposing this manager's amendment because rail safety belongs in a rail safety bill, which the subcommittee is going to take up. So I urge my colleagues to oppose the manager's amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise today with great respect for the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner and all the people that they represent. But I strongly oppose both this rule and the underlying resolution. 
   The resolution we are considering today is, pure and simple, a power grab. There is no way I can support a resolution that dilutes the rights of the hardworking people of western and central Pennsylvania, and there is no reason they should support representatives that have their rights diluted. 
   The Democratic scheme tramples on the Constitution and the design of one man, one vote. Article I, section 2 of the Constitution clearly states the House ``shall be comprised of Members chosen by the people of the several States.'' It does not provide full voting privileges for Delegates representing non-State territories. 
   Plain and simple, this is representation without taxation. This proposal will allow the Democratic Delegates to raise the taxes on the American people, but then they will not have to pay them. 
   I strongly encourage all members of the Pennsylvania delegation to vote against this resolution and protect the rights of the hardworking people of Pennsylvania.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHUSTER. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the first responder  and emergency management reforms in this 9/11 bill. 
   As the past chairman of the emergency management subcommittee, I am very familiar with first responder reforms we enacted since the September 11 attacks. 
   While there are some improvements in this bill, the major 9/11 reforms were made under Republican leadership. Since 9/11, we have provided over $15 billion to prepare State and local first responders. We increased funding for Fire Grants and created the SAFER grant program for hiring firefighters. We also created a billion dollar grant program for emergency communications. 
   Unlike the unfunded authorization in the Democrats' bill, Republican leadership provided real money. But we have done much more than simply throw money at first responders. We also enacted a comprehensive reform bill that rebuilds FEMA's capabilities and establishes a truly national preparedness system. We gave FEMA the authority and the tools they need to manage all disasters. We strengthened FEMA's regions, response teams, logistics, and communications capabilities. We established a national preparedness goal and set clear preparedness standards for State and local governments to coordinate their resources and focus on their highest risk priorities. 
   We established a national incident command system so that all levels of government can integrate their forces in a disaster. We created a comprehensive training and exercise program so first responders will be ready when the next big disaster strikes. And we created a comprehensive assessment and lessons-learned program so that first responders won't make the same mistakes again. 
   Unlike the bill before us, we made these reforms through a series of committee hearings and markups with bipartisan support. While the press releases are going to claim that this bill implements all of 9/11 Commission recommendations, the reality is that the vast majority of legislative changes were made under Republican leadership. 
   This is no more than window dressing. It is not good policy; it is politics.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHUSTER. (TAX INCREASES -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, it is certainly an honor to be here on the House floor, and it is a great opportunity to follow the Blue Dogs tonight, that coalition on the Democratic side that are talking about fiscal responsibility, because that is what I want to also talk about tonight. It is an extremely important issue. It is a pocketbook issue. And one I didn't hear mentioned too frequently by my friends in the Blue Dog Coalition has to deal with taxes and what we are responsible for here in Washington, which is spending, and also making sure we are not reaching too deep in the pockets of the American people and spending their money. 
   Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned that the American people are unaware of what is going to happen here in Congress in the next 4 years. There is a countdown. The countdown begins. It is 1,452 days, and we will see over that period of time the tax cuts that we put in place as a Republican majority, they will expire. So the American people, over the next 4 years, will see a $200 billion tax increase, money that will be taken out of their pockets. 
   The Democratic majority doesn't even have to act. They can just run out the clock. I am not sure the American people realize that, that if the Democrats don't act to extend these tax breaks, that they will see this $200 billion tax increase occur, as I said between today and January 1, 2011. As I said, I appreciate the Blue Dogs coming here and talking about fiscal responsibility, but unless they act and they join with the Republicans to see these extended, that is what the American people face. 
   What do these tax cuts mean? They mean that over the last 4 years we have seen 7.2 million jobs created in this country because of those tax cuts. Just in the month of December, 167,000 jobs were created in this country. The unemployment rate in this country is down to 4.5 percent. That is the lowest average it has been in four decades, and that is directly attributable to the tax cuts that we passed over the last 4, 5, or 6 years in this Congress. Again, if we don't extend them, if we don't do the responsible thing and let the American people keep more of their money, there will be dollars taken out of their pockets. 
   Now, what has happened with those tax cuts is that the American people have gotten to keep more of their hard-earned dollars. The American people, from Pennsylvania, to Arkansas, to California, to Arizona get to keep their money in their pockets and get to decide how that money is going to be spent. It is not going to be spent in Washington by bureaucrats. When you get $2,000 or $4,000 more in your pocket a year because of these tax cuts, you decide whether you will use it as a downpayment on a car, save the money for your children's college education, or buy a new washer and dryer or refrigerator for your home. These are the things the American people want to be able to purchase, and they can do it with these tax cuts.  
   As I said, I am very, very concerned that we are going to see this $200 billion tax increase if we don't move forward to expand that. We had four major tax relief packages since 2001. We cut taxes on the American taxpayer in every walk of life. Across the board, every American has benefited by this. We eliminated the marriage penalty tax. We stopped penalizing people in this country for being married. We should be encouraging that in America: marriage. We doubled the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000. If we don't act to extend that, that will be cut in half over the next 4 years. 
   We removed 10.6 million low-income Americans from paying taxes all together. People are not paying taxes because we lowered those tax rates. We lowered tax rates on our small businesses and employers. 
   I know every single district in this country has numerous small businesses. It is the backbone of the American economy. And we have cut taxes for those people in small business, and they have been able to take that money and reinvest it in their businesses and their employees. I know full well because before I came to Congress I didn't serve in the State legislature, I wasn't a trial attorney, I was a small business owner, and I worked to employ between 30 and 40 people. I know what it is like to meet a payroll, and I know what that burden is like to have to pay crushing taxes. I know what it is like to make sure my bills are being paid every month. 
   So as a small business owner, I know firsthand. As a family man, as a father of two children, and a daughter that will go to Penn State University next year, I know it is important to save for college. Every American wants to save money to help their children get educated. As I said, I think it is extremely important that we here in Congress act responsibly to keep those tax cuts in place and there is record revenue coming into Congress. 
   I hope that the Democrats will take a lesson from history, from one of their own, Jack Kennedy, in the 1960s. President Kennedy did the right thing. He cut taxes. What happened? Revenues increased to the government. What happened in 1980, when Ronald Reagan did the same thing? He cut taxes and revenues increased to the Federal Government. And we did that again in 2001 and 2003. And what happened? History has repeated itself. Revenues are at the highest levels that they have ever been to the Federal Government. 
   So once again, I am absolutely committed, and we are going to be coming to the House floor week after week talking to the American people, reminding them that if the Democrats do not act, do not aggressively pursue the extension of these taxes that the American people will be penalized. 
   And I think that here in this next hour I am going to be joined by many of my colleagues who want to stand up and talk about this. And the folks coming down to the floor, most of them, if not all of them, are former small business owners or still own small businesses and have families and raised families, so they can talk to the issues that we are here talking about tonight: what it 
   means to get $2,000 more a year in your pocket, or $4,000 or $5,000, or have lower tax rates, if you are running a business. 
   I will now invite some of my colleagues up, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Davis). I yield to him.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee and would just point out that, as the gentleman said, he is a father, and I understand that he was a hospital manager before he started his own business. So he knows firsthand what it is like to be out there meeting a payroll, facing the tax burden of this country. So I really appreciate not only that you are here in Congress and you bring a commonsense, a small business owner's perspective to the legislative process, but you are here tonight talking about these issues that are going to be vital to not only people in Tennessee and Pennsylvania but across this country. Every American is concerned about their tax bill. 
   It was interesting, the Blue Dogs were down here talking this evening earlier and they said America voted for a change. America did vote for a change, I believe. But I don't believe that I heard anybody in America, at least not in my congressional district in Pennsylvania, or across Pennsylvania, who said they wanted to vote for higher taxes. I am very concerned. 
   As you mentioned, they changed the rules. We had the rules in place where we had to have a three-fifths majority to pass tax increases. They have reduced that to a simple majority. That obviously means they need only 218 votes. The Blue Dogs were talking tonight there are between 40 and 50 members of the Blue Dogs. I hope they hang with us as we try to push the agenda to keep the American taxpayers, keep the American people with those tax cuts in place. 
   Again, Mr. Davis, thank you very much for coming down tonight.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman from Texas. And when you talk, I think a lot of folks here in Congress, I think, forget about the stories that you talk about, the plumber who starts out with a truck and all of a sudden he has enough business, he buys two trucks, then three trucks. And that is what small business in America has been doing over the last couple of decades. That is where most of the jobs are created in this country, in small business by that plumber or that person who has an idea that works hard and puts together a plan and goes to the bank and borrows some money. And I know when I first went into business back in 1990, I bought an existing business, borrowed a lot of money, went into debt, worked hard. And something that I learned in college in accounting is that cash and profits aren't the same thing. And a lot of people, I think they say, and I realized that lesson, I learned it in accounting, but it really didn't make an impact on me until my first year I had a profit in business and thought, oh my goodness. We had a great year. And then I realized that I had to pay this tax bill, but all my cash was tied up in my inventory and improving the physical plant and doing things to make business continue to grow. But I didn't have the cash. So I had to keep the debt up; had to figure out how to get that money to pay taxes. So it really puts a tremendous burden on small business when you have a high tax burden. 
   And, as you pointed out, American business, small business, is really the backbone of this country. So I appreciate the fact that you are another small business owner and that you, like myself, didn't serve in the legislature before, and you bring that perspective of a small business owner, of a business owner of someone that has been out there meeting payrolls and creating jobs in this economy. 
   It is now my pleasure to yield to another great Texan, Mr. Conaway, from Texas, who is the resident CPA in the House tonight. So I am sure we can learn a few lessons from him. So with that, Mr. Conaway, thank you.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas. I think you bring up a very good point on the spending side. As you know, as an accountant, anybody that has been in business, two sides to the income statements, there is revenues and costs. 
   Costs are important. You have to control your costs. You can't spend more than you bring in. Of course, we have done that over the last couple of years, because we are at war, we have seen a recession. But the revenue side is equally important, and there are two ways to do it in the Federal Government. We have found that you can increase taxes, which gives you increased revenue for a while, but eventually the economy turns down, and then revenues go down; or you can do as Jack Kennedy, President Kennedy, did in 1960, Ronald Reagan did in the 1980s and we did in the early 2000s, we cut taxes and revenues grew. There are record levels of revenue coming into the Federal Government. 
   Don't listen to BILL SHUSTER about how it works when you cut taxes. Look at the record, look at the history record, and you will see it is quite clear. 
   You mentioned the death tax, yes. The gentleman has another point to make.

   Mr. SHUSTER. That is a great point. It is great to have people like you in Congress to bring that common sense and know what it is like, and what really happens when prices go up and taxes go up and the response you get from people. 
   You also mentioned that January 1, 2011, the death tax expires. You also have the capital gains tax will expire January 1, 2009. The taxes on dividends will increase January 1, 2009. I think it is record numbers of American people that have investments in the stock market through their mutual funds. Over 60 percent of America has invested. Folks that are getting dividends from those investments are going to be taxed at higher rates. 
   We are going to again lose the child credit that will be cut in half over the next couple of years, the marriage tax, the penalty will be put back in place. Low-income taxpayers will go from that 10 percent tax bracket up to 15 percent tax bracket if we don't act. 
   Just to remind the American people that are watching tonight, it is 14,052 days in the countdown for the Democrat tax increase. They don't have to act. All they have to do is sit on the clock, run out the clock. When it runs out, we are going to see over the next 4 years a $200 billion tax increase. 
   Another thing you mentioned about job increases, I saw over the last 6 years, one of the sectors in the economy that saw one of the larger increases percentage-wise in jobs was the government, and over 4 percent increase in government jobs. You know, we see that in other sectors of our economy. We have seen many of them increase double digits, but that is one that was discouraging to me to see the Federal Government, when we were at these times when we were trying to cut spending. We need to cut some of that and curtail some of these government jobs.

   Over the last 4 or 5 years, 6 years since I have been in Congress, I haven't seen a budget proposal by the other side that hasn't increased spending significantly, and there are some estimates that in these first 100 hours the proposals that they are putting forth over the next several years are something to the effect of an $800 billion increase in spending. 
   Again I think it is quite clear what the Democrats intend to do. We need to stay together as Republicans and join together with the Blue Dogs to fight that.

They were talking about fiscal responsibility tonight; they have no idea how much it is going to cost. It is going to be a big cost. They all know that. 
   But it is my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. PHIL GINGREY, who I know is an old pro at these Special Orders and does a great job. It is something that I think a lot of Americans, myself included, as I was growing up, we tried to put this group together as we talked. We wanted small business people, people from the business background, to be on the floor. 
   When you introduce a guy, Dr. PHIL GINGREY, and say he is a physician, a lot of Americans like myself in my younger days didn't realize a physician is a small business owner. He is a man or a woman who is running a practice. You call them patients, but they are customers. But it is a practice, and it is a business. 
   You have to meet a bottom line, and you have to do what many do, the plumber, the car dealer or the computer business operator, you are meeting that bottom line and making sure it is profitable.

But if they still aren't sure about it, I have got just a couple of quotes here.  
   The incoming chairman of the Ways and Means Committee told Bloomberg News that he cannot think of one of the tax cuts passed under President George Bush that merits renewal. He also told the Congressional Daily when he was asked whether he considered tax increases across the income spectrum, and his quote was, ``No question about it.'' He said, ``Everything has to be on the table.'' ``Everything'' would mean repealing the 10 percent low income tax bracket, the child tax credit I talked about, the marriage penalty, all of which was passed in 2001 and, of course, the death tax. And my good friend from Texas knows full well what it is going to do to a lot of business owners on Main Street. We are not talking about Wall Street, we are talking about Main Street America and in the farms of the Midwest. 
   So with that, I yield to my good friend from Texas.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee.  
   Our time is running out, but I want to just talk about a real world experience. There is a family, Mr. and Mrs. Smith living in my hometown of Hollidaysburg or maybe even Youngstown, Ohio, or a small town in Florida or California; that person, Mr. and Mrs. Smith making $40,000 combined income, if these tax cuts are allowed to expire, they are going to pay about $2,100 more in taxes a year. And there are some people in this country who may think that $2,100 isn't a lot of money; but for that family struggling in Youngstown, Ohio, $2,100 a year, if you put $2,100 in the bank every year, at 5 percent interest return on that $2,100 and you invested it every year for 10 years, that turns into over $30,000. That is a good nest egg for that family to put their son or daughter through college or pay a good chunk of that if you are going to a great State school. So these things are serious, they are real life, and I just want to thank all the Members who came down here tonight who come from, whether it is a home care business, as Mr. Davis, or CPA or Mr. Neugebauer being a builder and a developer, myself running an automobile dealership, people just like us all across America that have to be concerned about what is going to happen here in the next 2 years. And all Americans need to understand that they have to talk to their Members of Congress and put the pressure on them to make sure that these tax cuts stay in place so that the American people can keep more of their hardearned dollars in their pockets and they can spend it as they see fit and not send it here to Washington, D.C. to be spent by faceless, nameless bureaucrats in many of these agencies.

   In 1,349 days, if we don't act, we are going to see the largest tax increase in American history. And this is coming about because the tax cuts, the tax reductions that we put in place as a Republican majority in 2001, 2003, extended some of those in 2005, they are going to expire. And the majority party doesn't have to act. All they have to do is run the clock out, and those tax increases will go into effect on the American people. The American family, small businesses, all around this country are going to feel the pain. 
   As I said, my friends and I have been, colleagues and I have been coming to the floor for the past few months talking about this, making sure that the American people are aware that this is going to occur. 
   And I have heard some folks on the other side of the aisle say that they are not going to vote for a tax increase, thus it is not really a tax increase. Only in Washington do we employ that type of rationale, that type of logic. 
   If we don't act, there is going to be a tax increase. And for the American people, who have just paid their taxes this year, and when they go to pay their taxes in 2008 and 2009 and 2010, they are going to see that their taxes have increased. Although there wasn't necessarily a vote on the House floor to specifically increase those taxes, those tax cuts expiring are, in effect, and, in fact, going to increase their taxes. 
   What kind of tax increase are we talking about? First of all, raising, from the 10 percent tax bracket to 15 percent. And more than 5 million individuals and families previously who owed no taxes will become subject to those individual income taxes in 2011, if we don't act on the House floor. If the Democratic majority doesn't act, the Democratic majority will be responsible for raising taxes on people in the lower-income levels in this country. 
   It will eliminate the marriage penalty relief that we put in place in the early 2000s. By 2011, 23 million taxpayers would see their taxes increase an average of $466 just because they are married.  
   Cutting the child tax credit in half: if we don't extend those, if we don't vote on this House floor before 2011, 31 million taxpayers will see their taxes increase an average of $859 in 2011. 
   The AMT tax, if we don't act, if we don't do something that rectifies that situation, we are going to see people across America that have, husband and wife that earn an income, two families, for instance, teachers, we are going to see a husband and wife that are both teachers in the coming years, if they already haven't been affected by it, they are going to be hit with the AMT and pay higher taxes if we don't act. 
   An elderly couple, for instance, in America, a senior couple making $40,000 in income, this couple will, their tax bill would raise in 2011, from $583 to $1,489. And for a retired couple making $40,000, that almost $1,000 increase is a huge burden on them. We have got to make sure that that doesn't happen. 
   A family of four with an income of $60,000: that family's income tax bill would raise, from $3,030 to $4,898, almost $5,000 in 2011 if we don't act. And I know that families in my district, that is a typical family, a family of four, $60,000 of income, two people working. That is a huge burden. 
   And for people across America, we have been calling ourselves the Countdown Crew, and we have an e-mail that we would like you to share your stories with us on what the tax cuts have done for you, and what, for instance, a family, again, of four, $60,000 if you have to pay about $1,800, almost $1,900 more in income, $2,000 more in taxes, how is that going to affect your family. So we would like for you to share those stories with us. You can e-mail us at the countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. I will get that up here in just a minute and you can see it. But, again, that is countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. And share those stories with us because we want to hear, we want to be able to have those stories to talk about how it is going to affect, as I said, a typical American household. 
   A single parent with two children, a woman who has got two children, $30,000 in earnings, she would, that parent qualifies at present to get about $2,400 back from the Federal Government. But if the tax cuts are allowed to expire, she is going to have to pay an $800 tax. That is a $3,200 swing from receiving $2,400 from the Federal Government to having to pay almost $800 in taxes. Families, individuals are going to be hardest hit, small businesses, unless we act. 
   Just to give you a brief rundown of the numbers on what is going to happen if the Democratic majority doesn't act and increases taxes, 115 million, taxpayers would see their taxes increase an average of $1,795 in 2011. 
   Eighty-three million women would see their taxes raise an average of $2,068 if the Democratic majority doesn't act. 
   Forty-eight million married couples will incur an average tax increase of almost $2,900. Taxes would increase an average of $2,181 for 42 million families with children. Twelve million single women with children would see their taxes increase an average of just over $1,000. Seventeen million elderly individuals would incur average tax increases of $2,270. And it goes on and on and on. 
   As I said, only in Washington, only in our Nation's Capital is the logic employed that says, if we don't vote on a tax increase, it is not really a tax increase. But I know and millions of Americans know that if they paid $5,000 in taxes one year and they pay $6,000 in another year, then that is an increase in taxes. So we need to make sure that we are honest and open with the American people and realize what these tax cuts have done. 
   This economy, which is growing, has grown each year for 21 straight quarters, I believe the last number was. We are creating jobs. We have created, in the last 4 years, 7.5 million jobs. Unemployment is at a 4.4 percent unemployment rate.     
   I have a county in my district that has a 2.8 percent unemployment rate. That is incredible, 2.8 percent. I was under the belief that full employment is when you have 97 percent of the people working, or close to 97 percent of the people, because you are always going to have folks transitioning and moving around; but I have got actually two counties that are under 3 percent. And as I said, this economy is growing because of those tax cuts. 
   It comes as no surprise to me, it should come as no surprise to millions of Americans, it should come as no surprise to my friends on the other side of the aisle, that when you cut taxes, the economy grows. When you cut taxes, also the revenues to the Federal Government increase. 
   And my friends on the other side of the aisle don't have to take my word for it. Go back to the 1960s when President John F. Kennedy cut taxes on the American people. And what happened? The economy grew and revenues grew coming into the Federal Government. In the 1980s Ronald Reagan cut taxes on the American people and American businesses and the economy grew and revenues grew coming into the Federal Government. And in 2000, once again history repeats itself. When you cut taxes, as we did, the Republican majority did, when you cut taxes, the economy grows, jobs are created, and we have seen record revenues coming into the Federal Government. In 2005 the revenues to the Federal Government grew by 14.5 percent, and last year, in 2006, they were over 11 percent growth in revenues to the Federal Government. 
   We have got to make sure that the American people are keeping more of their hard-earned dollars, not sending them to Washington, but that we are sending them back home. But in Washington we have to make sure that we are spending responsibly, and we are trying to balance the budget and we are working towards that and working in such a way that the budget is going to be balanced, and we have been working towards that in the last 4 or 5 years. 
   And I know that the Democratic majority, they talk about fiscal responsibility, but one of the first things they did was to change the rules of the House so that there was no longer a three-fifths majority needed to increase taxes. It is now a simple majority, and they can increase your taxes. 
   They have come out with a budget just last week, or 2 weeks ago, I guess, we passed a budget, and they make it seem like it is responsible, but a lot of things in that budget just don't add up. The PAYGO rule is something that, quite frankly, is difficult to understand. And I am privileged to have a colleague of mine on the House floor, a colleague of mine from Texas (Mr. Conaway), who is, first of all, on the Budget Committee, so he understands the complicated budgetary process that we face here in the Federal Government. But, more importantly, he is a CPA. He is a certified public accountant. So he understands the balance sheet, he understands the income statement, he understands not only that of a business, the government, but of the average American family and what it takes to balance a budget at home, in a business, and here in the Federal Government. 
   So with that, I would like to yield to my good friend from Texas to talk a little bit about the PAYGO rules and the budget and explain to the American people what is going to happen here in the next couple of months, weeks, and years in the United States. 
   With that I yield to Mr. Conaway.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman. I appreciate you coming down and talking about the budget because I know you understand it; but as I said earlier, more importantly as a CPA, you really understand what the Tax Code means to individual businesses and families. 
   In fact, just last week I had a conversation, I would say it was an unfortunate conversation with my CPA as we went through my tax returns and had to pay taxes, as millions and millions of people across this country had to do. 
   I know the gentleman said he had one more point to make.

   Mr. SHUSTER. That ATM which I mentioned earlier and this conversation I have had over the past couple of weeks with my accountant, he is seeing married couples, both husband and wife are teachers, and they are real close to getting caught up in that minimum tax. Again, two teachers making a decent living, and they are getting caught up in a tax code that is increasing their taxes. We need to address that. 
   As I said, talking to my accountant last week, as millions of Americans had, to fill out the paperwork and write checks to pay their taxes, it is a yearly ritual that is unavoidable. The government has made this an incredibly complicated process to go through. Not only does it seem we are ignoring the need to extend these tax cuts so Americans pay less, but we are ignoring the fact we need to reform our Tax Code to make it simpler. 
   I recently read an article by John Stossel from ABC, and he wrote in 2005 Americans spent 6.4 billion hours complying with the Federal Tax Code. He further stated that a Washington-based group, The Tax Foundation, calculated that that 6.4 billion hours was valued at $265 billion, was what Americans spent on complying with the Tax Code. That is more than the Federal deficit last year. 
   If we could cut that in half, imagine $130 billion going into the economy, our small businesses being able to buy more equipment, employ more people, build a new building, expand their operations; the American family, having $130 billion to buy a new washer and dryer, save for college. What will it do for this economy? We have to make sure we pay attention to that. 
   As we were talking earlier tonight, the Democrat budget put out last week, in Pennsylvania alone it is going to increase taxes by 2009 on the average Pennsylvanian by over $3,000. We hope that people will e-mail us at countdowncrew@mail.house.gov and let us know what $3,000 would mean to your family, how important that would be, that you would have that $3,000 to spend, instead of sending it to Washington. 
   As we keep pointing out, by 2011, if we don't act, the Democrat majority is going to increase taxes by almost $400 billion. It will be the largest tax increase in American history. I haven't been able to document this, but I think it is probably the largest tax increase in the history of the world. The American people need to understand that. That is the sad reality. We are taxing too much. We have got to make sure that we in Washington are making this government work efficiently and not wasting their money, but making sure that they continue to keep more of their hard-earned dollars. 
   Next Monday night is going to be Tax Freedom Day, April 30 this year. That means Americans will, after April 30th, starting May 1, will be able to start working for themselves. The first 4 months of the year they have been working to pay their taxes, and on May first they work for themselves.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I appreciate the gentleman for pointing that out. 
   As I said, next Monday night, April 30, Tax Freedom Day, Americans will begin to start working for themselves. In 2003, Tax Freedom Day was April 18. We have slowly grown to April 30. It will be even longer than that if this Congress doesn't act. The percentage the Federal Government is going to take from people will grow. People will earn less. As I said earlier, the average Pennsylvanian, and there are 4.7 million Pennsylvanians that will pay taxes, on average that tax will go up by $3,000. 
   So we hope the American people communicate with us at countdowncrewÐ@mail.house.gov and let us know what they could do with that $3,000, as well as over the past 4 or 5 years what it has meant to them, whether it is their family, whether it is a small business, how they have been able to utilize those tax cuts in expanding their business and saving for their children's future. These are extremely important matters that this Congress has to address. 
   As we started off saying, in 1,349 days, if we don't act, if the U.S. Congress doesn't act, there is going to be the largest tax increase in American history. 
   So I appreciate the gentleman from Texas. I don't know if you have anything else to add. If not, I will yield back the time. I know some of our other colleagues have come to the floor here to talk about important things.  
   But we want to make sure the American people know what is going to happen if the flawed logic is employed that if we don't vote on a tax increase, it is not really a tax increase, when in fact if people pay more money, that is a tax increase. The American people need to know that. 
   I appreciate my colleague coming down to the floor tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHUSTER. (TAKING RESPONSIBLE ACTION FOR COMMUNITY SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am very, very disappointed to be here today speaking on this bill. The TRACS Act is much too controversial to be considered under suspension. I wrongly believed that we had an understanding with the majority that we would continue to work in a bipartisan manner to improve this bill before we brought it to the floor. That is very unlike, very uncharacteristic of the T&I Committee. We did have one hearing. We had no subcommittee hearings. As I said, that is not characteristic of the Transportation Committee and how it works. So it is disappointing to me to bring this bill here under those circumstances. 
   I oppose H.R. 6707 because I am concerned that changing the Surface Transportation Board's merger and acquisition review process could have unintended consequences of hampering the growth of our Nation's railroad industry. I know that the folks who serve on the committee know how important it is that we expand the capacity of the railroad industry in this country. 
   One of the ways to do that is through mergers and acquisitions. It is an important part of how the industry has to grow and needs to grow because it allows railroads to invest in underutilized trackage around the country. 
   Some on the other side have complained that the class 1 railroads have given up track around the country. I believe they have, and they did it because they were not profitable. But here we have a situation where they are trying to use trackage that will be important to increasing capacity in this country. 
   This bill is likely to have a chilling effect on rail transactions. We are living in an increasingly difficult economic climate, and the last think that we want to do is discourage investment that will improve capacity, and especially in Chicago. Anybody that ships across this country knows that Chicago is the most congested area in the country. It is a bottleneck and it is not only a bottleneck in the upper Midwest, it is a bottleneck to the entire system because so much of our freight goes through Chicago. 
   The port of Seattle, 70 percent of what comes into the port of Seattle flows through to Chicago. So I think Americans need to realize how important Chicago is to the shipment of goods in this country. 
   In the next 20 to 25 years, we expect rail demand to increase 90 percent over today's level, and the industry will need to invest $135 billion in infrastructure just to keep pace with this unprecedented growth. We cannot afford to discourage this investment, and I believe the TRACS Act will do just that. 
   It is also very troubling that this legislation will be retroactive because we are creating a new standard of review for deals reached years ago. This type of retroactive congressional action can, and I believe will, undermine confidence in our regulatory system and deserves much more scrutiny than we have given it. 
   This bill was introduced to kill a single merger, and this has generated significant controversy in the Chicago area, which as I said, is one of the most congested areas in the country. But it will also affect, I believe, all future rail mergers in this country. 
   I am unconvinced that this bill will even accomplish the goals of the Chicago community, to stop CN purchasing the EJ&E line. I understand that CN will spend an astounding $25 million to review the environmental impacts of their acquisition of the EJ&E line. They are offering at least $40 million to offset negative impacts of an increase in train traffic in that area and on that line. 
   But there is nothing in the bill that would prevent the current owner, EJ&E, from running additional trains over those tracks. If the CN deal falls through, the increase in traffic may very well happen. And the $40 million that CN is offering to mitigate the effects, will be off the table. If that turns out, that the $45 million is off the table, that CN is not going to put that the money into the deal, it would be very troubling for those communities. 
   But the STB today has the authority to increase from $40 million to $45 million, to mitigate those problems that they believe will occur. But if it goes too high, it also likely will kill the deal. 
   I am sympathetic to the needs of the communities that are affected by the deal. There are two sides, and I am sorry that we haven't heard much more from the communities that will be affected in a positive way. We hear from the suburbs, the wealthy and upper middle-class suburbs of Chicago that are fighting this, but we haven't heard from the inner city of Chicago where low-income folks will see train traffic decrease so they won't have to deal with the freight trains as much as they do today. 
   I am not in a position to judge whether this transaction should go forward. That is not Congress's job. It is the STB's job. The STB was not brought into this process in drafting the bill. The chairman of the STB and his staff have warned of serious concerns about the affects of this. We need  more involvement and input from the STB before we change the rules of the game. 
   Again, I am very disappointed we are here today. I hope we can defeat this and go back to committee and produce a bill that has broad, bipartisan agreement. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I would like to yield myself 30 seconds just to respond to what the gentleman mentioned about the automotive industry and the $25 billion loan they want and about the $700 billion. 
   Well, the good news in this debate today about the railroad industry is that the railroad doesn't need it. The railroad industry is successful, and we need to make sure that they continue to be successful and that they don't require any kind of assistance from the Federal Government. They're the only freight rail system in the world that doesn't require the Federal Government's propping it up. So that's a good news story here today, and that's what we want to keep doing.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHUSTER. (TAKING RESPONSIBLE ACTION FOR COMMUNITY SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Again, I just want to reiterate the reasons that I oppose this bill today. First and foremost, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is a committee that does its homework usually, that works hard to understand the issues and come forth with something that is good legislation, and it's also bipartisan. And I think that in this situation, we're not able to reach that standard that we typically do in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Not bringing in the STB to have them at the table, the experts, to really understand how the nuts and bolts of this legislation going forward is going to have a chilling effect, I believe, on our rail industry. 
   We do have the most efficient, the safest railroad industry in the world. It's the gold standard. Countries around the world look at our rail industry and want to copy it, want to try to have that type of freight industry in their countries. 
   But we in Congress sometimes do our best to try to make it extremely difficult for them to operate, to cause them to put mandates on them that I don't believe serve the best interests of not only communities, but of the rail industry and of our economy. 
   As I said, we have the most efficient and safest rail industry of the world, and we should continue to want to see that so that we don't, down the road 10 years, 15 years, see the rail industry coming to Congress asking them to bail them out. 
   As I said, I believe there are going to be unintended consequences of this bill. There are going to be negative effects on the growth of the railroad industry which we desperately need to see going forward as I talked earlier about the increase and demand for rail. The retroactive provision is going to undermine the confidence in our regulatory system, and it's going to, as I said, have a chilling effect on investments when rail companies in the future want to merge. 
   The CN and EJ&E deal, if it's killed, the increase in traffic can still occur on those lines. The situation is going to be, though, that the EJ&E is not going to have to put $40 million of money into mitigating some of the problems and the increase in traffic. So I think that's going to be bad for those communities. 
   And we can't forget the benefits that decreased congestion in Chicago is going to have on America. And also, most importantly, as I said earlier, we're not hearing from those low-income communities in Chicago that have hundreds of trains going through their neighborhood every week. They are going to see a decrease. That voice of those low-income neighborhoods is not being heard, is not being addressed because that is what is going to happen here. Those neighborhoods will benefit also with a decrease in traffic if we are able to spread out trains to decrease that bottleneck that's occurring in Chicago. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this piece of legislation, and I urge other members of the committee, let's go back to the committee, let's work together and produce something that we can see improvements to the STB that will be a positive for the communities as well as the economy of this country. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, and I want to start today by saying that it's a shame that this Congress and that the majority party, for 18 months, has failed to do anything to alleviate our energy problems in this country. We've had ample opportunity to pass legislation that will deal with this rising cost of energy this country, and as I've said, we've done nothing. The American people are crying out for us to do something. 
   And what we can do, it's obvious, in the short-term it's supply. It's look for new sources of oil, explore in different parts of this country, offshore. That's the answer in the short-term. 
   The long term-we have other technologies, clean coal technology, nuclear energy. We have to start doing something here. The American people, as I said, are crying out. 
   Gas in my district is $4 a gallon. In my 7 years in Congress, I've been approached by people to tell me they disagree with me on this issue or that issue. But I've never had people come up to me and at the gas pump and yell at me publicly about this Congress doing absolutely nothing. 
   The time is now. We have to act. We've already, 7, 15 years ago we should have been acting. But we have to move today. As I said, it's just a shame that we haven't done anything sooner. 
   That being said, I think that this bill that we have before us today, The Passenger Rail Investment Improvement Act, does something positive when it comes to energy in this country. It's a small step. It's a positive step, but it's a step I think it's important for us to take today. 
   The last time that we authorized Amtrak was 1997. Gas was $1.27 a gallon, and today, as I said, in Central Pennsylvania it's hovering around $4 a gallon. 
   We also have, in this country, in 2005, we passed the 300 million mark in population. It took us 65 years to go from 200 million to 300 million. It's only going to take us 35 years to go from 300 million to 400 million. And that population isn't all going to move out into the West and to the middle of the country. That population will move around some, but those corridors around the country that are densely populated, the Northeast Corridor, Chicago, the west coast, throughout Texas, Florida, up and down the east coast, those corridors are going to become even more, the population is going to become denser. 
   So it's important that we do things to encourage people to use other forms of transportation, and passenger rail is one of those modes of transportation. It is one of the, if not the most efficient modes of transportation to move people, move large quantities of people. And I think that that's an extremely important reason for us to move forward. 
   As we watch fuel prices escalate, as we watch the population continue to grow, and as I said, the American people are desperate to escape gas prices, long commutes that define their work days, and I think this is a way for us to move forward. 
   Now, in the bill there are some important provisions, and one of the reasons that myself and the Ranking Member Mica signed on to it, and there are some private sector initiatives. First, we authorize in this bill for Amtrak, the IG and the Department of Transportation to identify the least of the underperforming, significantly underperforming lines in this country; identify at least two of them. That we then turn to the private sector and allow them to bid to take those lines over, and to allow them to run them and see if we can't turn them into efficient operations. 
   The second privatization initiative is to take a line in this country that Amtrak has stopped using, has abandoned because of high cost or whatever reason, and allow the private sector to take it over, re-establish it and run it efficiently and profitably, we hope. 
   And third is the Northeast Corridor. It is the most used corridor in the country. We need to establish high speed rail in this country, and the Northeast Corridor is where we need to do it, from Washington to New York; to get private sector companies to come to the table to give real bids on how much it's going to cost to establish high speed rail in this country. Not pie in the sky, not throwing darts, as we've done over the years, but to have real numbers, if it's $10 billion, $20 billion, $60 billion, how much is it going to cost us to have true high speed which we need in this country, because of the population growth, because of energy costs that we have in this country. 
   High speed rail is extremely important in this authorization. And for the past 20 years we've had a theoretical debate on this floor about can the private sector run a railroad, can the public, is it the public responsibility, and can the public do it better than the private sector? 
   Well, I believe that the private sector can run a passenger rail system. And I just have to look back to history. From 1850 to 1950 the private sector ran a profitable passenger rail system.

   Mr. SHUSTER. For 100 years the private sector operated passenger rail profitably. But what happened to it wasn't mismanagement, it was aviation, the airplane that came about. It was the interstate highway system that we built in this country. So people got off the trains and got into their cars and into airplanes. That's what happened to passenger rail. 
   And for the last 30 some years, as the government's tried to run it, it's not done it efficiently. So this is an opportunity for us to have some real successes, some private sector successes, and we can end this debate. 
   Is the private sector able to run a railroad, a passenger rail system? I believe they are, and I believe that these initiatives are extremely important for us to have some successes to point to as we move down the road and give the American people something they need, a passenger rail system that is profitable, that is successful. 
   And I want to end as I started. We need to do something on energy. This is one small step in the right direction. We can do more to solve our energy problems in this country. We should do more, and we must do more. The American people deserve that.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for hosting this evening's hour, as we count down the tax increase that is going to occur in this country in 1,426 days unless this Congress acts, unless the Democratic majority acts to stop it. 
   I think it is important, you pointed out, that you are a small business owner. I was a small business owner. I know there are many small business owners in Congress. And I think it is important that the American people understand there are people serving in Congress that know what it is like to meet a payroll, to get up and unlock the doors every day and make sure that your business and the people that you employ have a job there. 
   It is extremely difficult to do when the tax burden goes up. And if we do not act, as I said in this Congress, the Democratic majority does not even have to act; it just has to run out the clock. 
   As you mentioned, what we will experience on January 1, 2011, is over a $200 billion tax increase. And that will occur over the next 3, 4 years as tax cuts that we put in place in 2001 and 2003, if they are not extended as you pointed out, that there was a deal made that we had to have them sunset. But we need to make sure that those tax cuts stay in place so that the millions of small business owners and families, hardworking families in this country, get to keep more of that money in their pockets, so that they can go out and spend it or save it for whatever the purposes that they have. 
   You have, I know, six kids. So you know what is coming down the road for you, and college tuition is going to be a lot of money. And for you to be able to save, as millions of hardworking Americans being able to save, that  money is extremely important. My daughter, we just had her at Penn State this weekend. She was accepted there. As we start to look at colleges, you start to realize the expense. It is not just tuition, but kids going away to school, and living expenses. 
   A family in this country of four that make 40, $50,000 a year, if we do not extend those tax cuts, they are going to get a tax increase of about $2,000. $2,000 is a lot of money to hardworking Americans. If you take that $2,000 and invest it in an account that is going to get you 5 percent, a modest 5 percent return, you do that over 10 years, that grows to $30,000. That is a significant nest egg of savings that you can spend on your children's education. 
   It is better that we leave it in the pockets of the American people than to bring it here in Washington and spend it on the array of things that do not make sense to the people back home. It is their money. They worked hard for it. And they should be able to keep most of it and not send it here to Washington. 
   What happened when we cut taxes in 2001 and 2003? Well, over the last 4 years alone, we have created 7.2 million jobs in this country. That is something that is very worthwhile. 
   The unemployment rate is down to 4.5 percent. That is well below what it was in 2005, and on average it is the lowest in four decades. This economy is moving forward. You mentioned that the national media did not cover something very well in the past. Well, this is one of those cases where the national media is not covering the strength of this economy. 
   4.5 percent unemployment is a good number. Creating 7.2 million jobs over the last 4 years is a good number. In December alone, 167,000 jobs were created, in December. We have not got the January numbers, but the estimate is it is going to be in that 150,000 job-creation range. 
   The 7.2 million jobs we have created, that is more jobs than the European Union and Japan combined created in the last couple of years.

   Mr. SHUSTER. And it is no mystery what happens when you cut taxes. And as you mentioned, I heard the same interview you heard on Meet the Press, or Tim Russert's show, I forget what it is called. John Edwards, the 2004 vice presidential candidate for the Democratic Party, said quite matter of factly and calmly that yes, we are going to have to raise taxes; yes, we are going to have to raise taxes to provide a universal health care that is really code for a Federal Government program that is going to take the decision-making process out of the American people's hands, and there is going to be some bureaucrat sitting in some cubicle in Washington deciding what medication you can take or can't take, what procedure you can have or can't have. 
   And I think that we have proven that when you put the forces to work in the marketplace, like we did on Medicare part D, that not only do you give people a choice, but with that choice comes competition and with competition comes the stabilizing and in some cases the decrease of prices. And that is the way we need to move forward, not with a huge tax increase which John Edwards, as I said, I think he had a Walter Mondale moment with Tim Russert saying, oh, sure we are going to increase the taxes. And you know, for a guy who is a multi-millionaire, who I see lives in a multi-million dollar home in North Carolina, it is certainly easy for him to say, well, sure we are going to increase. Now, he says they are going to do it on just the wealthiest. But I think we all know when you increase to get the kind of revenues that he is talking about to fund a huge government run program, it is going to trickle down and the people that are making 50 and $60,000 a year, people in my district, two-income earners, if they are teachers from the Altoona School District, two teachers that have been around 15, 20 years are making $100,000 or better now. And those are the people that are going to get hammered on these tax increases. 
   But back to the point I was making. It is no mystery what happens when you cut taxes. And don't listen to me. Don't listen to George Bush. Don't even listen to Ronald Reagan. Go back in history to when President Kennedy in the sixties when he cut taxes, cut the marginal income tax rate, it spurred the economy on. Revenues to the government increased. And again, that is what happened under Ron Reagan and that is what is happening today under George Bush. Cutting taxes is a positive thing. When you let people keep more money, they spend it. They spend it on what they want to spend it on, which helps to spur the economy on. So once again, don't listen to me, if you are a Democrat. Look at what Jack Kennedy did back in the sixties. I think that is the way we want to move this economy forward.

   Mr. SHUSTER. If the gentleman would yield. I have started to accumulate little stories of people in the ninth Congressional district of Pennsylvania that I represent, what has happened to them over the past several years with these tax cuts. Gregg Rothman, who owns or is partner in RSR Realty in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, which is the county seat, is Carlisle,  Pennsylvania, which is known to many where the War College is and where Jim Thorpe made his name at the Carlisle Indian school. 
   But Gregg Rothman, he became a partner with this firm in 1999. Because of the reductions in the capital gains tax, that has allowed many empty nesters to enter the housing market. It has increased sales and their business has grown tremendously. And, in fact, since 1999 when they went into business, or when he bought into the partnership, they had 20 realtors. Today they have 60, and that is an addition of 40 new jobs of people out in Cumberland County, in central Pennsylvania, working. Creating jobs is what these tax cuts enabled people like Gregg to do. He saw his highest volume of sales since entering the realty business just in the last couple of years. 
   Now I have got another story in my hometown in Everett, Pennsylvania. A couple of young guys started BC Stone several years ago. Travis Collins is the President of that company and he went to high school a couple of years behind me. What they have been able to do is create a tremendous business. In this little town of Everett, Pennsylvania they are selling stone granite tops, marble tops all across the State of Pennsylvania, all across the region, in the mid-Atlantic region. He has grown from 16 employees in 2001 to today he employs 70 people. And that is because this economy is growing. Not only are people building and buying new homes and remodeling them, which helps his business, but he is able 
   to go and buy equipment, modernize what he is doing there and along the way, go from 16 employees to 70 employees in this town of about 2,000 people. And they are good paying jobs. 
   They have been successful enough that they have bought an old hotel, the Union Hotel in downtown Everett, and they are renovating it and going to revitalize it and they hope by 2008 they are going to open up this hotel and restaurant and employ 20 full-time employees. Adding on to the, from the 16 to the 70 and then this new business with 20, and that is all because of this, of the tax cuts we have put into place in early 2000, 2001, 2003 and extended them here a couple of years ago. That is what makes this economy, or helps to make this economy move forward, by letting people keep their own money, by letting entrepreneurs and small business owners and families decide how to spend their money, not the Federal Government. 
   And as you mentioned earlier, your background as a small business owner, your background as a person who has children, who has a family, you know the importance, and it is important for the American people to realize that if this Congress doesn't act in 1,426 days, a $200 billion tax increase is going to occur. And if anybody doubts it, you mentioned earlier, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Congressman Rangel from New York, said quite frequently and quite clearly that all those tax cuts were on the table. He didn't see any of them or many of them that were, that he thought were good or that they were tax cuts that he supported. And, in fact, I don't think he supported any of them, if I am not mistaken. 
   But further than that, the Democratic majority, when they came to Congress, one of the first things they did was to make it easier to raise taxes. They call it PAYGO, which sounds good but really it is TAXGO because what they are going to do is they will ratchet up spending. They will pay for their increase in spending by increased taxes. And so you have PAYGO or TAXGO is what it really should be called. 
   And then they decreased, or they made it easier to raise taxes by going from a three-fourths majority, which the Republicans put in place, because we wanted it to be difficult to raise taxes on the American people. But they changed it from three-fourths to a simple majority. Now, many of the incoming Members on the Democratic side I know ran on a conservative agenda. You know, I want to see how they are going to go back home and tell the people back there that we made it easier to raise taxes on you. They talk about, I know the Blue Dogs come down here and talk about fiscal responsibility and talk about cutting the budget or balancing the budget. But how are they going to do that if they are not willing to make the hard choices on what programs, not just to cut, more importantly to reform the entitlement programs. Reform doesn't necessarily mean cut. It means make them efficient. Make them produce or become more efficient. You get more out of your bang for your buck. You don't have to necessarily cut the programs. But so more and more people can get those programs more efficiently, instead of just raising taxes or slashing benefits. 
   At the end of the day, if you are going to increase spending, I believe this has been very clear by the Speaker and the leadership of the majority party, that they are going to increase spending and they are going to increase your taxes. Why else would you make it easier to pass a tax increase? And that is, again, one of the very, very first things they did when they came into the majority party here. So it is going to be interesting to watch how that plays out with the Blue Dogs and many of the incoming Members that they claim that they are going to be fiscally responsible, that they are going to be conservative, that they are not going to tap into their constituents' wallets and bring more money here to Washington instead of leave it home with them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Absolutely. And you talked about the size of the U.S. economy. Those tax cuts that we put in place from 2001 and 2003 that helped this economy move forward, the reason it happened is because those tax cuts put $1.1 trillion in the pockets of the American taxpayer, $1.1 trillion. And a lot of that money went into savings, but most of that money went back into this economy directly, into whether it was paying for your child's college education, whether it was to buy a washer and dryer, buy a new car, buy a house, remodel your house. I mean, there are hundreds of thousands of ways that people put that money back into the economy. And we did that by cutting taxes on every American that pays taxes. Some folks in this country were even taken off paying taxes. We lowered the rates so that there were many people that didn't have to pay taxes. And once again, when you put money back into people's pockets, what happens is the economy grows. 
   I have another story from my district. Smith Elliott Kearns & Company, it is a regional accounting firm located in my district in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, and they service clients throughout central Pennsylvania, western Maryland, and actually up and down the east coast. They have clients from New England to Florida. And they characterize their clients as mom and pop shops, small and mid-size companies. And they told me about one of the tax cuts we put into place, which was a section 179 deduction, which allows smaller companies to elect to expense up to $108,000 of equipment purchased in the year of the acquisition, and that that is phased out from 108,000 up to over $400,000 of equipment. They phase out the amount of money they are able to expense. But that has tremendous growth in this economy of people going out and buying equipment, whether it is a truck to do pickup and delivery or whether it is a piece of equipment that makes the company more efficient. And in 2009, at the end of 2009, beginning of 2010, those deductions will revert back to the amount before we passed the law of $25,000. 
   It is amazing how much money companies are saving and reinvesting in their companies to make them more efficient, to add jobs, create jobs. And when you buy that equipment, not only does it make your company more efficient but some other company has to produce it, and those companies have to put people back to work. So it is a snowball effect on our economy. And once again, it is something that the national media is just not covering it the way it should. I watch Lou Dobbs, and he is doom and gloom all the time about what is happening in our economy. All he sees is the negative side, and there is so much positive occurring in our country. 
   As I mentioned, this accounting firm has hundreds of clients that are using these tax cuts, using these ways to save themselves money, to reinvest in their company, to create jobs. And that is why it is so important for the American people to really pay attention to what is happening here in the United States Congress. 
   The Blue Dogs have been down on the floor. They haven't been down in a week or so, but they talk about the change, the American people want a change. And they may be right. The American people want a change. But there is nobody that I know of in the United States, in the Ninth Congressional District and across this country, that I have heard say they want a change to increase their taxes. I haven't heard it, except for maybe folks like George Soros and Bill Gates and, of course, John Edwards, who are multimillionaires and multibillionaires. They don't mind paying more taxes. But when you have that much money, there is certainly a lot less pain, or I should say there is no pain at all when you have that much money. 
   But if you are a hardworking American in Pennsylvania, in Kentucky, in Indiana, in Missouri that are out there every day getting up, trying to save money for your kids to go to school, trying to pay the bills, it is significant when the Federal Government reaches into your pocket. And as we talked about here earlier tonight, a family of four that earns $40,000 to $50,000, when these various tax cuts expire, people are going to get about a $2,000 tax increase. And that is significant for a family of four making that kind of money, and it is just wrong. 
   And we here in Congress have to make sure that we are making the  tough decisions on controlling spending. Controlling spending and continuing to see this economy grow because we are getting record levels of revenue flowing into the Federal Treasury because this economy is growing, because of the Gregg Rothmans of the world and the Travis Collinses and the people throughout this country, the small businessmen, the small entrepreneurs that are creating jobs, buying things, putting people to work so that this economy continues to flourish. 
   So as the sign says there, in 1,426 days, which means December 31 of 2010, this Congress and the next, all we have to do is run the clock out. Run the clock out, and the American people are going to get a huge tax increase. 
   And we need to make sure that we are here fighting. But we can't do it without the help of the American people. The American people have to be communicating to their representatives to keep those tax cuts in place because it is good for America, and the numbers bear out: 4.5 percent unemployment, 7.2 million jobs created over the last 4 years. These job gains are throughout our economy. Also, when you look at the different segments, the educational attainment groups in this country, all those groups have seen unemployment drop. Even for those without a high school diploma, we have seen their jobless rates drop by about three quarters of a percentage point just last year, and over the last 2 years a 1 1/2 percent drop in the unemployment rate of people who don't have a high school diploma. That is significant. 
   And if you look at the want ads, I think in almost any newspaper in this country, you will see where people are advertising for jobs. It takes training. It takes some level of education to get these jobs, whether it is a truck driver, which is a pretty good paying job. Today it is a very good paying job. You have got to have the training. So the way to do it is, I believe, not to have some new vast government program, but to keep cutting taxes on people so that people who are in a job can get some training so that maybe they can get another job that pays more.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Right. And just to sum up, there are millions of Americans out there, hardworking Americans, that in the last election didn't vote to see their taxes increased. And I defy anybody in here to show me that their constituents, that the majority of their constituents, the vast majority of their constituents voted to have a tax increase. 
   It is going to be very interesting here in the coming months. We are going to have the budget come up here next month. It is going to be very interesting to see what our Democratic colleagues on the other side propose. The President has proposed a budget that is a budget that is controlling government spending. It is extending the tax cuts that we have put in place, and along the way we are going to move towards a balanced budget and even surpluses. But the only way we do it is not to increase taxes but to allow this economy to grow so that the revenues continue to flow into the Federal Government and that we control spending. 
   Control spending and reform entitlements. Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, we have got to look at reforming them. That doesn't mean cutting benefits. That doesn't mean necessarily increasing taxes. It means looking at ways to better provide those services so that we are not wasting as much money in the entitlement programs. 
   So as I said, I think it is going to be an interesting next couple of months. We are going to see what the Democrats propose as their plan. And as I mentioned earlier this evening, I think we are going to see the proposal of significant tax increases, which I think is going to make many Members on the other side of the aisle very uncomfortable if they have to vote for a tax increase. But if we don't act, if we run out the clock, in 1,426 days, January 1 of 2011, we are going to see one of the most massive tax increases in American history.

   The American people know that drilling isn't the only answer, which my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to say, but they do know it is a huge part of the solution. They also know that it will have the greatest impact in the shortest period of time. It is a real solution. 
   The American people also know that we can explore and drill in places like ANWR and off the coast of the United States. We can do it in environmentally safe ways and extract tremendous amounts of energy in those parts of the world. 
   The American people also know that this Congress has done nothing, has done nothing to solve the problem at the pump, has done nothing to help this economy with solving our oil and energy crisis that we face today. This Congress needs to act. We need to stop talking and limiting our options available to us. The American people are crying out for us to solve their problem and help them and help this economy grow.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHUSTER. (FEDERAL RAILROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We are here today to consider one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will undertake this year, as the chairman pointed out, the Federal Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2007. 
   As the chairman pointed out, there are still accidents that occur and there are still deaths that occur on rail, but to put that into perspective, in 2006, it was in fact the safest year ever in our Nation's railroad history. 
   Over the past 30 years, we have made tremendous progress in reducing the number of train accidents and deaths that occur around our rail yards and railroad lines. Let me give you some of those statistics. 
   In 1996, there were 33 railroad employees that were killed; in 2006, it's down to 16. Now, that's 16 too many, and we can continue to reduce that as we're attempting to do in this bill, but as you can see, there has been definite improvement. 
   Passenger trains, which were carrying, in 1996, 397 million people, in that year, there were 12 passengers killed. In 2006, there were 549 million passengers that were transported by train, and there were only two killed in 2006. Once again, a significant decrease. Any death is too many, but we're seeing positive results in the rail industry. In 1996, 488 people were killed at grade crossing accidents; and in 2006, that number, again, is down to 369. 
   While those numbers are high, this bill is going to address, as I will talk about here, how it's going to address those unsafe conditions and how we can improve making them safer for the traveling public and, of course, the rail industry. 
   One of the biggest issues we address in this bill is limbo time, the time that train crews must wait for pickup at the end of a run. Limbo time is very complicated. We went through some complicated negotiations, but in the end, limbo time will still exist. And I think it's important that people know that the limbo time that employees wait at the end of their run, they are being paid for limbo time, but it extends that waiting period and can result in crews being fatigued. So we phased that down in this bill. We phased down limbo time to 10 hours per month over a period of 3 years. Complete elimination of limbo time would have had some unintended consequences, like forcing train crew members to relocate their homes to new reporting points. The compromised language in this bill avoids disrupting the lives of rail workers and should permit railroad operations to continue smoothly and safely. 
   Another safety concern addressed in this bill is installation of positive train control, or PTC. The bill mandates that PTC be installed by the year 2014, but also provides up to 2 years of leeway in case a better or more effective system is developed. 
   Installation of PTC will likely cost about $3 billion, but the people that use the system will pay for that. That's not going to be passed on to the taxpayers, but the people that use the system and the rail industry will see some positive things happening in their operations to help them lower their costs. That's why I think it's important that we install an effective and reliable system, and this bill will ensure that. 
   I must admit that I think the bill still has some weaknesses, and we need to continue to improve in some critical areas. Grade crossing and trespassing fatalities, still the numbers are high. As I mentioned earlier, in 1996, there were 471 fatalities. That number went up, trespassers that died in 2006, to 517. And trespassers are people that are going onto rail properties illegally, they don't belong there, but those trespassing deaths are something we have to address. 
   Grade crossing fatalities. Again, we've seen them decrease, but we need to do more. I am grateful to Mr. Graves, who submitted an important amendment in the committee markup. The amendment is now part of the bill and authorizes up to $250,000 in emergency funding for a crossing which experiences a collision with a school bus or an accident where there is a fatality. Presently, if there is a fatality, that grade crossing just stays on the list, but with Mr. Graves' amendment, we're going to push it up until it's prioritized and make sure that crossing is dealt with in a timely manner. 
   I am also grateful to Mr. Brown from South Carolina, who helped us create a provision fostering the use of advanced warning devices at railroad crossings. 
   In closing, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Brown, the subcommittee Chair, for working with me and Mr. Mica in trying to make this bill a better bill. As I said, there are still some improvements that we would like to see, and we will continue to work through the process to make the bill a stronger bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2095. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, through this process, we have had some significant differences, but we were able to work them out and produce a product that has bipartisan support in the committee. For me, it was a great experience working with Chairwoman Brown, but especially working with Chairman Oberstar. At times it was quite daunting to go into negotiations with somebody who not only knows the current issues of the rail history, but knows the vast history of the rail industry. So I made it through the process and learned quite a bit, and I appreciate the chairman and chairwoman for working with me, and also, of course, Mr. Mica for giving me the responsibility on this piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2095, the Federal Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2007. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, Chairman Oberstar's manager's amendment contains several important provisions. First, it codifies FRA's existing safety advisory on railroad bridges. This provision will help ensure that the recent tragic collapse of the highway bridge in Minneapolis will never be repeated on our Nation's rail system. 
   The manager's amendment also modifies the Swift Act, which requires locomotives to sound whistles at every crossing in the Nation. The amendment will require the FRA to take into account the impact of horn use on local communities. 
   For example, the town of Baldwin, Florida, is only a mile wide, but has a number of rail crossings and heavy train traffic. According to Mayor Godbold of Baldwin, locomotives sound their horns over a thousand times per day in this small town. The amendment will help Baldwin and other towns balance issues of safety and noise pollution. 
   Finally, the manager's amendment makes some technical corrections deleting the preemption and the police provisions which have already been enacted in the 9/11 bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I have some concerns with this amendment which attempts to regulate railcar brake inspections in Mexico. 
   As I understand it, this issue has already been dealt with by the FRA. The Union Pacific Railroad had requested a limited waiver to do certain air brake testing in Mexico, but the Federal Rail Administration denied that waiver. So air brake and other safety inspections are actually being done on the American side of the border. 
   A potentially larger issue is that this amendment attempts to regulate labor conditions in Mexico. This amendment would interfere with the existing flow of commerce across our southern border. I do not have an answer to that, but I am concerned it could be construed as violating NAFTA. 
   While I agree with Mrs. Napolitano's intent of ensuring a safe U.S. rail system, I have great concerns. But I hope we can work together as we go through conference to take care of my concerns. I thank the chairman.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment deals with STB preemption of laws regarding railroad waste transportation facilities. The Rail Subcommittee has held several hearings on this issue, one last year and another just yesterday. 
   I've a great interest in this issue, as my home State of Pennsylvania is the number one recipient of imported waste from other States, most of it coming from New Jersey and New York City. So, as I said, I've great concern. 
   At yesterday's hearing, we heard many complaints from local communities about illegal railroad, or not  even railroads, but people who claim the railroads, that are waste facilities. We also heard from the STB that most local laws are not currently preempted by Federal law. In fact, many entities claiming Federal preemption do not have legitimate claims. 
   I think it's clear that this law has to be clarified to make it easier to stop unscrupulous operators that Mr. Pallone mentioned in his State of New Jersey, but regarding Mr. Pallone's amendment, the STB has told our rail staff that this amendment needs improvement to accomplish that, to accomplish the stated goal of regulating railroad waste facilities. 
   In fact, I quote from a letter from the chairman of STB that says his ``general concern with the Pallone amendment is that it is overbroad and could result in local land use and zoning agencies exerting jurisdiction over legitimate rail transportation projects and impeding interstate commerce.'' 
   In addition, the STB is already in the process of addressing many of these issues, which they need to do. If people were out there operating waste facilities in an illegal or unscrupulous manner, that needs to be addressed. 
   I would like to work with Mr. Pallone on this issue, but I'm going to oppose this amendment on those grounds. We need to encourage States to deal with their trash problem, all of us across this country. We all produce waste. We've got to make sure in our neighborhoods that we're taking care of our own waste and not shipping it to other States, and I'm just concerned that that's what will occur if this amendment is passed. And so I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I agree with what the chairman said. Again, I don't disagree with the situation that is occurring that appears significant in New Jersey. 
   I am concerned, as I stated, that this language is going to allow communities to stop legitimate and law-abiding rail entities and operations, to stop them when they don't like it. I have great concern in that. 
   I believe the trash issue, as I said, is significant. Pennsylvania is the biggest importer of trash in the Nation with 10 million tons every year coming across the border into Pennsylvania. 
   My concern is that this problem will get pushed out of New Jersey and out of other States into States that are more willing to handle it, and as I said, we all produce trash. I'm sure today I've got half a waste can or more in my office. My community produces trash. Communities have to deal with that problem. 
   Again, nobody wants a landfill in their backyard, but the reality is we've got to have landfills. We've got to have these waste transfer stations. We've got to make sure, though, that people that are operating them are operating them properly so that we're not damaging the environment, that we aren't doing negative things to our communities because, as we heard yesterday, outside of Philadelphia and Bensalem, Mr. Murphy's district, they were trying to redevelop their town, and right across the street, somebody wants to come in and put in a waste treatment facility or waste transfer station that's not going to be positive for that community. 
   So, again, local communities have to have some say, but we've got to make sure they're not overstepping and stopping legitimate operations.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, as Mr. Rohrabacher pointed out, this authorizes a program to install a pilot electric conveyer system for cargo. There have been several concepts developed for the Port of Los Angeles to move cargo using electric trucks, LNG trucks, automated shuttles, and even maglev. The general idea is, as Mr. Rohrabacher has pointed out, to get rid of the diesel trucks and move the cargo to outlying areas for transload to trains or truck. This would cut air pollution and potentially cut the congestion that exists now in the Port of Los Angeles, and would certainly benefit all of the Nation as we develop these types of transportation ideas. 
   I support Mr. Rohrabacher's goal of reducing congestion and pollution and urge support of the amendment.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight, as I have for the past couple of weeks, to remind the American people that if this Congress does not act over the next 2, over the next 4 years, in just 1,440 days there will be a tax increase in this country. It is going to happen as I said over the next 4 years if the Democrats do not extend the tax cuts that the Republicans have put in place over the last several years. 
   It is going to amount to about $200 billion that the American people will pay more in taxes. And I appreciate my colleagues from the Blue Dog Democrat Coalition coming down to the House floor and talking about fiscal responsibility. They talk about the budget. But I hear very little about taxes and keeping taxes low on the American people. 
   And one of the Blue Dogs mentioned in his remarks that he believes in smaller and efficient government and that we have to make tough choices. And that is true. We have to make very tough choices. But it is not our money. 
   We need to make sure that one of the decisions is to not raise the taxes on the American people, because when we were here in the final hours of the Democrats' 100 hours, on that Friday morning, right after they finished the 100 hours, we were in session for all of about 45 minutes, from 10 to 11 a.m. and most Americans did not see that 45 minutes. 
   So that is why I think it is important that I come to the floor and remind the American people what this Congress is doing and what we have done in the last couple of weeks or the 100 hours that the Democrats ran their six bills. And I have a number, 1,440. That is again January 1, 2011, when our taxes will finally get up to that $200 billion tax increase if we do not act. All the Democrats have to do is run the clock out, they do not have to pass legislation, and those tax cuts that we put in place that have benefited this economy so greatly will expire. 
   There is another number that you can put up, and that is how many days since the Democrats' last tax increase. And it has been just 4 days. Now, little did I know and little did I think that it would take only 14 days of the Democrats being in the majority party in Congress, they worked for 13 years to win back the majority, and in 14 days the first tax increase passed this House and is going to move on to the Senate. I hope the Senate does not pass it. 
   Because that is a tax increase on the American people. Now, the Democrats say that it is the oil company, the big oil companies that are going to receive this increase in taxes. And that is true. The big oil companies will pay about $6.5 billion of taxes over the next several years. But the reality is, corporations and businesses do not pay taxes in this country; consumers pay it. The tax increase will be passed along. And it will be passed along in the form of higher energy costs. 
   We will pay more at the pump when we go to fill our cars up. Oil companies, they will have a competitive disadvantage. They will have to pay more when they go out to explore for oil. It will be the Venezuelan oil company, Citgo, or it will be the Iranian or some other foreign oil company that is going to be in a better position to be able to spend money to find oil, to sell it to the American economy, sell it to America, less expensive than our own domestic energy producers. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I just think if you are watching tonight that is not the right thing to do, especially in this time of high energy costs. We have got to make it more cost efficient, give our companies a better footing to compete, not only in energy but in manufacturing. And raising taxes on business is the wrong thing to do. 
   And as I said, it has only taken the Democrats 14 days until this first tax increase has come down the road and has passed this House of Representatives. And that should not surprise anybody in America, because during the campaign, the new chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the Representative from New York, he told the Bloomberg News that he cannot think of one tax cut passed under President Bush that merits renewal. 
   There is no question about it, he said, everything has to be on the table. And what we have seen already is a tax increase just 4 days ago. And as I said, I believe that is going to trickle down into the American public, and they will be paying that through higher energy costs, higher fuel costs. 
   As I said, it is important that I think the American people, if you are watching this evening, are reminded that you are getting exactly what the Democrats said during the election. They said that they would raise your taxes. Once again, I hear the Blue Dogs come down 
    here night after night talking about fiscal responsibility. I do not hear them, though, talking about taxes, making sure they keep the taxes low on the American people. 
   I do not hear them talking about the biggest spending programs that our government has, and that is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. How are we going to improve and strengthen, reform those important programs important to the American citizens, important to our seniors in this country? 
   So those are things that I do not hear them talking about. I am very interested to see what the Blue Dog Democrats will propose when it comes to the budget. We will come into budget season here I believe in March. And I know that when the Republicans were in the majority, the Blue Dogs offered a budget every time. There was a Democrat budget, there was a Blue Dog budget, and there was the Republican budget. So I am very, very interested in seeing what the Blue Dogs propose if in fact they are even allowed to propose a budget, because I think it will be different than their elected leadership will put on this floor. 
   But back to the tax cuts and what it means to the American people. Over the last 4 years we have seen 7.2 million jobs created in this country from those tax cuts. Our economy is creating jobs month after month. Just in December 167,000 jobs were created in this country. The unemployment rate is down to 4.5 percent. It is the lowest average it has been in four decades. That is directly attributable to the tax cuts we have put in place over the last several years. 
   Now, if we do not extend them, if we do not do the responsible thing, the American taxpayers are going to be penalized for their hard work by us taking money out of their pockets. When you look at a family of four that earns over $40,000, if we allow the child tax credit and the marriage penalty to expire, they will pay about $2,000 more that will come out of their pockets. 
   That is money that they could use to save for college, to pay for health care insurance, to buy a new washer and dryer, or put a down payment on a new car. That is their money. They should be able to spend that money as they see fit. And the way to do that is to keep the tax rates low so that they can continue to determine how to use that money best. 
   Small business owners, same situation. If we allow some of these tax cuts to increase, our small businesses in this country will be hurt. And I hope the Democrats take a lesson from history. President Kennedy, back in 1960, did just that. He cut taxes. And when he cut taxes, revenues to the Federal Treasury rose as they have today. 
   Ronald Reagan did it in 1980. He had to fight a Democratic majority, but finally was able to cut taxes. And what happened was the economy grew, one of the greatest expansions of our economy in history, and revenues to the Federal  Government grew as well. That is the same thing we did in 2001 and 2003, cut taxes, the economy rebounded, it was coming out of a recession, coming out of the terrible attack of 9/11, and now our economy is growing very strong. And we do not want to turn that back. 
   I do not think the Americans, although they did vote in many part of this country for a change, they did not vote to change to slow this economy down. They did not vote to increase taxes. I know that none of my constituents is coming up to me and saying we voted for a change, increase our taxes. That is not what they voted for. 
   I think it is very important that we in Congress have a very clear voice talking about the need to maintain these tax cuts that as I said we put in place in 2001 and 2003. 
   I see I am joined tonight by my colleague from Kentucky, a former Army Ranger and a great Kentuckian and also a small business owner who has six kids. So he knows the effects of when you are running a small business how important it is to have a low tax rate so that you can invest back in your business, and also with six children the importance of having money to be able to raise your children and save for their college and make sure that they have a better tomorrow than we have today. 
   So with that I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Davis).

   Mr. SHUSTER. I would just remind the gentleman, it has only been 4 days since the Democrats raised taxes because of their repeal of section 199 for oil and gas which was enacted in 2004 to help manufacturing companies. It took them 13 years to win the majority, and in only 14 days they raised taxes. 
   What you are talking about in that article, this is what is going to happen. It is wrong for us to raise taxes, those tax increases that they put in place just 4 days ago, placed squarely on the domestic energy production which will encourage companies to move jobs overseas. When you raise taxes, when you raise the regulatory burden, that is what companies do, they want to go someplace where they can make a profit. And they are going to encourage the domestic energy industry, which employs 1.8 million Americans who have an average salary of $30 an hour with great benefits, this is going to cause these companies to look to go offshore to produce their product, in this case energy. 
   Shifting the energy industry and facilities overseas will make America more dependent on foreign oil, not less, as the Democrats claim. So the refining of fuels and, again, exploration is going to occur off the coast 
   of America and not on the coast of America, driving jobs out of this country. 
   The higher taxes on the oil companies will hurt retirement security because as I have found out in some of the research we have done, 41 percent of the shares of oil and gas companies are in retirement accounts and pension funds. So when Democrats are helping to drive their profits down to make less money to drive them offshore, it is going to hurt those folks who are retired today. Again, 41 percent of the shares of oil and gas companies are owned by pension funds and retirement funds. Once again, this is a wrong-headed plan. It only took them 14 days. 
   I see the CPA from Texas joins us to remind me of that. It is only 4 days since the Democrats last raised taxes, and we see it is going to come. We talked the past couple of weeks about how they made it easier to raise taxes with the PAYGO rules going from three-fifths majority to a simple majority to raise taxes. 
   Now the Speaker and her party want to give the vote to the American Samoa here in Congress. They want Guam and the Virgin Islands, they are territories of the United States and wonderful people, but they don't pay taxes. They are going to allow them to vote, so these folks that don't pay taxes are going to have the ability to raise taxes on Americans. 
   American Samoa has a population of 60,000, which is 91 percent of the average congressional district. My district is 650,000. The delegate from the American Samoa is going to have the ability to vote to raise taxes.

   Mr. SHUSTER. The gentleman is correct. All Americans want to pay less at the gas pump and less for heating oil. As we have seen in the last month alone, prices have come down to about $50 to $52 a barrel.     
   But the answer is not to increase the cost on the oil and gas producers. The answer is to have more supply. The answer is for us to conserve more, to use it in more efficient ways. The answer is to come up with alternative fuels, which I hope to hear the President talk about that initiative tomorrow night. 
   But when you talk about the oil industry and you talk about dollars and cents, there is nobody better to talk about it than the gentleman from Texas, our resident CPA, who can keep us on the dollars and cents. 
   And with that I would like to yield to the gentleman from Texas.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHUSTER. (DEMOCRATS MUST ACT TO AVOID TAX INCREASES -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. And you look at another measurement when you look at investments and profitabilities. In 2004, a 10-year period ending in 2004 shows that the return on investment the refining marketing segment of the oil companies are in was 7.7 percent return on investment, which was well behind the 13.9 average of the S&P 500. So I think, as our friend from Texas was talking about, huge investments, huge investments. They are certainly making returns, and they are certainly making profits, but it is far behind what many of the other manufacturing and the other companies in the S&P 500 are making. 
   So this is a capital investment industry. We have got to encourage them to keep on going out and looking and looking and finding the reserves. But it is also important, I think, as you pointed out, coming from Kentucky, I come from Pennsylvania, the importance of that other natural resource we have from coal and how we utilize that to truly make us energy independent or move toward energy independence, not this wrong-headed tax increase. 
   And, again, I believe that it is just the first of many we are going to see, statements by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee over the last several months, the rules that the Speaker and the Democrats put into place to make it easier to raise taxes, not harder, to make it easier. And I think the American people need to know that the Democrats, the majority in the Congress, are going to raise your taxes. And when it happens, as it happened 4 days ago, this was a targeted tax increase, they think, just to one industry, but it is going to flow down through the economy, and every American is going to feel it. But we are going to see tax increases. They are not going to control spending, they are going to continue to increase spending. And they said they are going to pay for it, and they are going to pay for it by taking away hard-earned dollars from Americans. 
   I was talking today, I went to see my accountant to prepare myself for tax season this year. And I wonder if the gentleman from Texas would comment on it. My accountant told me that just the sheer difficulty, the complexity, of keeping up with the Tax Code, he said to me that he thinks he produces a reasonably correct, he can't assure anybody that it is correct because it is so difficult. We passed the extenders last year, and he told me that the IRS has informed him he cannot file electronically until February 1. So he is going to have a backlog; he is trying to figure it out, but he doesn't get an extension from April 15 to May 15 because he doesn't file electronically. 
   So I think that the time has not only come to continue to keep tax rates low, but to change our Tax Code. He had on his wall, I am going to get a copy of it, 1913 was the first year that we had the income tax. 
   It was three pages long, it was pretty simple, and basically it was a graduated flat tax. And, again, I am going to bring that in here next week and have it blown up to see how simple it was, and I think the time has come that we go to some different kind of tax. 
   But if the gentleman CPA from Texas would like to comment on that.

He said he believes next year he will see for the first time dual income husband and wife that are teachers that are making in central Pennsylvania about 110, 120 combined income, he thinks for the first time they are going to be caught up in the AMT and they are going to pay several hundred to a thousand dollars or more in taxes.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman is absolutely correct. What we did here in 2001 and 2003 by reducing the tax rate on American people, it is going to expire in 1,440 days, unless this Congress acts. 
   You need to look at the numbers that the gentleman from Kentucky pointed out. Record revenues are flowing into the Federal Government. Since August of 2003, we have created 7.2 million jobs. In December alone, 167,000 jobs were created. The October and November numbers increased by 29,000 jobs. In 2006 alone, there was an increase of 1.8 million jobs. In the 2003 period to today, 7.2 million have been created. That is more jobs than the European Union and Japan combined have created. 
   Our economy has added jobs for 40 straight months, and I believe it is going to do that with an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent. That is well below the 5.1 percent rate of 2005, and below the average of the past 4 decades. So these tax cuts have worked. 
   We need to make sure that we act in this Congress and not run out the clock. The American people need to know that if this Congress does not act, if it just sits on the ball and runs out the clock, come 1,440 days, January 1, 2011, the American people will have seen a $200 billion tax increase, and that is not good for America.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, coming to the House floor as I have for the past 4 months to talk about the great concern that I have and to draw attention to what is going to happen in the United States Congress if the new Democratic majority does not act, in just 1,335 days, the American people are going to see the largest tax increase in American history. I also believe, although I haven't been able to verify this, it is probably the largest tax increase in the history of the world. And the Democratic majority doesn't have to even vote on it, all they have to do is run out the clock and allow the tax reductions, the tax cuts that occurred in 2001 and 2003 to expire. And only in Washington, and I have heard this said, that the majority party is not going to raise taxes because they won't vote on raising taxes, but because they are going to expire and people's taxes are going to go up, that is not really a tax increase. Well, if you are sitting out there in middle America and you are making $40,000 a year and you have two children, your taxes will go up approximately $2,000. That is a tax increase. Everybody in America knows that. And everybody that knows how to add and subtract knows that if your taxes go up $2,000 or if anything goes up $2,000, that is an increase. And as I said, the majority, the Democratic majority will not have to vote on it, they can just, as I have said, run out the clock. 
   In 2001 and 2003 and every year in the Republican majority, we cut taxes; we cut some tax over the 12 years in majority. And the new Democratic majority, it took them about a week, maybe less than 10 days to have their first tax increase. They passed it back in January. And fortunately it hasn't become law because they haven't been able to pass anything of substance that passed the House and the Senate and gone to the President. So, as I said, we haven't seen that first tax increase, although the Democratic majority did in fact vote on a tax increase and it passed here in the House. 
   I hope my friends on the other side will take a lesson from history and look back to the 1960s to President John F. Kennedy and what he did in his term as President. One of the first things he did was to cut taxes. And what happened in the 1960s? The economy grew, revenues to the Federal Government grew because of those tax cuts. And then look back just into the 1980s when President Ronald Reagan came to Washington, and with the help of a Democratic majority, he cut taxes. And what happened? The economy grew, the revenues to the Federal Government grew, and that was a positive thing. 
   The same thing occurred in 2001 and 2003 and continues. We cut taxes, allowing the American people to keep more of their hard-earned dollars, and the economy is growing. Revenues to the Federal Government are at record levels coming into the Federal Government. And the facts are there. Since 2003, 7.5 million jobs have been created. That is more jobs that the European Union and Japan combined have created. Our economy has now added jobs for 43 straight months. 
   Just last month, in April, 88,000 new jobs were created in the United States. Folks that had been unemployed or happen to find themselves unemployed are finding much shorter duration of unemployment than they had in the past. The national unemployment rate remains at 4.5 percent, which is well below the 5.1 percent rate which was in 2005, and below the average of each of the past four decades.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman talking about this tonight. I think it is important that you point out that it is not the government that creates jobs, it is small businesses. We do want to hear your stories. We want to hear what you have been able to do with that tax cut that you received, either in your business or your family, and those stories, we would like you to e-mail them to us at Countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. 
   If you don't want to send them to us, send them to your Member of Congress. Let your Member of Congress know how important it is that this Congress acts to extend those tax cuts before they expire. They are going to expire anywhere from the end of this year in 2007 to the end of 2010, and if we don't act, run out the clock, we are going to see this huge tax increase and you are not going to have that money in your pocket. It is going to be spent to Washington and the bureaucrats and politicians are going to spend it. 
   It is a great privilege to have with us here tonight a colleague of ours from Texas, who more importantly than that is a CPA. He understands the Tax Code better than most of us, although I don't know that anybody understands the Tax Code, as large and complex as it is. But we appreciate his coming down and being able to walk us through some of what is happening in the Tax Code and the burdens it is placing on businesses and families. 
   With that, I yield to a good friend from Texas, Mr. Conaway.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I think it is extremely important to point out that only in Washington, D.C. and the accounting we use here, and I know that the Democratic majority when they were the minority would say that we were cutting spending on programs when we were in the majority when actually it would go up by 2 or 3 percent instead of the 4 or 5 percent that they wanted it to, and they would say that is a cut when it is not a cut.     
   Now, they are saying that it is not going to be a tax increase because we did not vote on it, but all of us know that those of us balancing checkbooks at home and people who run small businesses, people that are trying to save money, know if the Federal Government takes an average $2,000 more out of your paycheck a year, that is a tax increase. 
   As I pointed out earlier, in my State of Pennsylvania, the average taxpayer will pay $3,000 more in taxes, and that is a tax increase. Whether the United States Congress votes on it or does not vote on it, if you pay $3,000 more in taxes, that is a tax increase. 
   This PAYGO rule, which I always thought PAYGO meant that if you are going to increase spending, you have got to find a way to fund it, and that is increase taxes or offset it by cutting spending elsewhere. Quite frankly, I do not know what PAYGO means under the Democratic majority anymore because they find loopholes and exceptions and make changes to it. So, once again, this funny accounting in Washington, DC continues to proliferate under the Democratic majority. 
   I think it is important that, as my friend from Kentucky talked about his experiences with small business, that we get Americans to e-mail us at the countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. E-mail us what you have been able to do over the past couple of years with those tax cuts, whether you are putting it back in your business and increasing your workforce or making it more efficient, selling more products by expanding markets; or if you have a family and you are able to save $2,000 or $3,000 because of the elimination of the marriage penalty or the doubling of the child tax credit, how were you able to take those dollars and employ them in  your household and your business to make your lives better. 
   I think that is extremely important that we hear those kinds of stories. Once again, I want to point out if you are unable to or do not want to e-mail them to the countdowncrew@mail.house.gov, send them to your Member of Congress; let them know what you were able to do with those funds. 
   Again, I know all across America we hear those stories. My good friend from Florida and I were talking, Ric Keller, and talked about what the seniors in Florida, how they have been able to improve their housing, invest that money in a nicer house, a bigger house, a different house because of those tax cuts. 
   So I know that, once again, we are joined by our colleague, the CPA, from Texas, and it is always educational to hear him talk about some of these tax issues. I think he wants to talk a little about the ATM. 
   I went to my accountant a month or so ago. He was talking to me about how it is catching people in this web. He said in Pennsylvania, a household where there is two teachers, they are now approaching and some of them have surpassed that level where two teachers, modest income, are getting caught up in the ATM, paying more taxes. 
   So, with that, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway).

   Mr. SHUSTER. Right, $265 billion. 
   In closing, I just wanted to point out, as the gentleman mentioned, the importance of keeping your own money, being able to invest it, being able to save it. I think a lot of times Americans feel helpless, hopeless over this tax situation. 
   You get that paycheck, and as my 18-year-old daughter just got a paycheck, came home, showed it to me and said, why did they take so much out? I said, well the good news for you is they are going to give you most of most of it back, because you're not going to make the minimum. 
   But as I said, Americans feel helpless or hopeless in a tax situation, but they're not. Americans really have to pay attention to what's going on here in Washington. As we said tonight send us your stories at CountdownCrew@mail.house.gov or send them to your Member of Congress and tell them what you have been able to accomplish with those dollars that you get to keep in your pocket because they are not coming to Washington. 
   Make sure you are talking to your Member of Congress, communicating with him, telling them that you don't want to see taxes go up. You don't want to see the largest tax increase in American history. You want them to keep their tax rates low. Although many Americans are looking at those tax rates today, think they are high, they are lower than they were 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 years ago. 
   This Congress has to act. This Congress has to act before all those tax cuts expire by December 31, 2010, and the gentleman is signaling me. We want to make sure that the American people are communicating to their Members of Congress that they want us to stop this tax increase that's going to occur, a tax increase that the Democratic majority is saying, they are not going to increase taxes because they are not going to vote on it, which is just hogwash. The taxes are going to go up for individuals across this country, businesses across this country, if this Congress fails to act in just 1,335 days.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I spent the Fourth of July recess traveling to Pakistan and to Iraq. 
   I came away with a couple of observations. First in Pakistan, our allies in the war on terror, the Pakistanis, have great concern about an early withdrawal from Iraq, because they saw first hand, after the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, when America left that region, left Afghanistan to uncertainty and chaos, what happened was the rise of the Taliban, an extremist group, that then gave basis to al Qaeda to be able to plan and plot the 9/11 attacks on America. 
   So the Pakistanis are extremely concerned about an early withdrawal. Our allies around the world are concerned. The word of America is at risk. Our allies are watching what we do here in the United States Congress and what America does. 
   Second, traveling to Iraq, I came away with some positive reports, not only from our commanders, but listening to the Iraqi general, who is in charge of the national police. He said that the Shia, the Sunni and the Kurds have come together as Iraqis, standing up a national police force that's fighting to throw out the negative elements that are in Iraq today. They are standing shoulder-to-shoulder, the Shia, Sunni and Kurds. Our folks also told us that they need more time to train the police, the security of the Iraqis. 
   Talking to our soldiers was the most powerful information I came away with. One of the sergeants in our Special Forces told us something very significant. Right about now, he is saddling up, he is getting ready to go out on a dangerous mission in Iraq tonight to either kill al Qaeda to take down a production facility for IEDs. He said to me, he said to the group of us that was there, we cannot leave Iraq prematurely because chaos will ensue, and what we will find is that the terrorists will be in the streets of America. 
   So listening to that powerful statement from somebody who is putting his life on the line, every single night, that's powerful information. Those are powerful words. 
   We have to allow this surge, not just to last for 3 weeks, but to go for 3 months. Let it go. Let us vote down this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, we have come to the floor tonight again, my colleagues and I, to talk about something that is of great concern to us, great concern to the American people. And that is that, in just 1,398 days, there will be one of the largest tax increases in American history, over $200 billion, and that is going to occur if the majority party does not extend the tax cuts that the Republicans put in place in 2001, 2003 and extended some of them in the last Congress. 
   But that is going to happen. This huge tax increase is going to occur in America. And the Democrats don't have to do anything but run out the clock. If they sit on their hands, sit on the ball, we will see, in 1,398 days, as I said, one of the largest tax increases that the American people will have ever experienced. 
   Some of my colleagues on the other side have talked about the change that took place in this body, and there was a change. But I don't know anybody in America, nobody that I talk to in the  Ninth Congressional District of Pennsylvania or across Pennsylvania, that voted to see their taxes get increased. 
   Over the last several months, over the last few years, several years actually, we have seen this economy move forward creating jobs. In fact, over the last 4 years, this economy has created 7.2 million jobs.     
   It is because of those tax cuts that we put in place. The unemployment rate in America is at 4.6 percent. It is the lowest average unemployment rate in the four decades that we have experienced over the last three or four years. 
   Once again, if we don't extend these tax cuts, the American people are going to see more of their hard-earned dollars being sent off to Washington. If you look at a family of four that makes $40,000 or so combined income, has two kids in their family, if we don't extend these tax cuts, if the majority party, the Democrats in Congress, don't extend these tax cuts, people in that income range are going to see an increase of about $2,000 or $2,200 a year. 
   Some in this body may think that is not a lot of money, but I know to the hardworking people in central Pennsylvania that earn $40,000 in income, $2,200 is a lot of money. You can take that money and that is a nice down payment on a car. You can buy a new washer and dryer machine. You can save that money for college for your children. If you take that $2,000 or $2,200 a year over the next 10 years and invest it in a mutual fund returning about 5 percent income, that would grow to $30,000 in the next 10 years. That is a significant amount of money to send your child off to one of the higher education institutions in our country. 
   I think that the majority party ought to take a lesson from one of their own. Back in the 1960s when President Kennedy came into office, he cut taxes. What happened was that the economy grew and revenues to the government grew. We look back at history to President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He did the same thing. He cut the tax rates. The economy grew, it created jobs, and, lo and behold, more revenues flowed into the Federal Government. 
   That is again what we did in 2001 and 2003. We cut taxes, and history has repeated itself. This economy is one of the strongest economies in U.S. history. We are getting record levels of revenue coming into the government. So what we need to do is to continue to keep those tax rates low, extend those tax cuts. 
   Unfortunately for the American people, and that is one of the reasons we come to the floor on a weekly basis and talk about this, to make sure we bring the attention to the American people, make sure they are aware of what is going to happen, the Democrats, they said it very clearly in their campaign rhetoric in 2006, that the leader of the Ways and Means Committee, the new chairman, has said time and time again during that campaign election that he didn't know of any of President Bush's or the Republican tax cuts that deserve to be extended. 
   One of the first things they did when they became the majority party is they made it easier, not harder, but made it easier to raise your taxes. When the Republicans controlled the House, we made it the rules of the House that you couldn't raise taxes unless you had a three-fifths vote in the House to raise taxes. One of the first things the Democrats did was to make it easier. They decreased it to a simple majority to raise your taxes. 
   They put in place PAYGO. It should actually be PAYTAXGO, because it is going to make it easier for them. They are not going to touch any existing programs, but on new spending they are going to have to offset any new spending; and the way to offset that, the easiest way, is to increase taxes. I believe, as I believe many Americans believe, that that is what is going to happen. 
   The American people need to know this. We hope that people are tuning in and listening to us as we talk about this. We call ourselves the Countdown Crew. We are 1,398 days away from this huge tax increase unless the American people speak up, unless the American people talk to their elected officials and say they are not going to stand for a tax increase. 
   We have created a Web site, and we would love for you to e-mail us and let us know, give us your story of how the tax cuts, whichever one, whether it was the child tax credit, or the accelerated depreciation, dividend tax cuts, the death tax, which one of these tax cuts has benefited you. We would like to hear your story so we can talk about it. 
   There are millions and millions of Americans out there, young and old, low and medium income, that have benefited by these tax cuts. Our Web site, I guess it is our e-mail, is countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. Once again, there are some stories tonight. Later on in the evening we will be sharing with you that people around the country have sent us e-mails about how important these tax cuts are to them and how detrimental it will be to their small business or their family or communities across America. 
   I am pleased to be joined tonight by one of my colleagues from Kentucky, Mr. Davis. I yield to Mr. Davis to talk about some of these issues tonight.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Absolutely. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I just wanted to know what size business that was and make sure the American people know that we are talking about people in their neighborhoods, in their communities, that employ 25, 30, 50, 100 people and that start from small and turn these enterprises into successful businesses. In most cases, my experience has been those small business owners, they are the backbone of the community. They are the ones that give to the local little league team. They are the ones that contribute to the hospital and the hospital boards. They are the ones making sure their communities are wonderful places to live, or are helping to make sure they are wonderful places to live.

   Mr. SHUSTER. As soon as next week, the Democratic majority will be introducing their budget. It is my guess that they are going to spell out exactly how they are going to increase taxes on the American people to pay for that budget. They are going to have a choice. The choice is going to be either to continue the tax policies which have resulted in record job growth, 7.2 million jobs over the last 4 years, 40 quarters of an expanding economy; or they are going to choose to put the brakes on the growth of this economy by raising taxes. 
   I am going to predict tonight that if they decide to choose to raise taxes, which all indications lead me to believe they will, the brakes will go on this economy in very short order. 
   One of the important reforms that we as Republicans made when we were in the majority was to reduce the taxes on dividends and capital gains. In past history, dividends and capital gains were sort of viewed as only the fat cats in society, only the wealthy get to benefit by a reduction in taxes on dividends and capital gains. But that is not the case today. 
   Over 60 percent of the American population is invested into mutual funds and the stock market, into various other financial vehicles. It is widespread in the economy who invests and who can benefit from a decrease in the tax on dividends and a cut in the tax on capital gains. 
   Prior to 2003, tax cut dividends were subject to individual income taxes up to 38.6 percent on top of corporate taxes of 35 percent. It was double taxation. The corporations in America that you invested in, if you invested in General Motors or you invested in Wal-Mart and they made a profit, they got hit with a 35 percent tax increase, and then they paid out their dividends to the millions of people from all walks of life who invested in those corporations, and the dividend, it was hit at a tax rate of 38.6 percent or below. Among developing countries, only Japan has had higher tax rates on investment income than us. 
   In 2003, the top individual tax rate on dividends was cut by more than half down to 15 percent. Starting next year, there will be no dividend tax at all for lower income Americans which is absolutely essential to continue growth in this economy. 
   In addition, capital gains tax increased, with the top rates on long-term capital gains dropping from 20 and 10 percent down to 15 and 5 percent. The 5 percent rate will drop to  zero next year for those in the bottom two tax brackets. Again, for families in the middle and lower income that have investments, they are not going to be taxed on those types of investments, or it is going to be significantly decreased. 
   Those lower tax rates have promoted a strong and growing economy, and has created 7.2 million new jobs. Our job creation in the last 4 years is greater than the European Union and the Japanese economy combined. This has been an economy that has grown strong and created millions and millions of jobs. 
   Again, if the Democrats fail to extend the tax relief, in 2010, those rates will return to where they were before we lowered them, and the American people are going to experience significant tax increases. 
   Because seniors rely on income from investments, they have benefited greatly from those lower taxes. That is why it is important. They are one of the key groups in our economy that have benefited by it. 
   The Treasury Department has estimated that 8.5 million seniors saved an average of $1,144 on their 2005 taxes as a result of lower rates on dividends and long-term capital gains. And $1,100 goes a long way towards buying something new for your home, whether it is a washer and dryer, or whether it is a senior giving it to their grandchildren to help them out as they make their way in the world and go to college and try to get an education. 
   According to the Tax Foundation in an analysis of IRS data, more than half of all taxpayers over the age of 65 received dividend income in 2004. Over half of the folks over 65 years of age are receiving dividend income. That is double the national average for all taxpayers. 
   Seniors also rely upon capital gains income. That same Tax Foundation report found that while nationally less than 13 percent of taxpayers claim capital gains income in 2004, that figure cost 30 percent, a third for taxpayers between the age of 65 and 74, and more than 27 percent for those over the age of 75. Seniors benefit greatly by the dividend and capital gains tax cuts. 
   On May 10, 2006, Flora Gramma Green, a national spokeswoman for the Seniors Coalition, described the importance of lower dividend tax rates for seniors living on a fixed income. She said, ``When I planned for my retirement, I needed the dividend income just to have a secure retirement. I am not wealthy. I worry every day if I will have the money to buy the gas I need to get to the doctor, I worry if I will have the money I need for proper nursing care as I get older, and I worry that the monthly income I plan for will stretch far enough each month to let me pay my bills. The millions of fellow seniors who benefit from this tax reduction are in the same boat I am in. We need this tax break just to continue the safe and secure retirement that we planned for.'' 
   Those are the words of a senior who is certainly involved in the fight to continue to keep these tax rates low, to see that the tax rates are extended so that in just 1,398 days, which will be January 1, 2011, which is a short period of time away, we will see this $200 billion tax increase, and it is going to cut across all income spectrums, from low income to high income. 
   These folks are going to have to send more of their money to the Federal Government and not be able to put it back in the economy, creating jobs in the most efficient way that an economy can create jobs.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I don't want to mention his full name, but I had a conversation with a gentleman today who is a local businessman and employs about 120 people in one of my counties back in Pennsylvania. I am just going to call him Harold. I had a conversation with Harold on the phone today, and it was about the negative impact of these tax increases if we don't act on them. 
   As I was talking to Harold, he has been in business. Actually, his father started the business. Harold has been in it for 40 or 50 years. They started out with a couple of dump trucks and a bull dozer. Today they have a tremendous amount of equipment. They are an excavating business. They employ 120 people. But Harold's wife, Delores, just had a health scare, and so Harold has been looking at the business and what would happen if he were to pass away. 
   He said, you in Congress need to pass the death tax because if you don't, if I pass away, it is going to cost his children millions, up to several millions of dollars in taxes that they are going to have to pay in Federal and State tax, mainly Federal tax, to keep the business. He said, my children won't have access to that kind of cash, so they will have to liquidate the business if I were to die. 
   There are thousands of stories like that across America, that we need to make sure that we are extending the death tax and making sure that small-business owners like Harold and Delores, if they pass away, that their children will not have to liquidate a business because you have 120 families that they employ making a good living, living in rural Pennsylvania, that are potentially not going to have jobs if that were to happen. 
   Also, something that I think is important, as you mentioned, you were a small business owner, and I was a small business owner before I got here. Harold is the kind of guy in Pennsylvania, he is one of the pillars of the community. He is the guy that is always contributing to the community, giving back, whether he is on the hospital board or the economic development board. He is the guy making sure that he is contributing to the local Boy Scouts, to the Little League, making sure that the firemen have money, that he is supporting their efforts to raise money as they struggle to keep their ambulance and fire service going. 
   Those are the kinds of people, small-business owners, that have been in business for many, many years, that give back to their community, give back to their community and give back to their community.     
   Those are the kinds of people and those are the kinds of communities that are penalized with a tax like the death tax that would cause a business, one of the pillars of the community, to have to liquidate to raise the money to send it down here to Washington, to come into the Federal Treasury, and it would go out again probably 50 percent or 60 percent less of what came in. It would be less efficient than Harold being able, or Harold's family being able, to give back to the community and get the most impact out of a dollar. 
   Again, those are the kinds of people. I had a lunch with a gentleman in a similar business as Harold, gentleman by the name of Dave I will call him, who is the same type of person, started a business, told me about growing up on the farm in rural Pennsylvania, saying he did not have any money; he did not know any better. But he started out a with a flatbed truck hauling coal from the coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania back down to central Pennsylvania. That is how he got started, and today he has 200 employees, three different businesses, and is another gentleman who gives back to the community again and again and again. 
   That is what we are talking about. That is what makes America great, coming from a poor farmer to a prosperous business owner and a pillar of the community. Again, that is what makes America great. These are the kinds of people all across this country we have to make sure that we are not penalizing for being successful. 
   I yield back to the gentleman.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Absolutely. You talked earlier about the stories that we want to have sent to us, talking about real-life stories out there in America, how these tax cuts have helped them or what they are feeling in the economy or what they are feeling about their government. You can e-mail us at countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. That is countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. 
   I received an e-mail, and I wanted to read some of it to you. It is from Kent Berry, who is a small business owner from Gravel Ridge, Arkansas. I have never been to Gravel Ridge, Arkansas. It is about 15 miles north of Little Rock; and over the past months, Kent has been watching us. 
   Kent says he is swamped by Federal tax regulations which are driving him down. He goes on further to say: ``More and more I feel that the deck is stacked against me. I witness so much nonproduction being rewarded with money which I had to struggle to remit. I'm beginning to feel that the American Dream is an optical illusion. I'm starting to envision the American Dream a lot like the carrot and stick. I keep pressing but it ain't gettin' no closer.'' 
   Kent continues: ``I'm no constant agitator or perpetual malcontent, but I do enjoy C-SPAN and I did hear your e-mail address several times, and I'm writing to say that I'm struggling here. 
   ``Government, like a lot of things, is a good thing. 
   But like all good things, moderation.'' 
   And as Kent points out there, he is struggling out there because he has got a small business. He works hard to earn the money that he earns, and then he has to turn around and pay a tax bill that is bigger than he can probably handle. If we do not extend some of these tax cuts, the tax bill is going to be even greater for Kent. 
   I know his story and his feelings are like millions of Americans out there that want to make certain that if they are going to invest their capital, if they are going to invest their blood, sweat and tears into a small enterprise, that they have the ability to get a return, that they have a ability to save some money, that they have an ability to make sure that their family lives a little better life than they have. 
   This is the American Dream, as we have talked about a couple of these folks from your district and some from mine, that they start from meager beginnings and with hard work, with ingenuity, they grow a business and become significant parts of their communities, giving back to their communities. Those are the types of people that we want to make sure that they are not penalized, that they are not driven out of business because they have to have some big tax bill when they pass away, you know, whether it is taking that money and investing it into a mutual fund so they can get a nice dividend back and they are not overburdened with taxes, whether they take their company or their business or their property and sell it and do not have an oppressive capital gains tax. 
   As you mentioned, most Americans do not take the money and bury it in the backyard. They put it back into the economy. They invest it in a mutual fund. They invest it into another business or a property that builds something, but that money goes back into the economy to create jobs and to hopefully when they invest that money create a return for them so they can continue to live a good life. 
   Again, through my district, there are a number of people. I have mentioned the name before, a B.C. Stone, another one of those operations started out in a garage. I visited with those folks about a week or so ago. They started out in a garage and today with a couple of employees, and today they employ 70 people. Their business is prosperous. It is growing over the last 4 years, and Travis Collins, one of the owners, says it is directly because of the various tax cuts that we put in place. The economy is moving, booming, and so his business right along with it. 
   As I mentioned before, he has taken on an old hotel in my hometown of Everett, Pennsylvania, an over 110-year-old hotel, and he is restoring it and turning it into a 12-bedroom hotel with a first-rate restaurant in it. By doing this, he hopes he is going to make some money, but he really wants to give back to the community and this beautiful, small town that he grew up in and this hotel, quite frankly, was dilapidated. He is putting a fresh face on it, and he is going to try to attract people to come into the community, to spend money through tourism. 
   Again, these are the kinds of things that happen when you allow people to keep more of their own money. They invest it, they grow their business, they try to create jobs and make their communities better places to live and to work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. Just in our closing minutes here, I want to reiterate, first of all, say we have been getting up here for the last several weeks talking about the coming tax increase, unless Congress and the Democratic majority acts, which will occur in 1,398 days, which will be January 1, 2011, and that occurs in 2008, some of the taxes, if they are not extended, will expire, 2009, 2010. Again, we want to hear from citizens around the country that have benefitted by these tax increases, tell us your story about your small business, how it has grown or how you started it. 
   You can get those stories to us at the countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. We want to hear those stories. Again, I want to close with just talking about what's going to happen with the dividend and the capital gains tax cuts if we don't act. 
   January of 2010, those rates will go back up. As I mentioned earlier, when folks think about those dividends, whether you have a mutual fund, you have an IRA, you have a 401(k), you have some pension fund out there. By and large, if not all of them, almost every one of them, is dependent on investments to put income in and pay out to the beneficiaries. 
   Prior to a 2003 tax cut, dividends were subject to an individual tax rate up to 38.6 percent and on top of a corporate tax rate of 35 percent. Those types of rates are coming back unless this Congress and unless this Democratic majority acts. In 2003, the top individual tax rate on dividends was cut by more than half, down to 15 percent; and starting next year, that dividend, no dividend tax on income, on lower-income Americans. That is substantial. 
   In addition to capital gains tax decreased with the top rates on long-term capital gains dropping from 20 and 10 percent down to 15 and 5 percent, and, again, the 5 percent rate will drop to zero next year for those in the bottom two tax brackets. 
   If the Democrats fail to extend this tax relief, again, in 2010, they are going to come back, and anybody out there in America that is retired, anybody out there, as I said, that has a 401(k), a mutual fund, they are going to be taxed at a higher rate on those dividends. 
   So it is important that we act. That is, again, why we come to the floor once a week and remind the American people that this tax increase is coming. 
   You need to talk to your Member of Congress. I do not believe that anybody in the November elections voted to increase their taxes, and your Member of Congress needs to hear about it. We have to stop it because we want to see this economy continue to grow and to prosper. 
   Does the gentleman from Kentucky wish to close? The gentleman from Texas arrived, too.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
   I agree with much of what my colleagues on this side of the aisle have said this evening. I first and foremost commend the chairman for putting forth a bill that is going to increase funding for bridges. Certainly it's a tragedy what happened in Minnesota on I-35, and we have to be concerned in America. But our bridges are in grave danger of those types of incidents occurring. Pennsylvania has thousands of bridges that are in a deficient state, and we need to address that. 
   This bill, though, in talking to leadership at Penn DOT, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, today, they have grave concern, as I do, that in this bill--I'm not clear how extensively it reduces the flexibility for our States to be able to move money around where they need to do it. I know Pennsylvania, in the past, has been criticized, saying we don't spend as much as we are authorized and appropriated for bridges. But, in fact, because of the flexibility in the past, Pennsylvania spends almost double on fixing new bridges because they're able to move money around in a commonsense way to rebuild bridges that need attention. So I'm concerned that this bill is going to restrict the flexibility. 
   I'm not quite sure, as we're reading the language and we're trying to work through this to try to understand it, if this legislation is going to reduce the flexibility in the nearly billion dollars that's out there, or if it's going to reach back into our highway funds that we have now, it's going to create stringent requirements on them. 
   The second thing that concerns me is that there appears to be a new certification program for bridge inspectors. And Pennsylvania, I believe, leads the Nation in training and certifying people to go out and inspect bridges. In fact, in Pennsylvania, it's not always an engineer who's an inspector, but it's somebody who has a tremendous amount of experience building bridges, working around bridges that has gone out and certified these bridges. 
   And in talking to Pennsylvania today, the Penn DOT, they expressed to me that if this certification program moves forward, it's going to hamper their ability to continue to go out and inspect bridges and decide which bridges need to be dealt with. 
   In addition to that, the certification program, Penn DOT expressed to me today that it could cost as much as $30 million to recertify bridges under a Federal regime. And as I said, Pennsylvania is a State where we have several thousand bridges that are in desperate need. Pennsylvania is a leader in moving forward, trying to rehab these bridges, making sure they're safe so we don't see tragedies occurring. 
   And then finally, the risk-based priority regulations in this bill. Pennsylvania doesn't have hurricanes, Pennsylvania doesn't face those kinds of risks. And it's a concern that, with this type of Federal regulation, are we in Pennsylvania going to be hurt by this mandate that's put in place or this type of risk-based priority? Because we do have, as I said, several thousand--I  believe the number is 9,000--bridges that need attention today. 
   So I have grave reservations about this. I'm trying to work through the bill and trying to understand all that it puts forward, but these are some of the concerns that I've had, not just from me working through the legislation, but in talking to the experts in Pennsylvania. So there are grave concerns here. And again, at this point, I'm going to hold my judgment until I continue to work through the bill and try to understand it.

   Mr. SHUSTER. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. And those are certainly all things we need to consider. 
   And I raise these issues not because I have a deep understanding of this law, but when I talk to the experts back in Pennsylvania, they raised the concerns that--we have good intentions down here sometimes in the Federal Government in Washington, but when the language comes out, it doesn't exactly meet up to our expectations, and certainly not back to the professionals back in Pennsylvania that are working hard day and night trying to make sure these bridges are taken care of. 
   But they've expressed to me--and again, I'm going to be in consultation with them tomorrow and hopefully committee staff to make sure that we understand that these aren't putting impediments in place to the State of Pennsylvania, in particular, because we have a tremendous need to fix, repair and replace these bridges that are in very, very bad condition. So I appreciate the gentleman's words and will certainly be talking with the staff.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, last week I traveled across my district to talk about energy and announce my legislation, H.R. 6421, the Energy Independence Act. My district is fed up with what Congress has not done. It is time for us to do something when it comes to investing in domestic energy policy, and my legislation does just that. 
   Number one, it opens the Outer Continental Shelf to drilling. Two, it creates a tax credit to develop coal-to-liquid fuel technologies and projects. Three, it opens up ANWR and puts regulations and restrictions on it to make sure that ANWR is developed responsibly. Four, it creates an alternative energy trust fund to pay for renewables and alternative energies. And five, it streamlines the licensing process to allow for new nuclear power plants in our country. 
   Drilling alone will not earn us energy independence, but it is a critical step that we must do coupled with investment in alternative and renewable energies. Let's join together to begin to solve the energy problem in this country. Americans demand it; but more importantly, they deserve it.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, I want to express the regrets of the subcommittee ranking member, Mr. Graves from Missouri, who was unable to be here and has asked me to explain the bill. 
   H.R. 3246, as amended, authorizes two existing economic development commissions, the Delta Regional Commission and the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission. The bill also creates three new economic development commissions, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commission. 
   The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act authorizes these five regional economic development commissions for 5 years, and provides a structure for economic development, decision-making and planning. The bill outlines conditions for financial assistance, authorizes grants to  local development districts. In addition, the bill establishes an Inspector General for the commission. 
   Additionally, H.R. 3246 provides a framework for administration and management. The framework is modeled after the Appalachian Regional Commission structure, including membership, voting structure and staffing of the commission. Through the use of this common framework, this bill provides a consistency in distribution of economic development funds. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, today is an important day for our Nation's railroad industry. We are authorizing, as everybody has been talking about, Amtrak, which has not been done in 10 years. We are also considering a comprehensive rail safety legislation which will make our Nation's railways safer for both passengers and freight trains. I'm heartened that we are considering this bill now, and I hope it's offering some small degree of comfort to the families who are suffering after the recent Metrolink disaster in California. 
   America's railroads are becoming an increasingly important part of our transportation backbone. The gridlock on our highways and in the air and the need to conserve energy makes the case for passenger rail even more compelling. I believe that expanded passenger rail service can do a great deal to ease the congestion and, as I said, to conserve the energy that we so desperately need to conserve. 
   But it's important that the private sector be given a chance to participate. I believe this bill is an important step towards this goal because it allows the private sector to bid on lines where Amtrak currently operates, and I believe the private sector, if given an opportunity, can greatly improve the efficiencies in our passenger rail system. 
   I would encourage and would ask those on my side of the aisle who for years have wanted to eliminate, to break up and to kill Amtrak to consider this bill. 
   We have important private-sector initiatives in this bill. Instead of talking about theory, we can see it go in motion, and then we'll have the evidence that I believe will come about by having the private sector's being involved. As I said, we will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the private sector can operate, once again, a passenger rail service in this country in an effective and efficient manner. 
   I also support this bill because it has given an important opportunity to the private sector to submit proposals for the construction of high-speed rail lines, starting with the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor, followed by other corridors designated for high-speed rail service. 
   High-speed rail has been in long use overseas--in Japan with the Bullet train for over 40 years and with the French with their TGV trains that have been in revenue service. I'm excited about the possibility of bringing this technology or similar technology to the United States so that we can open up the Northeast Corridor and can get some cars off the highways and can get people off of planes and into rail service. 
   I just have to look to Pennsylvania, to the Keystone Corridor from Harrisburg to Philadelphia, which has been a partnership between Amtrak and the States. They have upgraded the lines. They now have service that runs 110 miles an hour between Harrisburg and Philadelphia. In its first year of service, it's up almost 20 percent in ridership. I think that's proof that high-speed rail or that higher speed rail with dependable service is something that Americans will use in significant numbers. 
   The rail safety component of this bill is equally important, and it will result in a number of things: one being the installation of Positive Train Control by the end of 2015 on all routes that carry passengers and on all mainline routes that carry toxic materials like chlorine. PTC will use state-of-the-art technology to prevent trains from colliding into each other. What happened with the Metrolink disaster possibly could have been avoided or probably would have been avoided if we had had PTC. We are also providing grants to help defray some of these costs because we are mandating it. I think it's the appropriate thing, when we mandate something, to contribute to that cost. 
   So, as I said, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill. Those who have come to the floor and who have argued in the past against Amtrak, please consider this. As I said, with the private-sector initiatives that are in this bill, it gives us a chance to put those theories forward for practical purposes. So I do urge the passage of this.

   Mr. SHUSTER. Finally, I do want to say thank you to my colleagues: to Chairman Oberstar for his leadership and hard work, to Chairwoman Brown for her hard work and cooperation and for allowing us to participate in a significant manner in the writing of this bill and for putting in some important provisions that we needed to have in here to be able to support this bill, and also to the leader on the Republican side, Mr. Mica, for his leadership and hard work. I thank him for giving me the opportunity to be the ranking  member on this subcommittee. Thank you. 
   Again, I urge passage.
