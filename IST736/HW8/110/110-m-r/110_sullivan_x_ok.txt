<DOCNO>Mr. SULLIVAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 6, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wonder how Congress could possibly consider addressing an energy bill that has no energy in it. 
   The House is considering energy legislation which does nothing to expand domestic energy production, develop nuclear or coal-to-liquids technology, and only increases our Nation's dependence on foreign oil and hurts American jobs and the economy. 
   While promoting the use of alternative energy is a worthy and long-term goal, by mandating and increasing renewable fuels 36 billion gallons by 2022 without concern to the fact that this technology does not exist today and with almost no consideration of cost or price to consumers, it is not the right direction for our country or the Nation's energy industry.     
   In addition, the renewable portfolio standards mandates in this legislation, which only nine States can currently meet, can increase the cost to Oklahomans by a whopping $900 million. 
   Given our country's current energy needs and our long-term goal of energy independence and security, it is imperative for us to increase our domestic production of crude oil and natural gas while exploring innovative and renewable energy technologies.

<DOCNO>Mr. SULLIVAN. (ERNEST CHILDERS DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OUTPATIENT CLINIC -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 366, which will designate the Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the Ernest Childers VA Outpatient Clinic to honor one of our Nation's finest military heroes. 
   Ernest Childers holds the distinction of being the first Native American to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroic action in 1943 at the battle of Oliveto, Italy, where he charged the German machine gun nest against machine gun fire. Although suffering a broken foot in the assault, Childers ordered covering fire and advanced up the hill, single-handedly killing two snipers, silencing two machine gun nests, and capturing an enemy mortar observer. His courageous action helped American troops win the battle and saved the lives of American soldiers. Childers was also awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his actions. 
   Born in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, Childers enlisted in the Oklahoma National Guard in 1937 to earn extra money while attending the Chilocco Indian School in north central Oklahoma. While stationed at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, he was deployed to Africa to fight in World War II. 
   Childers retired from the Army in 1965 as a Lieutenant Colonel, but remained very active in the Tulsa community, serving Indian youth which led to the naming of the middle school in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma in his honor. 
   As a proud Creek Indian, in 1966, Childers was honored by the Tulsa Chapter of the Council of American Indians as ``Oklahoma's Most Outstanding Indian.'' 
   Of his military service in World War II, Childers once said, ``This American Indian has only one country to defend, and when you're picked on, the American Indian never turns his back.'' A fitting quote from a man who exemplified courage under fire and dedication to defending our Nation. 
   Until his death on March 17, 2005, Childers was one of Oklahoma's last Congressional Medal of Honor recipients still living in the State. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor his life and legacy. We were honored to have him grace us with his model character, defend us with his bravery, and leave us all a life well lived.

<DOCNO>Mr. SULLIVAN. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Chairman, this is a very important amendment. Any thoughtful legislation must ensure four things: That the lights stay on, that driving a car stays affordable, energy prices stay competitive, and that we protect people's jobs. If we think that we can achieve these goals without a continuing role for domestic fossil fuels, we're kidding ourselves. 
   We are addressing global warming, but we are not doing it in a vacuum. We are also charged with making sure that people in America have energy that power our jobs, and through them, our people's opportunity to succeed. If we do our jobs, people will keep their jobs. 
   I accept that the science on this matter is uneven, uncertain and evolving. That certainty hasn't changed, but now we seem to be pressuring ourselves, or someone is pressuring us, to legislate first and get the facts later. I hope we don't do that. I want to make sure that we get the best information available so we have a full and accurate definition of the problem before we start making decisions. 
   We have to be clear about the issues before us. Discussion of mandatory steps to cap CO  
   2 often misses the essential fact. Carbon dioxide, unlike carbon monoxide, and other compounds ending in ``oxide'' is not toxic. It is not a pollutant. Not only is it natural, it is indispensable for life on this planet. 
   What we need to understand is how does CO  
   2 fit into the atmospheric mix? I am told all CO 
   2 is only 0.038 percent of the atmospheric gases. 
   How does the CO  
   2 from fossil fuel combustion fit into the total annual CO 
   2 increase in the atmosphere? I am told it is only 0.4 percent of this amount. 
   How does U.S. fossil fuel consumption fit into mankind's overall share of fossil fuel energy use? I am told it is 22 percent and shrinking. That means if we shut down 100 percent of all fossil fuels in the United States, we would  only reduce CO  
   2 growth in the atmosphere by 0.088 percent. That is 0.0003 percent of atmospheric gases, and China will be filling in the gap and then some. 
   How much will any legislation we consider actually change the total U.S. emissions and, in turn, change total human emissions and, in turn, affect global greenhouse gas concentrations? 
   What will it cost? The people who will pay for our policy decisions are taxpayers and consumers and workers. What amount is the right amount to take from them and their families for our policies? 
   And we need to understand whether well-meaning steps to cap CO  
   2 here and now will simply drive industry offshore where control of actual pollution such SO 
   X, NO 
   X, mercury and particulate is far more lax. 
   Whether we like it or not, CO  
   2 correlates to national economic activity. That means jobs and the ability of working families to thrive is defined by jobs. Despite impressive gains in energy intensity over the past few years, a basic reality is that with the technology mix deployed today, to cap CO 
   2 emissions constraints economic output, jeopardizes economic growth, and eliminates people's jobs. 
   It is imperative that we reach rational conclusions, based on real evidence, about the reliability of our knowledge that CO  
   2 has the sort of impact on planetary temperature as people say. 
   At an Energy and Commerce hearing earlier this year, we learned that a cap-and-trade program added 40 percent to the wholesale cost of electricity in Germany. A cap-and-trade program could lead to real rate shock for electric consumers. High electricity costs will only drive manufacturers overseas, and American jobs will go along with them. 
   This cap-and-trade approach has been proven unworkable in countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol, and it would be unworkable in the United States. Few participants in the protocol are on track to achieve the international targets for carbon emissions reduction. An increasing number of the countries are unwilling to strangle economic growth through stricter carbon caps in the future. 
   Another fundamental flaw with the Kyoto agreement is the exclusion of India and China from its reach, particularly when China is soon to claim the distinction of being the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world. 
   The United States cap-and-trade program would fall the same failed trajectory as Kyoto. Its artificially high energy costs would cripple the United States manufacturing base and suppress job creation for working American families. And that's not all. Two of our greatest economic competitors in the world market, India and China, won't have to cap emissions and pay a premium for energy. Those two countries will laugh all of the way to the bank, and the joke will be on us. They will use it as an economic weapon. 
   What is very important when we look at this very important matter, we need to take our time, we need to gather the facts, and we need to educate other Members. The decisions we make will impact Americans for a long time in the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. SULLIVAN. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 6, legislation that puts America's independent energy producers at risk and increases America's dependence on foreign oil. 
   This bill unfairly punishes offshore oil and natural gas companies who signed leases with the Federal Government in 1998 and 1999. These leases, due to a mistake by the Clinton administration, did not set price thresholds for royalty incentives. The bill requires all companies to renegotiate these leases, even though they were fairly signed in the first place. 
   The companies who entered into these agreements cannot be blamed for the Federal Government's mistakes. The contracts signed by the Federal Government and energy producers are legal and binding, regardless of the mistakes of the Federal Government in drafting them. In addition, a fair version of this provision was included in the Republican Outer Continental Shelf drilling bill that was adopted last year. 
   We talk about this and I think this is a national security issue. Right now we  should be encouraging domestic production here in the United States of America, and we are not. 
   We get 60 percent of our oil from foreign sources, and a lot of that oil that we are getting is from areas that we are at conflict with or we have carpet bombed recently. I think it is asinine we are not doing all we can to spur domestic production here in the United States and not penalizing companies for doing such. It is absolutely ridiculous. 
   Not only are gas prices low right now, in Tulsa where I am from it is below $2 a gallon when I left this past week, but also crude oil prices are as low as they were in 2005. They are going down. 
   All this legislation will do is increase gasoline prices at the pump to upwards of $5 a barrel. What we need to be working on is a comprehensive energy policy in this country that will actually get prices down by not only spurring domestic production but also working on getting more refining capacity in this country. 
   We are operating at 100 percent capacity right now. We need to be expanding, building five or so additional refineries in this country. And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.

<DOCNO>Mr. SULLIVAN. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1424, the Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007. I would like to commend Congressman Kennedy and Congressman Ramstad for the work they have done on this bill. 
   There is a problem I have with it, though. I am disappointed with the offsets that are in there. I think these offsets do punish the pharmaceutical industry for participating in the Medicaid program, and it places financial limitations on physician-owned hospitals. Unfortunately, these offsets are essentially just a political game, and I hope at the end of the day they are not in this bill. 
   Mental health illness, if someone has a biologically based mental disorder, it is no fault of their own. They either have it or they don't. It is a chemical imbalance of the brain, and I think it should be treated like any other illness, and it is high time in this country that we do that. 
   This bill, people are going to say, we are going to score it, it is going to cost all this money. It is not. Some research says we spent $100 billion last year on untreated mental illness in lost productivity in the workforce in this country, and last year we lost $400 billion in lost productivity in the workforce due to substance abuse problems in this country. It is high time that we do not brush this issue aside anymore. We can't do it. It is costing us way too much. 
   My State of Oklahoma has the highest rate of mental illness in the United States of America. I don't know why, but we do, and we need to address it. That is why I was so glad that Congressman Kennedy did come to my district to hold a field hearing there. 
   We heard from businesses. We asked them point-blank, one of the biggest employers in my district, we said, is this going to cost you money? He said, no, it will help us. It will save money. We talked to other people in the district about that as well. 
   People need this desperately. It is high time that we do treat people that have a mental disorder just like anyone else that has diabetes, a heart illness, or any other illness. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. SULLIVAN. (THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend from Texas for doing this tonight, and also my friend, Congressman Shuster from Pennsylvania. This is a very important topic, talking about tax relief for America's working families, for America's small business people. 
   You know, we have seen a great economy recently. It is roaring along. Unemployment benefits are at an all-time low. You know, gross domestic product is up. We are seeing record numbers in our economy right now. That is due in small part, or in large part, because of the tax relief measures instituted by President Bush. 
   I do not think, you know, tax relief is the only answer to a robust economy  like we have right now, but it is certainly a piece of that puzzle. You know, other countries have used tax relief as an economic tool to get out of economic slow times. And America has done the same. It has been very important that we have done it. 
   You mentioned too, Congressman Conaway, about the oil and gas tax. You know, oil and gas keeps this economy going. People do not realize, especially people from producing States how vital that is to our economy. 
   There are so many byproducts from oil and gas. Taxing them is ridiculous. We need to spur domestic production here in the United States and become less reliant on foreign oil, not more reliant upon foreign oil. 
   Taxing the people that produce that, which is really not only the large oil, Big Oil like the Democrats like to say, but small producers out there, independent producers, small mom and pop independent producers that produce 90 percent of the domestic oil and gas in this country. It is absolutely wrong. 
   You know, people pay a lot in taxes. We pay too much in taxes. You know, government needs taxes for vital government services like the war, vital infrastructure needs. It is very have important that we have taxes for that. But I think that government has gotten too big, and we have taxed too much. 
   If you think about it, if you look at your Federal tax, State tax, city tax, Congressman, we are taxed a lot. You get up in the morning, you take a shower, the alarm clock wakes you up, if it is an electric alarm clock, you pay taxes on electricity to get you up. 
   If you take a shower, you pay taxes on the water, soap and shampoo. If you eat breakfast, you pay tax on the cereal you eat. You go to work, if you drive there, you pay the motor fuel tax, tire disposal fee, tag tax. 
   You go to work, you have income tax or self-employment tax. You go home have dinner, taxed on that. And we are talking, Congressman Conaway, you can go home, kiss your wife, you are taxed on that too, that is not free either, you have got a marriage penalty tax too. 
   So we pay a lot in taxes in this country. And, you know, the people that are counting on these things, if we allow the Democrats to raise taxes like they want to do, and in essence that is what they are doing if they do not continue these vital tax decreases, is they are hurting the American people, they are hurting small business. 
   Now, 85 percent of the people that work in this economy right now are employed or work or own a small to medium-sized business. And those people, one of the things they talk about is providing health insurance to their employees, and they have been able to do it because of the tax relief, the money that they have saved because of that. 
   And if their taxes go up, they are not only going to have to probably lay some people off, but they are not going to be able to provide the kind of health insurance that they want to provide for their employees. They have to make tough decisions right now, and it is wrong. 
   I remember Congressman Shuster and I, we were in the back of the Chamber when we were first elected, and the Democrats were talking about tax cuts. And they said, Bill and I heard them say that some of them were in a group and they said, if we allow people to keep that money, they might not spend it the right way. 
   Who are they to say that? It is their money. I mean, it is your money; it is not their money. The money that we take from, that we confiscate from taxpayers is not the politicians' money, it is not the Washington, DC people's money. It is the people's money, and they know best what to do with their own money. 
   And what they are going to do, if you allow a family to keep more of what they earn, they are not going to go bury it in the yard; they can if they want. But they are probably going to go out and buy other things that are taxed. It is going to stimulate the economy. That is what taxes really do. There is a dynamic economic effect of tax relief. 
   If you allow that money to bounce around the economy several times, it is going to find its way back to Washington anyway. But several people get to touch that dollar before it gets here. It spins around the economy. There is a dynamic economic effect to that. When you take money out of Washington, DC, it helps people, it helps the economy, it bounces around. It is going to find its way back anyway. And tax relief does work.

   And they said they couldn't believe that the Speaker, Nancy Pelosi from San Francisco, would not allow us a vote on this. One guy said, I can't believe she's that powerful that she is single-handedly holding this up when the majority of the American people want to see this done and done now and get a comprehensive, all-of-the-above strategy. 
   She does have that power, and she's exercising her power. She has the key. She holds the key in her hand to unlock the potential of America, to unlock oil and gas reserves in this country that would last for 160 years that we can get right here in our own backyard. And while we're doing that, we can develop technologies like wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, biomass, all other technologies in an environmentally sound way, and we need to do it now. 
   Instead, we're getting a bill that's full of tax increases and drilling less in America, and this is the biggest hoax perpetrated on the American people that I've seen since I've been in Congress. 
   And on her Web site, she says a bill should generally come to the floor under procedures that allow full and open debate. Members should have 24 hours to examine bills and conference reports before they come to the floor. But she's not doing it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, as I look forward to celebrating Father's Day this weekend, I was proud to introduce House Resolution 1243, which honors fathers across the country by recognizing the important role that fathers play in shaping the lives of our Nation's young people, supporting responsible fatherhood, and encouraging greater involvement of fathers in the lives of their children. 
   Being a father is one of the greatest blessings of my life. I love my job, but I look forward to the end of the week when I can head back home to Tulsa to be with my family. 
   My children, Tommy, Meredith, Sydney and Daniel are my number one priority, and I strive every day to show them they are important. I would like to take this opportunity to remind all fathers to spend extra quality time with their children on Father's Day, and to continue to do so throughout the year. 
   I introduced this legislation not only to honor fathers but to call attention to the importance of the job. The role that fathers play in the development of our youth cannot be overstated.  
   The absence of fathers contributes to many social problems that we, as legislators, fight to prevent daily. According to findings by the National Fatherhood Initiative, the closer adolescents feel to their fathers, regardless of the type of family structure in which they live, the less likely it is that they will engage in the use of drugs or delinquent behavior. Involved and proactive fathers help to shape confident and productive future citizens. 
   So as we honor fathers on Father's Day, we should also encourage men to evaluate their own participation in their children's lives, because you never can be too involved. 
   As a co-chair of the Congressional Task Force on Responsible Fatherhood, as a father and a concerned citizen, I ask my colleagues to join me in spreading the message of responsible fatherhood to all levels of society, and encouraging more fathers to reconnect with their children by supporting House Resolution 1243.

   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, it's really astounding that there is nothing in this bill that stops States from covering illegal immigrations in this bill. People have come up to me and said, you know, the Democrats, the people in the Senate wanted to allow illegal aliens to get free Social Security benefits. Now they want to give free health care, and that's wrong. 
   There is nothing in this bill that prevents adults, States from covering adults, giving them health care. There's nothing in this bill that prevents States from even covering the children of the Members of Congress in this bill. 
   I think this is a bill that should not happen. I rise today in strong opposition to it. 
   One of my problems is that it eliminates the 5-year waiting period for immigrants who deserve to be eligible for Medicare and SCHIP. Congress wisely created this waiting period, and eliminating this waiting period will exacerbate our current immigration problems and further endanger government health care programs. By repealing this current law, millions of citizens will be eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP immediately. 
   Had this bill been brought to the committee, the proper thing, I had an amendment that would have saved taxpayers $2.2 billion having this waiting period. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. SULLIVAN. (THE STATUS OF ENERGY IN THE WORLD TODAY -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. I thank Congressman Shimkus, and I appreciate your leadership today and also on the Energy and Commerce Committee where Congressman Shimkus has worked hard on issues to help solve the problems in this country. 
   Congressman Shimkus, you are right. I didn't realize until you showed the chart, how much under Democratic leadership oil prices have gone up. It is staggering. And gas prices have gone up, too, under Democratic leadership in this Congress. 
   Congressman Shimkus knows, too, that we have tried very hard on the Energy and Commerce Committee to have rational, comprehensive solutions in this country. We had a bill recently where Congressman Shimkus tried to get some of his legislation into this bill that would have helped a great deal, the coal-to-liquids technology, and it was stifled. They wouldn't allow it in. 
   What kind of bill did we get. Congressman Shimkus is right, ``no'' is not an energy policy. We got no energy policy. We got a bill that was energy policy in name only.  
   What they did was they had those curly light bulbs with mercury from China in them and everybody is going to put the bulbs in their homes, and that is really going to help our energy solution. That is a step in the right direction, I guess, but it is not going to solve our problem. 
   Also they looked at efficiencies in our appliances, which is a good thing, but we need to go much, much further. 
   One of the things that Congressman Shimkus talked about is supply and demand, and that is what this is all about. We haven't built a refinery in this country in the last 30 years. Congressman Garrett was talking about that. That is a problem. When all of our refineries are operating at maximum capacity, you can only get so much fuel out of them. We need more refineries in this country, and we can do it in an environmentally sound way. 
   Also, we need to spur domestic production, getting more oil, gas and coal in the United States instead of relying on countries, particularly in the Middle East, that we have been at war with recently. That is not a good idea. If it is in our backyard, let's get it here. Nobody wants to hurt the environment. Everybody wants to have clean air, water, and land. The oil, gas and coal companies do, too. 
   We also need in our energy policy to start looking 
   at other energy sources as well. That is important, getting away from oil, gas and coal, but it is not going to be in the near future. It is a pure technology-driven issue. And we need alternative sources of energy. We need solar and wind. We need nuclear. We need alternative fuels. We need all of those things, but it is going to take time. You can't do it immediately. We need to develop those technologies to where they can be brought to the public, like batteries in cars developed to where people can afford them, and develop and use alternative energy sources. And we need to develop more gas and oil here in the United States. 
   You know, Cuba allows China to drill off the coast of Florida. Yet in the United States, we can't drill in a lot of places offshore here in the United States. We can't do it. 
   Also here in the United States there are areas where we can't explore in. We hear a lot about the Alaskan Wildlife Reserve. Let's develop that here in the United States. There is a vast quantity of oil in the Alaskan Wildlife Reserve. We can develop it in an environmentally sound way where it is not going to hurt some caribou or anything like that. The Alaskan pipeline, they said that was going to happen there, yet the caribou actually like the pipeline. They use it for shelter. 
   But if we develop the Alaskan Wildlife Reserve, let's put it in perspective. If ANWR were the size of a football field, the area we are talking about drilling in would be the size of a postage stamp on the football field. The footprint we drill in would be relatively small. Oil and gas companies want to do it in an environmentally sound way. And some experts say we could produce at least 2 million barrels a day out of ANWR. We were importing almost that much from Saddam Hussein and Iraq before the war happened. We could lessen that. 
   It is ridiculous that we depend so much on countries that have been hostile to the United States on something that is so important. 
   But when we look at energy policy, we need to look at it from a multi-pronged approach. We need to look at all of the oil, gas and coal. They are here to stay for the time being. But we need to look at alternative energy sources as well. I think everybody agrees that is important. 
   We need real solutions. We need real energy policy in this country, and we are not getting it from the Democrat-controlled Congress. We have worked hard and Congressman Shimkus has worked hard in the committee to get these things done, but they stifle them every time. We need real solutions to real problems, and this is a problem that if we don't address relatively soon, it is going to come home to roost. It is a national security issue. We are putting ourselves in jeopardy, and it is wrong. It is the wrong thing to do. 
   Again, I commend Congressman Shimkus for all he does on the Energy and Commerce Committee and for doing this special order tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. SULLIVAN. (NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Chairman, I believe Mr. Honda is right on track with this amendment. However, I believe my amendment will strengthen his amendment. 
   Simply, my amendment ensures that children are educated on all aspects of global climate change, from global warming, climate science, and greenhouse gas reduction, to human activities on climate change, and the impact of greenhouse gas reduction strategies on developing nations, U.S. energy security, U.S. energy costs, and the global and U.S. economies. 
   The decisions we make today in this Congress will not only affect our children but will affect many generations to come. As the father of four children, I feel it is imperative that they know all the viewpoints on an issue so that they can make an educated decision. It is important that they obtain knowledge through schools and their parents to make informed decisions, especially when those decisions will affect the environment and the economy. 
   Our children are our country's future. What a bright future they have ahead of them. Every time I look at my four children, I think of the tough choices they will have to make on the road ahead, and hope that my wife and I have taught them to make the best decisions possible. I know that, between the education they receive at home and the education they receive at school, they will be well equipped to face the important choices later on in life. 
   It is important to me that the science education they receive in school reflect the diversity of scientific viewpoints on this very important issue. This is something my friends on the other side of the aisle have long advocated for and something my amendment achieves.  
   With 36.4 million elementary school-aged children and 16.8 million high school-aged children in our country, it is obvious that the science education they get today will dramatically affect their future tomorrow. 
   Thanks to advanced technologies, today's science classes are much more advanced than the ones I took when I was in school. Yet there are so many viewpoints out there on scientific subjects, especially climate change, it is sometimes difficult to present all views fairly to them. However, I feel that this is important, especially on an issue as sensitive and politically charged as global climate change. 
   Our children are our future, and we owe it to them to provide them with the best most balanced education possible. My amendment will help achieve that by presenting all viewpoints to students in kindergarten through 12th grade. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have long called for all scientific positions to be heard, and my amendment achieves this. I encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment and ensure that all students receive fair and balanced scientific education.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this pretend, fake, disingenuous, cruel-to-the-troops resolution. It is impossible, despite what the Democrats have claimed, to both support the troops and not support the increase in troops necessary to win the war. 
   With this nonbinding, fake, pretend resolution, Democrats maintain they support the troops but at the same time disapprove of their mission. This confusing message simply lends encouragement to the Iraqi insurgents and terrorists to believe that every roadside bomb brings them closer to their goal of a terrorist state in the heart of the Mideast.     
   The simple fact is the deployment of troops to secure Baghdad has already begun. In fact, soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division, who were deployed after President Bush's call for a temporary increase in troops, are already in Iraq doing critical work with the Iraqi Security Forces. 
   The passage of this misguided, pretend resolution does nothing except demoralize these brave men and women in uniform and invigorate those who wish America great harm. 
   The consequences of failure in Iraq could not be greater. The outcome in Iraq will directly affect America's efforts in the global war on terrorism for many generations. A victory for the Islamic militants, such as the al Qaeda members who are embedded in the Anbar Province in Iraq and the Iranians in Iraq who are provoking sectarian violence, would embolden the enemy to expand the reach of their efforts. Retreat would result in instability in the region, encourage radical Islamic terrorists and rogue regimes to expand into the region, and give terrorists a sanctuary from which to launch attacks against the U.S. and the West.

<DOCNO>Mr. SULLIVAN. (SOWING THE SEEDS THROUGH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, today I stand before Congress to offer this motion to recommit because we must encourage new innovations in domestic energy supply. This motion to recommit gives priority to grants to expand domestic energy production through the use of coal-to-liquids technology and advanced nuclear reprocessing. 
   H.R. 363 already emphasizes the need for increased science and engineer research grants, especially with regard to our Nation's young people. What it does not emphasize is the need for further diversification of our energy sources that will help achieve American energy independence and energy security. World energy demand is expected to increase by over 50 percent by the year 2030, a startling statistic, for sure. In America alone, energy demand is expected to increase by one-third. 
   There is no one simple solution to arrive at energy independence and energy security. There are, in fact, several pieces to the energy puzzle. It is vital that we wean America off unstable foreign sources of energy. 
   Congress must urge researchers to invest time and money into the rich technology of coal-to-liquid and nuclear reprocessing. We must commit to support coal-to-liquid technologies for the total life cycle, from coal extraction, through benefaction, processing, refining, packaging, distribution and end product consumption. 
   It has been said that the United States is the Saudi Arabia of coal. If we can economically produce liquid transportation fuel from coal, we could displace barrels of unstable foreign oil with barrels of domestically produced fuel. As America's most abundant domestic energy source, coal is an obvious choice to diversify our transportation fuels mix and to reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources. If we invest in coal-to-liquid fuels technology in the early stages, we can take one more step towards energy independence. 
   Several countries, including France and Japan, are already reprocessing their spent nuclear fuel. It is important for our young scientists and engineers to learn how to develop this progression of reprocessing nuclear fuel. 
   In 20 years, the number of university nuclear engineering programs has declined from 65 to 29. These young engineers should be encouraged to reuse nuclear fuel in an efficient and cost-effective way. This motion to recommit will promote our colleges to train our future scientists and engineers. In an aging nuclear workforce it is important that these young people are properly trained. 
   It is time to encourage American energy supply through the development  of coal-to-liquid and advanced nuclear technologies. With these technologies we can achieve this energy independence we so desperately need. 
   This motion to recommit will allow us to meet this energy demand on our own terms by giving priority to grants to expand domestic energy production through the use of coal-to-liquids technology and advanced nuclear reprocessing. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield some time to the gentleman from Illinois, Congressman Shimkus.

<DOCNO>Mr. SULLIVAN. (THE COUNTDOWN CREW -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Thank you, Congressman Davis. And I want to thank you for doing this tonight. 
   I also want to thank Congressman Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania for the Countdown Crew. Tax relief is very important to the American people, the American families, American business. And we are about ready to embark on the largest tax increase in the history of this country, and it is going to be very detrimental to our economy. 
   And I can remember when I got to Congress just a short time ago, almost 5 years ago. Congressman Shuster came in a little bit before me. And since that time, with some of the tax relief measures that have been put in place, we have seen just 167,000 jobs were created in December alone. Payroll, nonfarm payroll employment increased. 
   Since August 2003, more than 7.2 million jobs have been created. Workers are finding jobs faster. 
   I remember when I came to Congress back in 2002, one of the votes that I had to make, along with others, was to extend unemployment benefits. And we don't have to do that now, in large part, because of the tax relief measures that have been put in place. 
   A lot of people think that we need to keep taxing and taxing and taxing our way to prosperity. And that is wrong. 
   And my friends on the left, the liberals on the left, think that this money belongs to them, it belongs here in Washington with the politicians. And that is not where it belongs.     
   It belongs to the people who earn the money in the first place, working families, small business people. And how does that apply to somebody, let us say, that lives in Oklahoma, a small businessman or woman? Well, I will tell you how it applies to them. When I go around my district, one of the biggest things I hear about are complaints from small- to medium-sized business people, and small- to medium-sized business people employ 85 percent of the people in our economy. They either work for, own, or operate small- to medium-sized businesses. And if we allow a small business to keep more of their money, what are they going to do with it? Well, they are going to hire more people to work. It is going to create jobs, which it has done. They are going to buy equipment to expand their business, and that money is going to bounce around the economy, that dynamic economic effect of that money bouncing around the economy, and it is going to find its way back to Washington anyway, but we get to do things with it before it does. 
   One of the things too, Congressman Davis, that I hear about a lot is small business people are really complaining right now about providing health insurance for their employees. Either they have to go to their employees and say, hey, I can't cover you anymore or they have to lessen the benefit to the employee or they have to make the employee pay more of their health care cost. Now, if we provide tax relief to them, they are able to use that money to provide health insurance for their employees. The Democrats, if they allow this tax increase to take place,  we are going to have more uninsured people in this country. 
   Tax relief has been used many, many times. I remember last week or the week before that, Congressman Shuster talked about how tax relief was used when John F. Kennedy was President, a member of the other side of the aisle. And it works. He used tax relief, reducing all marginal rates. Also Ronald Reagan proposed tax relief, and it was wildly successful. We had a roaring economy. Tax relief is used by other countries in economic slow times to get out of that. It is one of the economic tools that are used. 
   We have to realize too that Washington is getting too big. Government is too big. It is unaccountable. There is runaway spending here in Washington. There is no accountability, no light of day on the budgetary process. People talk about the budget like it is a complicated thing here in Washington. Well, heck, a chimpanzee could do the budget here in Washington. You get what you spent last year; you try to get more money. You want $10 million, you ask for $1 billion and you get $10 million more, and you spend that and that goes to your baseline for the next year. 
   Instead of throwing money at all these supposed problems around here, we need to find the problems first and scrutinize the spending here in Washington, D.C. And we certainly don't need to free up more money for the politicians in Washington, D.C. to spend by allowing massive tax increases to occur. 
   So I really commend you for doing this countdown, the Countdown Crew. I want to commend Congressman Shuster for all he has done, Congressman Davis, Jack Kingston from Georgia. This is very important. And when I go around my district, even in Oklahoma, we are hearing a lot of things about what you guys are doing on this Countdown Crew. People do not want to see these tax increases occur. I talked to someone the other day that said, I am afraid that our child tax credit will go away, from $1,000 to $600. That will be critical. I have four kids. It is going to affect me. It is going to affect a lot of people. And that is what we are dealing with, people. And we want them to keep the money that they worked so hard to earn in their pockets, not here in Washington. 
   And, again, I want to thank you for having me here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I stand here today in support of this resolution, House Concurrent Resolution 74, addressing the need for additional research into the chronic neurological condition hydrocephalus. 
   This disease, for which there is no cure, affects an estimated 1 million Americans. Often the symptoms of hydrocephalus are confused with those of dementia, Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. When the disease is properly identified, people with hydrocephalus are able to live full and productive lives. 
   The National Institutes of Health has responded to the needs of the hydrocephalus community by working with scientists and researchers to organize a conference in September of 2005 called ``Hydrocephalus: Myths, New Facts, Clear Directions.'' 
   Demonstrating the need for collaborative research at the National Institutes of Health, seven institutes were able to work together and initiate new research and treatment efforts for hydrocephalus. 
   I thank Representative MIKE THOMPSON for his work in bringing awareness to this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 52, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of American Heart Month. I commend Ms. Millender-McDonald for her efforts in bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   Beginning in 1964, the President has issued a proclamation every year designating the month of February as American Heart Month. It is important to recognize the need for greater heart health. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in America. This year alone, over 1.2 million Americans are expected to experience a heart attack. American Heart Month renews the need to recognize and respond to symptoms of heart damage. 
   Great work is being done by the American Heart Association to reach out into communities and help provide instructional programs on heart disease. It is important to have policies in place that ensure access to screening, referral, and counseling services for stroke and heart disease risk factors. 
   I believe Congress should continue to support the goals of American Heart Month. This resolution is important in that it continues to encourage Americans to take a healthy approach to living and protecting their hearts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3560. The bill is designed to make technical corrections to policies we enacted in this and previous Congresses. 
   Specifically, this bill, at its core, corrects a technical error in the funding level for the extension of the QI-1 program that was passed earlier this year as part of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. The QI-1 program provides for the government's payment of Medicare part B premiums for certain low-income beneficiaries through the State Medicaid program. 
   In addition, this bill provides an important correction in FDA policy regarding the development of antibiotics. This provision would have been in the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act that we passed last year; however, it was dropped at the last minute because of PAYGO reasons. 
   Finally, this bill provides the Secretary with additional authority to perform education and outreach activities as part of the Medicaid Integrity Program established by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. 
   This bill is fully paid for, with some money left over to spare. The offset for this bill is the use of the State Public Assistance Reporting Information System. This system provides States with a tool to improve program integrity and go after fraud and abuse in the administration of public and medical assistance programs. This system does this by matching program enrollment data, such as Medicaid enrollment data, with data from other States which determine possible duplicate payments. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation. However, I do want to remind Members that the need for a technical bill might not have arisen if the majority would have involved the minority in the crafting of the Medicare bill passed in July. The majority should have provided the minority time to review the legislation and offer a motion to recommit. 
   I support this legislation, but I hope moving forward the majority will include the minority when writing major legislation. 
   I yield as much time as the gentleman may consume to my friend from Michigan, DAVE CAMP.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, thank you for yielding me the time in supporting this legislation to reduce mercury exports from the United States. 
   I am pleased that this bill has come back to us from the Senate and want to congratulate all the people who have worked so hard to make this legislation a reality. This bill is proof that people of all political stripes can come together for the common good. It is a shining example of how our process in Congress can work and work well if given the chance. 
   Elemental mercury presents a serious American health concern even when it is mishandled in distant countries. Specifically, this form of mercury converts into neurotoxic methylmercury that comes back to the United States in the form of tainted fish and polluted air. 
   This legislation attempts to break the global transport cycle of mercury by banning the export of elemental mercury in 2010. It does not cover coal exports and is not intended to cover fly ash exports from coal combustion or elemental mercury in manufactured consumer products. 
   This bill also assures that domestic stocks of elemental mercury, which are a valuable commodity, have someplace to go. Under the consensus language we are considering, a safe domestic storage option will open when the ban commences. Further, the legislation does not preclude private storage solutions. I am glad that this bill allows enterprising folks to facilitate good environmental policy. 
   In addition, I am pleased this bill recognizes that we should not punish people who do the right thing. Private entities who want to take advantage of the government-sponsored storage option must pay their fair share, but they will be indemnified against any environmental damage after the government takes possession of their mercury. This is commonsense policy and a key feature of ensuring that the proper handling and the safe, long-term storage of elemental mercury occurs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased with the compromise, bipartisan legislation. It represents the serious give and take by both parties. I hope that efforts like this will continue to be more the norm than the exception throughout this Congress and future ones as well. 
   I urge my colleagues to support S. 906. 
   And I would like to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey to address another concern.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday was the third anniversary of the Supreme Court's 2005 decision in the Kelo v. City of New London case. 
   In that decision, a divided Supreme Court ruled that the government may take people's homes and bulldoze them to make way for strip malls or other private development in order to increase tax revenue. 
   The negative effects of this far-reaching decision places all private property owners at risk. No property owner is safe if the government decides that their land would serve a better purpose and be an economic gain if something bigger and more taxable were in its place. 
   To combat these unjust property takings, I introduced H.R. 6219 to protect the rights of the private property owners. With this bill, all Americans now have the tools they need to fight unjust property takings and defend their homes and small businesses. 
   The government has overstepped its bounds in taking private property from people. It has also done the wrong thing in not allowing us to drill for oil and gas in America. It is very important that we get it in our own backyard. A lot of people on the Democratic side talk about alternative energy sources, and that is good. And we as Republicans believe in that. But also, we believe we need to get energy right here in our own backyard as well as we need to develop these technologies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the rule for H.R. 1684. This bill in its current form would eliminate the critical Federal 287(g) program, which serves as a force multiplier for immigration enforcement across our Nation. 
   The 287(g) program is a highly effective, voluntary partnership that provides the legal authority and training for States and local enforcement to investigate, detain and arrest illegal aliens on civil and criminal charges and grounds in the course of their regular duties. 
   Unfortunately, an amendment offered in the Rules Committee to reauthorize this important program was not made in order, jeopardizing the future of this popular program with local and State law enforcement agencies across our Nation and in my district. 
   Illegal immigration is a serious problem in eastern Oklahoma, and securing a 287(g) designation is a top priority of mine. I am working diligently to see that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officials and the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office partner in this program; 287(g) would provide them with the resources they need to deal with the ever-growing criminal alien population in Tulsa. I am pleased with the progress we have made and recently learned from ICE officials that we are in the final stages of making 287(g) a reality in northeastern Oklahoma. 
   The 287(g) program is working to stop the catch-and-release practice that allows dangerous criminal illegal aliens to remain free in communities across our Nation. It would be foolish for the House not to reauthorize this critical program. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this ill-considered rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4, legislation that effectively places the Federal Government in charge of the prescription drug program seniors participate in and jeopardizes seniors' ability to choose the Medicare plan that best fits their needs. 
   The Medicare Modernization Act wisely provides Medicare prescription drug plans with powerful free market tools that drive deep discounts in prescription drug plans. Seniors deserve low drug prices, and that is what they are getting with Medicare part D. 
   American taxpayers are also benefiting under Medicare part D. In fact, since 2003, taxpayers have saved $96 billion through competition among health plans. We are already seeing competition drive down prices and provide lower costs to Medicare beneficiaries. Competition is the reason why. Premiums have dropped from $37 to $22 per month, and the average monthly bill seniors spend on prescription drugs has fallen 54 percent, saving seniors an average of $1,200 a year. Ninety percent of all Medicare beneficiaries and more than 90 percent of seniors in Oklahoma are seeing real discounts on their prescription drugs. 
   If the government is allowed to set costs and control prices with Medicare part D, it will limit access to drugs, and seniors may lose the right to choose plans. This problem already exists in the Veterans Administration. A quarter of our Nation's veterans who receive VA health care benefits are also enrolled in Medicare part D. 
   This bill shows a clear difference between Democrats and Republicans. We want free market choice for our seniors instead of one-size-fits-all bureaucratic programs that will deny seniors the opportunity to choose drug plans that serve them best. 
   Let's not jeopardize a good benefit that 80 percent of our seniors are satisfied with and is providing real savings to taxpayers and seniors alike. I urge a ``no'' vote on this measure.
