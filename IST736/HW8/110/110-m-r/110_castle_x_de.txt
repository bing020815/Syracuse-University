<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill before us and consider it a good mix of fiscal policy solutions. Others before me today have already described this legislation in some detail, so I'll refrain from repeating what's already been said. However, I think the approach agreed to by the administration and House leaders from both parties is prudent and responsible. It is no simple matter to find an artful mix of fiscal policy solutions that will stimulate the economy yet mitigate inflationary risks. 
    As this legislation moves on to the Senate for further consideration, the House and administration should be open to other ideas. There is much at stake and the other body knows that we can always return to this issue if the results of this package need adjusting. We have to recognize that we alone cannot solve an economic slow down. The Federal Reserve will play a major role by setting interest rates and the costs of borrowing at levels commensurate with economic conditions. So some restraint and caution is needed at times like these. 
   This stimulus package uses a variety of fiscal policy tools--some that will have long term benefits like accelerated depreciation, and others that will have a more immediate impact like recovery rebates. While we can debate the particulars and merits of exactly who is eligible and for what amount of rebate, history shows us that programs like this do positively impact the economy as Americans pay down debt or make modest purchases. 
   Homebuilding is a major part of our economy, and that industry sector employs many, many Americans. Housing starts this year are forecast to be half of what they were in 2007, and the current stock of new and existing homes on the market is increasing markedly. Therefore, I am particularly pleased that the size of loans the Federal Housing Administration can insure is increasing, and the size of loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can purchase will be temporarily increased. This will benefit homeowners who are in a subprime mortgage and struggling to make payments now or when their loan resets. 
   Finally, the accelerated depreciation schedules included in this package are very important components. As businesses find it advantageous to replace existing equipment or purchase new goods for expansion purposes, the effects of these decisions will be vast and have a positive impact for those that manufacture the equipment or goods, on those that install and in turn use these new or upgraded resources. 
    All in all, Madam Speaker, I think we have taken some very sound steps here with this bill. Much is at stake here, and we need to move with care and consideration.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (MICHELLE'S LAW -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding to me. 
   I also rise to ask my colleagues to support the legislation before us today, Michelle's Law, which will prohibit insurers and group health plans from terminating coverage of dependent college students who lose their full-time student status due to a serious illness or injury. 
   As you may know, some insurance plans allow college students to remain covered as dependents only if they attend a post-secondary institution full-time. As a result, this may force college students throughout the country with serious illnesses or serious injuries, who are dependent upon their parents' insurance, to make the difficult choice of pursuing a college education or taking care of their health. 
   Mr. Hodes just spoke about Michelle Morse who died tragically of colon cancer in 2005 after going against her doctor's wishes and maintaining her full-time course schedule to maintain her health insurance. 
   In my home State of Delaware, Michelle Rigney, a University of Delaware student diagnosed with melanoma when she was 19, and cancer advocate who I had the honor of working with several times over the last few years, also recently lost her battle with the disease. 
   Throughout her battle with cancer, Michelle Rigney advocated for the passage of this bill to make things easier for others in similar situations. Michelle expressed her concerns over insurance to me as well as the importance of easing the stress students with a serious illness face when deciding between an education and their health. 
   I believe strongly that Michelle's Law will give seriously ill and injured students and their families the time they need to decide what their next steps should be without the fear of losing their health insurance. CBO estimates that the bipartisan H.R. 2851 would have no significant impact on the budget. Additionally, this commonsense legislation has been endorsed by several key health and insurance groups, including the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the National Education Association, America's Health Insurance Plans, and the American Diabetes Association. A full list of groups that endorse this bill will be submitted for the Record, and indeed, Representative Hodes sent up letters already doing that.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Ohio for yielding and for his work on this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3087, legislation requiring the administration to work closely with Congress and our military leaders in communicating a comprehensive post-surge strategy for Iraq. 
   Since 2003, over 3,800 American military personnel have been killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and more than 27,000 have been injured. These are very difficult times, and it is our duty to do everything possible to support those who have risked so much in service to their Nation. 
   To this point, however, the U.S. Congress has been consumed by partisan infighting, which has resulted in gridlock and has prevented debate on substantive proposals like the Iraq Study Group Recommendations Implementation Act. 
   The American people deserve a straightforward understanding of our involvement and long-term objectives in the Middle East. The legislation before us today, of which I am a proud cosponsor, takes an important step forward by requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit regular reports to Congress regarding the status of post-surge planning. 
   Clearly, the U.S. Congress should not be acting without considering the advice of our military commanders in Iraq, and this legislation will ensure that Secretary Gates, General Petraeus and other senior officials are capable of communicating developments with Members of Congress and the administration. 
   This information will also provide a greater understanding of progress made on General Petraeus' proposal for the redeployment of U.S. troops, and it will assist Congress in budgeting for the possible missions that may continue in Iraq, such as efforts to disrupt terrorist organizations and train Iraqi security forces. 
   H.R. 3087 is the first of what I hope will be a substantive, bipartisan effort in Congress to work with our military and foreign policy leaders to achieve stability in Iraq and bring our soldiers home to their families. 
   Last week, 14 Democrats and 14 Republicans endorsed such an approach by signing the Bipartisan Compact on Iraq Debate. Like Mr. Tanner's proposal, the importance of developing a clearly defined and measurable mission in Iraq is one of eight central principles agreed to in the Bipartisan Compact. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that by finally agreeing to consider H.R. 3087, Members from both parties will signal a willingness to set aside the partisan tactics that have crippled our efforts over the last several months. 
   The Iraq war provokes intense and genuine feelings from individuals at all points of the political spectrum. However, politics as usual in Washington, D.C. should not be allowed to consume our efforts in lieu of progress. 
   Bridging this critical political divide in Washington is our only hope for transitioning responsibility to the Iraqi Government and bringing about real substantive change in Iraq. 
   Let us all join together to support H.R. 3087.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, with ongoing high oil and gasoline prices and the conference on global climate change taking place in Bali, the time for making investments to secure our energy future is now. 
   H.R. 6 is a strong first step toward reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, which is a real security concern, addressing climate change, and protecting public health, while saving consumers money on energy bills and providing business opportunities in the energy market, which will stimulate economic growth and create new jobs. But we must not stop short of addressing climate change. Scientists say that if we are to have a good chance of avoiding potentially catastrophic repercussions of climate change, we must reduce emissions 60% to 80% by 2050. Through cap-and-trade, based on a sound energy policy foundation, Congress can deliver the kind of reform business and industry need to grow the economy, stabilize the climate, and create more diverse and secure sources of energy. I sincerely hope the Speaker keeps her commitment to address this critical issue. 
   The Energy Independence and Security Act, includes many provisions that I have previously supported in earlier iterations of the legislation in January and August. It increases the fuel economy for automobiles to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, requires that 15% of our electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2020, includes important energy efficiency provisions for buildings and appliances, a renewable fuels standard with safeguards under the Clean Air Act with specific incentives for cellulosic biofuels, and continues and makes new investments in renewable energy production through the repeal of subsidies for the oil and gas industry. 
   For the first time in 30 years, the bill ensures that our automobiles go farther on a tank of gas by raising fuel efficiency, or CAFE, to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, which is both aggressive and something manufacturers feel they can achieve. This is an historic achievement. With close to $100/barrel oil, $3.00 a gallon gasoline, and a nearly one billion dollar deficit in our balance of trade from oil imports makes increasing our fuel economy so critical. I have long believed that reasonable CAFE standards are both achievable and practical and would have a positive impact on fuel consumption in this country. While the issue of raising CAFE standards is not new and the proposals for how it should be achieved have differed greatly, I am pleased to support the agreement Congress has reached. 
   Another key measure is the requirement of a 15 percent national renewable electricity standard, which will help lower energy costs, create new jobs and help diversifying our energy portfolio with clean, renewable sources,  like wind and solar energy. This standard will hopefully begin to ease pressure on natural gas prices and help reduce carbon emissions quickly. While I am a cosponsor of legislation to create a 20 percent national renewable electricity standard, complimenting Delaware's recently adopted standard and effort to harness offshore wind energy, this compromise will go a long way in helping to keep our air and water clean and in our effort to address climate change. 
   Finally, I strongly support the key tax provisions, such as the 4-year extension of production tax credit for qualified renewable energy, like wind, and credits for residential efficiency measures, that will help us make strong investments in clean, renewable energy sources, and help address affordability and availability.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the legislation's amendment before us today. I never thought I would be involved in a love fest in a discussion for reauthorization of Amtrak. I would like to credit that to Chairman Oberstar and everybody on the committee who put this together. On Monday I submitted an important amendment to the Rules Committee which fortunately has been included as part of this manager's amendment. 
   For anybody who has driven on I-95 recently, it is strikingly clear that highway congestion has become a critical problem threatening business productivity, increasing safety risk and hindering efforts to improve air quality. In fact a recent study found that road congestion in the top four metropolitan areas cost Americans 4.2 billion hours and 2.9 billion gallons of fuel sitting in traffic delays. Try multiplying that by $4. 
   In contrast, passenger and commuter rail systems have proven to be the most efficient options for travelers in heavily congested areas of the country. Between Boston and Washington, ridership on Amtrak has surged 20 percent with nearly 2,000 trains operating along the corridor every day. Clearly the Northeast's entire transportation system would stagger to a halt if these trains ever stopped running. In fact, a few weeks ago, I was pleased to welcome Ranking Member Mica to my home station in Wilmington, Delaware, to discuss the importance of rail transportation in alleviating congestion in the Northeast.  
   In this era of high gas prices, congested roadways and overcrowded airports, rail transportation has become imperative for many travelers. For this reason, I strongly support the provisions in the bill to begin developing a high-speed rail corridor between New York and Washington, D.C. 
   My amendment to this bill will simply ensure that proposals to build a high-speed rail system in the Northeast allow for station stops at the corridor's busiest rail hubs. For example, last year nearly 1 million people boarded or exited a train in Wilmington, Delaware, which is centrally located on the corridor between New York's Penn Station and Union Station here in Washington. As a regular Amtrak commuter myself, I can attest to the fact that thousands of travelers rely on the Wilmington train station when it comes to visiting friends and relatives who are traveling for business, making it the fifth busiest station on the Northeast Corridor. Therefore my amendment makes clear that heavily utilized high-ridership stations like Wilmington should be included in any proposal for building a high-speed rail system in the Northeast. 
   As co-chairman of the House Passenger Rail Caucus, I commend Chairman Oberstar, Congressman Mica, Congresswoman Brown, Congressman Shuster and everyone who has worked hard to expand transportation options and cut delays for travelers in this part of the country.     
   Mr. Chairman, I thank the committee for including my amendment as part of the legislation before us today. I believe this bill is vital to exploring the untapped potential of passenger rail, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on these critical transportation issues.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the three amendments before us today to H.R. 2642. Our troops have done incredible work in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it is critical that we provide them with the protective equipment, operating funds, and counterterrorism resources necessary to execute their missions. For this reason, I support the funding in this package for vital priorities like mine resistant ambush protected vehicles, IED jamming devices, military healthcare, traumatic brain injury research, and military family support programs. 
   As a leader of the House Committee on Education, I have long advocated for a permanent expansion of GI Bill education benefits for veterans. For the first time, the funding in this package would reward those soldiers who stepped forward in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks by allowing them to receive expanded education benefits in proportion to their period of service. The men and women who serve in our Nation's armed forces deserve the opportunity to pursue an education and I believe this provision represents a significant step towards the realization of that goal. In addition to financial assistance, our government must help veterans cut through the red-tape surrounding GI bill benefits and I have introduced legislation to aid our soldiers in making this transition. 
   There has to be an incentive for the Iraqi government to make political progress and it is critical that we begin shifting the day-to-day combat mission over to the Iraqi security forces. I continue to oppose proposals in Congress that would hamstring our troops by setting a hard deadline for troop withdrawal. Last September, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker outlined a responsible plan for gradually redeploying our troops from Iraq and I believe this plan should move forward in a way that maintains security and stability in the Middle East. Therefore, I support provisions in this bill that would set a goal of redeploying a majority of our combat troops from Iraq by the end of 2009, while permitting forces to remain in the region to conduct counterterrorism operations and assist the Iraqi security forces. Clearly, our military and foreign policy leaders must retain the ability to react to conditions on the ground and I believe this provision allows them the appropriate flexibility in executing their mission without conditioning troop funding on arbitrary timelines or an immediate deadline for troop withdrawal. 
   Additionally, I support language in the bill that would improve transparency and oversight of contractors to prevent waste and abuse in government spending. In the same way, I support sections of the bill that would require better accountability from the Iraqi government by providing an incentive for a greater Iraqi investment in the country's reconstruction. Embracing a comprehensive regional diplomatic initiative, ensuring American soldiers are properly trained and prepared for deployments, and prohibiting torture are also key provisions which I continue to support. 
   Lastly, while I intend to vote in favor of this emergency spending package, I continue to have deep concerns about the manner in which it was brought forward. In my estimate, the leaders of the House have unfairly manipulated congressional rules in severely limiting debate on this measure and restricting input from both Republicans and Democrats. Rather than using this issue as a tool to score points politically, Members from both sides of the aisle should come together in support of a workable policy to bring our troops home. 
   To date, over 4,000 American soldiers--including sixteen brave Delawareans--have lost their lives in Iraq. Close to 500 U.S. service members have also died in Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to embrace the substantive areas of this bill where we can find agreement, and join me in committing to a bipartisan approach for achieving stability and bringing our troops home to their families.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding and for all his work on the this issue. I also obviously thank my coauthor and good friend on this, Diana DeGette, for her tremendous work on it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise, obviously, in strong support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which ethically expands the current Federal embryonic stem cell research policy. 
   I think we should make a note, this is a Senate bill we are dealing with now. It's changed from our House bill. While we considered similar legislation before, and we have referred to it, this bill has since been expanded to develop methods of deriving stem cells without destroying a human embryo. That's an addition to what we have considered before. 
   With this bill we have a real opportunity to make history, to jump-start research, which may lead to treatments and cures for countless diseases, including diabetes, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, ALS, multiple sclerosis and cancer. 
   There are a number of things being stated here that I consider to be myths, and I would like to try to correct some of these in the brief time that I have. 
   First, this bill does not expand Federal funding and, in fact, does not contain any funds whatsoever. The expansion in the bill refers to the source of the embryos and the quality of stem cell lines. These stem cells would be developed from embryos that come from IVF clinics, which receive no Federal funding. There would be no Federal funding involved in that whatsoever. 
   Second, it is important to understand that we are only talking about research on embryos that would otherwise be thrown away as medical waste. 
   That is a decision which is made by those who created the embryo and whoever was running the IVF clinic before the subject of using them for research was ever brought up. So you are dealing solely with embryos on which the decision has been made to have them eliminated as medical waste, because, simply, they don't want to continue to pay for the storage of the embryo or whatever it may be. So anyone who refers to it as killing needs to understand that's going to happen anyhow. That's a decision that's been made. No stem cell would ever be taken from an embryo that was not destined to be destroyed in any event. 
   Third, the bill specifically states the embryos must be created for purposes of fertility treatment, and no money may have exchanged hands. We think there should be a greater ethical process in all of this, and all of that is spelled out very carefully in this particular legislation. 
   Fourth, as to the recent announcement of returning mature cells, perhaps, in the skin to an embryonic state which we have been reading about in the last day or two with respect to mice, we need to point out a couple of things: One, that's mice, not human beings; and there is a vast difference. Another interesting point is that these  would not be eligible for Federal research dollars because they were derived after August 9, 2001. 
   Fifth is this whole issue of pluripotency and what could be done here. There is the constant argument here that adult stem cells have actually been able to resolve some problems. I am all for that. I am 100 percent for all the medical research which goes on. That's what this is all about. 
   I believe the embryonic stem cells can extend beyond that. I believe the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, which is supported by so many scientists in this country, is what can make a difference. You don't see that in the others. I would encourage everybody to follow the medical and scientific institutions who are in support of this. 
   Just finishing the point with respect to the pluripotency, nothing has been stated with respect to the embryonic and umbilical stem cells, that they do have the same pluripotency, as do to embryonic stem cells, which can develop into any cell as far as your body is concerned. 
   There are approximately 500 medical and scientific universities throughout the country, and various other individuals and groups, Michael J. Fox and others, who support the stem cell research and ask us to vote in favor of lifting restrictions on potentially lifesaving medical research. 
   I would encourage a ``no'' vote on any motion to recommit to restructure the legislation and a ``yes'' vote on the underlying legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The amendment I have offered with Representative Welch today is meant to complement the underlying legislation and help us better utilize the Federal student loan program. I am supportive of H.R. 5715, which I believe will help prevent instability in the student loan market and ensure students have access to funds for higher education. This amendment doesn't alter the base bill but can help us learn more about rising costs. 
   As you know, the committee has actively worked to identify causes of rising college costs while tuition rates continue to increase more rapidly than household incomes. This rate of increase continues to prove to be overly burdensome for both students and families as they save and borrow to pay for higher education. 
   Adding another layer of complexity is the existing slump in credit markets. For this reason, several lending institutions have recently announced that soaring lending costs have caused them to decrease availability of new loans to American students. 
   Today, I am pleased Congress has the opportunity to vote on this bipartisan legislation to protect students and families by ensuring disruptions in the financial markets do not prevent students from pursuing their higher education goals. 
   I believe this legislation can help restore investor confidence in the marketplace, provide additional flexibility for parents through a new, optional grace period for PLUS loan payments until after their children graduate, as well as ensure that parents struggling with mortgage payments are not automatically denied credit through PLUS loans. 
   Also, this bill expands loan availability through higher unsubsidized Stafford loan limits. This provision, along with a provision passed under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 which increased loan limits on federally subsidized loans, enables students to receive more Federal funding, reducing reliance on higher cost private loans. 
   Although I strongly support these provisions, I believe we have an opportunity here to determine what impact, if any, these changes have on tuition, fees, and room and board costs and private loan borrowing by students and parents. 
   The amendment I am offering today does just this. The amendment will provide for a review and evaluation by the Government Accountability Office, GAO, of these two aspects of higher education. 
   Specifically, the GAO study will examine institutions of higher education over a 5-year time period to look at whether tuition, fees, and room and board increase, decrease, or remain neutral after the increases in loan limits take effect, as well as whether the amount of private educational loans taken out by students and their families to pay tuition, fees, and room and board increase, decrease, or remain neutral. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment to shine some light on possible causes of the rising cost of higher education and also urge support for the base bill to maintain access to the Federal student loan program. 
   I thank Mr. Welch for working with me on this amendment and for speaking in favor of this bill yesterday before the House. And we would just like to say that I just think it is so important that we deal with the costs of higher education as well as the financing of higher education. Hopefully, by this add-on, we will be able to do at least a little bit of that. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, regrettably, I rise in opposition to the Fiscal Year 2007 Emergency Supplemental Spending bill. 
   Earlier this year, our military submitted a request to Congress for emergency funding to protect our brave soldiers, and it is our duty to respond to this important request in a timely fashion. Unfortunately, the legislation before us today includes billions of dollars in non-emergency spending and numerous provisions relating to troop withdrawal not requested by the Administration, which have the potential to delay passage of this vital emergency funding. 
   Much of the extra spending included in this bill will go to wasteful pork barrel projects and non-emergency subsidy programs, including millions of dollars for spinach farmers in California and peanut storage in Georgia. While I have strongly supported some of the policy provisions added to this bill, such as the minimum wage increase and expanded funding for homeland security, I am concerned that the Democratic leadership is attempting to hold critical resources for our soldiers in limbo in order to force political votes. 
   Our military leaders on the ground in Iraq have warned that disruptive changes in day-to-day operations will occur without immediate supplemental funding. In fact, the acting Secretary of the Army recently stated that if it does not receive additional funding by the end of April, the military will be forced to start making difficult decisions, such as postponing repairs on equipment. Sadly, rather than providing our military with the tools it has requested, the Democratic leadership is forcing a political agenda, which is certain to lead to an impasse with the Administration and further delay this important funding. 
   I have disagreed with many aspects of our strategy in Iraq, and I have worked hard to convince our government to change its course in the region and begin pursuing robust diplomacy to end the conflict. Indeed, I am hopeful that my efforts, and those of my colleagues, have prompted the Administration to begin engaging in an intense diplomatic initiative to establish peace and stability, so that our troops may return home to their families. However, when it comes to funding for our soldiers who are serving in harm's way, it is not appropriate for Congress to set arbitrary timelines for withdrawal or condition military resources based on partisan objectives. It is important that our strategy in Iraq include goals for bringing the troops home, but excluding the judgment of U.S. commanders and mandating an exact deadline for withdrawal--regardless of the situation on the ground--would endanger our brave soldiers. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President has pledged to veto this legislation due to the inclusion of non-emergency spending and policy provisions. We can not afford to waste precious time arguing over disingenuous political proposals and extraneous pork barrel spending projects. I intend to vote against this bill and I will adamantly oppose any attempts to play politics with funding for our soldiers.

   Mr. CASTLE. Madam Chairman, let me thank the gentleman from Florida tremendously for his work on this. And I, too, rise in strong support of the Hastings-Castle amendment expressing congressional intent that the operations and grants budget for the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program receive adequate funding. 
   I understand Chairman Dicks and Ranking Member Tiahrt are willing to accept the amendment; so I will be brief. 
   By helping local communities share the stories of the men and women who resisted slavery through escape and flight in the underground railroad, the Network to Freedom is a tremendous historical resource. Without continued and adequate funding, efforts to operate and provide grants to support a variety of underground railroad preservation and interpretive projects throughout the United States will be greatly diminished. 
   Promoting programs and partnerships to commemorate this time in history and educating the public about the historical significance of the underground railroad are vital. It is for this reason we offer this amendment today. 
   Again, I would like to thank the distinguished gentleman from Florida. We in Delaware have a lot of involvement with the underground railroad during that time. I think it is a significant part of our history.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding to me, and I do rise in support of H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act. 
   This legislation builds upon a strong foundation of the National Environmental Education Act, NEEA, a law originally passed in 1990 to coordinate the Federal Government's environmental education programs through the Environmental Protection Agency, which we know as the EPA. 
   I believe strongly in the need for environmental education--our dependence on fossil fuels, growing global warming pollution, and skyrocketing energy costs are all major concerns that require multi-pronged approaches. I believe environmental education is the tool of choice in tackling many of these issues. Never before has it been more imperative that we educate not only the next generation of scientists, but also the next generation of environmental stewards. 
   Environmental education fosters greater appreciation among Americans, beginning in the classroom and extending throughout their adult lives, for the role we all play, collectively and as individuals, in shaping a greener world. Through the NEEA, the Federal Government is playing a strong role in environmental education, promoting science to meet the challenges of the 21st century, and helping to foster a green economy. 
   I believe this legislation takes a number of steps which work to bolster environmental education and ultimately benefit our Nation's students, such as extending for one year the NEEA, strengthening the existing environmental education and training programs so that it focuses on creating opportunities for enhanced and ongoing professional development, and developing a National Capacity Environmental Education Grant Program under NEEA to develop elementary and secondary environmental programs. 
   I am also pleased that this bill includes language that I offered before the Committee on Education and Labor to ensure that the programs and activities funded under the NEEA are, in fact, quality programs and activities by requiring participants to report on and subsequently making public the progress they make on a number of quality indicators. Important indicators which foster the understanding and appreciation of the environment, such as enhancing the understanding of the natural and built environment, fostering an appreciation of environmental issues, increasing academic achievement in environmental issues and in related areas of national interest such as mathematics and science, increasing the understanding of the benefits of natural environmental exposure, increasing the understanding of how human and natural systems interact with one another, and broadening the awareness of environmental issues for funded programs and activities. 
   As I stated earlier, I believe strongly in improving educational achievement  and believe environmental education is an important component. Resulting from the No Child Left Behind Act, which I coauthored, all 50 States have implemented accountability measures in response to increasing concerns about the quality of our Nation's students' elementary and secondary education. I believe this amendment follows this trend by ensuring that environmental education, too, is of a high standard in this country. 
   While I believe the underlying legislation will help strengthen environmental education in our country, I also believe it is necessary for Congress to move forward with a broader reauthorization of the National Environmental Education Act. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues on this vital piece of legislation as we head into next year. 
   I would just point out with all the discussion we've had on the floor in the last 2 or 3 months about energy and the environment, that education such as this could be very helpful in terms of future Congresses as well. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3036.

   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6184, the America's Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008, which I am pleased to support with my friends, the gentlelady from New York (Mrs. Maloney), and I appreciate her kind comments here on the floor, and the gentleman from Chicago (Mr. Gutierrez). 
   This is an easy bill to understand and I hope an easy bill to like. It was popular enough, as the Congresswoman from New York pointed out, in committee to have passed by a 58-0 vote 2 weeks ago. 
   We all know the popular 50 State quarters program which sequentially honored every State in the Union with a design of its choosing on the back of the quarter. There are just two more States, Alaska and Hawaii, to be honored. Next year, there will be quarters honoring the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the territories, and the program will be done. 
   Mr. Speaker, the 50 State quarters program met or exceeded every goal. It honored every State in such a way that educated the rest of the country about things that made that particular State so special. The national parks quarters program is a follow-up to the State quarters, and I believe nothing could be more logical than recognizing the sites all America hold most dear, places like Yosemite, Yellowstone, or Glacier National Park. 
   The national parks quarters program will focus on the great natural beauty of our country or on other national sites important to history or conservation, such as seashores, forests, wildlife refugees, or monuments. 
   Just to mix things up a little, instead of honoring the States in the order they were admitted to the Union, this legislation honors national sites in the order in which they were recognized. I note with some chagrin but in the spirit of fairness, Mr. Speaker, that this will honor the western States that joined the Union later before the original 13 States, and ensures that my own State of Delaware will not again be first. As a matter of fact, we do not have a national park; we will be last in this particular sequence. 
   The bill also creates a special new investment-grade coin that will be three inches in diameter and made of five ounces of silver. These noncirculating coins will bear exact duplicates of each quarter and will be available only in the year in which the equivalent quarter's design is issued. Although normally our investment-grade coins are distributed only through a small network of highly specialized dealers, this legislation allows the National Park Service to buy these bullion coins in bulk so they may be sold as souvenirs to visitors. 
   The national park quarters program will start in 2010, after the completion of D.C. and the territories quarters, which is why it is so important for us to send this bill to the Senate and President quickly. We must ensure adequate time is given for the United States Mint to work with the Interior Secretary, other Federal officials, and State Governors to honor the best sites and choose each design. The Mint has done a terrific job with the State quarters, and I have great faith that the artists, engravers, and the excellent staff there will do a great job for this program as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to work on this effort with Mrs. Maloney, who joined me as a tireless and skilled supporter of the Presidential $1 Coin Act and with Mr. Gutierrez who chairs the Domestic and International Monetary Policy Subcommittee that I once chaired. Their input and suggestions from the Mint before introduction of this bill have certainly improved it. I would also like to thank Chairman Frank for his willingness to move this bill along. I urge immediate passage of this bill, and urge the other body to move it on as swiftly as well. 
   I would point out to the Speaker that the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the territories are included already in this legislation, which they were not originally as we know in the 50 State quarters program. 
   I yield to Mr. Price such time as he may consume.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (EDUCATION: THE QUALITY OF OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the education committee for yielding time to me, and I would like to share in his message which we have tonight. I remember 25 years ago when Secretary Bell issued The Nation at Risk and we had the whole discussion about the fact that America perhaps is not doing as well educationally as were other countries. I am not sure before that time that anybody had ever really tried to point the finger at that and to really reach that conclusion. We looked at our fine schools, our excellent colleges and universities, and we didn't look at some of the problems behind, and we didn't look perhaps at the fact the economy was growing on us in a way that demanded education of all children, not just of the kids that could go to the very best schools in the United States of America. But from that point on, I think there has been a focus on this. 
   The Congress has essentially done its job. There has been a great increase in funding of education, not as much on the local and State level, but at the congressional level there has been a great deal of funding increases. But we have seen many studies now which have indicated that the funding increases do not necessarily end up with a bottom line of our young students being educated better. 
   The bottom line is that we need a tremendous commitment from anybody who touches on their lives. Obviously, their parents, the teachers, the administrators in the school, the other personnel in the schools, elected officials both here in Congress and throughout the United States of America, and I think a broader understanding among all Americans, perhaps even the media, of the significance of education and how that ties in economically to what children may do in the future and to the entire future of America. 
   We have for many years now here in Congress under the leadership of Mr. McKeon and other leaders looked at education and made efforts to try to improve our educational status in our country. There is a distinct recognition of we need to do more in math and science, perhaps in geography and other areas as well, but that has not happened at the levels which we would like it to happen. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which has been with us for some time, has worked to help in that area somewhat, but it wasn't really until No Child Left Behind came along some I guess 6 years ago now that we really started to make a difference as far as education is concerned. 
   All of a sudden, now our test scores are going up in various parts of the country. In addition, some schools who are educating their best students very well are being exposed as not doing as good a job with some of their lesser students. We now have to examine these students by various categories and we have various numbers and achievement levels that have to be met for schools to make adequate yearly progress, and that has shown that in some areas of the country and in some certain school districts, that is simply not happening. In others, it is. 
   I can tell you that in my State of Delaware that I have visited many of our schools. In fact, at one time or another I visited every school in our State. It's a small State. I will tell you that some of those districts have done just a wonderful job of grabbing hold of the need to make improvements in education, of getting commitment, of getting parents involved, making sure the courses are laid out in such a way that those kids could improve. As a result, we have seen test scores grow, particularly in our elementary and middle school levels, and these kids are now doing considerably better than they had been doing before, simply because they have made that commitment. 
   It does involve standards, it does involve assessments. Some people don't like that, and we hear some concerns about it. But the bottom line is that we are making the progress that we felt that we had to make in order to improve our schools. This must continue, and I believe strongly that we have to do a variety of things to do this. We have to strengthen the parental options which are out there, make sure they understand what they can do in terms of helping education. 
   We still have State and local flexibility. That is another area that we have to continue to work on, and we have passed legislation to do that. No Child Left Behind is very demanding in terms of teacher quality, and some of the aspects of teaching, which is important as well. We have encouraged the establishment of more charter schools. That is not just to establish charter schools, it is so that they can perhaps show us the way or set an example for our other schools. For that reason, the charter school movement has had a beneficial effect on education in ways beyond just the charter schools themselves. 
   We need to be careful with our dollars, obviously. We know that is important. The whole business of standards and assessments and growth models is important too. We need to be able to  measure how we are making progress. I am not sure that we do that quite as we should. We need to do better with reading. We have learned that if we do not teach these children how to read early on, it is going to be problematic in terms of their future education. So that is extraordinarily important. 
   We just had a call for more effective measurement of graduation rates by the Secretary of Education. And I have actually introduced legislation along those lines previous to that. I am a strong believer that we need to be able to measure graduation equally throughout all of our State so we can determine what the graduation measures truly are. 
   I believe that dealing with No Child Left Behind has not been easy. There is opposition to it. There are those that believe it is too demanding. They are reluctant to try to undertake to meet the standards that are there. Many of us who will speak tonight believe we can make improvement in No Child Left Behind. As I indicated, Secretary Spellings just in the last 2 days has issued a series of regulatory changes which she believes she can make, and she has already made some, in order to improve No Child Left Behind. 
   I believe that we in Congress should assume that responsibility too. That we should not just say we don't like it, we are not going to change it, because if we don't like it and we are not changing it, it's going to stay the same. We should look at the various things that we can do in order to make No Child Left Behind more meaningful if indeed there are problems as far as that is concerned. 
   I mentioned a growth model. That is a significant aspect of this. If we measure growth, we don't have to measure that everyone has achieved the way we would like them to, but how much they have grown, which could be a factor. I mentioned the graduation rate, which is important. A clarification of multiple assessments might be important as well. 
   Obviously, information to parents is also vitally important at all times to make sure that they are involved and engaged in terms of what is happening in our schools. I have seen a program in schools just the last couple of days in Delaware, and I have seen what one person in a school can do in terms of communication between the school, the parents, and the outside. I think it makes all the difference in the world, and that is something that we should be pursuing. Supplemental education services is included in No Child Left Behind, and that is another area in which we can provide services to those kids who need it the most. 
   These are the kinds of things we need to boost. We don't need to dismiss them or throw them out because we feel that perhaps they don't work as well as they should. They do work. They make a difference as the education of our young children is concerned. 
   I would call on the media to get involved with this. I think we need to look at the comparisons with other countries, we need to look at the significance of education as it applies to the economics of what kids are going to be doing in the future. There just needs to be a greater understanding among our young people that with good education, their opportunities explode in terms of what they might be able to do. 
   So these are all things that I think we all have a responsibility for, Republicans and Democrats alike, in Congress. I believe the Secretary of Education is doing all that she can. I believe we are still at risk 25 years later. I don't want to be at risk 25 years from now. Hopefully, together we can continue to work to make sure that American education is improved to the point that we can look at everybody else and say we have without a doubt the best education system in the world. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding time. I yield back to him.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (NICS IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. I also thank those who've worked so hard on this, the gentleman from Michigan, the head of the Judiciary Committee, for his great work. Obviously, the extraordinary work of CAROLYN MCCARTHY. We know her personal story and how touching it is; and Mr. Dingell for his work on this legislation. 
   I do rise in strong support of H.R. 2640, the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. As I've indicated, many people have worked hard on this legislation, and for that we owe them a great deal of thanks. 
   H.R. 2640 would enforce existing laws to help States automate and share disqualifying records like felony criminal convictions, mental disability and domestic violence incidents with the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System database. By increasing the quantity and quality of data available for the background checks of potential gun buyers, we will strengthen a system that has proven vulnerable. 
   Funding has been provided through the National Criminal History Improvement Program to help States update, automate and improve their records. However, we were reminded of the gaps in the current Federal background check system in the wake of the Virginia Tech tragedy. A lack of reporting of those who are mentally adjudicated allowed the shooter, who should have been barred under Federal regulations from purchasing a firearm because of his history of mental illness, to purchase two handguns. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 is critical to strengthen public safety and prevent gun violence. 
   Consideration of this legislation is long overdue. As an advocate of strengthening the NICS database for many years, I am pleased to lend my support to H.R. 2640. A background check is only as good as the records included in the database, and all relevant records relating to persons disqualified from acquiring a firearm under Federal law must be included in the NICS. It is my hope that the funding provided in bill will help States to act quickly and to improve their reporting. 
   This legislation represents a true compromise, a public safety measure that will prevent gun violence and protect the second amendment rights of law abiding citizens. 
   I think it's very important to note that we have two diverse groups coming together, the NRA and the Brady Group, coming together to help work out this legislation, and both had some benefits from it. Hopefully, perhaps a lesson we can all learn here on the floor. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this vital measure, and I hope that we can support it and prevent future tragedies in our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (NATIVE AMERICAN $1 COIN ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2358, the Native American $1 Coin Act, and urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   The Native American $1 Coin Act directs the Treasury Department to mint and issue $1 coins to celebrate the important contributions made by Indian tribes and Native Americans to the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a terrific complement to the Presidential $1 Coin Act that I worked to pass last Congress with the gentlelady from New York (Mrs. Maloney). Like that program and the very popular 50-state quarter program, this bill will provide an enormous educational opportunity for parents and teachers, while at the same time recognizing the immense and important contributions of Native Americans to the history of the United States. 
   Implementation of this legislation will save taxpayers more than half a billion dollars over the next decade. When Congress passed the Presidential $1 Coin Act in December of 2005, the bill required one-third of all dollar coins minted each year to bear the design of the Sakakawea coin that was first issued in 2000. The requirement was intended to keep the image and memory of Sakakawea in the public's mind at the same time the Mint produced and issued coins bearing the images of the Presidents. 
   Unfortunately, through no fault of the design or its subject, there is not a large demand for a dollar coin with a static design. It is that problem we sought to overcome with the Presidential dollar by creating a constantly  changing design that encourages the public to look for new coins. 
   The current law requires the Mint to issue 300 to 350 million of the current design Sakakawea dollars every year, for which there is no evident demand. That would be about $60 million worth of material and labor costs per year, not including the high cost of storing the unused coin yearly. 
   The innovative legislation was introduced by Mr. Kildee, Chairman Frank, Mr. Cole and Mr. Renzi. The bill would keep the Sakakawea design on the front of the coin, but would change the design on the reverse side each year to represent Native American contributions to the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will both honor Native Americans and create demand for the coins similar to the Presidential dollars. Instead of the Mint spending $50 million or more a year to make coins for which there is no demand, the legislation has the potential to save the Treasury $150 million a year or more. It is rare that we can do something so cost effective this easily. I support the goals of this bill and urge its immediate passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I think this is a very worthwhile piece of legislation which will move forward something which otherwise would not move forward, and will save the Federal Government a lot of money and make it far more interesting to those who are collecting these coins out around the country. 
   So for all these reasons, I hope we would all support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I would just like to make two brief points, perhaps to Chairman Obey, about this bill that concern me, although I think the bill is well done. I am basically supportive of it. 
   The first is something which the President has vetoed, the stem cell research legislation. Back in August of 2001, he signed an order which allowed 21 different stem cell lines to be developed. There was a lot of discussion that in this particular bill that we could have actually updated that date from 2001 until 2007. 
   There have been 400 private lines developed since that time; that is, without any Federal dollars whatsoever. They could have been used for research by anybody if indeed we could have had it approved in this legislation. As a result of that, I drafted an amendment to do just that. But I have been informed that it will not be in order if I were to present it, so I will not present it. 
   I think this is a missed opportunity. I say to the chairman, because he was supportive of the stem cell research, that my judgment is we should do everything in our power to be able to enhance and to further that research in America. This was an opportunity which is unfortunately lost. 
   The other point I would like to make also deals with health, which is a matter of great concern to all of us, obviously, and that is the increase in NIH research. Basically, when you boil it all down, the increase here is 1.9 percent. It has been widely discussed that it's 2.6 percent. But this includes $900 million to the global HIV/AIDS fund that will be transferred immediately to the Department of State. It will not go directly into research. 
   The amount which is left is 1.9 percent, which would be almost the smallest increase for NIH in 38 years. We will lose length and quality of life to disease and disability. New research opportunities will go unfunded. The number of new therapies will continue to decline. Flat funding may discourage, along with the embryonic stem cell research going by the boards, the best and brightest young scientists remaining in the United States. Another year of failure to provide sustained, strong growth and Federal support for medical research is a problem. 
   Madam Chairman, I would hope before it is all said and done that we can address these two issues.

   Mr. CASTLE. Let me thank Mr. Barton, who has been a tremendous leader in medical research in this country. 
   I couldn't agree with him more. I think this amendment is of extraordinary importance. I would ask every single Member of Congress to think about who comes into your office, and I guarantee no less than 30 percent, maybe 50 percent, are there for health reasons. They are concerned about cancer, they are concerned about heart, they are concerned about lung, MS, AIDS, whatever it may be. That is who comes into our office. 
   We need to appropriate whatever funds are necessary in order to try to eliminate these diseases or to make these people's lives better who contract these diseases. 
   I understand exactly what the gentleman from Wisconsin is saying. He is absolutely right. You do need evaluation, and you do need to be able to understand how to get this information out to the various people who are going to apply this information. I don't believe that is happening particularly well. I do not feel that $700 million is needed for that, and if it is, it shouldn't have to go through NIH and be taken away from NIH, which is what is happening now. It should go directly to HHS or wherever else it needs to go in order to carry out that responsibility. There is a mixup, in my judgment, for these last 16 years in terms of how this funding is handled. 
   This amendment is absolutely in order, and I would hope that every single Member of Congress who believes in medical research, and I think we all do, and who believes in helping our constituents will support this.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE TRANSPARENCY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from California for his work on this bill. I think that Congressman Schiff has done a wonderful job in putting together and listening to what needs to be done on H.R. 2630, the Campaign Expenditure Transparency Act, to end the practice of making campaign payments to a candidate's spouse; and I am in agreement to the legislation. 
   While I support going one step further to prohibit the same payments to immediate family members and introduced legislation to do so, I am pleased to lend my support to H.R. 2630, which I believe takes us in the right direction. 
   Some Members of Congress employ their spouses and family members for campaign activity without abusing the system; however, the practice of paying spouses and family members creates the potential for campaign finance and ethics abuses. 
   I listened carefully to the gentleman from Texas, who I think is very persuasive, anyhow, and understand his point of view, and as a matter of fact raises a couple of valid points. One is that the bill did not go through normal committee systems, which I think is a valid point. Another is the issue of lobbying by spouses and family members, which I think is perhaps even more abusive than what we are talking about here today and is something to be taken into consideration. But I do feel that if payment to a spouse becomes part of the Member's family income, the Member for all practical purposes is receiving a direct personal financial benefit of campaign funds, and I do believe that should be stopped. 
   Obviously, if the spouse wishes to work in some other capacity, that certainly would be allowed, but not directly involved with the campaign. 
   I believe there is a transparency issue here, and I believe that 2630 does move us in the direction of increased transparency, which I think is important; and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this legislation. This may not end all abuses in campaign circumstances and in many instances there would not be an abuse, but it does end the possibility of it and certainly the transparency end of it, which I think is very important, as well. And I appreciate the gentleman yielding time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding. 
   Unfortunately, one concern that continues to arise, and has done so since I came to Congress, is the continuously rising cost of a college education. Tuition increases are outpacing the rate of inflation, increases in family income, and even increases in State and financial aid which have grown tremendously in recent years. These cost increases are pricing students and families out of the college market. In a time when we have reports suggesting that today's high school students recognize more than ever the importance of obtaining a college education, these students should not shy away because of skyrocketing costs. 
   While today's bill does seek to help graduates, it barely skims the surface of the true problem of how we can help increase access and affordability. I will support this effort but hope that this Congress will make substantive steps towards helping current and future students. 
   We have all heard the statistics, and frankly we all deserve to hear them again. According to the College Board, the cost of attending a private college has soared by 52 percent, adjusted for inflation, since the 1991-92 academic year. Public colleges have increased costs by a whopping 86 percent in the same time span. In conjunction with these statistics, we don't often taught the fact that since 2001 under a Republican Congress, direct student aid has increased from $9.6 billion to $48 billion. During the same period, the number of students receiving such aid soared by nearly one-third, from 7.6 million to 10.1 million. Yet we are still in a predicament of students needing help. We must begin to look seriously and holistically at this issue. There is neither a simple solution nor one entity responsible. 
   First, it is my belief that one of the best things we can do is raise awareness, and to force transparency in the process. Legislation offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon), which I support, seeks to provide parents and students the information that they deserve as consumers. They deserve the opportunity to understand why tuition is increasing at their universities. As educated consumers, it is my hope that they will in turn have the power to demand more, to demand answers, and ultimately drive down cost. Understanding that there are many moving parts to a solution, transparency is a good first step in the right direction. 
   Second, we all must be part of the solution. The U.S. Secretary of Education, Margaret Spellings, and the Commission on the Future of Higher Education have helped to bring the issue of access and affordability to the forefront. They too have identified areas in which they may implement solutions, such as simplifying the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Everyone is clearly beginning to recognize how they can alleviate this dilemma. 
   Third, the institutions must accept some of the responsibility. There are some fabulous colleges and universities out there making it happen for a fraction of what they could charge. For all of those, however, there are also plenty who are not being as efficient as they should be. I believe that these institutions need to take a long, hard look at every aspect of their budgets to identify savings from within. As highlighted above, despite record increases in student aid, tuition continued to increase. Some have studied and argued that there is in fact a correlation. Further, it was maintained in today's Wall Street Journal that the increase in aid will permit colleges to raise their tuitions in order to reap the benefit. Without the aid, colleges and universities would be forced to be more careful. In December, the New York Times reported that based on the fact that some  equate price with equality, some institutions raise their tuition for the sole purpose of matching their rivals. In some instances they also raise their discounts and assistance, but the fact remains that they are artificially raising the price which unfortunately may scare many students away from even applying. The reality is, Federal assistance does not give license to increase tuition. We cannot continue to offer the solutions. Don't be misled. I do support Federal assistance but do ask that colleges not take it for granted. Today's action must be coupled with responsible governing and accounting by our institutions of higher learning. 
   Fourth, I believe that Congress has a responsibility to spend efficiently and effectively. While this proposal is well-intentioned and does reach our low- and middle-income classes, it unfortunately may not be the best use of $6 billion. Ideally, this money should be more evenly spent. Aid experts and those in the academic community often identify Pell Grants, the primary source of aid for the neediest students, as the best avenue for increasing affordability. Leading up to this bill, these groups argued that the money would be best spent in this manner. In the future, I hope that this Congress spends more time deciphering the best way to appropriate taxpayers' money. 
   Finally, I believe that we have to begin gaining a better understanding of private student loans. With the escalation in college costs, students are exhausting their Federal loans and are forced to turn to private loans, something that has not been a part of the conversation. Consider this: 40 percent of private loan borrowers are from the bottom two income quartiles of students going to college. Five years ago, private loans made up only $4 billion of the $850 billion of the asset-backed securities market. Today, it comprises $13 billion. This is a completely different market and is not shaped with the policy goal of increasing access and affordability for students. There are many questions surrounding private student loans and I intend on beginning to ask these questions. If we are to tackle this issue, we must do so completely. 
   The issue of college affordability and access is complicated but one that I trust we can come together to help resolve, not just those of us in Congress but also those in academia, the lenders, students, parents and institutions.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, this group of en bloc amendments includes an amendment I have offered. 
   Although often overlooked, each military service offers active duty personnel and eligible members of the Guard and Reserve tuition assistance to take college courses during off-duty hours. For example, the Armed Forces Tuition Assistance Program offers active duty personnel up to $4,500 each year to take college courses. These important programs help active duty soldiers to plan ahead by getting an education and setting goals that match their career aspirations. 
   However, with the demands of deployments and training, many active duty soldiers have difficulty finding time to use these education benefits and face obstacles in attending the institution of their choice. In response, Congressman Hinojosa and I have introduced this straightforward amendment which gives military installations the ability to enter into partnership with educational institutions for the purpose of making course schedules and curriculum more accessible and flexible for active duty troops. Such partnerships have proven effective in certain areas of the country, and our amendment makes clear the importance of working with local institutions to assist servicemembers in taking better advantage of their educational benefits. 
   I thank the ranking member for yielding and I thank the chairman for their work on this legislation and their cooperation on this issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding, and I apologize for returning to such a mundane subject as the rule before us, but that is what I am here to do. 
   I do rise in support of this rule, and I would like to thank Chairman Miller along with Mr. McKeon and Mr. Kildee, as well as their staffs, for the work they have done over the last several Congresses to strengthen and improve the Head Start program. 
   Since 1965, the Head Start program has given economically disadvantaged children access to the same educational, health, nutritional, social and other services that were enjoyed by their more affluent peers. The goal of the program was, as it remains today, to provide children a solid foundation that will prepare them for success in school and later in life. As the centerpiece of the Federal Government's efforts to support quality early childhood education for our Nation's most disadvantaged youth, Head Start has served nearly 20 million low-income children and their families. Currently, Head Start serves over 900,000 children every day and has over 1,600 grantees across the United States. In my home State of Delaware, Head Start programs serve over 2,000 children with over 800 additional 3- and 4-year-olds receiving assistance through State Government funding. 
   Although we can agree on the need for Head Start and its successes, we must also recognize that the Head Start program is capable of producing even greater results for our children. Students who attend Head Start programs do start school more prepared than those with similar backgrounds who do not attend Head Start. Head Start students continue, however, to enter kindergarten well below national norms in school readiness. By moving to close the school readiness gap, the bipartisan Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act will improve results for almost a million Head Start students across the Nation. 
   I believe strongly in the Head Start program, particularly because of how the program helps children later in their academic lives. Despite the positive reputation of Head Start overall, however, there have been reports which have unfortunately uncovered the fact that some individuals have taken advantage of the taxpayer dollars that fund the program to line their own pockets. Along with the expertise of the Government Accountability Office and through reforms made in this bill, changes will be made to avoid these issues in the future. I feel this is the right step to take for the benefit of the program, and I thank everyone for finding what I hope will be a resolution to the pockets of abuse. 
   As I said at the outset, Head Start is an important and very popular program. The importance of early childhood education and services cannot be overstated. I believe strongly that the reforms sought with this bill will go a long way to institute needed reforms to an already successful program. 
   I support passage of this rule and the conference report to H.R. 1429.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding and for his work on this legislation. 
   I do rise to ask my colleague to support this bipartisan conference report before us today. Like almost every other Member of this body, I believe strongly in the benefits of this program. I trust that the conference report on H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act, will improve Head Start by emphasizing that every child, regardless of his or her economic status, should have the best possible chance to succeed. 
   As Mr. McKeon stated, this report is a byproduct of bipartisan collaboration and compromise. I would also like to thank Chairman Miller, along with Mr. Kildee and Mr. McKeon, as well as the committee staff for their work on Head Start. I see Ms. Woolsey in the room. I have worked with her on this issue before, too, and thank her. 
   This legislation builds upon efforts made in the past several Congresses to address weaknesses in the Head Start program and improves upon language contained in the bill to help make the program even stronger. Specifically, this report preserves and enhances the vital role of parents in ensuring the success of Head Start by establishing both a governing body and a policy council, each with specific detailed responsibilities. This conference report also maintains the current income eligibility requirement to provide services to those who need them the most. Additionally, this legislation ensures that curriculum and other materials used in Head Start classrooms are based on the principles of scientific research and scientifically valid research. Equally important, this conference agreement ensures that a greater number of Head Start teachers are adequately trained and educated in early childhood development, and that applies to Early Head Start as well. Finally, consistent with the motion to instruct I introduced last week, this conference agreement limits the compensation of a Head Start employee to Executive Level II, that of an Assistant Secretary, currently $168,000. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act builds upon the success of the Head Start program and will assist in having the program achieve even greater results. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (CREDIT CARDHOLDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. 
   Let me first pay a compliment to the sponsor of the legislation. I worked with her through a number of the hearings on this situation with credit card companies. I think she heightened the awareness to do something about this. Maybe that's, in part, why the Federal Reserve has started to move forward. I think she deserves a great deal of credit for that. 
   Madam Speaker, I do not, however, support this legislation at this time for a lot of the reasons that have already been stated. 
   The Federal Reserve, as we all know, regulates in this area. This is not one of those unregulated banking areas. They have issued a rule on unfair and deceptive practices. They have received, as the gentlewoman has properly pointed out, over 50,000 comments concerning that. Those comments have come both in opposition to their rule and in support of it, and they are now going through all of that. 
   We anticipate that by the end of the year they will issue their final, what is known as UDAP, rules on this particular subject, dealing with these deceptive practices, which will guide the consumers, which will guide the credit card companies, in which a great deal of expertise and time has been put in. I am certain that a number of provisions that are in this legislation will be included in whatever the Fed people issue, but there also may be different ways of looking at problems, there may be different nuances. Frankly, I trust their expertise to be able to do that. 
   Plus, we have the ability as Congress, or at least the next Congress does, to come back and incorporate into law anything we feel should happen. I think by doing what we are doing now by trying to pass legislation at this point, regardless of whether it could pass in the Senate or not in the next few days, we are, indeed, taking the responsibility of doing something that the Fed is well prepared to handle. I think we should leave it to them to do that. 
   For that reason, I believe that this legislation should not have come up. I prefer not to oppose it, but in the circumstances that we are dealing with, I feel that we need to oppose it. 
   There are a few points here. There is a lot of competition out there and people can go from one credit card company to another. I do not necessarily think that we are abrogating our responsibility, as has been stated on the floor here, by not supporting this legislation at this time. As a matter of fact, I think we are doing the right thing as far as consumers, credit card companies and the economy is concerned. 
   I am also concerned about who is going to pay all of this. If some of these steps are taken and all of a sudden there are losses as far as the credit card industry is concerned, does that mean fees go up? Other people who were paying lower interest rates are going to pay higher interest rates? Will they charge more at the beginning? Various steps that I don't know if I have the economic sophistication to explain, but I have a gut reaction that the bottom line is that somebody is going to pay for it. They always do in some way or another, and that could be many consumers who are presently being responsible in terms of how they are handling their debt circumstances.     
   So for all of these reasons, it is my judgment that this is legislation better not done at this time. Could it come back in the spring in the form of incorporating what the Fed has done or incorporating and polishing what the Federal Reserve issues in their rules, yes, that would be something that we should do. I think we all agree there should be steps taken in this situation. 
   But I trust those who have received all of these comments and looked at all of this and have all of the expertise to make the decisions. I would hope that Members of Congress would withhold voting for this at this time and see what the Federal Reserve is going to issue. 
   I would just add, the statement was made by the sponsor, I believe, that hoping that the Fed will act is an abrogation of our responsibility. The Fed has acted. They have issued a rule. They are getting comments. They are going to issue a final rule. I don't think there is any doubt in anyone's mind that the Fed has acted in this circumstance, so I urge defeat of this legislation if it is going to move forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (CREDIT CARDHOLDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I again thank the gentleman from California for yielding. 
   I would like to take up a couple of points that the sponsor of the bill raised. 
   One is the credit card companies in general oppose what is happening at the Federal Reserve and thereby also oppose her legislation which is here. That may be accurate to a degree, but there are a couple of factors in this. One is that many of the better credit card companies--``better'' being the ones that are paying attention to the practices--have already made a number of the changes proposed both by the Federal Reserve and what is in this legislation. 
   Secondly, I certainly support the concepts of this legislation as well as support what has been recommended in the unfair and deceptive practices rule which hopefully will get even better with the 50,000-plus comments that will come out here again in the fall. I think that's a matter of good consumer adjustment that needed to be made. 
   I also hope that consumers in general will understand the significance of understanding what they're dealing with. What bothers me sometimes is people don't understand all of their practices, but we need to make sure it's clear before them. And so I, and I think many others on this side and even some of the better credit card companies, would be very supportive of a lot of these changes which are being made. 
   The other thing that concerns me somewhat is the statement that there is no evidence that this legislation may raise the cost of credit. That may be a correct statement. But I think it is also correct to say there is no evidence that it will not raise the cost of credit. I think that's a logical conclusion. If  you take away money in one way or another, they're going to have to make up for it, and they're probably going to do that by looking at fees charged, interest rates, or whatever it may be. 
   My bottom line is you are probably going to see increases if indeed the changes as proposed in this legislation are made. 
   Again, I would urge the bill to be withdrawn. I don't expect it today, but I would urge the bill to be withdrawn so we can allow the Federal Reserve to make its opinions known and then proceed from there.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (CREDIT CARDHOLDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Madam Speaker, I hope that we listened to the motion carefully. It pertains to the issue that's been raised a couple times in the discussion, the matter of credit. 
   And what we are simply trying to do in this is to make sure that there is not a reduction in the availability of credit covered by this act to certain groups, small businesses, veterans or minorities. There is a concern that as you start to make some of these shifts that you could have a credit increase, and even though the committee held several hearings on the bill before us today, not a single witness could reassure the committee that this bill would not result in a reduction of credit. 
   Given the current state of our financial system with available credit staying locked up on the sidelines, credit cards are becoming increasingly important to make ends meet for seniors, small businesses, and average Americans. 
   Should this bill be signed into law without an appropriate effort to evaluate the impacts, Congress will have been an accomplice to the reduction in credit. 
   This motion to recommit simply asks the Federal Reserve to study the effects of the bill, and if the conclusion is that this will damage our economy and reduce credit, then we would not enact these sweeping provisions. 
   There are more than 4 million minority-owned small businesses in America. SBA data shows that some 15 percent of the capital used to open a minority-owned small business comes from the use of credit cards. There are nearly 10.4 million firms owned by women employing 12.8 million people. However, these women-owned businesses had to make an average of four attempts to obtain bank loans or lines of credit and 22 attempts to obtain equity capital. So clearly the need is there. 
   Eleven percent of the capital for women-owned businesses comes from the use of credit cards. What if that number is reduced or eliminated due to a provision in the bill? The economy obviously would take a direct hit. 
   I would also point out in closing, Madam Speaker, that this hopefully is a motion to recommit that could be supported by everybody, even those in favor of the legislation, on the basis that we need to establish whether or not there's going to be a credit hit with respect to all this before such legislation would go into place. 
   I would encourage support from all the Members of the House for the motion to recommit. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to join my colleague, Mr. Delahunt, in offering this amendment today. 
   The 2005 energy law required Minerals Management Service, MMS, under the Department of the Interior, to develop regulations for offshore wind development within 270 days. It is now 6 months past the deadline, and it appears we will keep waiting. The delay causes regulatory uncertainty and potential setbacks for pursuing the development of this renewable energy source. 
   Our amendment to H.R. 3221 would require MMS to report to Congress within 30 days on the status of these regulations. We need to know the reason for the delay and what can be done to move things along so communities wishing to invest in this clean, renewable technology can move forward. This is of critical importance to the State of Delaware, which has not only agreed to produce 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 but has made a strong commitment to offshore wind resources as a component of its energy portfolio. 
   Wind power is one of the fastest-growing sources of energy and contributes economically and environmentally to America's energy future. Electricity from wind is inflation proof and is not subject to the price volatility of traditional sources. With growing concern over climate change, wind power offers emission-free energy that will diversify our energy supply domestically, while easing demand for polluting and imported fossil fuels. 
   For Delaware and many other coastal States, our best wind resource lies not inland but just off our shores. I look forward to learning from and working with the various agencies to make sure our renewable energy resources are developed in a timely and environmentally friendly manner so States like Delaware that have signaled it is time to move forward can do so. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I'm informed that the point of order will probably be upheld here, but I would like to make this point before I withdraw the amendment. 
   Today, all members of the Armed Forces, including those serving in the Guard and Reserves, receive two-and-a-half days of leave time per month, regardless of whether they're deployed in Iraq or back in the U.S. or at their home base. 
   My amendment would simply credit soldiers one additional day of leave time for every month that they are deployed in a combat zone, and this could be used when they return Stateside. We learned this from speaking to a soldier in particular by e-mail and to soldiers more specifically about it, and realized that with some of the mental health problems which are going on, the extra leave time, not time on standby but actual leave time, would be good as far as our soldiers are concerned, and so decided we wanted to push it. 
   We tried to do it in the Tauscher bill a couple of days ago, and unfortunately, the Rules Committee did not accept it. And I tried to put it in this Defense appropriations bill, and I realize it might have limitations as far as the point of order is concerned. 
   But I think it's an important question, and I just wanted to appeal to the chairman and to the ranking member to consider this perhaps in conference, perhaps at some other time, perhaps somebody else can borrow it. I just believe it's something we ought to be thinking about doing for our soldiers who have been called back on a fairly repetitive rotating basis. In my judgment, they would benefit from this extra leave time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, the work of this Congress will not be complete until we act to tackle our greatest hurdle in this area, climate change. While this energy bill moves us closer to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future for the 21st century, we must not stop short of enacting a comprehensive global warming plan that places mandatory limits on harmful global warming pollution. 
   At a time when the oil and gas industry continues to see record profit, the tax package, H.R. 2776, which includes provisions similar to those that passed the House in January, would repeal oil and gas tax breaks and use the revenue to promote the renewable energy production and use; energy efficiency in residential property; and bonds for state and local governments to fund energy conservation efforts, among many other new incentives. I am pleased the legislation includes a long-term extension of the renewable production tax credit, however, I oppose the cap placed on the credit for wind, and hope that agreement on a straight extension of the current credit will be reached during negotiations with the Senate. 
   H.R. 3221 takes preliminary steps toward a more secure, diverse, and domestic energy portfolio that will help spur investment in new technology. The legislation repeals royalty relief for oil and gas producers on leased federal land and takes preliminary steps to address climate change. The bill restores protections to public lands that will continue to allow oil and gas development while better protecting fish and wildlife, and water resources. It sets new efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings, while authorizing billions for the research and development of sustainable energy sources and alternative fuels. And, it authorizes funding for research and development: for the higher production of biofuels, like cellulosic ethanol, which can be an economic driver in rural communities; and for carbon capture and sequestration, an essential element in addressing climate change, particularly in the U.S. where coal is abundant. 
   Offshore wind can play an important part in diversifying the nation's energy supply and easing our demand for fossil fuels. For this reason, I proposed an amendment to require  the agency charged with developing new rules for new offshore wind energy production to update Congress on their progress. These guidelines are long overdue and are not expected to be ready for over a year. We need to know the reason for the delay and what can be done to move things along, so communities wishing to invest in this clean, renewable technology can move forward. This is of critical importance to the state of Delaware who has not only agreed to produce 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020, but has made a strong commitment to offshore wind resources as a component of its energy portfolio. Without these rules, promising offshore wind projects are being delayed across the country at a time when additional clean energy could curb air pollution and climate change. I look forward to working with the appropriate agencies to make sure our renewable energy resources are developed in a timely and environmentally friendly manner. 
   I also supported a key amendment to create a 15 percent national renewable electricity standard, which will help lower energy costs, create new jobs and help diversifying our energy supply with clean, renewable sources, like wind and solar energy. This standard will hopefully begin to ease pressure on natural gas prices and help reduce carbon emissions quickly. While I am a cosponsor of legislation to create a 20 percent national renewable electricity standard, complimenting Delaware's recently adopted standard, this compromise is the first step in engaging with the Senate on this critical issue. 
   I regret that the House did not follow the lead of the Senate to tackle increasing vehicle fuel economy. Reasonable CAFE standards are both achievable and practical--and there is no question they would have a positive impact on fuel consumption in this country. While the issue of raising CAFE standards is not new and the proposals for how it should be achieved differ, it is my hope Congress will come to an agreement on a proposal that is both ambitious and achievable. 
   In the end, I supported the energy package, because it represents important progress, but we clearly have much further to go. In fact, scientists say that if we are to have a good chance of avoiding potentially catastrophic repercussions of climate change, we must reduce emissions 60 percent to 80 percent by 2050. Through cap-and-trade, based on a sound energy policy foundation, Congress can deliver the kind of reform business and industry need to grow the economy, stabilize the climate, and create more diverse and secure sources of energy. I sincerely hope the Speaker keeps the commitment to address this critical issue when the Congress returns in the fall.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to overriding the President's veto of H.R. 2082, the conference agreement on the Fiscal Year 2008 Intelligence Authorization Act. 
   As a former Member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, I believe it is vital that we provide the United States intelligence agencies with the tools and resources necessary to ensure our security. Therefore, I strongly support funding in this bill for human intelligence activities, intelligence analysis, and counterterrorism operations. Furthermore, I support language in the agreement prohibiting the use of interrogation techniques not authorized by the U.S. Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations. Our soldiers and interrogators need to know exactly where the line is when engaging prisoners and there should be absolutely no question about what is acceptable behavior and what is not. In fact, I have cosponsored legislation to require the anti-torture provisions included in this conference agreement. 
   Nevertheless, I will oppose this bill because it fails to implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendations for reforming congressional oversight of intelligence funding. In its final report, the 9/11 Commission concluded that: ``Of all our recommendations, strengthening congressional oversight may be among the most difficult and important. So long as oversight is governed by the current congressional rules and resolutions, we believe the American people will not get the security they want and need.'' 
   Last year, the Democratic leadership attempted to apply a ``Band-Aide'' to this problem by creating a powerless Intelligence Oversight Panel that has very little control over actual funding decisions. This is clearly not what the 9/11 Commission recommended. In fact, its report plainly states that ``tinkering with the existing committee structure is not sufficient.'' In May of 2007, I offered a simple amendment to the bill before us, calling for Congress to implement these crucial recommendations--but it was prevented from being considered for inclusion in this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people have insisted that we implement all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations--even those that are difficult. We will be doing this country a disservice until we put in place an effective committee structure capable of giving our national intelligence agencies the oversight, support, and leadership they need.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   And let me just start by saying that I'm in total agreement with the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller). I'm also in total agreement with Mr. McKeon. I think we all here who've worked in this area understand the importance of Head Start and understand how it can give young children an opportunity to be able to advance enough in school to be able to succeed in school. And maybe early Head Start could do even more. But we also all agree that we need to be very careful about our dollars and how we manage them. And that is the whole purpose of this motion to instruct conferees. 
   We have, as Mr. Miller has well indicated, made important reforms for the children who are served in the program. I'm delighted the Senate bill is  very similar to the House bill, and I have high hopes that we are going to be able to pass legislation that we can all agree on in the House and the Senate ultimately. 
   Here, basically, we're instructing conferees to adhere to the House provisions for a reasonable salary cap prohibiting Head Start executives from collecting a salary higher than an assistant secretary of a Federal agency, which is currently $168,000. 
   Although the House language contained in H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act of 2007, effectively prohibits any official from receiving compensation above that of an assistant secretary, legislation approved by the Senate leaves open a glaring, lavish salary loophole by allowing programs to divert their own non-federal resources away from other uses in order to pay Head Start programs operators more than top officials. We think that's wrong. We think that money should be used for the kids, for the recruiting and development of the kids, for the students who are going to be in the Head Start program to pay their teachers. 
   So for all those reasons I think we all agree that executive salaries and other benefits which are out of the ordinary should not be allowed in the Head Start programs; that we should obviously compensate people as well as possible, but make sure that after that is done, that the money that is there, be it State money or local money, is channeled in the direction of helping these young children who need so much help in order to prepare them to get ready for school. And that is something I think we all agree on. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding. 
   I do rise in opposition to what I consider to be a closed rule. I do support the underlying bill, but I object to the leadership's decision to prevent any substantive debate. 
   I offered an amendment yesterday that would have credited soldiers with one additional day of leave for every month that they are deployed in a combat zone. All members of the Armed Forces, including those serving the Guard and Reserve, receive 2 1/2 days of leave time per month, regardless whether they are deployed in Iraq or back in the U.S. at their home base. 
   I developed this legislation, an extra day per month, not from anything out of my mind but in correspondence with a soldier who had been in the combat zone. We feel very strongly that spending time with family and loved ones after returning from deployment is essential to a soldier's mental health,  and that is why I prepared the amendment and introduced it. 
   We think that it is small step to help the troops, but this amendment was denied in the rule. For that reason, I oppose the rule as we have it. 
   But I am also very disappointed that this House continues to prevent consideration of the Iraq Study Group Recommendations Implementation Act. They are now getting close to 60 Members, almost evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, who support the concepts in this. 
   My decision is that the time has come to have the discussion of the Iraq Study Group's recommendations on the floor of the House of Representatives, and I hope that can happen sooner rather than later.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. In closing, I think both of these amendments are extremely important. I sometimes understand the writing on the wall when it comes to votes on rules, but I would hope that we in this House would consider the amendment that I put forward on the extra day leave in the Iraq Study Group recommendations sooner rather than later. I think it is an important way to move towards actually ending the war. 
   So I oppose the rule and urge Members to vote against the rule.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this closed rule. 
   While Members of this body will have differing views regarding the U.S. policy in Iraq and Afghanistan, we can all agree that the American soldiers who have been deployed into these combat zones have bravely risked their lives in the service of their Nation. These men and women have done everything we have asked of them, and as we all know, many returning soldiers experience some form of post-traumatic stress. 
   Under the current Pentagon policies, all members of the Armed Forces, including those serving in the Guard and Reserve, receive 2.5 days of leave time per month--regardless of whether they are deployed in Iraq or back in the U.S. at their home base. My amendment would have simply credited soldiers 1 additional day of leave time for every month that they are deployed in a combat zone. For example, if a soldier serves 12 months in Baghdad, that soldier would be credited 12 additional days of leave to be used when he or she returns stateside. 
   Although I am obviously the sponsor of this amendment, I cannot take credit for the idea. My staff developed this legislation after talking with a soldier who as we speak is deployed in a combat zone. Corresponding via e-mail, this soldier shared his experiences in combat and offered his opinion that many of the troops returning home after a deployment would benefit from being credited with additional leave time based on the number of months they served in a combat zone. This soldier noted that the opportunity to spend some time away from military life once returning stateside would be important in terms of both mental and physical recovery. 
   In fact, the Director of the U.S. Army Medical Command's Office for Behavioral Health has stated that 15 to 30 percent of troops returning home from combat experience post-traumatic stress or other mental health symptoms. While the Army Medical Command notes that this is not unusual after combat, it underscores that in addition to receiving treatment, it is critical for soldiers returning home from a combat zone to ``spend time with family,'' ``avoid a busy schedule,'' and ``resume family routines'' as soon as possible. 
   It is clear that my amendment would not solve every problem that troops face when they return stateside. Receiving appropriate diagnosis and treatment is also vital in dealing with post-traumatic stress. And this amendment is not meant to diminish the efforts of our military leaders to provide care for soldiers once they return to the U.S. The Army's Medical Command and its corresponding services have in many cases gone above and beyond the call of duty to diagnose, treat, and prevent post-traumatic stress disorder. Still, in many cases spending time away from military life and reconnecting with friends and family is the best way for individuals to prepare to resume their service in the military. 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment recognizes the difficulties faced by soldiers who serve time in a combat zone and would assist them in their homecoming by providing additional leave time to help improve their transition. The men and women who have sacrificed so much to serve our Nation in combat have earned this additional time to spend with their loved ones. Unfortunately the rule before us prevented any substantive debate, including debate on my important amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (ADA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding. I do rise today in support of the ADA Amendments Act entitled H.R. 3195. 
   Since 1990, the landmark civil rights legislation, the Americans With Disabilities Act--ADA as we know it--has provided numerous benefits. Over the last decade, however, people with serious health conditions, including diabetes, have faced serious difficulties meeting the definition of ``disability'' following the Supreme Court's decision that disability must be determined in light of the mitigating measures, like insulin, that a person uses. 
   These decisions have created a situation where people with serious health conditions who use medications and other devices in order to work are not considered ``disabled enough'' to be protected by the ADA even when they are explicitly denied employment opportunities because of that health condition. 
   Just briefly, I would like to mention Stephen Orr, a pharmacist from Rapid City, South Dakota, who was fired by his employer for taking lunch breaks to eat and manage his diabetes. After Stephen lost his job, he decided to file a claim under the ADA. The employer responded that Stephen did not have a disability because he was able to manage his diabetes with insulin and diet. The courts agreed. And this, I'm afraid, is only one example. 
   H.R. 3195 will remedy this problem. Passage will secure the promise of the original ADA and make clear that Congress intended the ADA's coverage to be broad, to cover anyone who faces unfair discrimination because of a disability. At the same time, it strikes an appropriate balance between the needs of individuals with disabilities and those of employers. 
   I am pleased that H.R. 3195 enjoys the backing of a broad coalition of supporters from both the employer and the disability communities. I am also proud it has bipartisan support here, and I thank and congratulate all those that had anything to do with putting this together. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, legislation I have authored with the distinguished lady from Colorado, Ms. DeGette, to ethically expand the current Federal embryonic stem cell research policy. 
   We have a real opportunity to make history, to pass legislation that will jump start research and may lead to treatments and cures for countless diseases, including diabetes, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's, ALS, multiple sclerosis and cancer. There is overwhelming support for this research, with 70 percent of the American people backing it. 
   There are also 500 universities, medical societies and advocacy groups backing this research, ranging from the American Medical Association and the Academy of Physicians to universities like the University of California and Harvard University and advocacy groups like the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and the Michael J. Fox Foundation. 
   This research may also provide a better understanding of the biological origins of certain diseases, as well as an opportunity for pharmaceutical testing. 
   However, this Nation and, more importantly, our scientists are being held back by a policy that is out of date, short-sighted, arbitrary and, most of all, based on politics and not science. 
   When the decision was made by President Bush in 2001 to allow Federal funding for stem cell research on lines that had already been created, it seemed that a compromise may have been struck. However, the number of lines has shrunk from 78 to 22, and all of the lines have been compromised. 
   Since that time, over 150 new and improved stem cell lines have been created in the United States and throughout the world. Despite the fact that these lines are much easier for scientists to use and, in some cases, are disease specific, they are off limits to Federal researchers. 
   Throughout this debate, you will hear many mistruths, and I think it is important to set the stage early about what this bill does and doesn't do. First, you will hear that this bill expands Federal funding. To the contrary, this bill has nothing to do with funding. It has to do with the source of the embryos and the quality of stem cell lines. 
   Second, you will hear this bill discourages destruction of human life, or that it uses taxpayer dollars to destroy human life. To the contrary, this bill has nothing to do with destroying lives and everything to do with saving lives. 
   It is important to understand we are only talking about embryos that are going to be thrown away otherwise as medical waste. We support all options for couples, including embryo adoption, but if the couple decides to discard their embryos as medical waste, we would like them to be available to research. 
   You will hear this legislation will encourage the creation of embryos for the sake of research. Again, not true. Our bill specifically states that the embryos must have been created for the purpose of fertility treatment, and no money may have exchanged hands. 
   Even worse, you will hear mistruths spread by a physician hired by the pro-life movement. Specifically, he says cures and treatments have been found using adult stem cells for 65 to 72 diseases. However, if you look at the science and not the hype, you will see a scientific research study published by three leading researchers in the Science Magazine this past summer who found that, in truth, the number is 9, far less than 65.  
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter this study into the RECORD. 
   Adult Stem Cell Treatments for Diseases?  
   Opponents of research with embryonic stem (ES) cells often claim that adult stem cells provide treatments for 65 human illnesses. The apparent origin of those claims is a list created by David A. Prentice, an employee of the Family Research Council who advises U.S. Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) and other opponents of ES cell research (1).

   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to point out that adult stem cells were discovered in 1960, and embryonic stem cells were only isolated in 1998. And since 1998, there have been great advances in animal models in the areas of diabetes, spinal cord injury and macular degeneration. 
   Finally, you will hear about the research concerning amniotic fluid stem cells conducted by Dr. Atala at Wake Forest University. While exciting, this is nothing new, nor do these stem cells have the same capacity to divide into all cell types in the body, as embryonic stem cells do. Yet you will hear opponents say they do. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter the letter in the RECORD on that as well.

   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to continue the discussion that the gentlewoman from Colorado had on the IVF process in the clinics. There is a methodology that many people, even perhaps here, have taken advantage of in terms of being able to procreate, and that is going to an in vitro fertilization clinic, and that is done commonly in this country. 
   Right now, by survey, there are about 400,000 embryos frozen in those clinics around the country. About 2 percent a year are disposed of. That is about 8,000. Why are they disposed of? For a variety of reasons. People may divorce. Perhaps they have children. Who knows what the reasons may be, but they are disposed of. How are they disposed of? How are those 8,000 disposed of? A decision is made by the original creators of that particular embryo and by the physician running the in vitro fertilization clinic that they will be disposed of, and then they are put in as hospital waste; so they are not going to be life. It is only those embryos that would be used in this situation to develop the stem cell lines that we are talking about. It is very important to understand that they are going to be disposed of anyhow as hospital waste or are they going to be used for research.

   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado. 
   This motion is a poison pill in the greatest way, and it goes a little beyond the normal poison pill. It has basically been designed by those who would oppose the legislation in a way of trying to knock it out because they know very well we have the votes for it on the floor here today. But it goes beyond that; it actually eliminates part of the research which may be essential in the implanting of the embryonic stem cells eventually in a human being called Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer, which really doesn't relate ultimately to the human reproductive cloning. 
   I have discussed introducing legislation, I have co-sponsored legislation in the past on banning reproductive cloning. I happen to believe in that, with the gentlewoman from Colorado, we both believe in that very strongly; but the bottom line is that we need to be able to develop the research on embryonic stem cells in every way we possibly can. 
   Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer is currently legal. It is just not funded by the Federal Government. This bill does not fund SCNT in any way whatsoever. 
   The motion to recommit is shortsighted. It is very damaging to any possible future research. It should be opposed by anybody who plans to vote for this legislation. And I would hope that 100 percent of the individuals who are going to vote for our bill are going to oppose the motion to recommit which is being presented here today. 
   I think in the names of those who are supportive of it, be it Senator Hatch or Nancy Reagan or Michael J. Fox or a lot of other people, but particularly all those people out there who are ill, who have some hope, and that is what it is, it is hope, will make absolutely sure that we do not vote for the motion to recommit, that we defeat it and then, right after that, we go on to pass the legislation which is so important and vital for the future of health of people in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I rise in opposition to H.R. 1257, the Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act, which seeks to ensure that shareholders have a say in their company's executive compensation and disclosures. 
   Let me just say that I agree with both the speakers on the other side so far. There is a problem with CEO and other high-level compensation in the United States. I happen to disagree with the solution which is offered by this legislation. In fact, I would urge that this solution probably will not be a solution. I would like to go through that if I could. 
   In July 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, adopted a package of rules designed to enhance the transparency of proxy compensation disclosure for CEOs, CFOs and the other three highest paid executive officers and directors, the first major reform since 1992. These new disclosure  requirements are being implemented for the first time and are a major step forward in promoting transparency and arming shareholders with detailed information on how executives are being paid. Therefore, we are attempting to legislate in this area before there is any evidence to suggest that the current SEC robust disclosure requirements are not working. 
   The bill before us intends to prevent excessive executive compensation. Yet, at a Financial Services Committee hearing on March 8, all six witnesses agreed that a better way to prevent unmerited pay would be to require that publicly traded corporations adopt majority voting policies for the election of board members. At the present time, more than 150 stockholder proposals relating to majority voting have been filed, and more than half of the companies in the S&P 500 have some form of majority voting policy in place. Furthermore, company organization and structure is traditionally governed by State law, while Federal securities laws generally govern the disclosure of information to investors. 
   In my home State of Delaware, corporate laws are already providing shareholders with majority votes. Majority voting enables stockholders to more easily unseat directors they believe have made poor judgments. The law enables stockholders to focus on compensation committee members in particular if they so choose. 
   In addition, compensation for executives of publicly owned companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange is determined by a compensation committee that is composed of totally independent directors.     
   Clearly, the market and States are active in working in this area. H.R. 1257 intends to provide shareholders with an advisory vote on executive compensation. However, public company equity is overwhelmingly in the hands of intermediaries like retirement plans and mutual funds that manage the economic interests on behalf of others. Therefore, the actual shareholder is already two steps removed from the holders of the true economic interests in the company. 
   In addition, intermediaries often rely on advice, sellers like the Institutional Shareholder Services, ISS, when voting on company proxies. Consultants such as the ISS are often criticized for their particular biases and their lack of transparency in their decision-making. 
   It greatly worries me that this bill could set a precedent of giving activist institutional investors who may have their own political and social agendas unrelated to the financial wealth of the companies more influence. 
   This legislation presents a counterproductive change to an American approach to corporate governance that, while not perfect, has produced better results for stockholders than any other financial system in the world. I have an article written by Secretary Robert Reich about this, in which he, too, opposes the changes that are being proposed here. 
   He indicates, ``House Democrats are now working on legislation to give shareholders the right to have more say over pay.'' And that is a growing consensus, but he says it is wrong. Shareholders won't constrain the growth of CEO pay because most shareholders don't care about it. The vast majority own their shares through mutual funds and pension funds and don't know which companies they are invested in at any given moment. Then he says later, ``Depending on shareholders to rein in CEO pay is like relying on gamblers to rein in the owners of Las Vegas casinos.'' 
   That is my concern with this. While we have identified the problem, the solution which has been identified in this legislation is not the right solution. The SEC recently enacted substantial new disclosure requirements, as I indicated, governing executive compensation to ensure transparent compensation packages, and these requirements should be given time to take effect. Disclosure is a vital component of our financial system, which increases investor confidence, promotes market discipline, encourages fairness in the U.S. markets and enables more informed decision-making by investors. 
   I believe there are many unintended consequences associated with the legislation before us today. Therefore, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in opposing this legislation.

However, he opposes everything with respect to this legislation, leading up to that little squib at the end as to how he would fix that particular problem. 
   I personally think, as I have outlined here, there are many solutions to this: what the SEC has done, the majority election of directors, what the various States are doing and where this problem should be handled. For that reason, I would encourage us to look at a different method of addressing what you have identified, in my judgment a very real problem.

   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act, H.R. 1592, which will provide needed assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies and make changes to Federal law to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of violent, bias-motivated crimes against people for no other reason than their perceived or actual race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability. 
   Hate crimes are alarmingly prevalent and threaten the full participation of all Americans in our democratic society. While State and local governments will maintain principal responsibility, an expanded Federal role in investigating and prosecuting serious forms of hate crimes is critical in targeting and preventing hate crime in our Nation. The measure importantly applies only to bias-motivated violent crimes and does not impinge free speech in any way. In fact, it explicitly states: ``Nothing in this Act, or the amendments made by this Act, shall be construed to prohibit any expressive conduct protected from legal prohibition by, or any activities protected by the free speech or free exercise clauses of, the First Amendment to the Constitution.'' 
   H.R. 1592 is supported by virtually every major law enforcement organization in the country. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1592.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee for his kind words and for yielding. I also obviously thank Mr. Miller and Mr. Kildee for their work on this, and Ms. Woolsey, who has worked on it before with me. And I am pleased to be able to be here. 
   I support the legislation before us today which will reauthorize the Head Start program. And like almost every other Member of this body, I believe strongly in the benefits of this program. I trust that H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act, will improve Head Start by emphasizing that every child, regardless of their economic status, should have the best chance possible to succeed. 
   In 1965, Head Start was created to give economically disadvantaged children access to the same educational, health, nutritional, social and other services that were enjoyed by their more affluent peers. The goal of the program was, as it remains today, to provide children a solid foundation that will prepare them for success in school and later in life. 
   As the centerpiece of the Federal Government's efforts to support quality early childhood education for our Nation's most disadvantaged youth, Head Start has served nearly 20 million low-income children and their families. Currently Head Start serves over 900,000 children every day and has over 1,600 grantees across the United States. In my home State of Delaware, Head Start programs serve over 2,000 children, with over 800 additional 3- and 4-year-olds receiving assistance through State government funding. 
   We all can agree on the need for Head Start and its successes. We must also recognize that Head Start can produce even greater results for children. Students who attend Head Start programs do start school more prepared than those with similar backgrounds who do not attend Head Start. However, Head Start students continue to enter kindergarten well below national norms of school readiness. By moving to close the school readiness gap, this bill will improve results for almost a million Head Start students across the Nation. 
   Toward the goal of closing the readiness gap, the Improving Head Start Act strengthens Head Start's academic focus while maintaining its comprehensive nature that is imperative to its success. The bill improves the academic focus of the program by establishing new quality standards that ensure enrolled children develop and demonstrate language skills; prereading knowledge, including an interest in and appreciation of books, reading and writing; premathematics knowledge, such as recognition of numbers and counting; cognitive abilities related to academic achievement; and social development important for environments constructive for child development, early learning and school success. 
   Research consistently demonstrates a link between the learning potential of children and the level of education and training of classroom teachers. For that reason, we improve the quality of teachers in Head Start classrooms by requiring that in time 50 percent of all Head Start teachers nationwide must have a baccalaureate degree.     
   As I am sure some of my colleagues know, this bill does not include a proposed State demonstration project, which was incorporated into the legislation the House passed in 2003. I believe strongly, however, in the policy goals of increased coordination and integration that were and continue to be at the heart of efforts to remove barriers and prevent collaboration between Head Start and successful State and local early childhood initiatives. I believe the proposal to be offered by Tom Price of Georgia would foster integration among quality early childhood programs, and plan on supporting Mr. Price's amendment. 
   About 40 States, including Delaware, have established some form of early  childhood education, because States recognize that these services can make a real difference in preparing children for a successful future. Various local initiatives have also been launched, and today, disadvantaged children and families have access to programs and services from a wide range of sources. 
   Some of these programs rival or exceed the quality of Head Start, while others fall short. Head Start is no longer the only option for early childhood education, and we must ensure that all children are receiving the same quality education. In this new era, Head Start should be working toward integrating service with other school readiness programs not competing against them. Where we previously would have allowed no more than eight States to improve Head Start coordination with State and local efforts, this bill will ensure programs in all 50 States are able to increase collaboration. 
   We are encouraging Head Start grantees to align their academics with State-developed K-12 academic content standards, as well as to have a more active partnership with local school districts that serve the same communities. This will help to facilitate a smooth transition to kindergarten for their students. 
   Finally, we are asking early childhood providers in the State, including Head Start, preschool and child care, to come together to identify ways to integrate school readiness initiatives across the State. 
   As I have said, I believe strongly in the Head Start program, particularly because of how the program helps children later in their lives. Despite these stories, we have also heard many stories of programs in which funds were being diverted away from this purpose. 
   In 2005, the GAO released a report that warned the financial control system in the Federal Head Start early childhood program is flawed and failing to prevent multimillion-dollar financial abuses that cheat poor children, taxpayers and law-abiding Head Start operators. The GAO made some helpful recommendations on how we can strengthen the oversight structure to prevent abuses and protect good grantees. They recommended that increased competition in the program could help weed out poorly performing grantees and ensure high-quality services are available to children and families. 
   In response to the GAO's recommendations of how to eliminate financial mismanagement, we are increasing the competitive nature of the current program. The competition requirements in the Improving Head Start Act will help to alleviate these problems, but, more importantly, will drive program improvement across the board. Program improvements will ultimately help thousands of children nationwide, which should always be our goal. 
   As I said at the outset, Head Start is an important and very popular program. The importance of early childhood education services cannot be overstated. I believe strongly that the reforms sought in H.R. 1429 will go a long way to institute needed reforms in an already successful program. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I thank all those who worked on this, including the staff, and I look forward to the passage of the legislation today.

   I would just like to also finally say at the end that, in my judgment, if you look at any aspect of Head Start that this underlying legislation basically improves the opportunity for young children who are within the parameters of the Head Start program, and I hope that all of us will be supportive of that.

   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment. I have a tremendous amount of respect for the chairman of the committee, Mr. Miller, but I disagree with him on his basic premise here. 
   I do believe that the Governors of this country, which I had the chance to be one, seems eons ago now, but a few years ago, have a tremendous and strong interest in the children of their States and in the education of those children. 
   I also believe that in the time since Head Start was created, that many of these Governors have put together prekindergarten, kindergarten, early childhood programs. I think they are ready to move forward with this. I think in many instances they have been competitive with, if not even ahead of, Head Start. We basically backed off from what the White House proposed originally, which is to give all 50 States the option to do this, to a pilot program of eight States. 
   There are requirements that those eight States match these funds, in fact, put in extra money in order to be able to enter into this program of dealing with the Head Start-type programs. The State demo would be limited to States with a demonstrated investment in early childhood education and established existing preschool system. 
   You can't just jump into this and take the money or whatever. You have to show you are ready for it, and that you are ready to do it, and you are ready to put the money into it. I believe strongly that those States should be afforded the opportunity. I actually think the competition with some of the Head Start providers would be positive in terms of developing the opportunity for young children. 
   I would hope that everybody would stop for a moment and take time for a moment to listen to this amendment and the arguments pro and con before votes are cast on it. I believe Mr. Price has demonstrated through Georgia, as well as other States, that this is something which could be beneficial to the children, which is really what this is all about, hopefully helping those children in poverty so that they could move ahead. 
   I hope everybody will support the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. While I appreciate the Rules Committee making in order several of the proposed amendments, including an amendment offered by Mr. Price of Georgia to create a State demonstration program that allows up to eight States to coordinate Head Start with other State-run early childhood development programs, this rule unfortunately limits improving the Head Start Act further by not allowing for debate on several Republican amendments. 
   Although I oppose this rule, I do support the underlying bill, the Improving Head Start Act of 2007 to reauthorize the Head Start program. This legislation improves the Head Start Act by emphasizing that every child, regardless of their economic status, should have the best chance possible to succeed. 
   We all can agree on the need for Head Start and its successes. We must also recognize that Head Start can produce even greater results for children. Students who attend Head Start programs generally start school more prepared than those with similar backgrounds that do not attend Head Start. However, Head Start students continue to enter kindergarten well below national norms in school readiness. By moving to close the school readiness gap, this bill will improve results for almost 1 million Head Start students across almost all of the Nation. 
   Towards the goal of closing the readiness gap, the Improving Head Start Act of 2007 strengthens Head Start's academic focus while maintaining its comprehensive nature. The bill improves the academic focus of the program by establishing new quality standards that ensure enrolled children develop and demonstrate language skills; prereading knowledge, including an interest in and an appreciation of books, reading and writing either alone or with others; premathematics knowledge, such as recognition of numbers and counting; cognitive abilities related to academic achievement; and social development important for environments constructive for child development, early learning and school success. 
   The Improving Head Start Act of 2007 builds upon the reforms of previous reauthorizations of Head Start, as well as the requirements of the landmark No Child Left Behind Act, and the vision of President Bush and Secretary Leavitt. We all want to do what is best for our children, and I truly believe the underlying bill does that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of the Iraq war, one of my foremost concerns has been the long-term stability of the Middle East, and the potential impact that chaos in this region could have on our security. 
   Our men and women in the United States military, among the hundreds of Delawarians, are doing extraordinary work under very complex and difficult  circumstances. We owe them an enormous debt of gratitude. 
   Notwithstanding the heroic efforts of our military personnel, the Iraqi Government has been unable to overcome the constant instability and sectarian violence that has marked much of the last 4 years. We have increased top levels in the past, including Fallujah in 2004, and Baghdad this past July, with mixed results. 
   Despite the incredible efforts of our brave solders, it is clear to me that an increase in American forces alone cannot resolve this conflict. Therefore, I will support this resolution, because I believe that the surge will be unsuccessful without a comprehensive diplomatic strategy to engage the international community and turn the responsibility over to the Iraqi Government. 
   That being said, I am disappointed that today's discussion has been structured in such a way that Members are limited solely to an up-or-down vote on the troop increases. On Friday, after Congress passes this resolution, we will still lack the strategy necessary to stabilize the Middle East and bring our soldiers home. 
   This Congress owes the American people a truly complete and comprehensive discourse regarding our future in Iraq. The situation facing our soldiers is extremely complex, and it is unfortunate that the Democratic resolution fails to accurately reflect that reality. 
   In December, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group presented a comprehensive blueprint to achieve stability in the region and transfer responsibility over to the Iraqi Government, which I have in my hand and I went back and reread this week. I would encourage everyone to reread it. 
   In my opinion, one of the important recommendations made by the group was to call for a robust diplomatic effort to stabilize Iraq and ease tensions in the region. In fact, some of our Nation's greatest military minds, including former Secretary of State Colin Powell, have joined the group in recommending that every country with an interest in averting a chaotic Iraq, including all of Iraq's neighbors, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran and Syria among them, participate in this important dialogue. 
   The group also recommended that we engage the United Nations Security Council, the European Union and other international institutions in launching this new diplomatic offensive. The intensive diplomacy recommended by the Iraq Study Group should be familiar to all of us who remember the Cold War. 
   One of the best examples of this approach to diplomacy was evident when a week after President Reagan asked General Secretary Gorbachev to ``tear down this Wall,'' he sent his administration to Moscow for diplomatic talks. 
   The Iraq Study Group's recommendations are by no means a panacea. But their report does represent a new path forward, based on the pragmatic style of diplomacy that helped us win the Cold War. 
   For this reason, I have joined Congressman Frank Wolf and some of my colleagues in introducing legislation that endorses the Iraq Study Group's call for an integrated diplomatic initiative. In focusing on a true strategy for achieving stability in Iraq, this resolution seeks to improve our global standing and concentrate our efforts on funding an end game based on a genuine commitment to diplomacy. 
   To obtain these goals, the Wolf resolution seeks to lift our debate above the existing political rhetoric and pursue a comprehensive strategy to build regional and international support for stability in Iraq. 
   It is equally crucial that we do everything within our ability to accelerate the training of Iraqi troops and provide them with the resources necessary to assume control of their own destiny. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we speak, thousands of our Nation's bravest and brightest are risking their lives to serve our country in Iraq. Protecting American soldiers must continue to be our greatest priority. I will oppose any attempt to cut off funds for our troops who are serving in harm's way. 
   Therefore, it is crucial that we advance constructive strategies, such as those identified by the Iraq Study Group, to end the violence and bring our troops home to their families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise also in support of House Resolution 515 congratulating Oregon State University's baseball team for winning the 2007 National Collegiate Association Division I College World Series championship for the second consecutive year. 
   On June 24, 2007, the Beavers of Oregon State defeated the University of North Carolina Tar Heels by a score of 9-3, sweeping the best of three series, two games to none, to win the 2007 NCAA Division I College World Series championship. They became the first team in 10 years to win back-to-back College World Series championships. 
   Oregon State University dominated the finals of the College World Series, trailing for only one of the 45 innings they played. The Beavers of Oregon State outscored their opponents 42-16 during their remarkable run in the College World Series, becoming the first three-seed to ever win the tournament. 
   Much of this team's success is due to Head Coach Pat Casey. After starting the year with only 23 wins and only 3 losses, the team hit a bit of a slump in May, which nearly cost them a spot in the tournament. But Coach Casey kept the team motivated and focused to help lead the Beavers to a 49-18 record. 
   The 2007 World Series MVP, Jorge Reyes, a freshman, who went 2-0 with a 2.92 ERA during the College World Series, became only the fifth freshman to ever win the award in the 58-year history of the College World Series. 
   And while we commend the college athletics department today, we should also recognize Oregon State University as an excellent academic institution. Known for its geosciences programs, which rank sixth in the Nation, the university offers over 200 undergraduate programs and more than 80 graduate programs. The campus has a renowned library and exceptional research facilities as well as great internship and study abroad programs to offer its students.  
   I extend my congratulations to Head Coach Pat Casey, Athletics Director Bob De Carolis, President Dr. Edward Ray, and all of the hardworking players, the fans, and Oregon State University. I am happy to represent my good friend and colleague Representative Hooley in recognizing this exceptional team in all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this resolution

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (UNDERGROUND RAILROAD EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2707. 
   I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Kucinich, for introducing this bill to ensure that those organizations that work so hard to share the history of the Underground Railroad are able to continue their good works. 
   The Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Program was created in the 1998 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act to provide grants to nonprofit organizations that provide education about and research into the Underground Railroad. In addition, grants could be used for organizations to collect, display or interpret artifacts relating to the history of the Underground Railroad. For example, the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, located in Cincinnati, Ohio, houses eight permanent exhibits and hosts any number of temporary exhibits, including displays, musical programs, and group discussion. 
   Other grantees under this program host tours that try and recreate the journey taken by anyone brave enough to utilize the Underground Railroad and exhibits the detail of the development of the Underground Railroad. 
   I supported the reauthorization of this program when Republicans brought a complete reauthorization of the Higher Education Act to the House floor last Congress. I had hoped to support this program again in the context of a complete reauthorization of the Higher Education Act again this year. Even though this program is receiving the attention of the Congress now, I hope we can complete the HEA reauthorization bill when we return from the August recess. 
   I believe strongly in promoting programs and partnerships to commemorate this time in history and educating the public about the historical significance of the Underground Railroad. The Underground Railroad was very active in the State of Delaware, I might also add. We have many of our own tributes to that in my small State. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise to offer myself a simple but much needed amendment to the legislation before us. According to a 2006 report by the Office of Government Ethics, many Federal agencies have become increasingly reliant on non government employees to work closely with government personnel and provide advice on important procurement and spending issues. 
   For example, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, or FFRDCs, as they are commonly known, are in most cases financed exclusively by the agency of the Federal Government and provides services similar to the duties of the Government Accountability Office. 
   There are currently 36 of these centers, which are normally affiliated with an industrial firm, a university or a nonprofit institution that contracts with the Pentagon, Homeland Security, Department of Energy and other Federal agencies to provide decisionmakers with recommendations on procurement policy and important issues that steer billions in taxpayer dollars. 
   In fiscal year 2000, FFRDCs received over $6 billion in Federal funding for their services, yet they are not considered to be Federal employees. Beyond just FFRDCs, other private advisers are increasingly being used to provide critical guidance and recommendations. 
   In fact, some of the most secret and inherently governmental jobs, including spending decisions and budget preparation at the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security, are increasingly contracted out. Because private advisers and government employees play under different rules, our current conflict of interest laws do not apply to nongovernment workers serving in quasi-governmental controls. 
   In fact, the Office of Government Ethics has determined that current law prohibits government employees from making recommendations on matters where they have a financial conflict of interest. But it does not presently apply to FFRDC personnel or the private advisers who sit right next to those employees making high-level decisions that involve billions in taxpayer dollars. 
   While there is no doubt that the majority of these nongovernment advisers are dedicated individuals with highly specialized skills, there is purely a need to prevent financial conflicts of interest from impacting our government's important spending priorities. 
   In fact, there have been reported incidents in which the advice of private advisers may have been tainted by personal conflicts of interest. In one case, an FFRDC contradicted government auditors, including the Government Accountability Office, and advised the Pentagon to move forward with a risky fighter jet program. 
   As it turned out, the program suffered costly setbacks, eventually spending billions more than originally planned. It was later discovered that the President of the FFRDC that recommended the program had financial ties, which may have skewed their recommendations. 
   My amendment would simply require the Office of Government Ethics to study this issue and submit a report to Congress within 180 days on recommendations for requiring nongovernment personnel who serve in an advisory role to the government to comply with personal financial conflict of interest regulations, such as those that currently apply to Federal employees. 
   This is obviously a very complicated issue, but I firmly believe that it is Congress' responsibility to make certain that ethical people are providing sound advice when it comes to crucial government decisions regarding procurement and spending. 
   I believe this amendment will help us better understand whether there is a need for such provisions and ensure that our government maximizes its return on investment at the best value for the taxpayer. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman, I do feel this is an area that we should look into. I am not enough of an expert to specifically recommend how to do it. That is why we are asking for the study in 180 days. There is potential for conflict here, and we are dealing with very, very large sums of money, and in my judgment, as part of a lot that we are doing this year in bringing in everybody with governmental basis in terms of making decisions, I think it's a very good idea that we do this. 
   I appreciate his support. I hope the amendment will eventually lead to the best rules and regulations possible with respect to conflicts of interest as far as the future is concerned and the best interests of the country.

You see a Georgia versus a Fresno State and your immediate thought is, well, gee, Georgia must be dominant in this situation as they are a very dominant athletic team in the country. But indeed, Fresno State fought to win two out of three of those games and I think deserve a tremendous amount of credit, especially considering the year that they had gone through. 
   This is an excellent school, and sometimes outside actions cause us to look at other things. And looking at the academics at Fresno State, which include a broad array of offices and services, including over 50 academic departments, eight colleges, a Henry Madden Library, the Division for Graduate Studies, the Division of Continuing and Global Education and dozens of centers and institutes, all these are designed to support the central academic mission of the university, that of creating an environment of engaged, student-centered learning. And they I think deserve to be congratulated for the academic side of what they're doing, as well as their great victory in the NCAA baseball tournament this year. 
   I congratulate them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1088, recognizing and commending the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater for 50 years of service as a vital American cultural ambassador to the world. 
   The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater was formed in March 1958. Led by Alvin Ailey and a group of young African American modern dancers, their combination of technique, repertoire, and high-energy performances changed forever the perception of American dance. 
   The dance company began to travel throughout the country, and in 1960, the AAADT became a resident company of the 51st Street YWCA's Clark Center for the Performing Arts. It was during this time period that Ailey choreographed his signature work ``Revelations'' which has been seen by more people across the globe than any other work of dance. In 1962, the company was chosen to tour the Far East, Southeast Asia, and Australia as part of President John F. Kennedy's ``President's Special International Program for Cultural Presentations.'' 
   AAADT made its performance at the New York City Center in 1971, where it is currently the resident company. AAADT celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1980 and its founder, Alvin Ailey, received the United Nations Peace Medal in 1982. When Ailey died in 1989, Judith Jamison, a former principal dancer, assumed the role of artistic director. 
   Despite the loss of its founder, AAADT has thrived. Following tours in Russia, France, and Cuba in the 1990s, as well as residency in South Africa in 1997, the Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation broke ground for a new dance complex in Manhattan. It is the largest facility dedicated exclusively to dance in the United States. 
   Every year the company provides more than 100,000 youth from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to explore their creative potential and build their self-esteem through its Arts in Education and Community Programs, including nine Ailey Camps in cities throughout the country. 
   Today, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater has gone on to perform for an estimated 21 million people in 48 States and in 71 countries on 6 continents, including two historic residencies in South Africa. The company has earned a reputation as one of the most acclaimed international ambassadors of American culture, promoting the uniqueness of the African American cultural experience and the preservation and enrichment of American modern dance. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of House Resolution 1261, congratulating the East High School in Denver, Colorado, on winning the 2008 ``We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution'' national competition.  
   Every year since 1987, the Center for Civic Education has sponsored ``We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution,'' a competition for American high school students held in Washington, D.C. 
   The primary goal of the competition is to promote civic competence and responsibility among the Nation's elementary and secondary students. What makes the program successful is the design of its instructional program, including its innovative culminating activity. 
   The instructional program enhances students' understanding of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, while also discovering their contemporary relevance. The culminating activity is a simulated congressional hearing in which students testify before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles and have opportunities to evaluate, take and defend positions on relevant, historical and modern day issues. 
   In the 21 years of competition, East High School has gone to the ``We the People'' nationals 19 times, placed in the Top Ten 16 times, placed in the Top Three eight times, and placed in the Top Two four times. However, this year East High School placed first in the national competition. 
   The 27 team members, under the leadership and guidance of their coach, Susan McHugh, are to be commended. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the team's accomplishments. 
   From the earliest days of American democracy, the study of history has been essential to the preservation of freedom. This competition is a great forum in which to strengthen the teaching, study and understanding of our Nation's history and culture. ``We the People'' is a wonderful opportunity for American youth to develop an understanding of the documents upon which our Nation was founded. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.

   This team was extraordinary. Their victory against Texas A&M in the World Series, 11-0 victory shows just how great they really are. 
   Beyond that though, I would just like to say that the Arizona State softball is not only an inspiration to student athletes in Arizona and across the United States, but a beacon of higher education as well. Arizona State University is a knowledge and discovery enterprise advancing teaching and research focused on the most pressing challenges that confront global society. A comprehensive public metropolitan research university enrolling more than 60,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students on four campuses. ASU is a federation of unique colleges, schools, departments and research institutes that comprise close-knit but diverse academic communities that are international in scope. ASU champions intellectual and cultural diversity and welcomes students from all 50 States and more than 100 nations across the globe. 
   I congratulate everybody who had anything to do with the softball victory this year, and I congratulate Arizona State University on being an outstanding university in our country.

   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 1259, congratulating the Hamilton College Continentals on winning the NCAA's women's lacrosse championship. 
   On May 18, 2008, the Hamilton College Continentals women's lacrosse team captured the NCAA Division III championship and completed the very best season in the team's 29-year history. The 13-6 victory over the Franklin & Marshall Diplomats secured Hamilton's first national title in any sport. 
   The Continentals entered the weekend as the number four-ranked team in Division III but knocked off number one Salisbury University 11-10 on Saturday before they defeated the defending champion and third-ranked Diplomats. Hamilton also avenged a 14-13 loss to Franklin & Marshall suffered in Florida on March 19. The loss was the lone blemish on the Continentals' 2008 record. The Continentals completed the 2008 season with a remarkable 21-1 record and won 19 straight games, which is the longest winning streak in Division III women's lacrosse. 
   Four Continentals earned All-American awards this year. Six players were selected to the All-Region team, and nine players were selected to the All-League team. The Continentals are truly shining examples of the products of hard work and commitment, and they have inspired and brought pride to their community as well as their loved ones and the students and alumni of Hamilton College. 
   Head Coach Patty Kloidt also merits recognition and praise for guiding the Continentals to their championship win. Coach Kloidt and her staff were named the Liberty League Coaching Staff of the Year in 2008. Coach Kloidt was also named the NCAA Division III women's lacrosse coach of the year. 
   While the accomplishment of capturing a national athletic title deserves our recognition today, we should also take a moment to reflect on Hamilton's commitment to academics. Hamilton is a liberal arts college with an emphasis on individualized instruction and independent research and is a national leader in teaching effective writing and persuasive speaking. Founded in 1973 as the Hamilton-Oneida Academy, it is the third oldest college established in New York State. Hamilton's curriculum provides its highly motivated students with both the freedom and responsibility to make educational choices that emphasize breadth and depth. In short, Hamilton College is the finest college in the United States. 
   I graduated from there 40-some years ago. 
   Through independent projects, The Senior Program, and summer internships with faculty, Hamilton provides an increasing number of opportunities for students to engage in significant--often publishable--research at the undergraduate level. 
   I am happy to join my colleagues in honoring Hamilton for its many achievements. I extend my congratulations to Hamilton's President Joan Stewart, Athletics Director Jon Hind, Head Coach Patty Kloidt and her staff, the players, the fans and to Hamilton College. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2082, the conference agreement on the Fiscal Year 2008 Intelligence Authorization Act. 
   As a former member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, I believe it is vital that we provide the United States intelligence agencies with the tools and resources necessary to ensure our security. Therefore, I strongly support funding in this bill for human intelligence activities, intelligence analysis, and training, infrastructure, and global intelligence improvements. I also support the authorization in the bill providing emergency funding for counterterrorism operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Furthermore, I support language in the agreement prohibiting the use of any interrogation techniques not authorized by the U.S. Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations against any individual in the custody or effective control of any element of the intelligence community. Our soldiers and interrogators need to know exactly where the line is when engaging prisoners and there should be absolutely no question about what is acceptable behavior and what is not. In fact, I recently cosponsored legislation to require the anti-torture provisions included in this conference agreement. 
   Nevertheless, I will oppose this bill because it fails to implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendations for reforming congressional oversight of intelligence funding. In its final report, the 9/11 Commission concluded that: ``Of all our recommendations, strengthening congressional oversight may be among the most difficult and important. So long as oversight is governed by the current congressional rules and resolutions, we believe the American people will not get the security they want and need.'' 
   Earlier this year, the Democratic leadership attempted to apply a ``Band-Aid'' to this problem by creating a powerless Intelligence Oversight Panel that has very little control over actual funding decisions. This is clearly not what the 9/11 Commission recommended. In fact, its report plainly states that ``tinkering with the existing committee structure is not sufficient.'' In May, I offered a simple amendment to the bill before us, calling for Congress to implement these crucial recommendations--but it was prevented from being considered for inclusion in this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people have insisted that we implement all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations--even those that are difficult. We will be doing this country a disservice until we put in place an effective committee structure capable of giving our national intelligence agencies the oversight, support, and leadership they need.

   By sort of coincidence, I happened to watch part of this game on television, I think the last half of the game, and they had a remarkable comeback as they beat the Augusta State University team. They are really a superb basketball team. 
   I had the pleasure of playing a little bit of Division III basketball many years ago. And either basketball's improved tremendously in those intervening years, or Division II is a heck of a lot better than Division III. These guys could really play basketball, and they were extremely impressive in terms of what they did. 
   I also congratulate the young men for their academic prowess. This is a college of some distinction. For that, they and all administrators deserve congratulations as well. We congratulate the head coach, Mike Leaf, who was named the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference coach of the year four times, and national coach of the year two times. 
   This is a team which has won two national titles and three straight North Central Region titles from 2006, 2007 and 2008, and four straight regular season championships and three straight conference tournament championships. Not many teams at any level of sports can make claims such as that. 
   The college, as the sponsor has indicated, is a significant institution in Minnesota, and does a wonderful job in its programs preparing young people for the rest of their lives. 
   We congratulate the President, Judith Ramaley, and the Athletic Director, Larry Holstad, the head coach, as I've indicated, and all the friends and supporters of a fine university which had a tremendous year this year in basketball.

   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am also a strong believer in what we are doing here in honoring foster care with this month. This is an opportunity to give these children a sense of well-being, a home, a stability, nurturing adults. 
   We've seen it work time and again, as the gentlewoman from Minnesota has explained. There are currently over 500,000 children in foster care in the United States, and the majority of these children have been removed from their homes because of abuse or neglect. So those who welcome these children in, give them that opportunity, deserve our plaudits in terms of what they've done to help in our society. 
   Just over half of all foster children complete high school, 30 percent continue to rely on public assistance into adulthood, and 25 percent will experience homelessness at one point in their lives. So we're dealing with circumstances, in many instances, in which we have to try to intervene and to make a difference. 
   We should pay tribute to the public child welfare agencies, the nonprofits and the private entities that provide these services for these children because, indeed, they are reaching out and making a difference in the lives of many of these individuals. 
   The groups we honor today provide invaluable resources to foster families, teachers, counselors, physicians, clergy and others who work closely with the children in the foster care system. They sponsor research, develop best practices, and offer assistance to youth transitioning out of the system to ensure they receive adequate support as they reach adulthood. There are an estimated 12 million foster care alumni in the United States representing all walks of life. 
   We pay tribute to those individuals in this resolution, and I would hope  that all of our colleagues would be supportive of the resolution. 
   I thank the gentlewoman for her sponsorship and all those who brought it to the floor today.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 789, honoring public child welfare agencies, nonprofit organizations and private entities providing services for foster children. 
   May is National Foster Care Month. We take this time to bring awareness to the many sides of foster care. Children are placed in foster care when their parents are no longer able to ensure their essential well being. These children need stable, loving care until they can either safely reunite with their families or cultivate other lasting relationships with nurturing adults. 
   Foster care is essential to protecting abused and neglected children. There are currently over 500,000 children in foster care in the United States. The majority of these children have been removed from their homes because of abuse or neglect. 
   During this month we recognize the unique challenges foster children experience based on the instability in their home and school environments. Just over half of all foster children complete high school, 30 percent continue to rely on public assistance into adulthood, and 25 percent will experience homelessness at one point in their lives. 
   Today, we pay tribute to the public child welfare agencies, nonprofit organizations and private entities that provide services for foster children. These organizations work tirelessly to improve the lives of foster children by considering the best interest of each child, focusing on keeping families together when possible, and recruiting loving foster families. 
   The groups we honor today provide invaluable resources to foster families, teachers, counselors, physicians, clergy, and others who work closely with children in the foster care system. They sponsor research, develop best practices, and offer assistance to youth transitioning out of the system to ensure they receive adequate support as they reach adulthood. There are an estimated 12 million foster care alumni in the United States representing all walks of life. 
   Today, we honor the contributions of public child welfare agencies, nonprofit organizations and private entities dedicated to finding homes for foster children and assisting foster families in securing the future success of their foster children. These groups are committed to raising awareness related to the special needs of foster children. 
   That is why I stand in support of this resolution and I ask for my colleagues' support.  
   I yield back the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1173, recognizing AmeriCorps Week. 
   Throughout the history of the United States, Americans have valued an ethic of service. As Alexis de Tocqueville wrote over a century and a half ago, this ethic of service ``prompts Americans to assist one another and inclines them willingly to sacrifice a portion of their time and property to the welfare of the State.'' AmeriCorps gives Americans an opportunity to make a difference in their own lives and in the lives of others by meeting critical needs in the community. 
   In 1990, President George Herbert Walker Bush signed the National Service Act, a network of national service programs that engage Americans in intensive service to meet the Nation's vital needs in education, public safety, health, and the environment. In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed the National and Community Service Trust Act which established the Corporation for National and Community Service and brought the full range of domestic community service programs under the umbrella of one central organization. 
   In September of 1994, the first class of AmeriCorps members, 20,000 strong, began serving in more than 1,000 communities. Today, AmeriCorps offers 75,000 opportunities for adults of all ages and background to address a myriad of needs in communities all across America such as tutoring and mentoring disadvantaged youth, fighting illiteracy, improving health services, building affordable housing, and managing after-school programs, just to name a few. 
   This year's theme for AmeriCorps Week is ``Getting Things Done.'' This organization is doing just that. Since its inception, 542,000 citizens have taken the AmeriCorps pledge and have served a total of more than 705 million hours in 4,100 nonprofits throughout the country. Last year, AmeriCorps members recruited and supervised more than 1.7 million community volunteers demonstrating AmeriCorps value as a volunteer channel. In return for their service, members have earned $1.4 billion to further their educational advancement in our Nation's colleges and universities and our communities. 
   Volunteerism is a way for Americans to connect to their communities, learn more about the problems facing their communities, and to simply make a difference. This week, we salute current and former AmeriCorps members for their powerful impact, and we thank all community partners who make the AmeriCorps program possible and bring more Americans into service. 
   I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues, Ms. Matsui, Mr. Shays, Mr. Platts, and Mr. Price for introducing this resolution and ask my colleagues to support the resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (ORIGINAL SAINT-GAUDENS DOUBLE EAGLE ULTRA-HIGH RELIEF PALLADIUM BULLION COIN ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is simple legislation, as Mr. Gutierrez has said, that directs the creation of an investment-grade coin of palladium made available to those who seek to invest in precious metals as a hedge against inflation. 
   I'm happy to be a sponsor of this bill, along with Mr. Gutierrez, the chairman of the Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade, and Technology Subcommittee that I once chaired. 
   With the spike in value of precious metals, investors who recently may have bought gold to put in IRAs have nothing in the standard 1-ounce size investor coin between $18 or so and about $1,000, with gold having jumped in the last couple of years from maybe $400 an ounce to more than $900. 
   Palladium, known as the fourth precious metal and approved as an investment vehicle by Congress a decade ago, along with gold, silver and platinum, would fill that gap.     
   Yesterday it was trading at about $422 an ounce. Palladium is also mined in quantity in the United States. I'm told that more than 400 people work in the Palladium mine in Montana. 
   Mr. Speaker, investors do want a choice in their precious metals. And while gold may always be king, if the Mint is going to have a bullion program, it needs to present alternatives. Unfortunately, for many investors, platinum, once valued at nearly the same as palladium, has leapt to nearly $2,000 an ounce, and once-healthy sales of platinum bullion coins shrank to a mere 9,000 ounces last year. 
   Creating a palladium bullion coin will offer investors another option. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, this legislation calls for a limited number of the palladium coins to be made with the exact design as the famous gold 1907 Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle Ultra-High Relief coin, of which only about a dozen were made because of technical limitations at the time. I understand Mint Director Moy plans to make gold replicas of that coin, and if so, this bill provides that a limited number be sold in a special presentation case with numismatic versions of the palladium coin. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to call Members' attention to a report required at the end of the bill. For some time now we've been hearing of the import and sale into the United States of high-quality fakes of both collectible and investor coins, and more recently of counterfeiting of the special containers that certify a coin's quality as set by an independent grading firm. Mr. Speaker, counterfeiting must be stopped, whether it's of U.S. $100 bills, ancient Greek coins, or high-quality fashion ware. 
   The report required in this bill will, I hope, focus the various parts of the government with jurisdiction over this crime so we can determine the scope and source of the problem and begin taking appropriate action to stop it. 
   I urge quick passage of the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the distinguished chairwoman of the House Railroads Subcommittee for yielding me this time. 
   We have heard many words of accolade for our railroads. I would like to second some of that. This marks the 139th anniversary of the completion of the transcontinental railroad, indeed a very strong engineering feat in our country's history. 
   Today, with gas prices soaring, which we have had a debate already on this floor, congestion building on our highways, and concern about greenhouse gases on the rise, we need to address this. The I-95 corridor is in difficult shape with respect to all of these issues.     
   Highway congestion has become a critical problem, costing Americans 4.2 billion hours and 2.9 billion gallons of fuel, sitting in traffic delays. 
   In contrast, passenger railroads are one of the cleanest forms of transportation. It emits only 0.2 percent of transportation industry's greenhouse gases. 
   Between Boston and Washington, D.C., ridership on Amtrak has surged by 20 percent, representing enough new passengers to fill 2000 757 jetliners. 
   As a co-chair of the House Passenger Rail Caucus, and as one who takes Amtrak on a regular basis, and I've seen the increase in the crowds on it and talked to many people on it, I realize that this truly the future, and something that Congress should be paying a lot of attention to in terms of supporting the need for future legislation in dealing with the issues of Amtrak and rail travel in our country. 
   I thank Chairwoman Brown for her strong leadership, and encourage all the Members of the House to support this legislation. 
   I'd just like to point out, as I often have in speaking about Amtrak, Mr. Speaker, we really need to look at our highways and our airports as well. This is one way of relieving a good number of those burdens. And hopefully we can pass this legislation and pay a lot more attention to what we're dealing with on rail travel in this country in the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise to offer an important amendment to the legislation before us today. 
   As many of my colleagues have noted, terrorists are increasingly targeting rail and transit systems throughout the world. The recent bombings in India, London and Madrid are clear evidence of this dangerous trend. 
   While the concept of rail security is relatively new here at home, security officials in Europe and Asia have decades of experience with terrorist attacks, and I have long believed in the importance of leveraging this experience to improve our own system. 
   In 2003, I asked the Government Accountability Office to undertake an in-depth study of foreign rail security practices. Over the course of several months, a GAO team visited 13 different foreign rail systems, and a subsequent report identified many innovative measures to secure rail systems, many of which are currently being used in the U.S. 
   Most significantly, however, the GAO report identified four important foreign rail security practices that are not currently being used to any great extent in the United States. 
   First, the report found that other nations have improved the vigilance of their security staff by performing daily unannounced events, known as covert testing, to gauge responsiveness to incidents such as suspicious packages or open emergency doors. 
   Similarly, two of the thirteen foreign operators interviewed by GAO also reported success using some form of random screening to search passengers and baggage for bombs and other suspicious materials. This practice has been used sporadically in the U.S., including in New York City following in the 2005 London bombings, but has never been implemented for any continuous period of time. 
   The GAO also noted that many foreign governments maintain a national clearinghouse on security technologies and best practices. Such a government-sponsored database would allow rail operators to have one central source of information on the merits of rail security technology, like chemical sensors and surveillance equipment. 
   Finally, while GAO noted that the Department of Transportation has taken steps to encourage rail operators to consider security when renovating or constructing facilities, many foreign operators are still far more advanced when it comes to incorporating aspects of security into infrastructure design. 
   For example, this photograph here to my left of the London Underground demonstrates several security upgrades, such as vending machines with sloped tops to reduce the likelihood of a bomb being placed there, clear trash bins, and netting throughout the station to prevent objects from being left in recessed areas. As you can see, the London stations are also designed to provide security staff with clear lines of sight to all areas of the station, including underneath benches and ticket machines. 
   The British government has praised these measures for deterring terrorist attacks. In one incident their security cameras recorded IRA terrorists attempting to place an explosive device inside a station. According to London officials, due to infrastructure design and improvements, the terrorists were deterred when they could not find a suitable location to hide the device inside the station. 
   While the GAO acknowledged that deploying these four practices in this  country may be difficult, in fact, random screening may pose many challenges, it is clear that these foreign security techniques deserve greater consideration. Therefore, the amendment I am offering today would take steps to improve rail and transit security by requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to study the cost and feasibility of implementing these practices and submit a report making recommendations to the Homeland Security Committee and Transportation Committee within one year of enactment. 
   Mr. Chairman, recent attacks on rail and transit throughout the world underscores the importance of acting now to upgrade security here at home. My amendment will make certain that we are knowledgeable and consider all available options when it comes to ensuring the safety and security of our rail system. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I don't mean to burden Homeland Security with studies, but to me this is a relatively simple study matter and something which I think will ultimately provide greater safety to people in this country. 
   Hopefully, all can support this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (SELECT INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT PANEL -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 35, a resolution to create a Select Intelligence Oversight Panel to advise the House Appropriations Committee. 
   As a former member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, I strongly believe that we must enact all of the 9/11 Commission's intelligence recommendations, even those that apply to our own congressional committees. 
   In its final report, outlining steps Congress should take to combat the problems which plagued our Nation in the lead up to September 11, the 9/11 Commission stated that ``Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work.'' 
   In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 2001, Congress acted quickly to enact a large majority of the commission's recommendations. Today the House will likely pass some of the remaining recommendations, impacting various agencies and levels of government. However, as it turns out, it has been those recommendations that apply directly to the tangled rules of procedures here in the United States Congress, which have been left unfinished. 
   Specifically, I am disappointed that the resolution before us today fails to implement the 9/11 Commission's very specific recommendation that Congress enact a separate appropriations bill for our intelligence community. Currently, intelligence funding is concealed in the classified section of the Pentagon's budget and thus is subject to very little accountability. As currently drafted, I have serious concerns that the proposed Intelligence Oversight Panel will have very little control over the actual funding decisions and will only succeed in confusing the process and adding to its complex bureaucracy. 
   As a former member of the House Intelligence Committee, I believe strongly in the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. For that reason, I will introduce legislation immediately to create an empowered and independent intelligence appropriations subcommittee to oversee the intelligence community funding and to keep our Nation safe from those seeking to destroy our way of life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 5937, a bill to preserve the affordability of the Starrett City development, the largest federally subsidized housing project in the country. This bill is a bipartisan effort with our colleagues from the New York delegation in the House, as well as Senator Schumer, to maintain affordable housing in one of the most unaffordable cities, New York City. 
   The current owners of Starrett City intend to sell the project. This legislation will ensure that Starrett City remains an affordable housing resource for Brooklyn residents when the sale is completed. H.R. 5937 allows HUD, per the request of the project's private owners, to convert the project's section 8 and rental assistance payments contract into project-based section 8 contracts. All existing tenants receiving housing assistance under the existing contracts will remain eligible for assistance under the new project-based section 8 contracts. If this bill is enacted, 5,881 affordable housing units will be preserved for 14,000 residents. 
   This bill will not result in any additional cost to the Federal Government. In fact, by preserving existing housing, this bill could result in cost savings. The owners of Starrett City are in favor of this legislation, in addition to the State of New York and the residents of Starrett City. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important piece of legislation.

   The legislation before us, which I support, has in it a provision banning lobbying by spouses in the office of the individual whose spouse it is. And I am very supportive of that. I think it is something that we should do, but I think it should go a little further than that. And this is a sense of Congress in which we are going to cast a wider net in terms of being careful about who is lobbying. 
   I am concerned that family members other than just spouses, obviously including children, parents, brothers, sisters, direct family members, lobbying can be extremely maybe unfairly influential in terms of what happens in the Congress of the United States. Obviously, if the spouse of a committee chair come to you, and you are on that particular committee, that could have an adverse influence as far as your decisionmaking is concerned. And I think we need to be careful about that. 
   I have done this, though not as a specific prohibition, but as a caution in the form in which we find it. And I also noted a recent poll suggesting that 80 percent of Americans believe it is wrong for lawmakers and their staffs to have contact with family members of other lawmakers who are lobbyists. 
   I believe in openness and transparency. I think it is essential to all that we do. And I believe if somebody has an unfair, unstated advantage in terms of what they are doing, it is something that we in Congress should pay attention to.

   I also rise in support of H.R. 392, the District of Columbia and United States Territories Circulating Quarter Dollar Program Act. I want to thank Chairman Frank, Chairman Gutierrez, and Ranking Member Bachus for the Financial Services Committee's support of this legislation and for getting this important bill to the floor early in the 110th Congress. This is a little bit unusual that we are doing early, perhaps early enough to get it done in the Senate as well. 
   The legislation before us would extend the popular 50 State Quarter project to include coins honoring the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. 
   Madam Speaker, the 50 State Quarter legislation has proven to be a great success. It has reinvigorated coin collecting, has become an invaluable educational tool, and has so far contributed close to $6 billion to the United States Treasury through seiniorage and the sale of products to collectors. With an estimated 140 million Americans collecting these coins, the State quarters have become the most popular coin program in the United States' Mint history. 
   Madam Speaker, expanding the program to include D.C. and the U.S. territories will further benefit the taxpayer and educate Americans about our Commonwealth. These coins are integral to the history of our country and educate children and tourists about the American way of life. This bipartisan legislation is supported by the members of the Financial Services Committee and has passed the House in every Congress since the 106th Congress. I am pleased that we have brought this much-needed legislation to the floor today and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting the bill.

   Mr. FORTU&#209;O. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 392, the District of Columbia and United States Territories Circulating Quarter Dollar Program Act, of which I am an original cosponsor. I want to thank Chairmen Frank and Gutierrez and Ranking Members Castle and Bachus for their leadership on this. 
   This bill, introduced by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, whom I commend as well, would finally allow the District of Columbia as well as Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands the right to choose a design, which would be imprinted on the reverse of a quarter. Inadvertently these jurisdictions were excluded from the 50 State quarter dollar bill that gave each State their own coins in 1998. 
   I echo the sentiments of my colleagues. This bill recognizes the importance of including all Americans in the symbols of American citizenship. I am confident and hopeful that this bill will see swift congressional passage and then that the President will imprint his signature. 
   As Puerto Rico's sole representative in Congress of the almost 4 million American citizens who reside in Puerto Rico, it is my honor to acknowledge the significant contributions which Puerto Rican Americans have made to our Nation. In particular, Puerto Ricans have never failed in their proud patriotic commitment to their call of duty, defending this Nation and its democratic principles. Madam Speaker, Puerto Rican Americans have served with honor and distinction in the Armed Forces of the United States in all wars and conflicts since 1917 to this day. 
   This bill's passage is long overdue. Its enactment would be an extremely meaningful way to honor these Puerto Rican Americans. It may seem like a small gesture, but our exclusion from this program undermines how faithful Puerto Rican Americans have been to this Nation and how we revere our citizenship and fellowship with all Americans.

   Mr. CASTLE. Madam Speaker, just in closing I thought I would reference back to what I said in the opening, and that is that this particular program which is known as the 50 State Quarter Program, has made a profit, if you want to call it that, through what we call seigniorage of about $6 billion for the Federal Government. How can that be? It is fairly simple: it costs about a nickel to make a quarter, and we essentially sell the quarters, if you will, for 25 cents; and that amount of money, that extra money is carried over, that 20 cents. And since none of these coins are being basically turned in because of all the collecting which is going on, this is money which the Federal Government can spend, it is called seigniorage, and it has worked out extraordinarily well. 
   This program not only honors and recognizes these very important entities that have been spoken to by their representatives here today, but also provides an opportunity for the Federal Government to continue to profit from this program, which will, by the end, end otherwise in the year 2008. So I would encourage everybody to vote for it. 
   I hope, to the distinguished woman from the District of Columbia, that the fifth time is good luck. We have had great luck here in the House; it is in the Senate that we seem to struggle a little bit, and hopefully we can get it done this time. 
   And let me make a point that I think is important. There has been a lot in the news lately about a delegate voting bill which some people here on the floor may be interested in. This is not that bill, and I am not either denigrating or advocating that bill today. But I think it is very important to understand what this is: it is just a clear recognition of those areas that have been left out of this quarter program that many of us think should be brought in and, for that reason, are very supportive of this legislation. Hopefully this is a bill which both political parties can be very supportive of when the time comes to vote on it. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do rise in opposition to the rule for consideration of the fiscal year 2009 Intelligence Authorization Act. 
   As a former member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, I strongly believe we must enact all of the 9/11 Commission's intelligence recommendations, even those that apply to our own congressional committees. 
   In its final report, the 9/11 Commission concluded that, ``Of all our recommendations, strengthening congressional oversight may be among the most difficult and important. So long as oversight is governed by the current congressional rules and resolutions, we believe the American people will not get the security they want and need.'' 
   The bipartisan 9/11 Commission report and the subsequent 9/11 Public Disclosure Project recommended three alternatives for reforming congressional oversight of intelligence. These options include: 
   One, establishing a joint committee on intelligence modeled after the old Joint Committee on Atomic Energy; 
   Two, establishing House and Senate committees on intelligence with authorizing and appropriating authority; or 
   Three, establishing a new appropriations subcommittee on intelligence. 
   In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 2001, Congress enacted a large majority of the commission's recommendations. However, as it turns out, it has been those recommendations that apply directly to the tangled rules and procedures here in the United States Congress which have been left unfinished. 
   Last year, Congress applied a Band-Aid to this problem by creating a powerless Intelligence Oversight Panel that has very little control over actual funding decisions. Despite what I am certain are sincere efforts on the part of members of this panel, this is clearly not what the 9/11 Commission recommended. In fact, its report plainly states that ``tinkering with the existing committee structure is not sufficient.'' 
   As a result, experts on the 9/11 Commission, including a leading Democrat from the commission who I happened to speak with this morning, are concerned that intelligence agencies can dodge effective oversight by going around the authorizing committees that scrutinize them most closely. For example, last year, the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee described what he called a ``consistent pattern'' in which the authorizing committee held in-depth hearings and then made specific funding recommendations for several secret programs only to have appropriators go in a dramatically different direction. 
   Yesterday, Congressman Shays and I appeared before the Rules Committee and offered a simple amendment to the bill before us calling for a sense of Congress that this House should act at the start of next year to implement these crucial 9/11 recommendations. Unfortunately, despite vocal support from both Democrats and Republicans on the Rules Committee last night, this amendment was denied under today's rule. 
   I have no doubt that implementing this proposal will be a challenge, yet we cannot continue to just sweep this vital 9/11 Commission recommendation under the rug while at the same time calling for other government agencies to make reforms. A former 9/11 Commission member, Tim Roemer, noted recently, ``Out of all the many recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, the congressional reform one might be the hardest, but it may be the single most important.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people have insisted that we implement all of these important recommendations, even those that are difficult. We will be doing this country a disservice until we put in place an effective committee structure capable of giving our national intelligence agencies the oversight, support and leadership they need.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding, and I do rise in opposition to the rule and the bill. I don't think in my entire time in Congress I have ever opposed anything that provides additional funding for education, but I think this bill has many underlying elements we have to pay some attention to. 
   I don't disagree with virtually anything I've heard from the other side of the aisle in terms of what this might do. There is, as Mr. Miller indicated, a desperate need for rebonding and renovation. We do need good schools. I think it would help our children. I'm in full agreement with all of that. 
   I'm also in full agreement with the gentlewoman from Ohio who said there's hundreds of billions of dollars of these kinds of renovations which are needed out there in the referenda for many of those things which are going on. 
   The issue is what else is needed to be done in education and what can we afford to do at the public government level. 
   If you look carefully at this bill and analyze the bottom-line expenditures, it's $6.4 billion for the first year of fiscal year 2009. It sets some thereafter for the basic renovations. There's $100 million for each of 5 years for emergency help in those States which were so devastated by storms which perhaps could be done separately, and I would have no problems with them, Louisiana, Mississippi, et cetera. 
   The title III provision is the green provision which calls for a percentage of this money to be spent for green aspects of our schools, as we should be doing. This is something the Federal Government has not done heretofore. We have had certain responsibilities either assigned to us or done by statute in some way or another, and one of those is an amendment which I introduced saying that before we do this, we should fully fund the authorization of title I. It is very arguable that if we have good schools, our students will do better. I think it's even more arguable that if we have the necessary teachers and other personnel to make absolutely sure the kids are going to be well-educated, they will do even better than that. 
   In title I last year, we appropriated $13.9 billion, but we have authorized $25 billion for title I. IDEA is not a part of this bill in particular, but again, we're not up to the statutory mandate of that which is up to 40 percent of contribution by the Federal Government; and if we were to add the $6.4 billion to that, we would get very close to that number which would be $17.3 billion. 
   This is money that we should be spending, and we can't afford to for one reason or another. I've heard the old saw about spending on the war, or whatever it may be. But the bottom line is there's going to be so much spending on education and other resources this year, and my judgment is that we are really opening the door here. If we open this door at $6.4 billion without hundreds of billions of dollars that are needed, we're going to find that that's going to double almost overnight when they find out there is a Federal resource for it. 
   The pressure in this place to take that up to $10 billion, $15, $20 billion a year is going to be overwhelming, and all of a sudden, the education programs which we have a responsibility to be funding, which was so important to the basic instruction of kids, will fall by the wayside. 
   I would urge all of the Members oppose this rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (21ST CENTURY GREEN HIGH-PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding. Let me try to put this in perspective. 
   We are talking about Federal dollars here. We have never at the Federal Government level funded school construction. Perhaps in emergency situations, but other than that, we have not.     
   We do have certain responsibilities that we do need to fund, and one of those is clearly under the No Child Left Behind. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is title I. The ranking member from California has already pointed this out. 
   But the bottom line is that when you look at the funding which we have here, which fundamentally is $6.4 billion in title I. There's another $100 million in title II of this legislation. But if you take that $6.4 billion and you add it to title I, you get very close to that amount of money that we have already authorized in our committee under the jurisdiction of all of us involved with this committee. 
   I think we clearly recognize the importance of title I. It brings in the teachers, it brings in the help. It brings in the people who are going to help our children in schools which are most in need of money. And we would get at least a lot closer to the $25 billion. Right now we only have $13.9 billion appropriated. 
   And then you look at IDEA. Everybody here, Republicans and Democrats alike have fought hard in recent years to increase IDEA to help our children with disabilities, the Individual Disabilities Education Act, and with that extra $6.4 billion, as this chart shows, IDEA could be funded at $7.3 billion, getting very close to the 40 percent requirement in the statute with respect to where we should be with helping those children with disabilities. 
   My concern is, where are we spending our Federal money? 
   My other concern is, and I hope my friends in the Blue Dogs are listening to all of this, but my other concern is we are opening a door here. We are opening a door which is very large, and we're opening it somewhat wide. You haven't even begun to see where we're going to go. The $6.4 billion for fiscal year 2009 is followed by whatever sums thereafter, that's going to go up dramatically very, very quickly, in my judgment. And when all of the local entities realize that perhaps they can  come to the Federal Government and get money, maybe they'll try to whittle down the title III of this so they don't have to worry about the green aspect of it quite as much, and they're going to go for more money. That's going to be the key to it and you're going to see huge increases. I think the 6.4 is merely a beginning. And all this is going to, in my judgment, take away from whatever money is needed for education. 
   Yes, we can argue that the money could come from war or this or whatever it may be. It's not that simple. The bottom line is that people are going to look at education, and I'm afraid they're going to say, we're putting it in construction, therefore we can't put it in title I, we can't put it in IDEA, and I think that would be a mistake. 
   I believe that this bill is well-intended, and I agree with everything that's being said on the other side about the good it can do as far as schools are concerned. But I have a strong disagreement with where the Federal Government should be in this. I think it should be a local and State issue in terms of construction, and we need to fund those things that we have agreed to fund. We need to fund title I. We need to fund IDEA. We do not need to open up a whole new source of funding that we simply cannot afford at this time. 
   So I would encourage defeat of the legislation and, hopefully, we can make sure that we're funding programs we should be funding in education.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (STUDENT LOAN SUNSHINE ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank both Mr. George Miller and Mr. McKeon. I am in total agreement with them on this legislation. I also would like to thank the staff for their working on this. 
   I think it is a shame that we have gone through the last few months and all the revelations of the problems in the student loan industry on a whole variety of levels. I am not here to attribute blame to anybody at this point but to suggest we do have a role in getting involved in this and to make a difference. I will submit my prepared statement, but I would like to go just a little beyond that. 
   I think everyone in America, in terms of being competitive, has to do everything we can to educate our young children. Clearly, student loans by the individual students and the families need to be taken into consideration, but so does the cost of college. 
   As we look at the Higher Education Act which Chairman Miller referenced, it is vitally important that we make sure that our colleges are being closely analyzed in terms of keeping those costs down. The Federal Government cannot do it all with respect to grants and loans or whatever it may be. Indeed, we need to close the gap between the cost of college and what people can afford. Hopefully, we can continue to work on this. 
   This is a wonderful first step. I hope everyone is supportive of H.R. 890. I certainly am supportive of it and concur with statements that have been made today.  
   I rise in support of H.R. 890, the Student Loan Sunshine Act, which will return the focus of the financial aid process to serving the needs and interests of students. H.R. 890 is the first step in ensuring that the federal student aid program is kept on a firm foundation for generations to come. 
   As Congress moves towards reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, the reforms in H.R. 890 are steps in the right direction to ensure the financial aid system works for students and colleges alike. 
   In addition to this bill, the Committee has also held one investigative hearing on findings by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo on the relationship between student loan lenders and the financial aid offices in institutions of higher education. Tomorrow the Committee will hold a second in investigative hearing, asking U.S. Secretary of Education, Margaret Spellings about alleged lapses in the Department's oversight of the federal student loan programs. Additionally, Mr. PETRI and I have sent a letter to the Congressional Research Service (CRS) requesting information from them about the private loan industry. By answering some of these questions and by passing this legislation today, I am hopeful Congress can work to restore confidence in the federal student loan system. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 890, the Student Loan Sunshine Act, to help serve the needs and interests of our students and to restore confidence in our federal loan system.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member from New York for yielding me this time. 
   I rise in strong support of this amendment. I believe its passage is important to ensure that our local first responders are prepared for major disasters. 
   Over the years, volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel have repeatedly answered the call of duty. In fact, my home State of Delaware, which is served almost entirely by volunteer firefighters, sent 37 ambulances to New York City on September 11. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, as fires spread throughout New Orleans and survivors struggled to find dry land, volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel rose to the occasion and proved to be crucial in the massive rescue operation. 
   Unfortunately, under current law, volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel are not protected from termination or demotion by their employer when they respond to national disasters. 
   As a result, just a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina destroyed the gulf coast, a group of us got together here on Capitol Hill to craft this legislation which will make certain that our volunteer responders are more readily available to assist local authorities in major disasters. 
   This proposal is similar to the job protections given to members of the National Guard who serve their country on the battlefield, and it will go a long way in enhancing our ability to respond to catastrophic events and save lives. 
   Mr. Chairman, last Congress, we collected over 70 bipartisan co-sponsors on this legislation. I appreciate the support of the gentleman from New Jersey and his introduction of this and all the others who have been involved. I urge Members to support this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise to offer a critical amendment to this legislation before us today. 
   Yesterday, it was revealed that several individuals operating out of the Philadelphia area had plotted to attack key installations in the Northeast, including Fort Dix, New Jersey, and Dover Air Force Base in my home State of Delaware. While the tremendous work of our law enforcement community prevented these attacks from taking place, this case serves as a clear reminder that terrorists are intent on attacking us wherever we are vulnerable. 
   One of our greatest vulnerabilities remains our mass transit systems, which move millions of people every year. In fact, terrorists are increasingly targeting rail and transit systems throughout the world, and the recent bombings in India, London and Madrid are clear evidence of this dangerous trend. 
   While the concept of rail security is relatively new here at home, security officials in Europe and Asia have decades of experience with terrorist attacks, and I have long believed in the importance of leveraging this experience to improve our own system. 
   In 2003, I asked the General Accountability Office to undertake an in-depth study of foreign rail security practices. Over the course of several months, the GAO team visited 13 different foreign rail systems, and its subsequent report identified several innovative measures to secure rail systems, many of which are currently being used in the United States. 
   Most significantly, however, the GAO report identified four important foreign rail security practices that are not currently being used to any great extent in the United States. 
   First, the report found that other nations had improved the vigilance of their security staff by performing daily unannounced events, known as covert testing, to gauge responsiveness to incidents such as suspicious packages or open emergency doors. 
   Similarly, two of the 13 foreign operators interviewed by GAO also reported success using some form of random screening to search passengers and baggage for bombs and other suspicious materials. This practice has been used sporadically in the U.S., including in New York City following the 2005 London bombings, but it has never been implemented for any continuous period of time. 
   The GAO also noted that many foreign governments maintain a national clearinghouse on security technologies and best practices. Such a government-sponsored database would allow rail operators to have one central source of information on the merits of rail security technology, like chemical sensors and surveillance equipment. 
   Finally, while GAO noted that the Department of Transportation has taken steps to encourage rail operators to consider security when renovating or constructing facilities, many foreign operators are still far more advanced when it comes to incorporating aspects of security into infrastructure design. 
   For example, this photograph of the London Underground demonstrates several security upgrades, such as vending machines with sloped tops to reduce the likelihood of a bomb being placed there, clear trash bins and netting throughout the station to prevent objects from being left in recessed areas. As you can see, the London stations are also designed to provide security staff with clear lines of sight to all areas of the station, including underneath benches and ticket machines. 
   The British Government has praised these measures for deterring terrorist attacks, and in one incident, their security cameras recorded IRA terrorists attempting to place an explosive device inside a station. According to London officials, due to infrastructure design improvements, the terrorists were deterred when they could not find a suitable location to hide the device inside the station. 
   While the GAO acknowledged that deploying these four practices in this country may be difficult, in fact random screening may pose many challenges, it is clear that these foreign security techniques deserve greater consideration.  
   Therefore, the amendment I am offering today would take steps to improve rail and transit security by requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to study the cost and feasibility of implementing these practices and submit a report making recommendations to the Homeland Security and Transportation Committees within 1 year of enactment. 
   Mr. Chairman, recent attacks on rail and transit throughout the world underscore the importance of acting now to upgrade security here at home. My amendment will make certain that we are knowledgable and consider all available options when it comes to ensuring the safety and security of our rail system. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CASTLE. I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to rise in support of the legislation and to rise in support of the manager's amendment. 
   I hope that everybody who supports considering this bill today is paying attention to what I think all of us are hearing at home, and that is that the cost of college education is going up faster, as the cost of living increases, than anything, including health care; that is a vital part of our economy; that if we do not produce good college graduates and graduate students beyond that, that we will be hurt greatly from an economic point of view; and that we need to address these issues. 
   I think this legislation, which was forged with the help of Republicans and Democrats, with amendments by Republicans and Democrats, is balanced legislation and serves the purpose of dealing with looking closely at college costs and asking them to pay attention to it. 
   We have had a number of hearings about this; and some have produced good testimony, some have produced  sort of marginal testimony in terms what could be done. In my view, this legislation is a big step forward in addressing that issue. I know all the college presidents and boards mean well, but the bottom line is they have to serve well too. They have to make sure that college is affordable to as many people as possible. 
   I will be involved in several of the amendments later on, but the basic underlying structure of what we are trying to do here today is of great importance to the entire educational and economic future of our country. I hope that all of us can be as supportive as possible of the legislation and of the manager's amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I'm pleased to offer this college cost accountability amendment to the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, which I also support, legislation to reform and strengthen many of the Nation's higher education programs. 
   As you know, for over a decade, Congress has worked on the behalf of students and families in an effort to solve the college cost crisis. Today we will have the opportunity to vote on these bipartisan college cost reforms. 
   We all can agree on the need to hold down the costs of college, and I believe we're making progress by providing additional support to minority-serving institutions, teacher quality grants, grants supporting veteran student success, and other positive changes. I would like to also note the provisions included to help us better track annual changes in tuition, fees, and room and board costs for undergraduate students. All of the information collected will be made publicly available on the department's College Navigator Web site so that students and their parents have better access to cost increases at various institutions. 
   While each of these provisions take steps in the right direction to combat college costs, I believe we can go farther to uncover what is driving college costs and hopefully stem the tide of this growth that threatens access to higher education for many American students. 
   My amendment expands the responsibilities of the quality task forces established in the underlying legislation by requiring them to develop annual benchmarks for the top 5 percent of institutions that have the largest increase in their tuition and fees over the most recent 3-year period. If these institutions fail to meet these benchmarks, rather than punishing these schools with legislative penalties, institutions are simply required to provide the Secretary of Education with a detailed explanation of the reasons why they failed to do so. 
   I am supportive of the underlying legislation which makes reforms for our institutions of higher learning, parents and students, and my amendment will build upon the provisions set forth in the introduced legislation to make tuition increases even more transparent and help ensure colleges are doing everything possible to reduce college costs so that any student wishing to obtain a higher education may do so. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in strong support of the Cooper amendment. 
   I am a great believer in what our historically black colleges have done and continue to do. Delaware State University in my State is clearly a good example of that. I think this authorization level increase makes a lot of sense. 
   This is not something new. This has been going on for over 100 years in our country. We have been basically educating African Americans, sometimes in a segregated way, but now I think in every instance in a way where we have complete desegregation, too. The historical black colleges have played a prominent role in the education of many African American students in our country and have provided an environment of intellectual and cultural growth. 
   While comprising 2.4 percent of all 2- and 4-year title IV eligible institutions, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities are responsible for 23 percent of the bachelor's degrees awarded to African Americans, 13.6 percent of all master's degrees awarded to African Americans, and 24.1 percent of first professional degrees awarded to African Americans. These statistics are very important, and I think make a great deal of sense in terms of our continuing support in the Congress of the United States of America. 
   I think the amendment is a good amendment, and I believe that it is one that we should all support here as part of this act which is going to help higher education in our country.

   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Ryan-Altmire amendment in the broader sense of what we are dealing with here today, and that is the cost of higher education.     
   I think we have an obligation as elected officials in this country to do everything in our power to allow young individuals, perhaps in some cases middle-aged individuals, to proceed with a college education. It is necessary for the future of our country, for the future of our economy, and we have to look at all different measures of this. And we're dealing with a lot of broader measures here today. But I've often heard this issue of textbooks is a significant cost driver, and I think it is. I see, by some statistics that have been provided to us, the textbook prices have increased at four times the rate of inflation since 1994; and students spend an average of $900 a year on textbooks,  an amount equal to 20 percent of tuition at an average university, half the tuition at a community college. If those numbers are anywhere near correct, and they're projected numbers, but if they're anywhere near correct, that is a huge problem which we have to address in this country. And the colleges have sort of wrestled with it a little bit, but I think they need some guidance. And I believe that the proposal which is in this amendment provides some good guidance to actually try to put together a program so that textbooks can be exchanged and the costs can be kept down greatly. 
   Under the bill, the publishers would be asked to provide more information to the faculty about pricing; and that's good, because I think the bill did some good things in this area. And colleges and universities would be required to notify their students about which books are needed for which classes so the students are better able to plan and prepare for textbook costs. 
   But this amendment, which goes further than that, provides us with an opportunity to take more concrete steps to address the high cost of college textbooks by creating the limited pilot competitive grant program to establish a college textbook rental program. If this, as a pilot program, can work, it could lead to measures much further down the line which could provide very substantial cost savings to individuals who are attending college. And for that reason, hopefully we can all be supportive of it.

   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment which I have cosponsored with Mr. Van Hollen. I could not be more strongly in support of this. 
   I think we need to understand what Teach for America is. Most people may know, but essentially it's a reach-out by a young lady whose name is Wendy Kopp, with a board of directors which is very strong, which was created with the idea of attracting bright young students to education. 
   We have many, many good educators in America. We need the best teachers we can find in this country. This was an effort to try to attract individuals who are not necessarily involved in education to become involved in that profession. So they reached out to our very best schools. And all of a sudden, if you look at the Ivy League schools and the other very top schools in America, you are going to find there are more young candidates to go into the Teach for America program than there are any other employer at those particular schools now. A lot of young people want to do this, and it's been highly successful. 
   They get involved in the schools. It was never established, necessarily, to have them be teachers for life. But that has actually worked in favor of teaching as well because some have stayed in teaching. Others have gone into education administration. And as a result, we have been able to bolster our teachers across the United States of America. It brings new young people into teaching; and with the experienced good teachers that we have already in our country, it can make a huge difference. 
   I think we have a responsibility to inspire young people to teach, if they are qualified to do so, in every way we possibly can. As a matter of fact, they turned down so many people in this program, I think maybe we should be suggesting a second program of some kind to pick up some of those who were turned down, because they're very qualified people, as a matter of fact. 
   You heard some of the numbers which Mr. Van Hollen brought up before of 5,000 corps members, et cetera. We want to increase that number. That's what this is really all about. 
   Hopefully, all of us can be supportive of legislation which is going to provide good teachers, great teachers, to make a difference in the lives of our young people and, hopefully, any concern about how they're getting into teaching versus how others get into teaching is something which we can resolve. 
   This is clearly needed in this country. We need to improve our schools however we can. I think this amendment will do it, and I encourage everyone to support it.  
   I rise in support of this amendment offered by Congressman VAN HOLLEN. I support H.R. 4137, and believe that with passage today we will be making some good reforms for our institutions of higher learning, parents, and students. This amendment is intended to build upon these reforms, and extend them into our nations elementary and secondary schools. 
   Specifically, our amendment would authorize funding to support the Teach for America Program to recruit, select, train and support a national corps of outstanding recent college graduates, of all academic majors, who commit to teach in low-income communities and who hopefully become lifelong leaders for education. 
   Earlier this year, Representative VAN HOLLEN and I introduced legislation which authorizes Teach for America. Currently, funding for the program has been consistent, but piecemeal. The purpose of the bill, and amendment, should the organization be awarded a grant, would be to provide an efficient funding stream. Ultimately this will help the organization grow from its current membership of over 5,000 corps members in over 1,000 schools in 26 regions. The Teach for America legislation has the support of 105 cosponsors, spanning the political spectrum. The Senate has also expressed support for the program, and has included language in their reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. It is my hope that today the House will show their support by including this amendment in H.R. 4137. 
   What we know to be true is that a highly qualified teacher is imperative to the achievement of our students. This amendment will help us to make that more possible across the country. As we, as a nation, continue to focus on closing the achievement gap, I see no better compliment than a national teacher corps. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to join representative VAN HOLLEN and me in supporting this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the legislation before us today mandating a hard deadline for the Secretary of Defense to significantly reduce our troop presence in Iraq. 
   Over the last several months, similar attempts on the part of the Democratic leadership to require an arbitrary date for troop withdrawal have gone nowhere, wasting precious time debating legislation that would be vetoed by the President. While I believe strongly that we must change course in Iraq and bring our men and women home, it would be a mistake for Congress to think it could disregard the complexity of this conflict by simply picking a random date for withdrawal. Forcing such an important decision without considering the advice of military and foreign policy leaders, could lead to the loss of many more lives and open the door for sectarian chaos to spread across the entire Middle East. 
   For this reason, I have been a leading supporter of the Iraq Study Group, also known as the Baker-Hamilton Commission, which in December 2006 outlined a comprehensive approach for bringing a responsible conclusion to the conflict in Iraq. In fact, in early 2007, I went to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives and called on the Bush Administration to change course in Iraq and implement the Study Group's recommendations for a new, robust diplomatic offensive in the Middle East. Since then, Secretary of State Rice has taken several encouraging steps to open the lines of communication with key nations like Iran and Syria, and I am hopeful that my efforts, and those of my colleagues, have prompted the White House to improve its diplomatic efforts in the region. 
   This September, Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker will submit a very important report regarding the conflict in Iraq. While I am hopeful that this report will show progress, I also feel strongly that we must begin developing a responsible postsurge strategy. Therefore, on June 5, 2007, I joined over forty other Members of Congress--Republicans and Democrats--in introducing the Iraq Study Group Recommendations Implementation Act. The Study Group recommendations, which would bolster diplomacy, improve political and economic reconstruction, and handoff the combat mission to the Iraqis, represent the first truly bipartisan proposal for ending this conflict and bringing Americans home. 
   Clearly, there is no easy solution in Iraq. Still, it is extremely discouraging that the Democratic leadership continues to hold votes on ``symbolic'' withdrawal timelines, while refusing to consider the bipartisan Iraq Study Group proposal--legislation that as of today has been cosponsored by 25 Democrats and 33 Republicans in the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan Baker-Hamilton Commission serves as a model for how we must work together in a responsible fashion to stabilize Iraq and get our brave soldiers off the streets. Rather than wasting time debating arbitrary timelines that disregard the complexity of the situation, it is critical that we come together now in support of a responsible exit strategy. I am encouraged that thirteen additional Members of Congress have signed-on to the Iraq Study Group Implementation Act since we introduced it over a month ago and I am hopeful that Members from across the political spectrum will join me in uniting behind this crucial effort.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1, legislation to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. 
   In July of 2004, the 9/11 Commission concluded that the United States Government was unprepared for the devastating terrorist attacks of 2001. In the weeks and months following the release of the 9/11 Commission's report, the U.S. Congress enacted important legislation to overhaul the intelligence community and improve our Government's ability to detect and respond to attacks. The legislation before us today will further expand our nation's preparedness by providing our first responders and emergency personnel with additional tools to enhance security, such as interoperable communication and cargo screening technology. 
   In fact, I am particularly pleased that H.R. 1 includes my amendment requiring the Department of Homeland Security to assess key foreign rail security practices that are not currently used in the US. While the concept of ``rail security'' is relatively new here at home, security officials in Europe and Asia have decades of experience with terrorist attacks and I have long believed in the importance of leveraging this experience to improve our own system. My amendment, which was approved overwhelmingly by the House and the Senate, will require our government to develop a plan for utilizing techniques such as covert testing of security systems and random screening of rail passengers and baggage. It will also require our government to model U.S. train stations and subway systems after methods used in London to prevent terrorist attacks. 
   Additionally, while I support the overall purpose of this bill, I am very concerned that Congress failed to use this opportunity to implement several of the 9/11 Commission's other most important recommendations. Specifically, I believe it is inexcusable that H.R. 1 does not include the 9/11 Commission's critical recommendation to reform congressional oversight of the intelligence community. Currently, intelligence funding is concealed in the classified section of the Pentagon's budget, and thus is subject to very little accountability. As a former Member of the House Intelligence Committee, I believe strongly in this 9/11 Commission recommendation and I have introduced H.R. 334 to create an empowered and independent intelligence appropriations subcommittee to oversee intelligence community funding. Unfortunately, the House's Democratic leadership denied my attempt to amend H.R. 1 to include this important provision. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned that we have missed a key opportunity to enact all of the 9/11 Report's recommendations. However, the bill before us makes progress to expand security and I commend the conference committee for taking much needed steps to improve rail security in the US. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and I call on the leadership in Congress to act immediately to address these remaining national security issues.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (WASHINGTON-ROCHAMBEAU REVOLUTIONARY ROUTE NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail Designation Act (H.R. 1286), which would designate the 600-mile route stretching from Rhode Island to Virginia traveled by Revolutionary War General George Washington and French General Count Rochambeau as a National Historic Trail, connecting the States of Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. The creation of this Trail will celebrate the Franco-American alliance and the victory of Generals Washington and Rochambeau who faced seemingly insurmountable odds. Importantly, H.R. 1286 will enable the National Park Service to support groups, projects, and activities associated with the trail's preservation and interpretation. 
   The Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail Designation Act was introduced to ensure that this history, in all its rich detail, is not forgotten. Although we often remember the victory at Yorktown, too often we lose sight of the heroic efforts of two nations, two armies, and two great men that made it possible. During this historic period the armies marched to Wilmington, Delaware, where the bankrupt Continental Army borrowed from Rochambeau to pay American troops. This designation has the strong support of many state, local, private, and public historic preservation groups and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. CASTLE. (COMMITTEE FUNDING RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding to me. 
   I rise today in opposition to the previous question for the committee funding resolution. The resolution at hand underfunds our Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, not compared to previous years but in light of problems that exist and the education that is needed. 
   At a time crucial to restoring America's faith in our ability to govern ourselves, the Rules Committee dismissed an amendment offered by Chairwoman STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES and Ranking Member DOC HASTINGS which would have allowed us to equip the Ethics Committee with the resources necessary for enacting meaningful reform. 
   Opposing this previous question will enable the House to consider the amendment to fully fund the Ethics Committee, which I believe will actually save us money in the long run, and I encourage my colleagues to allow us to debate and support this important amendment. 
   Mr. Speaker, some will say that the increase to the Ethics Committee is already substantial. To those Members, I would like to remind them that when making their request, the chairwoman and ranking member took into consideration the past problems and the recent changes to our rules, and determined the staffing and resources necessary to provide training, oversight and interpretation of those rules to this body. 
   We have rightfully tightened our travel rules, requiring preapproval; finally banned travel on corporate jets; and we have enacted specific restrictions on accepting food and drinks at briefings, and T-shirts or books from organizations or constituents. Some are allowed, and some are not. 
   Mr. Speaker, more than a memo is needed to convey these guidelines. Members and staff should already be receiving training on the Rules governing the 110th Congress. Instead, we are beginning the month of March, and it is unclear even when the training could be available. 
   On top of the new rules already adopted, there is more to be done, in my opinion. We need to have a permanent and professional committee staff, and we need to expand ethics training to lobbyists. 
   How can we expect the committee to exercise duties of even the most minimum oversight and investigations with a budget that does not meet the stated needs of the chairwoman and the ranking member of that committee? 
   As elected representatives, we come to Congress with the trust of those we represent. The poor decisions of a few have dishonored this great body and have challenged the faith Americans deserve to have in each of us. Enforcing high standards of ethics and civility may seem to be the responsibility of the majority party, but they are, in fact, essential within every one of us elected to hold the public trust. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to oppose this previous question to allow consideration of this amendment.
