<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 976, which extends and expands the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). 
   We have a moral obligation to cover all our children so every child in America can grow up healthy. It's the right thing to do; it's also the cost-effective thing to do. 
   The great Minnesotan Hubert H. Humphrey once said that a key moral test of government is how we treat those who are in the dawn of life, the children. We must not flunk this moral test! 
   My home state of Minnesota started covering children through its medical assistance program even before SCHIP was created, but we still have far too many children without coverage--73,000 kids. 
   That's why I strongly support extending and expanding SCHIP. I also hope we can work together to provide greater access to private insurance coverage for America's children and other uninsured Americans. 
   This SCHIP legislation also avoids cutting any of the payments to Medicare Advantage and other critical programs, as it is financed primarily by a cigarette tax increase. So this bill will cover our children without cutting benefits for our seniors. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. With an expiration of this crucial program looming on September 30, we cannot afford to wait any longer. It's time to break down the barriers to health care for our kids. It's time to reauthorize SCHIP. It's time that all kids have a chance to grow up healthy. 
   Like the U.S. Senate, we should pass this SCHIP reauthorization with a strong bipartisan vote. 
   Let's put children's health first and do the right thing. Let's pass this reauthorization of SCHIP and reduce the number of uninsured children by at least 70 percent. 
   There is no better investment than to invest in the health and well-being of America's children.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (DEDICATION OF VILLAGE HOMES OF WAYZATA, MINNESOTA -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is a special day in our community of Minnesota. Tomorrow is the day we welcome four very special new families to our community. Tomorrow is the day we dedicate and cut the ribbon at Wayzata Village Homes, an affordable housing complex built by Twin Cities Habitat for Humanity. 
   As we dedicate these beautiful new homes and welcome our new neighbors, I'm feeling deeply grateful to live in a community of compassionate, caring and committed people, people who care deeply about people suffering the ravages of poverty, homelessness and hunger, people who reach out to meet the housing needs of people in need, people like John and Nancy Berg. 
   John and Nancy Berg started a family foundation several years ago to meet the affordable housing needs in our community and have contributed so generously time after time after time. People like Steve and Geri Bloomer, who donated the land for Wayzata Village Homes. People like Wayzata Mayor Andrew Humphrey, the members of the Wayzata City Council and the Wayzata Housing Authority, all of whom have a progressive, enlightened and generous approach to expanding access to affordable housing. 
   I am also deeply grateful to all the sponsors, donors and other partners, as well as LaDonna Hoy, Jill Kohler and Kim Vohs, and all the staff and volunteers at Interfaith Outreach and Community Partners. Interfaith Outreach and Community Partners is truly the conscience of our community. I am also deeply grateful to Sue Haig, Tony Beckstrom, and all of those with Twin Cities Habitat for Humanity. Habitat is truly the conscience of our entire Nation in meeting the huge need for affordable housing in our country. 
   In 1961, on the steps right here at the Capitol, in his celebrated inaugural address, President John F. Kennedy said: ``Here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.'' In Wayzata, each of these wonderful people answered President Kennedy's call. They helped make Wayzata Village Homes a reality. They answered our community's call. And tomorrow we will celebrate this great affordable-housing success story. 
   Tomorrow, we will celebrate four new families in our community and extend a special welcome to the proud new residents of Village Homes. 
   Nobody will give a more special welcome than Rachel Poss. Rachel is a fifth grader at Birchview School in Plymouth. Rachel certainly touched my heart this week with her community service project, which was written up in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, of providing baskets of household items to the new families of Village Homes. 
   Thank you, Rachel, and to all who made this Habitat project a reality. You showed us what public service is all about.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (PROVIDING FOR CONCURRENCE BY HOUSE WITH AMENDMENT IN SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 3997, HEROES EARNINGS ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Defenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act, which provides important tax relief to the heroes who are defending our country, both abroad and here at home. 
   I also appreciate that the bill includes a one-year extension of the 1996 mental health parity law, which prohibits insurers from discriminating against mental health treatment with aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits. 
   But we must go much further to end insurance discrimination and expand access to treatment for mental illness and chemical addiction. We must knock down the barriers of higher copays and deductibles, limited treatment stays, and the lack of out-of-network benefits that do not apply to any other disease. We must pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. 
   It's a national disgrace that 270,000 Americans were denied addiction treatment last year. It's a national tragedy that 150,000 of our fellow Americans died last year from chemical addiction and 30,000 Americans committed suicide from depression. And it's a national crisis that untreated addiction and mental illness cost our economy over $550 billion last year. 
   And think of the costs that can't be measured in dollars and cents--human suffering, broken families, shattered dreams; ruined careers and destroyed lives. 
   Passing mental health parity is not only the right things to do; it's the cost-effective thing to do. We have all the empirical data to prove that equity for mental health and addiction treatment will save billions of dollars nationally while not raising premiums more than two-tenths of one percent. 
   This legislation has 273 cosponsors and passed three House committees with wide bipartisan support. It must absolutely be one of the first orders of business when Congress reconvenes in January. 
   It's time to end the discrimination against people who need treatment for mental illness and addiction. It's time to prohibit health insurers from placing discriminatory restrictions on treatment. It's time to provide greater access to treatment. It's time to pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. 
   The American people cannot afford to wait any longer for Congress to act.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (PENSION PROTECTION TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6382, the Pension Protection Technical Corrections Act. Pension technical corrections, Mr. Speaker, are hardly considered glamorous bills. The Tax Code and ERISA which govern pension plans are complicated, to say the least, and the interaction between the  two sets of laws is very complex. So it is no surprise that a pension technical corrections bill is, as named, highly technical. 
   But that doesn't detract from the importance of this bill. Because of the complexity of this area of law, a number of glitches have been discovered that prevent pension laws from operating the way Congress has intended. This bill will fix those glitches, will correct those errors, whether they are drafting or other errors. This will give much-needed certainty to plan administrators, government regulators, and, most importantly, the people who depend on pensions for their financial security in retirement. 
   That is the bottom line. This is all about making these corrections so that the people who depend on pensions for their financial security in retirement will have certainty and security. 
   Mr. Speaker, I realize some people do not fully appreciate what a difficult and painstaking process is involved in technical corrections. In fact, until I got involved directly, I didn't realize how complex a process this was, involving both caucuses, five committees in both bodies of Congress and three executive branch agencies. 
   In the case of the bill before us today, the process is led by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, which did a marvelous job, and includes collaboration from the bipartisan staff of the Ways and Means Committee and Education and Labor Committee, as well as their counterparts from the Senate Finance and Senate Health Committees. All of those staffers should be commended, Mr. Speaker, for the excellent work they did on this legislation. Also involved were representatives from the Treasury and Labor Departments and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 
   Sometimes, Mr. Speaker, there are disagreements about what should and should not be considered technical. Each participant in the process has a veto. Thus, only items that were unanimously viewed as correcting a drafting mistake are included in the technical title of the measure before us. Getting all these players to agree that the sky is blue is certainly not an easy task, so I can't overstate how monumental it is that we now have a bill that survived that rigorous process. 
   There is also another title in the bill containing a few other pension-related items that are not purely technical. I want to thank Chairman Rangel and his staff, as well as the Members here before us today, the outstanding Members on the other side the aisle from the committee, Mr. Pomeroy and also the gentleman from New Jersey, for their cooperation and collaboration on the bill. 
   I also want to thank Mildeen Worrell from Chairman Rangel's staff for working to include the provision that I authored that solves an urgent problem for State employees back home in Minnesota, including many, many first responders, police, firefighters and other first responders, as well as teachers. I am also grateful to Ranking Member McCrery and his excellent staff for their assistance. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by saying it is time to provide much-needed certainty to our Nation's pension plans and the people who rely on them. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Madam Speaker, it is my special privilege to welcome today's guest chaplain, Senior Pastor John Crosby of Christ Presbyterian Church in Edina, Minnesota. 
   On behalf of the entire House of Representatives, thank you, John, for your moving and timely prayer, and for serving as guest chaplain today. 
   Madam Speaker, the Reverend John Crosby is a true servant-leader who personifies faith, compassion and service to those less fortunate. He is a true man of God. 
   Pastor Crosby has been at Christ Presbyterian Church, one of the most dynamic and vibrant faith communities in the Twin Cities, since 1989. 
   John and his wife, Laura, came to Minnesota from Washington, DC, where they ministered at the National Presbyterian Church. They have two daughters, Maggie, who is a junior at Denver University, and Katy who worked as a congressional intern in my Washington office and is now working here in Washington for Bread for the World. Knowing Katy as I do, I can personally testify to the wonderful job John and Laura have done in raising their outstanding daughters, and I am pleased that Laura and Katy are here today in the Speaker's gallery to see their husband and father deliver the opening prayer. 
   Madam Speaker, Pastor Crosby is a thoughtful and caring person who applies his faith to daily life and the major issues of the day. He is very interested and involved in policy matters, and he has been a trusted adviser throughout my 18 years here in Congress. John Crosby also has experience working in the United States Senate for former Chaplain Richard Halvorsen. 
   Our Twin Cities community is truly blessed by Pastor Crosby's strong and principled leadership, as well as his inspiring commitment to help people in need. 
   Under Reverend Crosby's tenure, the youth program and community outreach at Christ Presbyterian Church have grown exponentially, and have been a great asset, a great resource for our community at large. Over a thousand young people are involved in the youth program at Christ Presbyterian Church. And I will never forget when that youth group lost one of its own in a car accident a number of years ago, a beautiful young woman whose family I knew well, and a thousand young people from that church gathered spontaneously that Sunday night at the church, and John led them in prayer. 
   Pastor Crosby is a man of God who lives out the Biblical command to love God, love others and serve the least amongst us, and I am proud and grateful to call him my friend. 
   Thank you again, John, for serving the House of Representatives today and for doing the Lord's work here on the Earth each and every day.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (VIRGINIA GRAEME BAKER POOL AND SPA SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. I thank the ranking member for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1721, the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act. I would like to thank my colleague from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz) for her incredible efforts, her tireless leadership on this important legislation. But for her efforts, this legislation wouldn't be on the floor before us today. 
   Mr. Speaker, this past July, a truly horrendous tragedy changed the life of my young constituent forever. Eight-year-old Abigail Taylor was swimming in a local club's swimming pool when she became entrapped by the pool's drain system. This brave young girl, and her family, fought with everything they had for her survival. She has now endured numerous surgeries and is faced with permanent disabilities that no child should ever have to suffer. 
   While it is too late to protect young Abigail Taylor from her cruel debilitating injuries, it is not too late to protect millions of other children who use swimming pools and spas. No child should ever be disemboweled by a swimming pool drain. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members, that is what we are talking about here. That is what happens to these children. They are disemboweled by the suction from these swimming pool drains. 
   This important legislation will establish a new consumer product safety standard, as has been explained previously by Mr. Rush, whose leadership I also deeply appreciate, as well as Mr. Stearns and Ms. Wasserman Schultz. The standards will require each swimming pool or spa drain cover to conform to the entrapment protection standards of the American National Standards Institute and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, obviously two organizations with direct expertise. And these are very reasonable, not onerous, standards, very reasonable standards for industry which will protect our children in swimming pools. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me just conclude by saying one drain entrapment is one too many. One precious little 8-year-old girl losing part of her small intestine is too much suffering to comprehend. Too much suffering to comprehend. It is time to take action to ensure our children are protected when children are sent to swimming pools by their parents or are there with their parents. Every parent should have a reasonable probability, a reasonable belief that their children will be safe in that pool. It is time to pass this critical legislation on behalf of Abigail Taylor and the millions of children who deserve to be safe in our pools. Let's pass this life-saving legislation without further delay.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, my friend from Florida, for yielding, and also thank the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Mr. Filner, for his leadership, as well as the author of this important legislation, Mr. Boswell of Iowa, and all of those who have worked to bring this legislation to the floor. 
   I have talked, Mr. Speaker, to the mother and the stepmother of Marine Lance Corporal Jonathan Schulze of Minnesota. I have talked to the stepmother, who, along with Jonathan's father, took this young marine to the VA hospital seeking admission. Lance Corporal Schulze, back from the war in Iraq, was suffering from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, and was suicidal. 
   I have talked to this mother and stepmother who, along with Jonathan's father, are absolutely heartbroken at the loss of their beloved son and this true American hero, Lance Corporal Schulze. He was told by the VA that he was number 26 on the waiting list and would have to wait several months to be admitted for treatment. Five days later, Lance Corporal Schulze hanged himself with an electrical cord. 
   This brave marine's tragic death demonstrates to all of us, to the Nation, the urgent need to provide greater access to mental health treatment for our returning troops and our veterans. 
   None of our brave troops, none of our brave troops, suffering from PTSD should ever be placed on a waiting list for treatment. It is absolutely, Mr. Speaker, outrageous, that mental health treatment is not readily available for our brave troops returning from war. 
   That is why I am proud and grateful to rise as a cosponsor of the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. This legislation will provide necessary screening to our returning veterans for risk factors of suicide. It will make sure that those found to be at risk will receive the care that they need and deserve. 
   It is too late, Mr. Speaker, for Lance Corporal Jonathan Schulze of Minnesota, but it is not too late for thousands and thousands of other returning troops and veterans. It is time to pass this critical bill. 
   But we must do more. We must pass mental health and chemical addiction parity. There are 56 million Americans suffering the ravages of mental illness, most of whom are going untreated. There are 24 million Americans suffering the ravages of alcoholism and drug addiction, many, many veterans who are going untreated. 
   We must also, in addition to this important legislation, pass the Mental Health Equity Act to provide equitable treatment for people suffering from mental illness and chemical addiction; that is, to put them on the same footing as people suffering from physical diseases. 
   We also, Mr. Speaker, must pass the Lane Evans VA Reform Act, which is more comprehensive, provides more resources to the VA and more access to treatment for our veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I said, it is too late for Lance Corporal Schulze of Minnesota. It is too late for Staff Sergeant Omvig of Iowa. But it is not too late for our other veterans. 
   Let's do the right thing. Let's pass this legislation. 
   I thank the gentleman for his leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. I thank the ranking member for yielding. And I, too, want to applaud Chairman Rangel, Chairman Levin, and Ranking Member McCrery for the new spirit of bipartisanship and collaboration on the committee, which has resulted in this agreement getting here this evening, remarkable accomplishment. The Ways and Means Committee voted this out on a unanimous vote, unanimous bipartisan vote. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3688, the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act. I've long been an ardent supporter of trade expansion.  
   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is jobs. Fully 95 percent of the world's population lives outside the United States. The global economy's projected to grow at three times the rate of the United States economy. So, it doesn't take a mathematician to figure that we must take steps to make sure American farmers, manufacturers and service providers remain competitive in the international marketplace. 
   We also must make sure our products have fair access to foreign markets. Job creation depends upon both factors. 
   But this agreement is about more than expanding markets for U.S. goods and services. In fact, it's about more than job creation. It will also have a significant geopolitical impact. 
   As we all know, and as has been said on the floor tonight, South America's on the precipice of choosing between the free market, democratic West and the autocratic, dictatorial model being peddled by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. 
   Chavez continues to lure Latin American countries into his fold through false promises and blatant, unabashed bribery. This agreement that we're debating here tonight offers a legitimate alternative for Peru, an alternative to make significant economic strides and alleviate poverty, while providing increased market opportunities for both countries, U.S. businesses as well as Peruvian businesses, because, you see, Mr. Speaker, as most people in this body understand, trade is a win-win proposition. Both win when we expand trade, both countries. 
   The empirical data, Mr. Speaker, clearly shows the benefits to both countries, both economies. And as a Member who has a personal history with the Peruvian people, who's gone on several missions with our mission group from home, I urge Members not to ignore the humanitarian benefits as well as the geopolitical benefits that come along with passage of this agreement. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to send my sincere thanks and gratitude to our Peruvian counterparts who worked so hard to make this agreement a reality. Former President Toledo and former Ambassador Ferraro worked tirelessly to address the concerns of many of us here in this body, especially on the Ways and Means Committee, came and met with us at least three times. Many of us went over to Peru to meet with them. Also President Garcia and Ambassador Ortiz. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's do the right thing for American workers and vote ``yes'' on this trade agreement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Madam Speaker, it was an amazing turn of events that made the treatment parity legislation Patrick Kennedy and I introduced, H.R. 1424, the vehicle for one of the most far-reaching bills considered in our lifetime. 
   This legislation is a rescue bill for the U.S. economy and a rescue bill for the millions of Americans suffering from mental illness and addiction. It will also prevent a devastating tax increase on middle-income families and job creators at a time our families and economy cannot afford more blows. 
   This vote will mean the end of 12 long years of fighting for treatment parity for mental illness and addiction. This is not just another public policy issue: It's a matter of life or death for 54 million Americans suffering the ravages of mental illness and 26 million suffering from chemical addiction. 
   Last year alone, more than 30,000 Americans committed suicide from untreated depression and 150,000 Americans died as the direct result of chemical addiction. On top of the tragic loss of lives, untreated addiction and mental illness cost our economy over $550 billion a year. 
   I'm alive and sober today only because of the access I had to treatment following my last alcoholic blackout on July 31, 1981, when I woke up in a jail cell in Sioux Falls, SD. I'm living proof that treatment works and recovery is possible. 
   But far too many people in our country don't have the same access to treatment that I and other Members of Congress have had. 
   A major barrier for thousands of Americans is insurance discrimination against people in health plans who need treatment for mental illness or chemical addiction. 
   The legislation we are passing today will end this discrimination by prohibiting health insurers from placing discriminatory restrictions on treatment for people with mental illness or addiction. 
   No more inflated deductibles or copayments that don't apply to physical diseases. 
   No more limited treatment stays that don't apply to physical diseases. 
   No more discrimination against people with mental illness or chemical addiction. 
   The ``Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act'' simply provides equal treatment for diseases of the brain and the body. 
   Providing treatment equity is not only the right thing to do; it's also the cost-effective thing to do. 
   All the empirical data, including major actuarial studies, show that equity for mental health and addiction treatment will save literally billions of dollars nationally. At the same time, it will not raise premiums more than two- tenths of 1 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
   In other words, for less than the price of a cheap cup of coffee per month, millions of people could receive treatment for chemical addiction and mental illness. 
   Madam Speaker, Rep. Patrick Kennedy and I have traveled the country from one end to the other--holding 14 field hearings on the critical need for treatment parity. 
   We heard literally hundreds of stories of human suffering, broken families, tragic deaths, ruined careers and shattered dreams--all because of insurance companies not providing access to adequate treatment for mental illness and addiction. We will change that today. 
   Madam Speaker, it's time to end the discrimination against people who need treatment for mental illness and addiction. It's time to prohibit health insurers from placing discriminatory barriers to treatment. 
   It's time to join the coalition of insurance companies and business groups that support parity because they know it's cost-effective and saves health care dollars. 
   It's time to make this bipartisan legislation the law of the land. The people of America cannot afford to wait any longer for Congress to act.

   The inclusion of the mental health parity bill, major tax relief and bank deposit, FDIC, insurance increases caused me to reconsider my position and I believe there's too much at stake to let the legislation fail. 
   The revised bill is a recovery bill for the economy and a recovery bill for millions of Americans suffering the ravages of mental illness and addiction. 
   This revised legislation will also protect 22 million middle-income taxpayers from the enormous tax increases of the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT. 
   Madam Speaker, the revised bill also extends research and development tax credits to create jobs and renewable energy credits to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The revised bill also includes higher education deductions and child credits to help families and students. 
   Also, the revised bill increases bank deposit insurance limits, FDIC, to $250,000 to protect depositors and help small businesses that need credit. 
   Madam Speaker, I will vote for the revised economic recovery plan to help Minnesota's working families, seniors and small businesses during this historic crisis in our economy. The credit crisis is real, and it's destroying jobs, retirement savings and the American dream.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the issue before us is not just another public policy issue, it's a matter of life or death for 54 million Americans suffering the ravages of mental health and for 22 million Americans suffering from chemical addiction. 
   Last year alone, 300,000 people were denied access to addiction treatment, most had health insurance, and 33,000 people committed suicide from untreated depression. Over 150,000 of our fellow Americans died as a direct result of chemical addiction. 
   On top of the tragic loss of lives, Mr. Speaker, untreated addiction and mental illness cost our economy over $550 billion last year. According to the Wall Street Journal, untreated depression alone cost our businesses $70 billion in lost productivity last year. 
   So it's ludicrous for the opponents to come here and argue that parity will cost businesses $1.5 billion, as my friend from Washington, member of the Rules Committee, did. If you don't believe the Wall Street Journal, certainly those on our side of the aisle, what do you believe? Cost businesses $70 billion, just depression, untreated depression alone. 
   Mr. Speaker, all the empirical data, including all the actuarial studies, show that equity for mental health and addiction treatment will save literally billions of dollars nationally. At the same time, it will not raise premiums more than two-tenths of 1 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That's our own CBO numbers. So, I don't know where these people are getting these numbers, these inflated cost figures. Pulling them out of thin air is the only thing I can surmise. 
   The CBO says it will not raise premiums more than two-tenths of 1 percent. In other words, for the price of a cheap cup of coffee per month, several million Americans in health plans can receive treatment for chemical addiction and mental illness. And it's unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that some opponents of this legislation have misrepresented the costs of enacting parity.     
   Mr. Speaker, I'm alive and sober today only because of the access I had to treatment back on July 31, 1981, when I woke up in a jail cell in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I'm living proof that treatment works and recovery is real. 
   But far too many people in our country don't have the same access to treatment that I had and other Members of Congress have also had. A major barrier for thousands of Americans is insurance discrimination against people in health plans who need treatment for mental illness or chemical addiction. 
   The legislation that my friend from Rhode Island, PATRICK KENNEDY, who has worked tirelessly on this legislation, who arranged for all 14 field hearings, who has been a real champion, this legislation that we have authored will end the discrimination by prohibiting health insurers from placing discriminatory restrictions on treatment for people with mental illness or addiction. In other words, no more inflatable deductibles or copayments that don't apply to physical diseases. No more limited treatment stays that don't apply to physical diseases. No more discrimination against people with mental illness or chemical addiction. 
   The Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act simply provides equal treatment for diseases of the brain and the body. This legislation provides people in health plans with the same exact coverage that we as Members of Congress have and other Federal employees as well. 
   By the way, some of the exaggeration, some of the red herrings as to the use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV are just beyond belief. The red herrings presented by opponents, caffeine addiction, sibling rivalry, jet lag, would not be subject to treatment because insurance plans can use ``medical necessity'' requirements. So let's not use bogus red herring arguments. Let's come with intellectually honest arguments if you're against this legislation. 
   Also, the DSM-IV is used for Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans health care. I wonder how many of you can go home and say, look, it's good enough  for Members of Congress but it's not good enough for you, constituents. I don't think anybody in this body would dare do that nor should we. If it's good enough for Members of Congress, it's good enough for the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, PATRICK KENNEDY and I have traveled the country from one end to the other, holding 14 field hearings. We've heard literally hundreds of stories of human suffering, broken families, tragic deaths, shattered dreams all because of insurance companies not providing access to adequate treatment for mental illness and addiction. I don't have time, Mr. Speaker, to recite some of these horror stories, but PATRICK and I could share hundreds and hundreds of horror stories caused by discrimination in treatment for mentally ill and addicted people that we heard in these 14 States. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's time to end the discrimination against people who need treatment for mental illness and addiction. It's time to prohibit health insurers from placing discriminatory barriers to treatment. It's time to pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. The American people, Mr. Speaker, cannot wait any longer.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (HONORING THE CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS, FIRST RESPONDERS, AND THE CITIZENS OF MINNESOTA FOR THEIR VALIANT EFFORTS IN RESPONDING TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE INTERSTATE ROUTE 35W MISSISSIPPI RIVER BRIDGE -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution honoring the city of Minneapolis, first responders and Minnesota citizens for their heroic efforts following the I-35W bridge collapse. 
   No Minnesotan will ever forget August 1, 2007, the day the 8-lane bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River. 
   No Minnesotan will forget the tragic loss of 13 people, the serious injuries and incredible devastation caused by the falling bridge. 
   And Minnesotans will never forget the countless acts of heroism they witnessed that day from first responders and concerned bystanders that ignored danger and rushed to help victims. 
   In spite of the devastation, chaos and confusion, there was a highly organized response from Minnesota officials, firefighters, law enforcement and EMS personnel, the Minnesota National Guard, the Twin Cities Red Cross, local hospitals and the individuals, charities and businesses that donated time, money and goods. It made me proud to be a Minnesotan. 
   America also witnessed an incredible story in the midst of that terrible disaster--the school bus on the collapsed bridge filled with children who miraculously survived the ordeal. 
   Our deepest gratitude goes to every person who responded to this disaster, saving lives, caring for the injured and comforting victims and their families. 
   A special thanks to Governor Pawlenty for his great leadership, as well as Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek, Minneapolis Mayor R. T. Rybak, the author of this resolution, Representative KEITH ELLISON, and the dean of our Minnesota Congressional delegation, JIM OBERSTAR, for his leadership in moving bridge funding legislation last month. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to support this resolution honoring the people who responded so bravely to the Minnesota bridge collapse.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the Bush administration's $700 billion bailout plan for Wall Street firms and banks. 
   The administration's bailout plan imposes great risk to taxpayers and no guarantee of success. 
   Because this bill was considered in such haste, without adequate hearings or debate, nobody knows what this complex financial scheme will produce so the final cost to taxpayers is uncertain. 
   Four hundred of the Nation's top economists signed a petition to Congress objecting to the bailout plan, as they are skeptical of the Federal Government buying up toxic mortgage-backed assets from banks and hoping the benefits trickle down from Wall Street to Main Street. 
   According to these economists, the long-term effects of this financial scheme--higher inflation, a weakened dollar and a greater National debt--will outweigh any short-term stabilization of the credit markets. 
   Rather than providing $700 billion of taxpayer money to buy frozen mortgage assets to solve the current problem, Congress should adopt the plan to insure mortgage-backed securities through payment of insurance premiums by the holders of these assets. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bailout.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (COPS IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Law Enforcement Caucus and proud cosponsor of H.R. 1700, the COPS Improvement Act, I rise to urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   Since its creation in the 1994 Crime Bill, the COPS program has been a key component of the Federal effort to keep our communities safe. The program has been widely hailed as a success. It has supported the hiring of over 100,000 officers and contributed to a nationwide decrease in violent crime in the 1990s. 
   H.R. 1700 makes several improvements to the program to increase public safety across the country. It reauthorizes the COPS hiring program to help put 50,000 new police on the beat in our communities, provides $350 million a year for State and local agencies to develop new technologies for crime prevention and police training and provides $200 million a year for community-based prosecution programs. 
   In my home state of Minnesota, I've seen, firsthand, the importance of the COPS program to local police in reducing crime and improving public safety. 
   The COPS program has been an invaluable resource to state and local law enforcement agencies for hiring, technology and school safety grants, and has been critical to providing personnel, equipment, training and technical assistance in the war on drugs and homeland security. 
   We must never forget our cops are on the front lines--in the war on crime, fighting drug dealers and protecting our homeland. 
   As Chris Matthews of MSNBC said after the attacks of September 11: ``Before the attacks on our homeland, America's heroes were the rich and famous. Since Sept. 11, America's heroes are the cops and firefighters. And that's good for America.'' 
   Today, America's heroes are counting on us. Congress owes it to these brave men and women who put their lives on the line every day they put on the badge. Our nation's law enforcement officers need all the tools Congress can provide. It's time to honor the sacrifices made by our Nation's law enforcement community and give our Nation's finest the support they need.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bipartisan comprehensive energy bill that opens offshore areas to drilling, provides incentives for the development of renewable energy, clamps down on speculators and requires oil companies to drill on 69 million acres of leased land and water. 
   I oppose the alternative bill, which would give coastal states that support drilling over $40 billion from oil and gas royalties over the next 10 years. After 2019, the federal government would be required to transfer to coastal states nearly 40 percent of all federal revenues from offshore oil and gas drilling ($6 billion every year). 
   Even the Administration has told us that such a cost would be too high! 
   We should not hand coastal states billions of federal dollars, while giving them undue influence over national resource management. And, despite its cost, the alternative plan would do little to increase the supply or reduce the price of oil, according to the Department of Energy. 
   Congress should debate offshore drilling on its own merits without using resource revenues to buy votes. Our nation needs a comprehensive energy reform policy that will boost supplies of all types of energy, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lower gas prices. The American people deserve nothing less!

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (TAXPAYER PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the Taxpayer Protection Act. This legislation is a package of commonsense reforms that passed the Ways and Means Committee by a voice vote with broad bipartisan support, and I want to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Rangel of the full Ways and Means Committee, as well as Chairman Lewis, the chairman of our Oversight Subcommittee, for working in a bipartisan, pragmatic and commonsense way on this legislation, and for working in a bipartisan way thus far generally in the committee. I also want to thank Ranking Member McCrery for his leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, true to its name, this bill will protect taxpayers and expand their rights. One important reform will prevent Internet domains from using the Treasury Department's name or symbol, which is usually done to trick people into giving out sensitive personal or financial information. Clearly, this should not be allowed and should be outlawed, as this bill provides. It  prohibits phishing, and by that I mean phishing with a ``P-H,'' not the kind that Minnesota is famous for. We are referring here to mass e-mail communications falsely claiming to be from the IRS that can lead to identity theft and have victimized too many Americans. 
   The bill also requires the IRS to notify taxpayers when there is an unauthorized use of the taxpayer's identity. This will help taxpayers take steps to clear their names quickly if and when their identity is stolen. 
   Another commonsense provision of this bill allows the IRS to return funds directly to a taxpayer's retirement account if the IRS improperly levied fines from that account. 
   One provision, Mr. Speaker, that received considerable attention in the committee deals with refund anticipation loans. I mentioned in the committee that while I certainly understand the motivation behind the provision and the belief that the IRS should not be a facilitator for predatory loans, I am concerned because the bill does not define ``predatory''; but I trust, Mr. Speaker, that will be clarified in the conference. 
   I also hope we are not inadvertently making this problem worse by denying lenders information on ``debt indicators'' so that the provision increases the risk that a lender will not be reimbursed by the taxpayer's refund. This could cause lenders to increase fees and interest rates even further, making taxpayers pay even more for early access to their refunds. While I am not opposed to the provision, this should be addressed in the conference. 
   I strongly support another provision in the bill which would encourage the IRS to do more to ensure that taxpayers entitled to receive earned income credit refunds actually receive them. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we all know, the earned income credit is one of our most effective antipoverty tools for working families. This provision certainly deserves our strong support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am also very pleased that the committee adopted my amendment to prevent tax fraud by prison inmates. This amendment is based on legislation that Chairman Lewis and I introduced in the last Congress in response to a hearing we held in 2005. This hearing revealed massive tax fraud going on within the walls of our Nation's prisons. In fact, the IRS testified that 15 percent of all tax fraud in the United States is committed by prison inmates while in prison. Tax fraud in any form is obviously unacceptable and illegal; but it is particularly outrageous and egregious when it is committed by prison inmates who are supposed to be paying their debt to society, not bilking taxpayers. 
   For example, we heard testimony, Mr. Speaker, from one inmate who had swindled taxpayers to the tune of $3.5 million in false tax return claims, and this was not an isolated incident. 
   While the IRS is able to detect some inmate tax fraud, far too much of it falls through the cracks. And, unfortunately, the IRS is prohibited by current law from sharing information with prison officials that would allow those officials to punish and stop this fraud. 
   My amendment, and I appreciate the chairman's support of this amendment, my amendment would allow the IRS to disclose information to Federal prison officials to help them stop the tax fraud that is occurring right under their noses within the walls of Federal prisons. I hope in time this commonsense provision can also be extended to include State prisons. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is truly fitting that in a bill entitled the Taxpayer Protection Act we protect honest taxpayers from such blatant, outrageous fraud that is being committed by some prison inmates. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect taxpayers and support this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (PAUL WELLSTONE AND PETE DOMENICI MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we would not be having the debate here today without the compassionate leadership of the late Senator Paul Wellstone. 
   I want to thank the Speaker and majority leader, as well as Chairmen Rangel, Stark, George Miller, Dingell, Pallone and Andrews, for their key support. 
   The issue before us today is not just another public policy issue. The issue today before us is a matter of life and death for 54 million Americans suffering the ravages of mental illness and 26 million Americans suffering from chemical addiction. 
   Last year alone, more than 30,000 Americans committed suicide from untreated depression and 150,000 Americans died as the direct result of chemical addiction. On top of the tragic loss of lives, untreated addiction and mental illness cost our economy $550 billion last year, according to the Wall Street Journal. In fact, the Journal cited $70 billion was lost from our economy because of untreated depression alone. 
   I am alive and sober today only because of the access that I had to treatment following my last alcoholic blackout on July 31, 1981. I woke up that day in a jail cell in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and I am living proof that treatment works and recovery is possible. But far too many people in our country don't have the same access to treatment that I and other Members of Congress, other Federal employees have. 
   A major barrier for thousands of Americans is insurance discrimination, plain and simple, against people in health plans who need treatment for mental illness or chemical addiction. The legislation my friend from Rhode Island (Mr. Kennedy) and I have authored, H.R. 6983 before us today, would end this discrimination by prohibiting health insurers from placing discriminatory restrictions on treatment for people with mental illness or addiction. 
   No more inflated deductibles or copayments that don't exist for physical diseases. No more limited treatment stays that don't apply to physical ailments, no more discrimination against people with mental illness or chemical addiction. 
   I just want to say a word about the chief sponsor of this legislation, Mr. Kennedy, who has worked tirelessly on this bill. We have worked together for many years now on this legislation since he first came to the House. I want to publicly acknowledge and thank Mr. Kennedy, who has not only worked hard on this legislation, but has been an inspiration to literally hundreds of thousands of Americans as we traveled this country to 14 States, holding field hearings on this important legislation. 
   Simply stated, the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which has, by the way, 274 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, simply stated, provides equal treatment for diseases of the brain with the body. Diseases of the brain should be treated the same as diseases of the body. 
   There is no government mandate. Nobody is mandated to insure anybody for treatment for mental illness or chemical addiction. There is no mandate in this bill. All it says is if your policy includes coverage for mental illness or addiction, then you cannot be discriminated against, that is, those ailments must be treated the same as physical ailments. 
   Providing treatment equity is not only the right thing to do, it's the cost-effective thing to do. Believe me, we have over the last 12 years assembled all the empirical data in the world, all the actuarial studies in the world, and they all showed the same thing, that equity for mental health and addiction treatment will save, not cost, but save, literally, billions of dollars nationally. 
   At the same time, treatment parity will not raise premiums more than two-tenths of 1 percent. That's according to the Congressional Budget Office. Let me repeat that. Premiums will not raise more than two-tenths of 1 percent. 
   So, in other words, for the price of a cheap cup of coffee per month, I am not talking about a fancy restaurant, I am talking about Pete's Diner, where many of us go, millions of people could receive treatment for chemical addiction and mental illness. In fact, 16 million people of the 26 million people in health plans could receive treatment under this bill. 
   When my friend from Rhode Island and I traveled this country holding field hearings on this legislation, we heard, literally, hundreds and hundreds of stories of human suffering that ripped your heart out, broken families, tragic deaths, ruined careers, shattered dreams, all because insurance companies would not provide access to treatment for mental illness and addiction for people who were in health plans. We could change that here today. 
   It's time to end the discrimination against people who need treatment for mental illness and addiction. It's time to prohibit health insurers from placing discriminatory barriers on treatment. It's time to join the coalition of insurance companies, yes, I said insurance companies. More than 10 of them now support this, as well as the major business groups who support parity. They know it's cost effective, they know parity saves health care dollars. It's time to make this bipartisan legislation the law of the land. 
   The people of America cannot wait any longer for Congress to act.  
   Mr. David Wellstone 
   Son of the late Senator Paul Wellstone 
   Co-Founder, Wellstone Action 
   Statement for the Record in Support of the Passage of The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, September, 2008 
   I am pleased to speak in support of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. This legislation is critically important to the future of health care, and it is also very close to my heart. During my father's time in the Senate, he never stopped fighting for fairness in coverage and treatment for mental illness and substance use disorders. My family and I are grateful for the tribute that the Senate and the House have paid to my father's legacy by naming the bill after him, as well as his close colleague, Sen. Pete Domenici. 
   My brother and I founded Wellstone Action to carry on my father's work, and through this organization, thousands of people are trained each year to run for office and to develop grassroots skills in organizing and leadership. But nothing represents my father's passion and commitment more than his work to pass legislation that would end the discrimination against those with mental illness and substance use disorders. This  legislation is a major achievement and will do so much to end that discrimination. 
   For some time, I have been coming to Washington to speak on behalf of this legislation, but the fight for parity has a long history with many milestones: the 1996 federal law; the 1999 Executive Order that gave federal employees mental health and addiction parity benefits; the many successes at the state level to strengthen their parity laws; the times that Congress came very close to passing the expansion of the federal law; and the endorsement by President Bush in 2002. For my father, these milestones were very personal. His dedication stemmed from his personal observations of the terrible conditions in psychiatric institutions when his brother was hospitalized in the 1950s. These conditions, and the eventual catastrophic financial toll that my grandparents had to bear, inspired my father to do everything he could to make things right for those in similar circumstances. 
   The legislation that my father and Sen. Domenici passed in 1996 was groundbreaking and important, for it established in law an important first principle of parity: that those with mental illness should not be discriminated against in insurance coverage. But my father knew that it was not enough, and that is why this legislation is so necessary. It is the critically important next step toward ending the persistent discrimination against people who suffer from mental illness and addiction. 
   In the House, the tireless leadership of Congressman Patrick Kennedy and Congressman Jim Ramstad has been extraordinary, especially with the groundbreaking inclusion of substance use disorders in the parity bill and their protection of the rights of patients. They and the House Leadership, especially Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, should be proud of their efforts to make this legislation one that will strongly protect the needs of millions of Americans who have mental illness and substance use disorders. In the House, the efforts by the Chairmen of the Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and Education and Labor Committees should be proud of their successful efforts to fight for the rights of those with these illnesses. And, as I know well, nothing is accomplished without the unflagging commitment of hundreds of dedicated staff and advocates who have worked so hard to right the wrong of discrimination that has existed for so long in our country. 
   I also want to extend my deep gratitude to former First Lady Rosalynn Carter for her many years of leadership on this issue and many other problems related to mental illness. She and my father worked closely together on parity for many years, and he was always grateful for her support and leadership. 
   We know that mental illness is a real, painful, and sometimes fatal disease. It is also a treatable disease. My father used to say that the gap between what we know and what we do is lethal. Available medications and psychological treatments, alone or in combination, can help most people who suffer from mental illness and addiction. But without adequate treatment, these illnesses can continue or worsen in severity. Suicide is the third leading cause of death of young people in the U.S. Each year, 32,000 Americans take their lives, hundreds of thousands attempt to do so, and in 90% of these situations, the cause is untreated mental illness. This legislation will save lives. It will also go a long way toward ending the stigma that is behind the discrimination. 
   People have asked me why I am so involved in this issue. My first response is, ``Because of my father, of course''. I loved him and I miss him, and I have learned that many others here in Washington and throughout the country miss him too, especially his courage and his compassion. He fought hard for those who had no voice, and he had a strong personal commitment to helping those with mental illness and addiction. After he died, Congressional members honored him and my family by promising to name the parity bill after him, and this meant a great deal to my family. But I also knew the kind of man my father was, and the kind of parity bill he would have wanted finally passed into law, and I wanted to help ensure that the final bill was one worthy of his name. The safeguards for patients that have been included in this final bill, such as protections of stronger state laws, out of network benefits, oversight of diagnosis coverage, and transparency of medical necessity, are essential to a strong law. This Congress can be remembered as the one that had the courage and leadership to pass a strong parity bill, one where everyone's voices had a chance to be heard. 
   I, along with millions of Americans, look forward to the day when people with mental illness and substance use disorder receive decent, humane, and timely care. The passage of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 brings us so much closer to this day. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I want to say, as I have said many times before as I have traveled this country, were the gentleman from Rhode Island's uncle, President Kennedy, still alive today, and were President Kennedy to write a sequel to his book ``Profiles in Courage,'' there would be a complete chapter about his nephew, the gentleman from Rhode Island, Patrick Kennedy, because not only has he been right on the policy and has done a tremendous job over the past several years fighting for parity, but also his personal story, which he  shared with people all across this Nation, has literally inspired hundreds of thousands of people to get help. He has been a real profile in courage and a pleasure to work with.

I want to thank all of the organizations, all of the individuals, too many to mention here today, but I want to thank particularly David Wellstone and Allan Garrity from Senator Wellstone's staff who have kept the legacy of Paul Wellstone alive in terms of moving this mental health and addiction treatment parity legislation. 
   I also want to thank the 274 bipartisan cosponsors of the current bill. I want to thank the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, because without their leadership we wouldn't be here today about to pass mental health parity. 
   I want to thank the distinguished chairmen of the full committees and the subcommittees and the other side of the aisle whose cooperation has been incredibly positive and helpful; and without their support, every one of you, without your support we wouldn't be here today as well.

   I want to thank all the staff from the full committees, the three full committees of jurisdiction, as well as the three subcommittees of jurisdiction. 
   And I particularly want to thank Karin Hope, my legislative director, who has worked on this legislation day and night for all 12 years that we've worked together. 
   Let me just wrap it up, Mr. Speaker, by saying that it's time for Congress to deal with America's number 1 public health problem. It's time for Congress to outlaw discrimination in treatment against people with mental illness and chemical addiction. It's time for Congress to pass mental health and chemical addiction treatment parity.

   It is a matter of basic justice for every American to have access to public accommodations and businesses. And every American deserves the opportunity to hold a job, contribute their talents and live with dignity and independence. 
   That's what the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, of 1990 was all about--creating access and equal opportunity for millions of Americans with disabilities. 
   And that's why the recent court cases that have chipped away at the protections of the ADA have been so alarming. This important bill will stop the erosion and clarify that people who use adaptive technology to cope with their disability still deserve the protection of the ADA. 
   People with disabilities have to overcome obstacles every day. It's time to remove the legal obstacles to their basic civil rights. 
   It's time to tear down the barriers that keep people with disabilities from fully participating and sharing their gifts. It's time to restore basic justice.

   I rise with tremendous sadness and grief about an awful tragedy that took place this evening in Minnesota. Full details on the tragedy are still sketchy, but we know that, as of 6:10 p.m. Minnesota time, during the midst of evening rush hour, a bridge on Interstate Highway 35W in downtown Minneapolis, very close to the Metrodome, collapsed, causing at least 40 cars to fall into the Mississippi River. 
   As my colleague, Keith Ellison, mentioned, at least three people are confirmed dead. A number of others have been hospitalized at the nearby Hennepin County Medical Center, and now we get word at five other hospitals as well. Rescue operations are still under way at this late hour, as fires continue to burn and people remain unaccounted for. 
   The Minnesota Congressional Delegation, thanks to our dean, Mr. Oberstar, has already met and pledged our total support to obtain whatever Federal assistance is needed. 
   In addition, on behalf of Governor Pawlenty, with whom I've been in constant contact, I want to offer the gratitude of all Minnesotans to Speaker Pelosi, who has already pledged her full support for any Federal assistance our State needs to address this bridge disaster. 
   I also want to pay special thanks to the first responders who are on the scene at the moment and rescue operations and other services. Every single Fire Department in the seven county  metro area is there on the scene, as well as all the Police Departments, emergency medical personnel. And, again, we all thank those brave first responders. 
   Our thoughts and prayers, Mr. Speaker, finally, are with the families of all those affected by this horrible disaster. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely, of course; and we ask all Americans to pray for the victims, the survivors and their families.

Dr. Ross came to Wayzata Community Church in 2004, after a 14-year ministry in Columbus, OH. Our Wayzata Community Church and indeed our entire Lake Minnetonka community are truly blessed by Dr. Ross' strong and principled leadership as well as his inspiring commitment to help people in need. 
   Every summer since 1996, Dr. Ross has led a mission of primarily young people to Mexico where they have built over 100 homes for the poorest of the poor. As one 8th grader from our church told me, J.R. not only talks the talk, he walks the walk. He is always the first one up the ladder in the morning and the last one down from the roof in the evening.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, the President has said for more than 4 years that he would follow the advice of his commanders on the ground with respect to troop levels in Iraq. That is why I am both surprised and disappointed the President did not follow the advice given as recently as 2 months ago by the Army and Marine Corps Chiefs of Staff, as well as General John Abizaid, General George Casey, and General Colin Powell. All of these highly respected commanders expressed their opposition to increasing the number of U.S. troops in Iraq. 
   As General Abizaid, the top commander in the Middle East said, an increase in U.S. troops would be counterproductive because it will perpetuate the dependency of Iraqi forces, create more targets and stretch our military too thin.     
   Until recently the top ground commander in Iraq, General George Casey, has said that sending more American troops into Baghdad and Anbar province would increase the Iraqi dependency on Washington. As General Colin Powell, one of the most respected military leaders of our generation put it, a surge was already tried in Baghdad last fall and it failed. Now it will only further delay Iraqis taking control of their own security. 
   ``It will only further delay Iraqis taking control of their own security.'' That is from General Colin Powell, who also noted that he had not heard any generals on the ground in Iraq ask for more troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, the original mission of U.S. troops in Iraq was to liberate the country and turn it over to the Iraqi people. We need to get back to that original mission. Our brave troops have done an absolutely heroic job of liberating the people of Iraq. Now our troops should get back to the original mission of training Iraqi security forces so they can secure their own country and turn it over to the Iraqi people. General Casey has long argued that the principal emphasis of American policy should be training Iraqi security forces and handing over responsibility to the Iraqis. 
   Mr. Speaker, the resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq that we passed in the fall of 2002 was never intended to authorize the use of American troops to police a civil war. It was never intended to provide justification for sending 21,500 more American troops into the middle of a civil war. As former Navy Secretary in Virginia, Senator JOHN WARNER, put it: ``Whom do they shoot at, the Sunni or the Shia?'' With 325,000 Iraqi security forces already trained, Mr. Speaker, that is according to our Defense Department, it is time for Iraqi troops to step up to the frontlines in Baghdad, Anbar province, and Fallujah. It is time to accelerate the training of Iraqi security forces and the turnover of security to the Iraqis so our troops can come home with their mission completed. It is time for enforceable benchmarks to measure the progress of Iraqi security forces. Mr. Speaker, it is time for a surge in diplomacy, not a surge in troops to mend a broken country. It is time for a stepped-up regional peace effort in the Middle East to settle this conflict. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress should listen to our commanders on the ground. We should follow the advice of the Army and Marine Corps Chiefs of Staff. We should follow the advice of General Abizaid, General Casey, and General Powell when they spoke up in December. It is time for Congress to step up and express our strong support of our brave troops, our continued support of the original mission, and our opposition to the increase of U.S. troops to police a civil war in Iraq. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Chairman, that great Minnesotan Hubert Humphrey said, ``The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the disabled.'' 
   The National Affordable Housing Trust Fund meets this moral test. It fills a critical need for vulnerable families, children, the elderly and people with disabilities. 
   The shortage of affordable housing is truly a crisis in our country--and it is not restricted to inner cities. 
   Virtually all of the suburban cities I represent have long waiting lists for affordable housing. I hear stories every week about families living in their cars, veterans living on the streets, seniors having to choose between medicine and housing. 
   Several of the communities I represent have sponsored ``sleepouts'' to raise money and awareness of the problem of homelessness and near-homelessness. They have raised millions of dollars and helped thousands of families. 
   But the crisis is just too big. The Federal Government has a critical role to play in helping the 14.4 million families with housing needs in our country. The important assistance in this bill can make the difference between stable housing and no housing at all. 
   Mr. Chairman, by setting aside funds for the production, preservation and rehabilitation of affordable housing, this legislation will help those suffering the ravages of poverty, homelessness and near-homelessness. 
   I urge all members to support this important legislation to expand affordable housing for all Americans. Everyone deserves to have a place to sleep every night that is stable and warm. 
   It's time to address the affordable housing crisis in America. It's time to pass the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (MENTAL HEALTH PARITY NOW -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. I thank my friend and colleague from Rhode Island for yielding, and I thank him for his outstanding leadership as co-Chair with me of the Addiction Treatment and Recovery Caucus, for his outstanding leadership on the parity legislation, and every other piece of legislation dealing with mental illness and addiction. 
   I also want to thank my friend and colleague from Rhode Island for the inspiration he has been to literally hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of Americans because of his own honesty, candor, because of the example he has been. By going public with his own story, he has impacted the lives of countless Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, as my friend from Rhode Island knows, and many of my friends here know, on July 31, 1981, I woke up in a jail cell in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, under arrest from my last alcoholic blackout as a result of my last alcoholic episode. I had abused alcohol for 12 long and painful years, and I was under arrest when I woke up that morning for disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and failure to vacate the premises. 
   I am alive and sober today only because of access to treatment that I had, like other Members of Congress. Like my friend from Rhode Island, we had access to treatment as well as the grace of God and the support of many other recovering people, over the last 26 years in my case.     
   I'm living proof, as is my friend from Rhode Island, that treatment works and recovery is real. But too many people don't have that access to treatment. It's a national disgrace that 270,000 Americans were denied access to treatment last year for their addiction, people who had admitted their powerlessness over chemicals, and the treatment doors were slammed shut because the insurance companies said, No, we're not going to cover you in treatment, despite the fact that the policy said treatment shall be provided. 
   It's a national tragedy, Madam Speaker, that 150,000 of our fellow Americans died last year as a direct result of chemical addiction. Thirty thousand Americans committed suicide from their depression last year alone. 
   And it's a national crisis that untreated addiction and mental illness cost our country, our economy, $550 billion last year alone. 
   And think of the costs that can't be measured in dollars and cents. Think of the human suffering, the broken families, the shattered dreams, the ruined careers, the destroyed lives. The statistics are so staggering that sometimes we forget there's a tragic human story behind every figure, as Representative Kennedy and I heard in those 14 field hearings we conducted throughout the Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, let me now share a couple of those stories. 
   In my home State of Minnesota, the second hearing we held, Anna Westin, was a young woman who suffered from anorexia for several years, and her mother, Kitty, talked about how their insurance company, the family's insurance company, refused to cover the inpatient treatment that Anna Westin desperately needed. Anna became distraught at being a financial burden on her parents and committed suicide, took her own life. 
   I want to thank Anna's mother, Kitty Westin. She has created the Anna Westin Foundation to help other young people struggling with eating disorders. And Kitty Westin has been a tireless advocate for expanding access to treatment. But her daughter didn't need to die had the insurance company done the right thing, the cost-effective thing, and covered that inpatient treatment that Anna Westin needed so badly. 
   We also heard horror story after horror story as a result of health plans discriminating against people with chemical addiction and mental illness. 
   We heard from Steve Winter, a close personal friend of ours because of these hearings. He traveled in his wheelchair to at least half of those field hearings. Steve tells the most compelling story I've ever heard. When he was a teenager, he woke up one morning and his back was stinging. He felt a stinging sensation. He stumbled downstairs to breakfast and he realized that blood was streaming from his back. He put his hand back there to his back, lower back, and had a handful of blood. Then his mother came into the kitchen, and her voice said, your sister is in heaven, and now you and I are going to join her. His mother was pointing a gun at him. Fortunately, Steve was able to talk his mother into putting the gun down after she had killed his sister and critically injured him, causing him to be a paraplegic for the rest of his life. But as Steve said, My mother didn't shoot my sister and me; her mental illness did. It was the family's insurance company who is to blame for stopping the coverage of his mother's drugs for schizophrenia. That's what caused Steve to lose the use of his legs for the rest of his life and his sister to be shot to death. 
   Clearly, Madam Speaker, there are very few families in America who haven't been touched in some way by mental illness or addiction. And I know my colleague's going to share some of those stories, but let me just say that it's time to end the discrimination against people suffering the ravages of mental illness and chemical addiction. It's time to end the higher copayments, higher deductibles, the out-of-pocket costs and limited treatment stays. It's time to end those discriminatory barriers that don't exist for other physical diseases. It's time to treat mental illness and chemical addiction under the same rules as physical illnesses. After all, it was 1946 when the American Medical Association categorized addiction as a disease. Anybody from the Flat Earth Society who still thinks it's a moral failing, I suggest they consult the American Medical Association, our Nation's doctors, who, as long ago as 1956, realized addiction is a disease. 
   As my colleague from Rhode Island said, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act will give Americans suffering from addiction greater access to treatment by prohibiting health insurers from placing discriminatory restrictions on treatment. In other words, it will end the discrimination against people in health plans  who need treatment for mental illness or chemical addiction, plain and simple. 
   Madam Speaker, expanding access to treatment is not only the right thing to do, it's also the cost-effective thing to do. We've got all the empirical data in the world, all the actuarial studies in the world to prove that equity for mental health and addiction treatment will save billions of dollars nationally while not raising premiums more than 2/10 of 1 percent, and that's according to an exhaustive study by the Congressional Budget Office. 
   In other words, Madam Speaker, for less than the price of a cheap cup of coffee per month, one cheap cup of coffee per month, 16 million people in health plans could receive treatment for their chemical addiction and millions more for mental illness. 
   It's also well documented that every dollar spent on treatment saves up to $12 in health care and criminal justice costs alone. People like Mr. Kennedy and I, who have been treated, our health care costs are 100 percent less, 100 percent less than people with an addiction or mental illness whose disease has not been treated; 100 percent less in terms of health care costs alone. 
   This landmark legislation that Representative Kennedy and I have been working on for 10 years has 273 House sponsors, 273 of you here in the House, cosponsors. It was passed with strong bipartisan majorities in two subcommittees, three full committees in the House. 
   Let me say, Madam Speaker, the bottom line now, we must not go home this year without enacting mental health parity into law. Let me repeat that. We must not go home this year, Congress must not leave without enacting mental health parity into law. Tens of millions of Americans suffering the ravages of mental illness, chemical addiction, can't afford to wait any longer. 
   Madam Speaker, before I yield back to my friend from Rhode Island, let me just thank him, again, for his incredible leadership, for his outstanding work, for his passion for people in need, people suffering from mental illness and chemical addiction, and for the example he is to millions of Americans. 
   I want to conclude, Madam Speaker, by saying that ending discrimination against people suffering from addiction or mental illness is not just another public policy issue. It's a matter of life or death. It's a life-or-death issue for millions of Americans suffering the ravages of mental illness and chemical addiction. 
   Let me conclude by repeating as strongly as I can, it's time to end the discrimination against people who need treatment for mental illness and/or chemical addiction. It's time to prohibit health insurers from placing discriminatory barriers on treatment. It's time to provide greater access to treatment. It's time to pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act, because, Madam Speaker, the American people, literally, can't afford to wait any longer for Congress to act. The American people should not have to wait any longer for Congress to deal with America's number one public health problem. 
   Let's keep the ball moving forward. And next week, hopefully, we'll have the best Christmas and Hanukkah present we could ever deliver to the American people; that is, treatment equity for those suffering from mental illness and chemical addiction. 
   Again, I thank my friend from Rhode Island.

   Mr. RAMSTAD. I again appreciate the gentleman's comments. 
   One of those troops lived not far from me in a neighboring community in Minnesota. Lance Corporal Jonathan Schultze, a brave, proud marine who had returned from combat in Iraq, went to the VA suffering from PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as alcoholism. He was told that there were no beds available at the VA, and he would be number 26 on the waiting list, that he will get a call in weeks, probably several months. 
   Well, 4 days later, Marine Lcpl Jonathan Schultze was found in his apartment hanging, hanging from an electrical cord. Just one victim, one brave marine who didn't have to die after sacrificing so much for his country in Iraq, one brave veteran who didn't receive the mental health treatment he needed and deserved. 
   And I thank my friend from Rhode Island and others who supported the Veterans Health Care Act. Hopefully, that legislation that we passed and was signed by the President earlier this year will help address that problem. 
   I also appreciate the gentleman from Rhode Island pointing out that the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Treatment Equity Act only addresses one aspect of the problem here, people who are being discriminated against in health plans. We also need to make sure our troops are getting the adequate mental health care that they need and deserve; our veterans, across the board, from all wars, are getting the treatment that they need and deserve; our Medicare seniors, you look at the rates as people are aging with our aging population, so is the incidence among people over 65, the incidence of alcoholism and drug addiction. We need to address the Medicare population as well. 
   The Medicaid population, there are roughly 26 million addicts and alcoholics in this country according to SAMPHSA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration. About 16 million of the 26 million alcoholics and addicts are in health plans, which means that at least 10 million are either in Medicaid or have no insurance whatsoever. We've got to address that population as well. 
   And, finally, as the gentleman from Rhode Island knows well, 82 percent of the people in prisons and jails in the United States are there directly or indirectly because of mental illness and/or addiction, and we're not treating, in our prisons and jails, we're not treating these problems, the underlying cause. And 99 percent of prisoners are going to get out some day, about one percent being capital offenders who presumably will be executed or will be staying there for the rest of their life without parole.

   Mr. RAMSTAD. Ironically, when President Nixon declared the war on drugs, he directed 70 percent of the funding to treatment, prevention and education, 30 percent to the supply side. In other words, 70 percent to demand side, to reduce the demand for drugs, and 30 percent for law enforcement, proper adjudication and interdiction efforts. Well, today those funding priorities have been reversed, and we simply aren't spending our resources wisely. We are not doing enough on the demand side of the equation. 
   That's why over the last decade and a half the treatment beds in America have disappeared. They're gone. Insurance companies aren't reimbursing. That's why, even more alarming, 60 percent of the adolescent treatment beds have disappeared over the last decade. We need to reverse those priorities. 
   I remember visiting with President Clinton and several other Members of Congress and Mexican President, President Salinas, former President Salinas, and he said, until you Americans curb your insatiable demand for drugs, we're never going to be able to address the supply-side problem, the flow of drugs from Central and South America through Mexico into the United States. 
   So the gentleman from Rhode Island is absolutely correct: we need to address the demand side. We need to spend more of our resources on treatment, education, and prevention.

   Mr. RAMSTAD. I'd just like to conclude my portion, Mr. Speaker, by quoting from one of our key advisers on this legislation, somebody who's a true expert, Navy Captain Medical Dr. Ron Smith, who is former chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center and who's worked in chemical dependency in the field of treatment for dozens of years. 
   And Dr. Smith, when he testified at a hearing several years ago, said every time you treat a person for addiction or mental illness, you're really helping seven people: their siblings, spouse, significant others, children, grandparents, uncles, aunts and others close to the addicted or mentally ill person. Why? Because these are family diseases that affect the entire family. And Dr. Smith went on to say at that hearing that the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Equity Act has the potential to favorably impact more American people than any other law passed by Congress since Social Security and Medicare; that this bill, to provide treatment, to provide equity in treatment for mental health and addiction has the potential to help more American people than any law passed by Congress since Social Security and Medicare. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can't afford not to pass this bill next week, the final week of this year of Congress. This is a historic opportunity for the Congress; and I know, I know in my heart that the President will sign the bill if it gets to his desk.     
   Again, I urge all Americans who have an interest in this life-or-death issue to e-mail, call your Congress Member, your Senators in the next several days, urge them to pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Parity Act. It is absolutely essential that we get it done now. 
   I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAMSTAD. (HOUSE SHOULD VOTE ON TREATMENT PARITY BILL -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, with 54 million Americans suffering the ravages of mental illness and 26 million suffering from chemical addiction, the failure of this Congress to pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act is a slap in the face to millions of Americans with mental illness and/or drug and alcohol addiction. It's also the biggest failure of this session of Congress. 
   Congress' failure to knock down the discriminatory barriers to treatment is a matter of life or death for people suffering from mental health and addiction diseases, diseases that took the lives of over 200,000 Americans last year alone. 
   Just 2 weeks ago, my friend of over 25 years took his own life as a result of depression. He joined 34,000 other Americans who have committed suicide from depression this year. 
   In my home State of Minnesota, Anna Westin was a young woman with anorexia. She suffered for several years from this terrible disease. Her parents' insurance company refused to cover the inpatient treatment that she desperately needed. Distraught at her condition and being a financial burden on her parents, young Anna took her own life. 
   Representative PATRICK KENNEDY and I held 14 field hearings across our country this year on the need to end insurance discrimination against mental illness and addiction. We heard story after story after story like these. 
   We heard from Steve Winter, who traveled in his wheelchair to several of our field hearings. When Steve was a young teenager, he awoke one morning with a stinging pain in his back. He stumbled downstairs to breakfast. He realized that blood was streaming down his back. He heard his mother's voice say, ``Your sister is in heaven, and now you and I are going there to join her.'' His mother was pointing a gun at him. She had been taken off the schizophrenia drugs she desperately needed. As Steve put it, ``My mother didn't shoot my sister and me; her mental illness did.'' 
   Clearly there are not many families in America, Mr. Speaker, who haven't been touched in some way by mental illness or addiction. Like my close personal friend, like Anna Westin and Steve Winter's sister, I could have been one of the thousands of Americans who die each year from mental illness and chemical addiction. 
   For on July 31, 1981, I awoke in a jail cell in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, as  the result of my last alcoholic blackout after abusing alcohol for 12 long and painful years. I'm alive and sober today, Mr. Speaker, only because of the access I had to treatment in 1981. I'm living proof that treatment works and recovery is real. 
   But too many people don't have that access to treatment. It's a national disgrace that 270,000 Americans were denied addiction treatment last year. It's a national tragedy that 160,000 of our fellow Americans died from chemical addiction and 34,000 died from suicide as a result of their depression. And it's also, Mr. Speaker, a national crisis that untreated addiction and mental illness cost our economy over $550 billion last year. 
   And what is Congress' response? Despite bipartisan passage by three House committees and two subcommittees, we were denied a vote in the full House on the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. 
   This legislation would give Americans suffering from addiction greater access to treatment by prohibiting health insurers from placing discriminatory barriers on treatment. As many as 16 million Americans in health plans could receive treatment under this act. 
   Despite the 273 cosponsors of H.R. 1424, this treatment parity bill, no vote was held. Despite the tens of millions of Americans suffering the ravages of addiction and mental illness, no vote was allowed to increase their access to lifesaving treatment. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time to end the discrimination against people suffering from mental illness and chemical addiction. It's time to end the higher copayments, deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, and limited treatment stays, discriminatory barriers to treatment that don't exist for any other diseases. It's time to treat mental illness and chemical addiction under the same rules as physical illnesses. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's time for the House of Representatives to vote on the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. Those still suffering cannot afford to wait any longer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I first want to thank my friend, my brother and my chairman--Mr. Lewis--who represents the absolute best in public service and who is truly the conscience of the Congress. I'm just grateful for his friendship and for the privilege of working with him for the past 18 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us addresses a very serious situation in America's prisons--rampant tax fraud. I'm deeply grateful to Chairman Lewis for being an original cosponsor of this legislation and for helping me get this crucial legislation on the suspension calendar and here to the floor today. 
   When I chaired the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee in the last Congress, Mr. Speaker, we held a hearing that featured an inmate from our Federal prison system. He was known as inmate Dole, a prisoner from South Carolina who single-handedly swindled taxpayers out of $3.5 million by filing fraudulent tax returns. That's right, Mr. Speaker, $3.5 million of outrageous tax fraud committed by a prisoner while he was behind bars, while incarcerated in a Federal prison. 
   The hearing revealed that this was no isolated incident. There is massive tax fraud going on within the walls of our Nation's prisons. In fact, the IRS reports that 15 percent of all tax fraud committed in America is committed by prison inmates, 15 percent. 
   As we all agree here, tax fraud in any form is unacceptable and illegal, obviously, but it's particularly outrageous when it's committed by prison inmates who are supposed to be paying their debt to society and not bilking taxpayers. While the IRS is able to catch some of it, far too much inmate tax fraud falls through the cracks. Unfortunately, the IRS is prohibited by law  from sharing information with prison officials, information that would allow them to take action to punish and to stop this fraud from going on in their prison facilities right under their noses. So, in other words, Mr. Speaker, Federal law enforcement is effectively blocked from pursuing these cases because of the ban on information sharing. 
   Well, this legislation that I have introduced and have brought here today, the Inmate Tax Fraud Prevention Act, would allow the IRS to reveal information on tax fraud to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and to compile statistics on tax fraud in each and every Federal and State prison. The authority for the IRS to disclose tax fraud information sunsets in 3 years, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration will issue a report, so in 3 years, Congress can determine whether the program should be renewed and whether other changes should be implemented. 
   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, let me just say that it's obviously time to protect honest taxpayers from this blatant, outrageous fraud that's being committed by prison inmates. I urge my colleagues to protect this commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will protect the taxpayers. Support the Inmate Tax Fraud Prevention Act because the taxpayers of America deserve nothing less. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, tough economic times are especially tough for America's charitable community. They face increasing demands for services from people in need, and the investments that foundations make in order to grow their endowments have eroded significantly due to market turmoil. 
   Last year on behalf of the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee, Chairman Lewis requested comments on the implementation of charitable reforms contained in the 2006 Pension Protection Act. 
   The bill before us responds to many of the concerns that were raised by the charitable community. Specifically, the bill has seven provisions aimed at relieving burdens on charities and on foundations: 
   Funds advised by certain public charities and government entities would not be treated as donor advised funds. 
   Certain scholarships given from donor advised funds would not be considered a taxable distribution.  
   Thirdly, a special written acknowledgment requirement for charitable contributions to donor advised funds would be repealed. 
   Fourth, supporting organizations would be allowed to pay reasonable compensation to substantial contributors for the services that they perform without the payment being considered an excess benefit. 
   Also, certain long-standing Type III organizations with no recent major or living donors would be exempt from payout and excess business holding requirements. 
   In addition, Mr. Speaker, contributions from Indian tribal governments would be treated the same as contributions from States for purposes of determining whether an organization is a public charity or a private foundation. 
   Finally, the IRS would be allowed to institute electronic filing for charities that file at least five information returns each year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor Chairman Lewis' legislation, grateful for his leadership of the Oversight Subcommittee and his friendship over the years. His leadership as chairman of our subcommittee has been thoughtful and bipartisan inclusive. For that I am very grateful. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7083, the Charity Enhancement Act to provide relief to America's charitable community.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAMSTAD. Madam Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto of H.R. 976, which extends and expands the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP. 
   We have a moral obligation to cover all our children so every child in America can grow up healthy. It's the right thing to do; it's also the cost-effective thing to do. 
   The great Minnesotan Hubert H. Humphrey once said that a key moral test of government is how we treat those who are in the dawn of life, the children. We must not flunk this moral test. 
   My home State of Minnesota started covering children through its medical assistance program even before SCHIP was created, but we still have far too many children without coverage--73,000 kids. 
   That's why I strongly support extending and expanding SCHIP. I also hope we can work together to provide greater access to private insurance coverage for America's children and other uninsured Americans. 
   I urge my colleagues to support overriding the veto. We cannot afford to wait any longer. It's time to break down the barriers to health care for our kids. It's time to reauthorize SCHIP. It's time that all kids have a chance to grow up healthy. 
   This legislation passed both the House and Senate with strong bipartisan support, and it deserves to become law. 
   Let's put children's health first and do the right thing. Let's override the veto of the SCHIP reauthorization and reduce the number of uninsured children by at least 70 percent. 
   There is no better investment than to invest in the health and well-being of America's children.
