<DOCNO>Mr. FERGUSON. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FERGUSON. I thank the gentleman from Georgia. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Addiction and Equity Act of 2007. This legislation brings treatment to individuals that desperately need the help. Addictions and mental illnesses are afflictions that have long been stigmatized and brushed aside by our society and institutions. Most of us have had a loved one or family member touched by mental illness or addictions. We know their painful stories all too well. Many individuals go years without treatment for serious illnesses due to society's stigma on mental illnesses. These individuals need and should receive the same care and treatment as if they had any other illness. However, I do have deep concerns about how this bill will be funded. Funding this legislation comes at the expense of United States medical researchers, which is ironic, since these are the folks who we look to to develop treatments for many of these very health conditions. 
   One of the offsets included in this legislation is a more than 30 percent increase in the Medicaid prescription drug rebate, which is a punitive and unwarranted move against the same medical researchers that we are relying on to find cures and treatments for illnesses and diseases. By increasing their cost and slapping a new tax on their work, we will be reducing their ability to invest in research and development of new products, new drugs. I believe that is profoundly shortsighted and misguided, and I believe it will set back the cause of research, which would ultimately lead to treatments for many of the diseases and afflictions that we are talking about here today. 
   Therefore, while I support and am a cosponsor of the underlying legislation, I urge that this particular misguided offset be struck from the bill as we negotiate with our colleagues in the Senate on a final version of this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr. Deal, for his leadership. I thank Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ramstad for their work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FERGUSON. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee. 
   I want to thank Congresswoman Boyda for her work on addressing this very important issue and of course Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica and all those who have worked so hard on this legislation. I am a strong supporter and cosponsor of the Safe American Roads Act. 
   This legislation takes a reasoned and commonsense approach to dealing with opening our borders to Mexico-domiciled trucks. Instead of providing blanket access to U.S. roads, this bill places important standards and restrictions on the DOT's proposed pilot program, ensuring that our roads remain safe and that our Nation's trucking industry remains competitive. 
   The heart of this legislation centers on establishing a pilot program that employs standards that we in Congress approved, while maintaining an open comment period to ensure that expert opinions are considered with respect to safety and compliance and enforcement. 
   The bill ensures accountability through both the administrative and legislative process, requiring an Inspector General review of the pilot program to determine whether Mexico-domiciled motor carriers participating are in full compliance with U.S. motor carrier safety laws, and requiring a report to Congress within 90 days of completion of the program. 
   The Safe American Roads Act does not aim to close America's roadways to foreign truckers. Instead, it requires the Department of Transportation to tap on the brakes, to slow down and make sure that the road we travel down is one that ensures the highest standards of safety and accountability. 
   Further, the legislation ensures the competitiveness of our Nation's trucking industry by preventing Mexico-domiciled motor carriers from accessing U.S. highways until U.S.-based trucking companies are given comparable access in Mexico.     
   Once again, I want to thank Congresswoman Boyda for introducing this legislation and her work with Mr. Hunter and so many others. I urge all of our colleagues to join me in supporting passage of this legislation.

   We are going to look at two different pieces of legislation, the American Energy Act written by Republicans and some of our friends on the Democratic side, and the Democrats and radical environmentalist no-energy plan that we will have to vote on today. 
   Because it might not be easy to see this chart, I am going to go down this chart.

   Real oil shale exploration to find new energy: Republicans say yes; Democrats say no. 
   Drilling off the Arctic coastal plain: Republicans say yes; Democrats say no. 
   Emission-free nuclear energy to help us find new electricity and power: Republicans say yes; Democrats say no.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Ferguson-Langevin amendment that will set aside $10 million for implementation and to fund the Lifespan Respite Care Act. 
   I know the gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Langevin, will be speaking on this amendment as well. I really want to praise him and thank him for his great leadership on this issue over the years. He and I have worked together as friends and partners on this issue in particular. I have great respect and admiration for the work that he has done on this issue. 
   Together, we have worked to pass the Lifespan Respite Care Act. It was unanimously approved by this Chamber and the Senate last Congress. It deserves the funding necessary to launch this critically important program. Funding the Lifespan Respite Care Act will, for the first time, establish a national policy to help our Nation's 50 million family caregivers who provide daily care for their loved ones with disabilities or chronic conditions or illnesses. 
   This program allows families to care in home for their loved ones instead of an institutionalized setting. In-home family caregivers provide minute-by-minute special assistance to their loved ones due to disability or critical illness or chronic condition. 
   Family caregivers are remarkable people. They make extraordinary sacrifices to help those who they love so dearly. 
   I saw an example of this firsthand in my own family. Ten years ago my mom was diagnosed with cancer. For 6 years I got to watch my dad as he cared for my mom through this very difficult struggle with cancer. Three years ago yesterday she lost that battle with cancer, but it was a great example to our family and so many others that we know of a great example of a family caregiver who made extraordinary sacrifices. There are some 50 million people just like my dad who provide care for a loved one in their own family. 
   These are folks who may not be blessed with a support structure that we had in our family. We had my siblings and me and others in our family who were able to give my dad a break when he needed a break from that family caregiving. There are many people in our country who are not fortunate enough to have that support structure around them. They are desperately in need of a break from time to time. 
   While the benefits that come from in-home care can be enormous, for caregivers and for that loved one who is ill, the cost for the family caregiver, from emotional to financial, can really be overwhelming. Lifespan Respite Care will provide much-needed breaks for caregivers who are providing intense and exhaustive care 24 hours a day. An occasional break can literally be a lifesaver. 
   I had a conversation with a constituent from my district, Ms. Pinter, who told me that caring for her special-needs child can be a very joyful but also can be a very challenging experience. You know what? She is exactly right. 
   Two-thirds of caregivers report physical or mental health care problems linked to their own caregiving. Recent studies have found that family caregivers suffer poor health or even higher mortality rates than nonfamily caregivers. Currently our Nation lacks a coordinated approach between different levels of government or advocacy groups to aid those who are in need of respite care. 
   Respite care is in short supply or doesn't exist at all in some areas of our country. This legislation and these funds would change that. 
   Funding the Lifespan Respite Care Act would improve coordination and access for respite care to recruit and train respite care providers, would aid family caregivers regardless of age or disability or their family situation, help them to find and pay for respite services. Through competitive grants, States would get funding to make quality respite care available and accessible regardless of age or disability or family situation. 
   Respite care improves the health and the well-being of caregivers and reduces the risk of abuse or neglect. Importantly, it also delays or even avoids more costly hospitalizations or placements in nursing homes or in foster care. 
   I want to thank all of the family caregivers in our Nation who provide tireless care for their loved ones, and I also want to extend my thanks to the numerous groups and organizations around this country in their exhaustive effort to establish this Lifespan Respite Care program. Providing relief to our Nation's family caregivers is long overdue. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Once again, I am pleased and honored to have worked with the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin) on this important legislation.     
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time

<TEXT>
   Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer this amendment to this important bill that would add an additional $50 million to help American students who require special education. 
   First, I want to commend the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for their outstanding efforts to recognize that insufficient funds for special education that are so desperately needed in this country, I know that in committee they added an additional $335 million to IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. But having talked to and listened to the stories from teachers and educators and parents from my district and elsewhere who work in special education in my home State of New Jersey, I believe we must try to do even more, and we can certainly do more to recognize the important needs of these particular students and these particular programs. 
   Mr. Chairman, Congress, in 1975, enacted the landmark IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which mandated that every student, including those students who have special needs or disabilities will receive a quality and appropriate public education. The law also committed the Federal Government to contribute 40 percent of special education costs, which are often several times higher than the cost of educating other students. 
   Washington, of course, has never met this long-standing, but unfulfilled, commitment to aid States in paying for special education. And as a former teacher, I know firsthand the value of education for every student and the importance of ensuring that every child, including those who have disabilities, experience the thrill of learning. 
   School administrators and teachers and parents all across my district tell me that more special education funding is needed to meet the growing demands in our schools. As teachers seek to improve academic standards and accountability, increased Federal special education funding is critically important to help schools to meet these important obligations to special education students and their families. 
   Washington, as we know, has never met that 40 percent funding threshold. And while Federal education funding has increased by more than 258 percent between 1995 and 2006, this year it still only represents 17.2 percent of the cost of serving students with disabilities. 
   My home State of New Jersey is a national leader in special education. Parents with kids who have special needs and disabilities literally move into our State. They come to New Jersey, particularly parents who have children with autism, they literally move to New Jersey so their kids can enroll in our State's special education programs. 
   This year alone, New Jersey education officials estimate that they're going to spend more than $4 billion in combined Federal, State and local funds to administer special ed programs to almost 250,000 students. Of course there's more than 7 million students nationwide who qualify for these programs. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have been in this House for 6 1/2 years. And I know that certain years funding levels for special education have been increased and other years they have not been increased. It can be fairly characterized as kind of going in fits and starts. Some years we've made big and new investments, and other years, frankly, we haven't. 
   Six years ago, when I first came to this House and to this Chamber, the first bill I ever introduced in this body was a bill that would fully fund our special education classrooms. I did it with the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Kennedy). He and I have worked together, and I know many others have worked together, to work to fully fund our special education classrooms. Indeed, today I remain and I am the lead Republican sponsor of legislation right now that would fully fund our special education classrooms. But despite many of our best efforts, we have not reached that goal yet. And I know that the chairman, the gentleman from Wisconsin, and the ranking member, Mr. Walsh from New York, they have made extraordinary efforts toward this goal as well. 
   The spirit of this amendment, my amendment, is to make for this year one additional effort to move us in the right direction. Like many of you, I've been in these classrooms. I've observed some of our special needs kids in action. I've seen the heroic efforts of their parents and their teachers and the administrators who work so hard to give them the chance at success in life that they really need and deserve. 
   We've done some to help them. And this bill today, frankly, does even more. But thanks to the efforts of Chairman Obey and Mr. Walsh, and others, I really know we are working hard toward this goal. But I respectfully ask that we try to do just a little bit more this year, and by approving this amendment we will be able to do that. 
   I ask my colleagues respectfully to support this important amendment so that we can say we did everything we probably could to help these students who need that extra chance in life. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman continue to reserve?

<DOCNO>Mr. FERGUSON. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5, but I also stand to say that the legislation should be expanded to address not only college graduates but also students who are in college now and struggling with the weight of mounting tuition and expenses--or families that are considering college for their high school children. 
   The Chronicle of Higher Education reported this month that average tuition and fees at four-year colleges have increased by 38 percent in recent years. ``Tuition inflation'' far exceeds inflation in the general economy, and is pushing the dream of a college education away from too families and students. For too many parents and too many children, college simply isn't an option because it's not affordable. 
   That's wrong. But while H.R. 5 would aid college graduates, it would do nothing to help today's college students or families that are struggling to pay for their children's college expenses. H.R. 5 does not address the growing barrier that restricts access to higher education and new opportunities. 
   That's a missed opportunity--not only for this House but also for the families who cannot afford their children's college tuition and fees. 
   As H.R. 5 is considered in the Senate and later in the legislative process, it is my desire that its scope include not only college graduates but also current and prospective college students--and their families. 
   It is my further desire that the legislation should not hamper competition and restrict access to student loans for future graduates. 
   During the last six years, Congress increased spending on federal student aid by 57 percent. Funding for Pell Grants increased by nearly 50 percent. These programs have helped college graduates and current students. 
   It is my hope that before we vote again on H.R. 5, its scope is expanded to address the urgent needs of prospective and current college students, too.

   Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank my friend and colleague, Mr. Crowley, for working with me on this resolution, and I appreciate his leadership on the floor today. I want to thank Chairman Berman of the committee and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their strong support in helping us bring this resolution to the floor today. 
   This Congress is committed to protecting and preserving the cultural heritage of all national, religious, and ethnic groups, including sacred sites such as the cemeteries here in the United States and around the world. 
   There are over 20 bilateral agreements between the United States and foreign governments assuring the protection and preservation of cultural property. However, in recent months, the bilateral agreement between the United States and Lithuania has, unfortunately, been broken. 
   We're disappointed that there has been a lack of meaningful action by the Lithuanian Government in preserving the Jewish cemetery in the Snipiskes area of Vilnius, Lithuania. Instead of preserving this site, the government in Lithuania has allowed an apartment complex to be built over the assumed boundaries of this particular cemetery. 
   Now, cemeteries are sacred sites and are established to remain undisturbed in perpetuity, and the sanctity of a cemetery is determined by the bodies and the families of those bodies that are buried in them. This resolution expresses this body's deep commitment to preserving these sacred cultural sites. Those buried there and their families deserve nothing less than that. 
   As I close, I just want to again thank the chairman of the committee, my friend from New York (Mr. Crowley) and the ranking member of the committee, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. I also want to thank my legislative director, Mandy Tharpe, who worked very hard on drafting this legislation, and all the members of the staff for helping us with this important resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for the time. I want to thank Chairman Pallone for his work on this legislation as well. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 4848. This important legislation will extend the current mental health parity laws to individuals that desperately need coverage and care. 
   Madam Speaker, I dare say every single one of us in this Chamber, and probably everyone we know, knows someone, cares about someone, perhaps a member of our very own family, who has faced the challenge of mental illness and who could benefit from additional mental health coverage. 
   Thousands and thousands of people suffer from mental health illnesses and addictions in our country. My family is no different from any other family who maybe has a loved one or a member of that family who has dealt with these very significant and difficult problems. This legislation would continue bringing much-needed treatment to those who are in such need. 
   Addictions and mental illnesses are afflictions that have long been stigmatized and brushed aside by our society and our institutions. Not only is this societal perception deterring many individuals from seeking and receiving much-needed treatment, but also the lack of insurance coverage for such treatments prevents many individuals from gaining access to the critical help and the treatments that they need. 
   Many individuals go months or maybe even years without treatment for serious illnesses due to the stigma that our society has placed on these serious diseases. They feel like they must hide their illness from their friends or their family while trying to lead a normal life. 
   However, these illnesses and the individuals who suffer from them deserve care and treatment just as if they were suffering from some other illness or disease. The victims of mental illness should no longer have to suffer in silence and in secret. 
   For too long, people have been told they must take care of themselves while battling these diseases and illnesses. Those battling their debilitating effects haven't been able to receive the stability of care that's available when adequate health insurance coverage is in place. 
   The legislation we are considering today takes steps in the right direction by continuing the current mental health parity laws. However, current laws are not perfect, and they need to be amended to improve the health care of mental addictions and illnesses in our country. 
   I have been a proud cosponsor of the mental health parity efforts in the past, and I will continue to be an ardent supporter of these efforts to have full mental health parity in America. I support legislation that was already mentioned, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act, which is legislation that would make full mental health parity the law of the land. This legislation is needed, and it should have been passed long ago. 
   This legislation has been championed by my good friend Patrick Kennedy, the Member from Rhode Island, who we just heard from. He's been such a leader on this effort, and he and Jim Ramstad of Minnesota, from our side of the aisle, have really worked so hard and so diligently on this legislation. I really believe that through their work, and the work of many of us, we will help to deliver what people battling addiction and mental illness have long needed and want; that is, the help that they need. 
   We have to continue to ensure that every individual has access to the health care coverage that they need. Every single individual that's affected by these sicknesses should not be without mental health coverage in our country. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4848 to continue to provide mental health coverage to the thousands of individuals who are so desperately in need of that help.

Permitting reimportation would significantly increase the risk of counterfeit, misbranded, and adulterated drugs that would end up in my constituents' homes.''  
   I agree with my friend from the other side of the aisle, the dangers related to drug importation the FDA needs the authority to prevent counterfeit medicines from coming into America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, I want to first thank the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member for the good work they have done on this bill. 
   I rise to offer this amendment which holds great importance not only to my home State of New Jersey, but really to the entire Nation. My amendment is a simple one and it is one that is a step in acknowledging the dangers that we are still faced with following the attacks of September 11, 2001. 
   My amendment would transfer $50 million from the DHS Office of Under Secretary for Management to grants, contracts and cooperative agreements to State and local law enforcement agencies for terrorism prevention activities. 
   Specifically, this amendment would increase funding for DHS buffer zone protection grants. These funds can be used to enhance security and protection around sites of national importance. These areas of national importance include not only banking and financial sites, but also government buildings and mass transit systems, such as the PATH in New York and New Jersey, the T in Boston, the BART in San Francisco. However, most importantly, this applies to chemical plants, which pose one of the most dangerous threats to our domestic security today. 
   These funds could be used to provide increased law enforcement patrols around chemical plants and to protect these critical infrastructures, as well as enhance information sharing among Federal, State and local officials and those in the intelligence community. 
   For example, in 2007, the State of California received $4.6 million of these grant funds. My home State of New Jersey received $1.5 million in these grant funds. Other States that have benefited from this grant program include Maryland and South Carolina, which have each received nearly $1 million. States like Illinois have benefited. Even States like Idaho, Delaware and Montana have benefited from this program. They have each received over $180,000 in these funds. In fact, in 2006, all 50 States in America received grants from this important program. 
   New Jersey ranks as one of the leading States for chemical production. Most unsettlingly, New Jersey chemical plans are specifically listed by Federal authorities as ripe targets for potential terrorist attack. Millions of people and essential transportation routes surround these chemical plants. An attack on one of these plants could not only cause tremendous loss of life, but also irreversible environmental damage by unleashing secondary explosions or toxic fumes and substances. 
   Make no any mistake, this amendment wouldn't only benefit New Jersey.  
   Countless states throughout the Nation that are home to high-risk targets also would benefit from this amendment, which would increase DHS funding for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements to state and local law enforcement agencies for terrorism prevention activities. 
   In 2005, 225 members of the House voted in favor of nearly identical amendment, and dozens of lawmakers are on record as supporting increased DHS funding to bolster protections at our Nation's most high-risk targets. I encourage you to continue this record of support and show the American people that national security is a top priority for this Congress by supporting my amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. FERGUSON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with mixed emotions. I am proud of our troops and the sacrifices they have made in Iraq, their dedication, their perseverance and the love and support of their families here at home. I am disappointed that the strategies employed thus far have not been more successful and that our progress in Iraq has been too slow, and I am saddened that those who have drafted this resolution are offering no alternatives of their own for our mission in Iraq. Indeed, they are prohibiting consideration in this Chamber of any alternative. 
   Therefore, I will vote against this resolution. 
   I believe most Americans share the same goal for Iraq, a stable government that can serve its people, a strong security force that can protect its people, and a growing economy that can encourage prosperity for its people. 
   We want the Iraqis to succeed, and we want our troops to come home. There is no question and no denying that mistakes in the planning and execution of the war have led us to where we are today. Hindsight is 20/20, and we can all offer suggestions for how things should have been done differently, done better, done more effectively during the past 4 years. 
   But that is not what is going on in this Chamber here today. Members are being cynically asked to vote on a resolution that does not address victory or success. It does not offer a pathway toward the peace and the prosperity that are vital to the region. It simply plays politics with the war and, in so doing, does our troops and their families here at home a terrible disservice. 
   While no one in this Chamber or any general in uniform can guarantee the success of this new initiative in Iraq, we can safely say that not pursuing it and continuing the status quo will lead to failure. Iraq then likely would fall into further chaos and transform itself, much as Afghanistan did a decade ago, into a breeding ground for terrorists, who plot attacks not on our troops in Iraq but upon our civilians here at home. 
   Make no mistake, failure of the U.S. mission in Iraq will not end the war. It will only shift the battlefield. The terrorists are at war with us, whether we fight back or not. 
   The consequences of failure in Iraq would be as dramatic as the fruits of victory. An Iraqi government stable enough to take the lead role in providing for its own internal security will allow us to achieve our collective goal, the return of U.S. troops. Rather than being allied with terrorists, Iraq would be an ally with America and the war on terror. In so doing, it would honor the more than 3,000 American men and women who have died fighting for its freedom and countless more who have been wounded and will bear for their lifetimes the scars of battle. 
   The status quo in Iraq is unacceptable. We need a new strategy, new tactics, new commanders on the ground, and a new and sustained commitment from the Iraqi government that they will do more of their share. 
   We know that the road ahead will be difficult and that the prospects for success are dwindling. But I believe a renewed and amplified effort by U.S. forces and Iraqi troops to retain security in Baghdad may offer the best hope we have for the lasting success of the U.S. mission and for the future stability of Iraq's government. It may also be, I believe, our last chance for victory. The President knows this, and I believe the Iraqi government and its people know this, too. 
   It is in that spirit and with that understanding that I will vote against this resolution. Our collective prayer is for the safety of our troops, for their success, and that they will be reunited with their families here at home as soon as possible.

   Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) and I thank our friends Ms. Eshoo and Mr. Lampson for their efforts, and I rise in support of this bill; but I think the bill can be better, and I rise in opposition to the second-degree amendment because I frankly think it would weaken the Burgess-Ferguson amendment that would really strengthen this legislation. 
   The amendment that Mr. Burgess and I are offering would help take a significant step forward in advancing fuel technology and helping to secure our Nation's energy independence, but it also is key to stopping a potential environmental problem before it starts. 
   I have been a champion for renewable energy technologies and new developments in alternative fuels, and I really believe that we have to ensure that these new technologies do not contribute to the ongoing environmental problems that we are facing today. 
   While the gentlewoman from California has offered an original amendment and has offered a secondary-degree amendment to our amendment, they sound familiar, but they are very different amendments. I believe this second-degree amendment to our amendment would significantly weaken the improvements that our amendment would make to the bill.  
   I commend her for her commitment to improving this legislation, but our amendment is more comprehensive and frankly just goes one step further. While her amendment would seek to minimize emissions from stationary sources at the end of the process, like at gas pumps, ours would seek to minimize emissions at both mobile and stationary sources. It is more comprehensive, it is a stronger amendment, and it would help to ensure that we are careful to recognize the possible environmental impacts that these fuels have as they move from production to the end product that ends up in your gas tank. 
   So in my home State of New Jersey, we undergo a constant struggle with clean air issues. Our amendment would go so far as to ensure that any new fuels that are added to our market to decrease our dependence on foreign oil do not have an adverse impact on the quality of the air that our citizens are breathing. 
   Let me be clear. This is a good bill. I intend to support the bill. I think it can be better. I think it can be better with the Burgess-Ferguson amendment. I think it would be weakened with this Eshoo second-degree amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. FERGUSON. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately today we are hearing a lot from the proponents of H.R. 4. We are hearing a lot of misinformation and lot of rhetoric, and I think some of these things need to be corrected for the record. 
   The biggest misconception is that the buying power of Medicare patients is currently unused, and that somehow this new plan is the only way to leverage lower prices for prescription drugs. In fact, prescription drug plans under Medicare part D right now are aggressively negotiating discounts; they have been before part D, and they continue to do so very well since the program's inception and they are going to continue to look to negotiate lower prices. They have been negotiating and giving beneficiaries choices and access to the newest breakthrough therapies. 
   Through Medicare part D, in its current form, beneficiaries have access to over 4,000 prescription medications at a much lower cost than previously estimated when we passed this legislation a few years ago. CMS has indicated that beneficiaries are saving an average of $1,200 annually on their drug costs. 
   Program costs are an estimated 30 percent less in 2006 and 21 percent less over the next 10 years due in large part to competition and negotiating of lower drug costs. 
   Currently, Medicare prescription plans have the discretion to use cost-containment tools. They can use formularies, and many of them do. Unlike Medicaid and the VA, Medicare beneficiaries actually have the power to choose which plan they want. If they see a plan with a formulary they like or don't like, they can choose or not choose that based on their own discretion; but if Medicare or the government, as prescribed under this bill, under H.R. 4 and its required mandatory negotiations, it will have to impose a uniform restriction on medicines, patients will lose their choices, and they will be stuck in a one-size-fits-all plan. They will be stuck with a restrictive national formulary and no choices whatsoever. 
   You have to be hiding under a rock recently if you have missed the numerous experts that are telling us that this brand of negotiation will limit choice and will not save money. I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 4.

<DOCNO>Mr. FERGUSON. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>

   Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer a motion to recommit H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, back to the committee. I offer this motion to recommit because this legislation falls short of funding two very critical programs for the education of people in our country. We must ensure that we are fully funding two very important programs, Pell Grants and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, before moving forward with other programs. 
   Both the Pell Grant program and IDEA have been underfunded for years. This body has promised to fully fund these programs for all Americans, individuals and States, and, sadly, today this body is going to break that promise once again. 
   These are commitments that Republicans and Democrats together have made over the years, and together we have fallen short. Today we have an opportunity to change that. 
   While I am sure the additional programs in today's legislation are worthy programs, we must first guarantee that we are meeting the requirements of current programs before adding more responsibilities to the Department of Education. 
   Individuals in this country depend on Pell Grants and special education funding. For years, these two programs have been successful and are critical to ensuring that all Americans have access to a quality education. It is crucial that we bring these programs up to their full funding levels before adding new spending programs. 
   This motion establishes better funding priorities than the underlying bill. Funding special education and Pell Grants for the higher education of individuals in this country should be the  number one priority of the education programs for this body. 
   Currently, IDEA, our special education program, is only being funded at 17 percent of the added cost of educating individuals with disabilities. The Federal Government has been authorized to fund up to 40 percent of the total cost of special education in our States. 
   The fiscal year 2009 budget request is for $11.28 billion. This represents 17 percent of the added cost of special education. To fund IDEA to the level the Federal Government has promised, this request needs to be, should be, $26.55 billion. This creates a funding shortfall of over $15 billion for IDEA. 
   Pell Grants are authorized to be $9,000, the maximum award, under this legislation. However, the current level is less than half of that, the discretionary maximum of $4,241. Including mandatory spending in the maximum Pell Grant, it is still only $4,371, which is only 49 percent of the authorized level. 
   Now, as a nation, Madam Speaker, we pride ourselves on our education system. How can we be proud of a piece of legislation that funds our longstanding key educational programs at only 42.5 percent of the authorized level? It doesn't sound like something to be proud of. How can we be proud of a piece of legislation without this motion to recommit that doesn't set the right funding priorities for our Nation? 
   Members on both sides of the aisle know that one of the heartfelt items that I have worked on in my years in this body has been fully funding our special education programs. We have worked on it together. We have sometimes had success, and sometimes we haven't had the success that we would have liked. But together, today, we have an opportunity to fully fund IDEA and to fully fund the Pell Grant program, these two programs which are so instrumental in helping give young people in our country the educational opportunities that they so desperately need and deserve. 
   Let's fully fund the Pell Grant program. Let's fully fund IDEA to keep our commitment to our special needs students. Let's vote ``yes'' on the motion to recommit. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FERGUSON. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I thank the gentleman from Virginia for the time. And I of course rise in strong support of this amendment. I am delighted to, once again this year, work with Mr. Weiner, Mr. Crowley and Ms. Berkley. 
   We've offered this amendment in the past. And each year that this Foreign Operations bill includes funding for Saudi Arabia we've offered this amendment, and each year we gain more and more support. Obviously we're disappointed that this bill does include some money for Saudi Arabia, but I'm pleased that offering this bipartisan amendment with broad support on both sides of the aisle, once again we will seek to strip that money. 
   The bill before us provides $115,000 in foreign aid for a country that has time and time and time and again proven that it doesn't deserve one cent of American taxpayers' dollars, not only because Saudi Arabia is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, but also because it's not a partner with the United States and other nations in our efforts to combat terrorism. 
   Saudi Arabia has a pretty poor record on a number of fronts. It's not just a poor record in joining with other allies around the world to combat terrorism. They have a pretty terrible record on human rights, pretty poor record on religious freedom, and they continue to support and participate in the Arab League's boycott of Israel. Now, even recently there was an Arab League boycott meeting in Damascus. The Saudi Government continued to participate in that meeting. All of this despite Saudi Arabia's repeated promises to dismantle the boycott and to support most-favored-nation status for Israel. And Israel, of course, our closest and most important ally in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia continues to undermine the efforts that we are building in the Middle East. 
   Clearly, Saudi Arabia is not a country that is struggling to make ends meet. Saudi Arabia doesn't need financial support from other nations. And they certainly can't be considered a strong ally of the United States or the global war on terror. 
   Last year, more than 300 Members of the House supported this amendment. I am really looking forward to continued broad bipartisan support for this amendment once again this year. And I'm really delighted, once again, to be working with Mr. Weiner and Mr. Crowley and Ms. Berkley in offering this amendment. 
   I thank you for yielding.
