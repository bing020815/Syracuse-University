<DOCNO>Mr. TIBERI. (EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE PAUL E. GILLMOR, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF OHIO -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIBERI. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, my heart goes out to Paul's wife, Karen, and his five children. 
   As Mr. Obey said, I can't believe it, either. I first met Paul Gillmor when he was president of the Ohio senate and served in the senate. He had a very distinguished career before having ever come to the United States Congress, a career that many would admire, just there in our statehouse in Ohio. 
   His reputation was as a man of great humility. Something that we all could learn a lesson from is Paul Gillmor's humility, the gentleness of Paul Gillmor, the way he treated people, the way he loved to serve the public of Ohio and northwest Ohio and the constituents he was so proud to serve. 
   Paul was an Air Force veteran. Many didn't know that. He was a proud graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University in my district, and, for an Ohioan, a proud graduate of the University of Michigan's law school. 
   Paul was known around the statehouse as a very gentle person, as a man who rose to the top of the political game, but never forgot where he came from, a successful politician, a successful public servant, a successful businessman. 
   Yesterday I had the opportunity with a couple of other Members, Congressman Jordan and Congressman Hobson, to sit in the airport in Columbus in the afternoon to chat with Paul as we were coming back to Washington, DC. 
   I had the added opportunity to spend some time with him on the airplane sitting next to him. I will remember Paul in the way that I have always known Paul, a very happy warrior, a man who loved what he did on a daily basis. He enjoyed August, reaching out to community after community in northwest Ohio at town hall meeting after town hall meeting, up at the lake with friends and family. He enjoyed August. He had a smile on his face. He enjoyed public service. He enjoyed representing the people of northwest Ohio. 
   That's how I will remember Paul Gillmor. We lost a good friend. Ohio lost a native son. And America lost a patriot.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIBERI. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentlewoman from North Carolina's amendment, and I too will echo the words of the gentleman from Indiana that it is disappointing to see what we are doing here tonight; when the American people spoke loud and clear last November for transparency, for more openness in government, and what we have is less transparency and less openness in government. 
   I think you will see tonight and tomorrow a series of amendments that will try to strike that balance that the American people spoke so loudly about in November. 
   Tax and spend is back. Today is just the beginning. I believe what we will see in the next 11 appropriation bills is a lot more spending that the American people are going to be very surprised about. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIBERI. (TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE RALPH REGULA, THE HONORABLE DEBORAH PRYCE AND THE HONORABLE DAVID HOBSON -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIBERI. Madam Speaker, it is with bittersweet sadness that we are here today. We thought that earlier this year this would be awhile before it came, but it is here before we know it. And it is not really an overstatement to say that these three individuals that we are honoring tonight have dedicated their lives to public service and serving our communities and serving our great State of Ohio, and certainly our country, spending so many years on the ground, in fact 70 years of service to this United States House of Representatives alone.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIBERI. (EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIBERI. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Frank and Chairman Waters for their leadership on these issues. For the, last 6 years I had an opportunity to work with both in the Committee on Financial Services and Housing Subcommittee on very important issues. Unfortunately, I am no longer on the committee but the issues are still very important to me. 
   This amendment today is about empowering home buyers. It would require the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to ensure high-risk borrowers and borrowers who are applying for zero down-payment loans to receive housing counsel. Under the current bill, the language allows the Secretary to provide counseling; this requires it. 
   Madam Chairman, as a former Realtor, I have seen firsthand the benefits, the joys, the importance of homeownership in America. However, given the current environment in our country, we need to make sure that there are safeguards put in place to protect homeowners to ensure fiscal responsible homeownership and guard against further default, bankruptcy and loss of home. 
   Buying a house today arguably is the most important and biggest investment in a person's life. Counseling, I have found, plays a very important role in empowering consumers, leveling the playing field, and making sure they have all of the right information to go into owning their own home. 
   In the past year, Ohio, California, Florida, Michigan and Georgia have comprised over half of our Nation's foreclosed homes. Recently Ohio, under the leadership of Governor Strickland, established the Ohio Foreclosure Prevention Task Force, which is comprised of various advocates and people in the housing community throughout the State. 
   In their report, they listed seven recommendations. One of those recommendations was to focus on expanding housing counseling services and making it available to everyone. 
   This amendment today only deals with two classes of borrowers: high-risk borrowers and those who are applying for zero-down loans under this legislation. 
   I believe it is very, very important, critically important, Madam Chairman, to make sure these borrowers understand the importance of homeownership, the responsibilities of homeownership. Madam Chairman, it is important because if we are going to take a bite out of this problem, and a bite is all this does today with this amendment because it only deals with those two types of borrowers, we need to make sure that every single borrower who is applying for a home under these two circumstances get all of the education that they need and deserve. 
   So I urge the adoption of this amendment. This is about empowering consumers, and I hope the House supports the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TIBERI. Yes, I think we can take a look at the best of what is happening in Ohio right now. We are doing some pretty innovative things. I am sure in Massachusetts and Illinois there is some innovation going on as well. 
   The intent at the end of the day is to help the borrower and level the playing field. And so yes, I would be happy to work with the committee.

   Mr. TIBERI. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I thank the chairman and the gentlewoman from Illinois. Just a point of clarification: Some of the things that are happening now in Ohio is you have online counseling that is taking place for people that don't have access maybe in person to a counselor. So there is room to grow here, Chairman Frank and Mrs. Biggert. 
   I think we have an opportunity to empower consumers and look forward to working with both of you. I urge adoption of this amendment, and urge passage of the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIBERI. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to this bill today. 
   I support the Children's Health Insurance Program. The original goal was worthy, Mr. Speaker: Cover poor children. Unfortunately this bill does much more than that. It expands the program to more adults and to children of middle-class parents who may already have insurance, and funds this expansion through relying on tobacco taxes that are going to bring in less revenues through the years, including tax increases on private health care plans, cuts to community hospitals, nursing homes, home health care providers, and, yes, cuts to Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Democrats are cutting Medicare, specifically the Medicare Advantage program. Seniors in my district have been writing and calling me, and I have been talking to them. 
   One said to me, ``The quality of our health coverage is greatly improved through Medicare Advantage.'' Another said, ``I cannot afford higher out-of-pocket costs. I get preventative care. I also get some dental coverage and eye care that I would not be entitled to under original Medicare.'' And, lastly, ``Please, in the name of decency, do not vote to change my health care.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, over 13,000 of my constituents benefit from Medicare Advantage. I will not vote to cut their benefits today. I will not, Mr. Speaker, support this bill which pits grandparents versus their grandkids.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIBERI. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIBERI. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution this evening. 
   The resolution we are debating this evening is a nonbinding resolution. It has no effect of law. It does nothing to change our direction in the war on terror. For those who oppose the war, this  resolution does nothing to end it. For those of us who would like to debate the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, this does nothing. 
   For those of us who would like to continue to show our support for the funding of the troops, it does nothing. For all of the chest pounding from the majority about a new direction or redeployment, this does nothing. This resolution could pass 435-0 and it still would do nothing. 
   Madam Speaker, there has been no opportunity for a free exchange of proposals this evening that could be useful in moving us forward. In fact, just this morning, one of Ohio's largest newspapers, the Columbus Dispatch, said it best in their lead editorial: ``Empty gestures. Democrat's resolution on Bush's Iraq war policy is political posturing.'' 
   That says it all. Madam Speaker, your party has the majority in the House and in the Senate. Yet we have tonight before us a resolution that does not do anything. If the majority wants to exercise real leadership, let's have a true debate. Let's make real decisions, tough decisions, that is for sure, but real decisions. 
   Madam Speaker, let me tell you about a young marine corporal in my district. His name is Matt. Matt represents the best and brightest in America. Matt had a scholarship to go to college. He turned it down. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps after Iraq was liberated. 
   Matt was on his second tour of duty just last month when he was shot. He returned home a few weeks ago. Matt will receive a Purple Heart. Weeks before he was shot, Matt sent an e-mail back to his family and friends in Ohio. In it he says: ``We have done a lot of good in Iraq, but on the homefront we likely will not see that reported.'' Matt said he has watched his fellow marines' hearts grow heavy when they talk to their family and friends, and that this is a tough part of war and a tough part of fighting for freedom. 
   I spoke with Matt a few days ago as we began debate on this resolution. Matt asked me to oppose the resolution and give him and his fellow soldiers the tools and the support that they need to help Iraqis help themselves take control of their own country, and together fight and defeat radical extremists. 
   Matt supports the mission. Matt does not want to see his children and grandchildren going back to Iraq to handle what can and should be done now. Our constituents elected us to lead, Madam Speaker. Our brave servicemen and -women look to us for leadership. We must not disappoint them. 
   Matt, God bless you and your fellow troops for your great and wonderful service to our country. I will vote against this resolution, this nonbinding resolution tomorrow, and will do all I can to support you and your fellow soldiers in your mission to fight and defeat radical extremists who seek to destroy our way of life.
