<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, defective, unsafe products, toys with poisonous lead paint, American jobs going overseas lured by cheap labor and unfair trade practices, these issues concern every American. But all of us can take a stand this holiday season. 
   One way is that instead of judging products by cheap prices, look for quality and safety that comes with American products. This holiday season shoppers will be buying gifts made from all over the world, but let's make an extra effort to look for American products. 
   This Christmas check the label for ``Made in the USA'' and support jobs for hardworking Americans and American quality. ``Made in the USA'' may be the best gift ever this Christmas.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, over the next 40 years, electricity demand in the United States will double. We have to conserve. We have to make strides in efficiency and renewable energy, but we can't depend on renewable power alone. It would take 3,000 huge windmills or 11 square miles of solar collectors to equal the power output of one modern coal plant. 
   Even if we quadrupled the share of renewable power by 2050, we will still need coal for half of our electricity. To meet America's future energy needs, we will probably need to build 800 new coal plants over the next 40 years: 400 to replace the old, inefficient plants and 400 to meet the growth and demand. This translates to one coal plant every 2 to 3 weeks, even if we start in 2010. 
   Solving the problem will require clean coal technologies with zero emissions, including greenhouse gases. Let's solve American's energy problems by cleaning up America's abundant energy resources. This bill, however, will tax America's abundant supplies of coal, and that just doesn't make sense.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Oil prices are climbing to record highs, gasoline is over $4 a gallon and climbing towards $5, food prices are up and rising, and family budgets stretch their limits. 
   And how do we handle this? We beg OPEC to produce more oil. The Saudis say they will call a meeting. Venezuela says they want $200-a-barrel oil. Foreign speculators say let's hope the market will fall. 
   Americans say, what about America? What about American energy? Why not explore for the trillions of barrels of America's oil off our coast, America's shale oil? Saying ``no'' to Americans is not an energy policy. Begging other nations is not an energy policy. 
   Americans get it. Congress needs to get it too. American oil, American jobs, American control of its own destiny and returning America to be the greatest Nation on Earth and not a nation that has its hat in its hand saying please help us.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (IMPROVING CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, within the past hour, the House voted to pass a bill on the Children's Health Insurance Program, a laudable program that all Members agree is important to help children with their health care needs. 
   Unfortunately, the debate was filled with much rhetoric, and it is important that we cut through all that rhetoric to understand that despite comments made, neither Republicans nor Democrats nor the White House nor anyone else dislikes children. We all want them to have the best health care they can get, and we will continue to work to make sure that happens. But as that bill was voted on on this floor with a threat of the White House to veto it, feeling it was not an appropriate bill, it appears that there may be enough votes to sustain that veto. 
   During the coming days or weeks as the Senate also looks at this bill and as it goes to the White House, Congress has a couple of choices. First of all, Congress may take this as an opportunity to gain political points, spending untold hundreds of thousands of dollars on campaign ads attacking each other, perhaps saying that each side doesn't care about children, perhaps trying to sway votes so that the veto is not sustained, accusing people of horrendous things which are not true. Or Congress can do what the American people expect us to do, and use this as an opportunity to make things even better. 
   Now, I believe there were a lot of good things in that bill, and I think all Members agree that there are important aspects about children's health insurance we need to support. But shouldn't we also use this as an opportunity to make things better? 
   There are elements in this bill that looked at some things to help with prevention, obesity, case management, health information technology, things that I have been talking about in this Chamber for the last 4 years as important things to help us save money. But let me review a few of these and say what we need to do and what we should be doing as Members of Congress to use this bill that will help several million children with their health care as a vehicle to find real change with health care. Instead of us continuing to come to this Chamber and debate how we are going to finance health care, we should be talking about how to fix health care. 
   The problem with health care is not just that the costs are too high and people can't afford them. The concern is that there is so much waste in our health care dollars that people cannot afford it, perhaps as much as $400 billion a year wasted on our health care system. If we are able to reduce that waste in health care, we can make health care more affordable, and we wouldn't have to be dealing with how do we find the money to fund children's health insurance or adult health insurance. By fixing the system, we could change that. 
   For example, health care-acquired infections this year will account for something like $50 billion in waste. This chart next to me indicates that just as of this evening, as of this evening there has been at least this many cases who have picked up infections in America, almost 1.5 million cases here, while some indications are that it may be much more than that. There have been some 66,000 deaths so far this year, one every 5 minutes, and so far spending, some $36 billion in health care-acquired infections which are preventable through hand washing, sterilized equipment, using clean procedures. 
   Health information technology, if we stop talking about it and work with hospitals to invoke it, can save $162 billion in reducing errors. If we do more with case management, we could reduce the big bulk of dollars spent on people who have chronic illnesses such as heart disease and other problems.  
   If we worked to reduce maternal smoking, we can reduce premature births, problems with low birth weights, asthma, respiratory distress symptoms, and so many other problems that infants experience, if we work to reduce maternal smoking. 
   Now, we have a choice here. We can continue to argue as a House over who has the better plan, the Republicans' or Democrats' plan; or we can really get together over these next several days and say we need to fix our broken health care system, not continue to finance it. We need a health care system that is focused on patients and not politics. We need a health care system that is focused on patient safety and patient quality and where patients can choose their doctors and hospitals. 
   I hope this is not a time that Americans will continue to see politicians beat their chest and say ``my plan is better''; ``no, my plan is better.'' I know if every few minutes a child or an adult is dying from an infection they picked up in a hospital, if we know the chronic illnesses they face continue to be so difficult to manage, and it is odd to me that Medicare and Medicaid will spend thousands of dollars to amputate the foot of someone who has severe diabetes, but won't spend $5 to have some nurse call that person and check up on them with care management, something is wrong and something is broken with that system. 
   If we really and truly care about children, as I believe we do, if we really and truly care about the health care of Americans, as I believe we all do, shouldn't we be focusing our time instead on how to fix the system and use the compassion in our hearts to roll up our sleeves and work together and stop this continued fighting for the sake of political points. 
   I believe that is what America wants, I believe that is what America needs, and I believe that is what they sent us here to take care of.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Greater Latrobe Ice Cats who were crowned Pennsylvania Ice Hockey State Champions on Saturday, March 29. 
   This is the first championship won by the Ice Cats in their 28-year history and only the second time in school history that a team has won a state championship. 
   The Ice Cats defeated the Conestoga Pioneers at Memorial Arena in Johnstown. 
   Head Coach Ron Makoski, who led the team to victory, reminded the players that, win or lose, playing in a State championship would be something that each of the players would remember for the rest of their lives. I have no doubt that each of these players will remember this experience with great pride. 
   So congratulations to the Ice Cats, the players, the coaches and parents for capturing the Pennsylvania Cup Class AA Championship. 
   I know the school and community join me in best wishes to the team for their tremendous victory and distinguished season.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY OF Pennsylvania. (ELIMINATING PREVENTABLE HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY OF Pennsylvania. I would like to welcome my colleague from Pittsburgh in his first time in the Speaker's chair. 
   Mr. Speaker, more people die each year from infections they pick up in hospitals than from AIDS, breast cancer or auto accidents. The Centers for Disease Control reports these health care-associated infections contribute to 90,000 deaths per year, with annual costs exceeding $50 billion. Medicare costs for patients who contract an infection while hospitalized is five times higher than for patients without these infections. For Medicaid patients, costs are 14 times higher.  
   Many hospitals have dramatically reduced infection rates by implementing patient safety procedures. I will be introducing the Healthy Hospitals Act to provide financial incentives to hospitals for savings gained from eliminating these infections, and require public reporting of infections so health care providers and patients can work together to save lives and money. We need patient-centered health care that promotes patient choice, patient safety and patient care quality. 
   To learn more about eliminating preventable health care-associated infections, I invite my colleagues to visit my Web site at Murphy.house.gov.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (BUILDING A STRONG WORKFORCE BY IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Employers spend over $26 billion per year in direct medical costs to treat depression. But the indirect costs, including lost productivity and absenteeism, increased spending by some $51.5 billion per year, but appropriate treatment for depression reduces health care costs for businesses. 
   The National Institutes of Mental Health reported depression treatments reduce absenteeism and save money. Plans for Federal employees where mental health coverage is included in their health care plan also saves money. 
   Employers and Members of Congress should review the benefits of mental health insurance coverage and note that coverage of mental health treatment can also significantly reduce public health care spending on Medicare, Medicaid and our criminal justice programs. 
   I would urge all my colleagues to review how businesses and the Federal Government can save money on this by reviewing my Web site at murphy.house.gov. And remember, patient-centered health care saves lives and money by emphasizing patient safety, patient quality and patient choice.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (AMERICA'S EPIDEMIC OF HEALTH CARE-ACQUIRED INFECTIONS -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it seems like every day in this House floor we call for a moment of silence to recognize some tragic loss of life across our country. And it is fitting that we do so. 
   If we were to recognize with a moment of silence those who die in hospitals from avoidable infections, we would be stopping House business many times each day. 
   So I am here to express my concern that we continue to ignore the increasing problem and potentially fatal epidemic of health care-acquired infections. Another week goes by and more and more patients are becoming infected with preventable infections. And instead of tackling this issue head-on, we continue to let the number of cases rise. And the costs strains our health care system, and more lives are lost. 
   Well enough is enough. This year alone, up to today, there have been 1,243,835 cases of health care-acquired infections. There have been a total of 61,562 deaths. And the total cost on our health care system has been $31 billion 95 million 999,420.07. By the end of this year, that estimate will be $50 billion and 100,000 lives lost. 
   Something must be done. We must put self-interests aside and work together to improve the safety of our hospitals. And I am committed to making sure this happens. That is why I introduced legislation last year that saves lives and money, H.R. 1174, the Healthy Hospitals Act. And it has received strong bipartisan support and support from consumer groups. 
   This legislation offers a simple solution to lower the costs associated with health care-acquired infections. It is not expensive. It simply requires hospitals to publicly disclose their infection rates and let the public see this transparently.     
   Hospitals should be taking commonsense measures, like washing hands, sterilizing equipment between uses, testing patients and giving antibiotics at the right time. It is, after all, people's lives we are trying to save. 
   How can a hospital or health care system argue that they don't want to report their infection rates if reporting is shown to save lives? How can hospitals complain that they don't want patients to know about patient safety and patient quality? Aren't hospitals supposed to be in the business of saving lives? 
   Hospitals need to be held accountable for opposing legislation, for opposing legislation, that would require reporting, because evidence shows it makes a difference. In my home State of Pennsylvania, there are shining examples of what happens when hospitals are held accountable for reporting. 
   Hospitals in Pennsylvania are required by State law to make their infection rates public, and we have seen the infection rates drop dramatically. Some hospitals were able to get to a zero infection rate, no lives lost. And here is the mortality statistic. According to the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council, the average charge of hospitalization for a patient who became infected with a hospital-acquired infection was $185,000 each, while the average charge for a patient without an infection was $31,000. Reporting infections is proven to save money and lives. 
   Hospitals say ``it will cost us more to keep track of it.'' That simply is not true. Isn't this enough to get our hospitals on board? Isn't this enough proof to save lives? Our health care system is in need of repair, not just simply saying it is too expensive, let's let government take it over. It needs to be fixed. 
   While we continue to talk about reforming government, cutting costs and eliminating funding for infrastructure projects back home, I hope my colleagues in the health care industry will support commonsense legislation that will save money and lives. 
   Public reporting of health care acquired infections is exactly what it sounds like, but the benefits of this simple action are far reaching. I hope that patients and their families will speak up to Members of Congress about the need for this transparency and demand such legislation be enacted. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues and hospitals around the country, especially those hospitals that know this saves lives and money, to support public reporting of hospital-acquired infections. Let's do this right. Let's save lives. After all, the families of so many Americans are at stake here. We can act on this. We can make a difference. We can save lives and save money.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (MISSING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATIENT ALERT PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for allowing me to participate in this particular bill to help not only our seniors but everyone who is afflicted, the 5 million Americans who suffer from Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Of these, nearly 3 million, or 60 percent, will become lost from their families or loved ones or caretakers. If not found within 24 hours, up to half will become seriously injured or die. 
   H.R. 6503, the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program, will increase the chance of locating missing persons suffering from this disease within the critical first 24 hours. H.R. 6503 authorizes funds for grants for nonprofit organizations to assist in paying for the costs of establishing and operating programs to protect and locate missing patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
   With police departments now being called upon to find missing elderly, these community organizations are critical in assisting law enforcement officials with their searches. Tips from family and people in the community often lead to the whereabouts of any missing person, including the elderly. 
   Each year, thousands more Americans are being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. The symptoms of these diseases often leave their victims feeling disoriented, lost, and vulnerable. H.R. 6503, the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program, provides support to those local programs working everyday to offer these patients protection and their loved ones some peace of mind. 
   I might add here that just this weekend I found out a dear friend of mine was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's. He's been a long-distance runner for all of his adult life, and ironically enough, he's still able to go out and find trails and run on them, but it is something that his doctors are concerned about for him that one day will he, too, become one who is perhaps lost as he tries to negotiate his community and his neighborhood.  
   Certainly for folks like my friend and others around the country who are suffering from dementia, early states or later, we have to recognize the value and importance of this bill. I might note this passed the Judiciary Committee unanimously, and I certainly urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This week the House passed a number of bills which are important to my municipality in the 18th Congressional District in Pennsylvania. This Water Quality Financing Act, which will authorize $20 billion over the next 5 years for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, is an important bill. It offers increased flexibility for local communities to meet their water quality infrastructure goals. 
   We take for granted the quality of our water, but it was not always so. The life expectancy of Americans increased from age 47 in the early 1900's to a life expectancy of 75 by the end of the century. The number one reason was the public health benefits of clean water and efficient sewer systems. 
   Decades ago, Southwestern Pennsylvania's boroughs and townships built their sewer lines with combined sanitary and storm water in the same system. What made sense at the time is now an antiquated and overburdened system. Wherever there is significant rain, it leaves untreated sewage flowing into our rivers and streams, recreating a health hazard. 
   The EPA then mandated the communities must fix these problems, but now local communities are strapped with massive costs. In Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, alone repair costs exceed $3 billion. The towns then pass on the cost to homeowners. Many citizens are seniors on fixed incomes who simply cannot afford to fix the mistakes of the past and still pay for their bills today. Without funding, many of my towns just can't make it. 
   For years we have tried to help by providing annual funding assistance in a piecemeal manner. We need a comprehensive plan to provide a steady stream of funds to fix these problems, meet the standards to clean up our streams, support the public health and not pass on the whole burden of the inherited problem to current homeowners. 
   After working on this problem for years, both sides of the aisle have worked on this problem for years, I am pleased that we have some opportunities to offer some solutions; the solutions that I recognize are going to require some more crafting with the House and Senate. 
   I commend my colleagues who are going to work on this to recognize that we all need to work together because we are all concerned about working men and women. We are all concerned about people, without assigning them to any classes, and together we will work to solve these health problems of our water infrastructure in America.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I know much of our concern is on energy and gas prices, but I want to remind Members of some grim statistics on other issues. 
   If an airplane crashed today and 250 people died, we would send the FAA and every other Federal agency to investigate. If the same thing happened tomorrow, our concerns would escalate, too. If it happened a third day, we would shut down the airline industry. We don't seem to do that same thing, and we have that many deaths each day from infections in hospitals. 
   In April of 2005, when I first started talking about infections in hospitals, we have had since that time over 6 million cases, over 320,000 deaths, and have wasted $162 billion. Just in 2008 alone, 969,000 cases, 47,000 deaths, and $24 billion. 
   When I introduced my Healthy Hospitals Act, H.R. 1174, the aim was to have hospitals declare their infection rates so people could compare hospitals so we could do something about it. 
   Hospitals can clean up their act. They can reduce their infections, and Congress needs to make sure there is a law of the land requiring them. People have a right to know if they are going to leave a hospital at all.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to support H.R. 5613, the Medicaid Safety Net Act. There's a lot of misinformation about what this bill does. Here are the facts. 
   When CMS put forth regulations to cut Medicaid service to save money, Mr. Barton's and Mr. Dingell's leadership not only prevented its cuts, but we actually saved more money than the cuts did. 
   We can't keep doing business in Washington the same way. Cutting services to save money the easy way, but not always the right way. We cannot cut programs for seniors on fixed incomes, for disabled children, for the medically needy. 
   Without this bill, North Carolina loses $2.5 billion, Missouri $1.4 billion, Florida $665 million. But with this bill we provide health care and cut waste, fraud and abuse. 
   I encourage the President to look past the rhetoric, withdraw his veto threat and encourage my colleagues to support this bill and support families in need.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (PREVENTING HARASSMENT THROUGH OUTBOUND NUMBER ENFORCEMENT (PHONE) ACT of 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and my good friend, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), for his work on this important bill. We worked together on it. On behalf of H.R. 740, I would like to urge all of my colleagues to vote for this. 
   The previous version, which I introduced last session and was passed unanimously in the 109th Congress as H.R. 5304, was the Preventing Harassment Through Outbound Number Enforcement Act, or the PHONE Act, or the PHONE bill at that time. 
   Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Forbes and others from the Judiciary Committee have taken a good bill and made it better. 
   Identity theft has become an increasingly critical problem for consumers. The Federal Trade Commission revealed that last year about 10 million individuals were victims of identity theft in all 50 States. The disastrous implications for identity theft includes damaged credit, financial ruin, and the effects can tear apart families and ruin businesses. 
   Congress has repeatedly acted to try and prevent identity theft. But, unfortunately, with new technologies, as soon as we outlaw one version, somebody comes up with a way around that, and once again harasses and harms citizens of this Nation. 
   One of these technologies used by thieves is the practice of call spoofing or caller ID fraud presented on Web sites as just an innocent game one can use, or perhaps use it to make sales calls, but they mask their identity and alter their outbound caller ID in order to mislead the call recipient. Some may call it a way to maintain caller privacy, but it is nothing less than fraud. 
   I believe Congress must enact a law to penalize caller ID fraud perpetrators. This bill is particularly necessary to protect American families, the elderly, and businesses because illegally using another person's phone number could have limitless, unlawful applications. It doesn't take much in the imagination to understand how dangerous this practice is and how it is being used now. 
   For example, a criminal could try to obtain personal financial information from individuals by using a bank's phone number. A person could harass a former wife or husband who has otherwise tried to block the calls from the ex-spouse's phone line. A pedophile could stalk children by stealing his school's phone number or the phone number of a friend of the child. A sexual predator could use a doctor's office phone number to gather records about someone. A terrorist could make threats from a government phone number, and the list goes on. 
   The criminal use of caller identity theft, however, is not just a possibility. Here are some real-world examples of how caller ID fraud is occurring. 
   In 2005, a SWAT team surrounded an empty building in New Brunswick, New Jersey, after police received a call from a woman who said she was being held hostage in an apartment.     
   She was not in an apartment. The woman had intentionally used a false caller ID. Imagine what might have happened if that was a site where people might have been coming out of the building and police might have thought that that person was a potential threat. 
   I might add that one of the things that these caller ID fraud sites use is they also will allow you to disguise your voice and switch it from a male voice or female voice or vice versa to further fool the person on the other end. 
   There also have been incidents where people have used stolen credit card numbers and posed as a person who owned the credit card to illegally wire money to someone else. Another case occurred where people claim they were the county courthouse, calling people, claiming that they had missed jury duty, and tried to use that situation then to have the people give them credit card numbers to pay a fine for something that had not even occurred. 
   For these reasons, I introduced this bill in the 109th Congress as the PHONE Act, to punish those who engage in the intentional practice of misleading others through caller ID fraud. Violators of this bill will be subject to penalties up to 5 years in prison and fines of $250,000 for these crimes. However, it also allows up to 1 year in prison for those who use this as a mechanism of harassing. 
   All those folks who are still using this system, be aware that this will be made illegal. We expect the Senate to pass this, and all the elderly and small businesses and families across the Nation who find themselves as victims of this, be aware that when the call you have today shows up on your caller ID, it may not be who they say they are. 
   Please, we need to make sure that until this bill is passed, people are still vigilant of that, protect their identity and never release a credit card number or other personal information, no matter what that caller ID number says, unless you are absolutely sure the person who you are talking to is who they are. 
   Again, I am pleased to work with the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee chairman on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security, Chairman Bobby Scott, who has reintroduced this bill. This bill, H.R. 740, adds the important criminal and financial penalties to those who prey on the identity of others. 
   This legislation will not stop crime, it will not prevent identity theft, but it will protect lives and protect others and close this loophole for identity theft once and for all. I urge my colleagues to vote for this important bill. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman from Texas if he is prepared to yield back the balance of his time?

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding, and Mr. Boswell for working on this important bill. 
   As a psychologist, I have treated more than my share of those who have suffered from significant depression and have had risk of suicide, many of those veterans of various conflicts. This bill is extremely important in what it does in providing access to care, but there are so many things that we must utilize here as part of this bill. 
   One is to make sure that it is used to provide proper screening for soldiers during basic training and also prior to deployment. Also to make sure that there is ongoing support and availability of that support in combat theaters. There must also be training for officers and leaders in the military to be aware of signs of problems and to be aware of treatment options. That training is vital. 
   There also must be access to trained personnel both while the person is in a combat theater and when they return home and after discharge and in the years to follow, because many times the signs of these problems may not actually show up for years. 
   It is important that all of us are aware, for our friends, our spouses, our loved ones who come back from combat, to recognize signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anger, and drug and alcohol abuse as all signs that there may be a deeper mental illness behind that. 
   But it is important, above all of this, that we eliminate the stigma of mental illness. It is indeed a problem which is associated with biological causes with very real symptoms and very real available treatments. But many times soldiers do not seek treatment because they have a fear of being looked down upon by their peers, they fear a loss of rank, they fear discharge or loss of a chance for promotion. They feel there is limited access for trained professionals, and many also think the cost is overwhelming. 
   We have to give hope to those with mental illness. For those who have seen significant problems in their life, some remain mired in those problems and remain victims and do not move forward. We can help them. There are some who are able to survive despite their problems and move forward and flourish and work. And there are others who thrive with their problems and turn these into a source of inner strength. 
   There is a great deal of hope and compassion that we can bring to our soldiers. This bill is a wonderful mechanism to bring that. I applaud all those who helped on it, and I look forward to its passage.

In this bill, there's $108 million for FutureGen which is creating energy from coal without emissions; $73 million for the other clean coal power initiative; and some $376 million has been recommended for the core research and development program, much of that done at the National Energy Technology Research labs, some of which are in my district, and others in West Virginia and Oregon and around the country. 
   We have a 250-year supply of coal under our Nation's soil. Conversely, other parts of the world that have oil will run out long before we are out of coal. 
   We have to crack the code in understanding how to create electrical energy out of coal without emissions. It is a monumental and perhaps one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time. 
   If we're able to do this, we'll be able to create the electrical energy and the power we need to power our factories, to light our homes and run our office buildings. Without this, we will continue to be subject to the whims of countries involved with OPEC who manipulate the price of our energy every day. 
   A report done this year through MIT called the Future of Coal stated that we need perhaps billions to deal with this issue of finding out how to create energy out of clean coal. It is an important investment and one that we cannot lag on, one that we have to continue to work on. 
   I certainly encourage all of us to look at ways we can watch for any waste involved with how this money is spent on every level in appropriations; however, I ask that this be one area, where America has abundant supplies of coal, we make sure that we continue to mine our coal because it's one of the few ways that we can do so and create energy without having to worry about the whims of terrorists and OPEC states.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member. 
   The CBO doesn't score savings. If it did, it would note that drug and alcohol addictions cost $400 billion each year, that depression costs employers $51 billion each year, that depression increases the risk for chronic illness, and that chronic illness and untreated depression doubles the cost of health care. It would also note that caffeine withdrawal and jet lag are not something that insurance companies pay for. In fact, they are not medically necessary. It is not occurring here. 
   But let's see what really happens with a person with mental illness, and I am saying this as a psychologist, as someone who has seen this time and time again, how the symptom really works. A person with a deadly disease such as anorexia or bulimia withers away until malnutrition and dehydration puts them in the hospital. Once the hospital stabilizes them, they come out. Maybe they will have a visit or two with a counselor or psychiatrist or psychologist. Maybe their primary care physician will put that person on some medication. And 75 percent of psychotropic drugs are prescribed by nonpsychiatrists, by people not trained in the field, because they don't have treatment possibilities under their health care plan. 
   I oftentimes have a somewhat tongue-in-cheek agreement with obstetricians: I don't deliver babies, and they don't treat mental illness. Unfortunately, that may be all the plan allows for. 
   But let's look at us as Members of Congress. Out of 435 Members of Congress, out of the 10,000 employees on our side of the Hill, we know that there are hundreds, thousands of people, quite frankly, who at some point in their working career will have some mental illness. What do we do with a well-trained employee? Do we say, you're fired? Do we say, go out and suck it up? Do we send them out into the unemployment system? Do we send them out into the welfare system? Do we take our children and send them out to the educational system and say, let the school take care of it? If it is a family member, do we say, well, be part of the criminal justice system, perhaps go into the emergency room system? No. We have the situation as Members of Congress where we can say, no, you can get help and you can get treatment. 
   Why not for the rest of the country? Why not look at this as a cost-saving measure? This is more than just a compassionate measure. I speak as someone who has treated the mentally ill all my professional life, for 25 years. I know time and time again, when the people who are trained in this field to do something are told, no, you can't see this patient anymore, what do you say to the autistic child's parents? What do you say to somebody suffering from depression? What do you say to that person with anorexia or bulimia or any host of other problems when you have to say you are not covered, and so they are treated by someone with nothing in terms of experience in that field? 
   If we really want to save money, if we really are looking at things to help business, let's look at and see what AT&T and Pepsi and PPG and other corporations have said, that it saves them millions of dollars in indirect costs, billions of dollars. 
   Let's be honest about this. If we leave the system the way it is, we will see more wasted money. We will see more deaths. We will see more people mistreated or lacking treatment. Let's do the right thing.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, oil prices climb to record highs; gasoline over $4; diesel prices near $5; family budgets stretched to the limits. And how do we handle this? We beg OPEC to produce more oil. The Saudis say they will give us 200,000 more barrels a day in the world market, but the daily world demand is 84 million barrels. 
   Hey, how about putting the U.S. in charge of our own economy? What about American energy? Sixty-four percent of Americans support American-made energy. 
   Today I will introduce a resolution calling upon the President to revoke a ban President Clinton extended in 1998 that prohibits exploration of our Outer Continental Shelf. The U.S. has the technology and regulatory framework to ensure that these resources are developed in an environmentally sound manner. The President has the power to remove this ban today, if he chooses. 
   I invite all my colleagues to cosponsor my resolution, and send a clear signal to the President and to the American people that we will help.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman. 
   One of the things that's important to keep in mind is why are gasoline prices what they are, and it is not the retailer. When we look at what has happened to prices over all, let's keep in mind that we have become more and more dependent upon other nations. When we look at what's contributed to costs, look at this: Crude oil costs are 56 percent of the price; taxes are 18 percent of the price; refining nearly 17 percent of the price; distribution and marketing, nearly 9 percent of the price. 
   What has happened with regard to crude oil prices, they have doubled since 2004, they have tripled since 2001, and they have gone up over 600 percent since the 1980s. 
   But what has happened, as the cost of a barrel of oil has gone from $11 a barrel to over $70 a barrel, is Congress has continually stood in the way of trying to come up with more sources. We have abundant supplies. We have the Atlantic coast, the gulf coast, the Pacific coast, the western States and Alaska. Whenever those come up for a vote, Congress shuts it down. Over 90 percent  of Federal lands are off-limits to exploring for the vast supplies of oil we have there. 
   We have shut off some of our other sources, and some are still trying to do that with regard to using coal as another energy source. We have not funded fully the things we need to do for hydrogen fuel cell. We have not gone far enough with conservation, with our automobiles, with reducing homeowner uses. 
   So between these issues of exploration, conservation, diversification, we have not taken the steps we need to do to truly reduce energy costs. It concerns me greatly that we are moving forward to blaming the retailer when we ought to be looking to blame ourselves. After all, if we have supplies of oil in the gulf coast, which we set off-limits to ourselves, and, yet, we let Cuba explore for them, something is terribly wrong. 
   I hope that what this Congress does is work more towards energy independence and recognize that it's changing the way we explore for oil and making sure that we do much more for diversification of our sources and conserving our huge energy waste in this country. That is what is going to lower the prices of gasoline. 
   Until we make this commitment as a Nation, and until we make this commitment as a Congress, we will not see these prices go down.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, as we pursue this, there are several things that still are of concern to me. We need to make sure we enact real consequences for those who are accountable for this mess and make sure that we enact real change to the system. We need to make sure that we say loud and clear to those who gamble with public funds that they have an obligation to the taxpayer. We need to also make sure that those who are offered loans with a wink and a nod who have no ability to pay, no identification, no credit, and no money down can't get these loans anymore until we get this system fixed. 
   We also need to understand that what we're talking about is a $700 billion bailout. It happens to be the same amount of money, $700 billion, that we send every year to foreign oil. If this Congress had taken care of our energy problems and had allowed drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf and of the Colorado shale oil, we would have had a real commodity to sell. We would have had real investments in the market and not just paper that we would have been shuffling around and would have been hoping that someone would have bought at auction. 
   Trillions of dollars in our economy and hundreds of thousands of jobs, that's what we should be doing to fix our economy, not just selling more paper.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. The recent tragedy at Virginia Tech leads us to ask what else could have been done to protect students at our colleges and universities. 
   The Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 is intended to protect the confidentiality of student records and define under what instances parents can have access to student information and grades. Unfortunately, under the definitions in the act, there are many examples where information was not released to parents or guardians regarding a student's mental health, which led to withholding of vital information that could have prevented suicides, assaults and other crimes. 
   Schools are hesitant to release information for fear of legal action. In my 25 years of practice as a psychologist, I have known many instances where these problems arose. 
   I am introducing legislation to clarify the act to help define circumstances where universities can release vital information to parents, including risks for suicide, homicide and physical assaults. Further, it will hold harmless colleges and universities who, after consultation with a mental health specialist, act in the best interest of the student, where they can release information to help save lives. We can no longer let this 30-year act be a barrier between parents, students and schools. 
   I urge my colleagues to sign in support of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank Ranking Member Deal, also Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Barton and Chairman Dingell for their work on this bill, but particularly to Representative Gene Green, the cosponsor of this legislation, for his hard work and commitment and also really for the teamwork that he engineered with the committee to work on this. 
   There are about 1,100 community health centers that employ about 6,000 physicians. They provide critically affordable primary care to more than 16 million people nationwide. It is important to note when people toss about numbers of the number of uninsured in America, and many of those uninsured are extra covered by Medicaid, many by their private plans; but these 16 million people we agree really are uninsured folks in America, and the community health centers are a place where they can have a quality health care home. 
   When we note that what happens with community health centers, what they provide in terms of primary care, dental care, podiatry, mental health care, and so many other areas that provide care, particularly in prenatal, it is of great concern that there simply are not enough physicians and other health care providers to give that care. 
   The greatest vacancy rates are in rural and inner city health centers where their vacancy rates range between 19 and 29 percent of the current workforce. These are shortages of physicians, nurse practitioners, physicians assistants, midwives, dentists; and all of those are open because the community health centers simply do not have the money to pay for all of those employees. 
   What I'm disappointed about in this bill--and I know Congressman Green worked very hard, as did Congressman Deal to keep this in here--is the idea that we cannot let physicians volunteer at these centers. I know we're all jointly disappointed because the community health centers, if they were able to have physicians volunteer at these centers, they could be covered by the Federal Torts Claim Act. Otherwise, they have to rely on paying their own malpractice insurance, which could run tens of thousands, if not well over $100,000, and community health centers cannot afford to cover that cost. The legislation I offered would have allowed Good Samaritan doctors to volunteer their time helping those in need. 
   We have to come back to this next year because in the meantime, many people without health insurance, or who are underinsured, rely upon community health centers for a whole host of their care. I look forward to working with my House and Senate colleagues in the future to ensure that legislation allowing doctors, nurses, psychologists, and other specialists to volunteer their time at community health centers. We must make that a law in order to provide care for so many people who need it at, I might add, a very, very low cost. 
   Again, I thank Chairman Dingell, Ranking Member Barton, Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Deal, and Representative Green for their hard work on this bill. Their impassioned teamwork to help provide care to those most in need is to be applauded.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the American public wants real solutions to this energy crisis. Unfortunately, what we're voting on today is not a real solution. It's a no drill bill. 
   Our country's security is threatened in four ways. One is family security. With the price of natural gas and food on the increase, families can't afford the next loaf of bread, the next gallon of milk, the next tank of gas or the heating bill for their homes. 
   Two, job security. As we continue to rely on OPEC countries for oil, we are refusing to create jobs here. Consider this: One oil refinery during construction would be 8,000 jobs and then another 1,800 during its use. Oil and natural gas exploration employs nearly 386,000 workers. We could double or triple this number if we drill for more oil. Indirect incomes in other industries resulting from this gas activity can support another 4 million jobs, and this bill cuts out our vast coal supplies and the jobs from clean coal energy and coal-to-liquid. 
   Three, our economic security is also threatened. As we rely on OPEC countries, other nations in the Mideast get rich off our dollars. Our national debt continues to rise and our dollar falls. OPEC buys our national debt, buys our businesses, and our trade deficit with energy gets worse. 
   Fourth, our national security. Many of these oil producing countries are threatening the United States. Iran uses oil money to fund missiles and nuclear weapons and supplies bombs to attack our troops. Russia invades Georgia, threatens the Ukraine, threatens Poland, and sends bombers to Venezuela. 
   We must drill for our own abundant oil as a means to end our dependence on foreign oil, but this bill cuts off 90 percent of U.S. oil off our coasts, which means we cannot use that energy to help our country. 
   Americans understand: We cannot tax away the independence. We cannot cut off our energy as a way to independence. We can and should use our oil, use our coal, use our nuclear energy, use our innovation and use conservation to be energy independent. That comprehensive solution is what we have to have. That's not what we have yet.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, America is threatened by four securities: Family security which finds itself hurting to pay for gasoline, food and heating costs; job security which sees our jobs going overseas, not only for manufacturing, but where other countries are drilling for oil, we can only sit back and watch; economic security, when we see our trade deficit improving in every area except for energy, when we see OPEC spending so  much money to buy our national debt and $700 billion of our money goes overseas every year; and our national security, when we see what other countries do with oil dollars, Iran buying missiles, building nuclear weapons, Venezuela sending terrorists to attack Colombia, the Saudis paying off al Qaeda, and Russians attacking Georgia, threatening Ukraine and Poland. 
   We have to have energy independence, and the means to energy independence is to drill for our oil and use that money to fund vast conservation efforts and innovative fuels so we can get off of oil. We have got oil to do that, and the oil is off of our Outer Continental Shelf and out in Colorado in the shale oil and out in the Arctic shores, and we can't get to it if we put a lock on it and turn the key and throw away the key. 
   We need energy independence, and this is a means towards the end.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, recently I met with a number of independent truckers in my district who said that many of their businesses cannot survive the current cost of diesel fuel. And many of my constituents have also said they cannot continue to pay these rising prices of gasoline, the rising prices of food. 
   What much of this comes down to is: Congress has to end its embargo on American oil. To say we cannot drill in the gulf coast, the Atlantic coast, the  Pacific coast, in the Colorado area with the shale oil, or Alaska, has reached a point where OPEC has continued to grab us by the throat and continues to fund both sides of the war on terror. 
   Americans understand that whoever controls the supply can demand whatever price they want. And now with gasoline being over 70 percent of the cost of oil, isn't it time that America took control of its own economy and began to use its own resources in an environmentally responsible way? 
   Let's end the embargo on American oil. Let's take back control of our economy. Let's take action on this.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I am here to speak on behalf of this bill and my support for it. 
   Under the Medical Device User Fee Modernization Act reprocessed or reused medical devices are brought under the regulation of the FDA. 
   Now, there is a problem with reusing medical devices sometimes, and that is these devices were designed for optimal performance and safety under their intended conditions of use, not necessarily designed for their ease of cleaning or even secondary use, which make it extremely difficult to effectively clean and resterilize. Reusing medical devices can compromise their safety and performance and even destroy some of these devices. This can also lead to deadly hospital-acquired or nosocomial infections. 
   At least half, half, of all cases of nosocomial infections are associated with medical devices. Let me give some examples of the rates of infection from these devices: 23 percent of peritoneal dialysis catheters; 7 percent of pacemakers; 7.2 percent of implantable cardioverter defibrillators; up to 50 percent of ventricular assist devices; and 30 percent of bladder catheters, just to name a few. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton as well as Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Deal for working with me to include language in the Medical Device User Fee amendments of H.R. 2900, the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2007, for a study on the causes of these infections, from reprocessed single-use devices; from handling of sterilized medical devices; from in-hospital sterilization of medical devices; from health care professionals' practices for patient examination and treatment; hospital-based policies and procedures for patient examination and treatment; hospital-based policies and procedures for infection control and prevention; and hospital-based practices for handling medical waste and other relevant hospital practices. 
   Let me explain why and what this means in terms of real lives and dollars. A CDC report from a couple of years ago said that learning to prevent these infections has the potential to save over 90,000 lives and $50 billion annually, according to the CDC. A more recent report just came out and said perhaps we are up to even 119,000 lives a year. 
   Health care providers should work with medical device companies to provide patients with information if a medical device has been reused. Patients have the right to know whether or not a medical device designed for single use has already been used in another patient before a device is used on them and what can be done and what was done in terms of sterilization and cleaning that equipment. Otherwise, patients will be exposed to an unnecessary risk for hospital-acquired infections and medical device failures. 
   This study has the potential to save thousands of lives and billions of dollars. Eliminating infections from medical devices will move us towards a safer patient-centered health care system that promotes patient choice, patient safety and patient quality. 
   We all know that physicians and nurses and hospital personnel are all dedicated to providing the best health care possible. We also know when hospitals have worked together to eliminate infections, indeed, that is what they do. The VA Hospital in Pittsburgh and a number of hospitals in the Pittsburgh area that I am familiar with and worked with have indeed brought some post-surgical infection rates down to zero. And there have been occasional lapses in these throughout the nation where post-surgical infections or infections associated with medical devices have been unnecessarily high. 
   We can prevent these infections. We can save lives. We could save not only the Federal Government, but other insurance companies, billions of dollars, and I look forward to passing this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE NEW POWER-SHARING GOVERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me on this important part that other colleagues and I have traveled to Ireland to work on this issue. And I am pleased today to speak in support of the power-sharing agreement reached in Northern Ireland. 
   Since my own youth, I have followed the conflicts in Northern Ireland and, like many Americans, hoped and prayed for the day when there would be peace throughout all the island of Ireland. As of a few weeks ago, with the power-sharing agreement, it would seem that peace has finally come. Now DUP, Sinn Fein, the UUP and the SDLP all share in the governance of Northern Ireland. Now men and women who once gave fiery speeches in opposition to one another sit at the same table working with one another. 
   When I visited Northern Ireland a few months ago with other Members of Congress, we were witnessing history, perhaps the end to centuries of conflict, the beginning of a new dawn. It was not too long ago, beginning in the 1960s, that marches for civil rights in Northern Ireland were followed by decades of riots, assassinations, bombings and warfare carried out by paramilitary groups. Thousands of British troops occupied the north to stop the violence. Ceasefires temporarily stopped the attacks, but the ``Troubles,'' as they came to be known, continued. In the end, over 3,200 or more were killed and thousands more were wounded. 
   Phil Coulter from Northern Ireland wrote in the song a few years ago, ``The Town I Loved So Well,'' about his return to the area, where he wrote in the final verse: 
   ``Now the music's gone, but they carry on for their spirit's been bruised, never broken. They will not forget, but their hearts are set on tomorrow and peace once again. For what's done is done, and what's won is won, and what's lost is lost and gone forever. I can only pray for a bright, brand new day in the town I loved so well.'' 
   Perhaps those prayers have been answered. The troops are gone. The bombings have stopped. And there is hope for all of the towns that are loved by the citizens of Northern Ireland. 
   Eight years ago, the Northern Ireland political parties signed the Good Friday Agreement, which established a blueprint for self-rule. But reconciliation faced continued difficulties. New deadlines to start self-government were set. The ceasefires continued to hold, and another election occurred in March of this year. Then, for the first time, men who were enemies, the likes of Ian Paisley, Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams, sat at the same tables to establish self-government. It was nothing short of remarkable that left all on the island with a palpable sense of awe and hope. 
   How did they do it? 
   First, there was hope for prosperity. The south of Ireland is in the midst of the greatest economic boom in the European Union. Families in Northern Ireland want to be part of that prosperity rather than the poverty and dependence on government jobs and the dole. They are putting tremendous pressure on their leaders to settle the differences and create jobs.  
   Number two, international diplomacy. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom, such as Tony Blair, and Ireland's Bertie Ahern, Presidents Clinton and Bush, and Members of Congress from the United States, in particular Mr. Walsh and KING of New York and Mr. Neal of Massachusetts, have all maintained pressure for resolution. At the same time, programs supported by the International Fund for Ireland brought Catholics and Protestants together to build positive relations. 
   Third, the disarmament of paramilitary groups. The IRA says it has given up its weapons, and outside observers agree. And even though other paramilitary groups say they are not yet ready to disarm, there is still a discernible belief that the days of terrorism are a thing of the past.     
   Each day without violence builds trust. 
   Number four: integration of the police force. To overcome the fears that the police will be used as weapons by or against either side, they have been working towards a goal of 50 percent Catholic and 50 percent Protestant. Respect for law enforcement is growing on both sides; and after 30 years of occupation, the last British troops quietly left only a few weeks ago. 
   In the midst of this hope, there are many challenges that lie ahead. Ninety-five percent of schools are still segregated. Thirty-foot high ``peace'' walls still divide Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods. Huge murals still cover the sides of buildings declaring loyalty to the Crown or to Ireland, or showing one or other masked paramilitary members looking down the barrel of a gun declaring who controls the neighborhood, or depicting an atrocity blamed on either the Catholics or the Protestants. Some neighborhoods fly the Union Jack of the United Kingdom, and others the green, white and orange flag of Ireland. 
   Perhaps these challenges and choices facing the people of Northern Ireland are best characterized by one of the murals we saw in a Belfast neighborhood. It depicts a large black and white photograph of a youth lying wounded on a street while a riot looms behind in the neighborhood. Another youth stands in the foreground throwing a bomb. But encircling this picture are the words, ``Can It Change?'' And at the bottom is the word ``Believe.'' 
   While the original meaning of the mural was meant to show that this Protestant neighborhood believed it could rise up and defend itself against what it considered to be ethnic cleansing, perhaps this mural can take on a new meaning today. Perhaps it can be a beacon of hope to believe in an end to violence and a lasting peace. Indeed, keeping the peace will demand that many believe. And if they do, perhaps this time, in our time, there will be an end to several centuries of warfare. Perhaps this time the elected government shared by the parties will not just be one more temporary fix, but the dawn of a bright brand new day in the towns that we all love so well.

Then Iran announced it was going to slow down production. 
   In the meantime, the U.S. has massive supplies of oil that we're saying ``no'' to, and Congress continues to say we're not going to drill. Well, ``no'' is not an energy policy. Begging the Saudis for oil is not an energy policy. Just yelling in cathartic sessions at oil executives is not an energy policy.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, we are facing massive problems with regard to the price of energy. Energy costs money, and expensive energy costs jobs, and we are seeing that now happen in our economy. 
   We are standing at a critical crossroad, and if we fail to deal with our energy needs in a responsible way, we will face not only the concerns about the environment, but we will face and we are facing economic recession threats and major job losses. 
   Earlier today, the Department of Commerce released December's trade deficit numbers, which, once again, strongly underscored the need for American energy independence. The good news is that the trade deficit shrank by 6.9 percent to $58.76 billion. But the bad news is that energy imports continue to make up over half of our trade deficit, over half, 55 percent. In November, it was the reason why we had major increases. 
   We continue to see risk that oil was sold for only $50 a barrel a year ago and gas into $2.50, and is going to continue to climb. 
   As long as we continue down this road of importing foreign oil to the United States, we will be allowing OPEC nations to call the shots for our economy and becoming more dependent upon hostile countries for oil. When OPEC manipulates production, rural oil prices soar. And our President is left to go and ask Saudi leaders to produce more oil, more Saudi oil, not more American oil. 
   We have Venezuelan leader, President Hugo Chavez, threatening to cut off oil to the United States and Exxon. If they were to do that, the price of oil would increase throughout the world. Chavez himself predicted the cost per barrel would double to $200 and increase our prices. Such a move would show all of these oil-producing countries that they can control our actions by shutting down our access to oil. We've already seen natural gas prices manipulated by Russia. We've seen these energy prices increase. But when we buy oil from countries with a history of supporting terrorism, the worst part about this is we are funding both sides of the war on terror. 
   Meanwhile, what has Congress done in the last year or two? Well, it's put on an embargo on our own oil. It's blocked exploration for American oil. Congress has voted to prevent oil production, oil drilling in the Atlantic coast, the gulf coast, the Pacific coast, Colorado and Alaska. These bans on drilling for our own oil are particularly preposterous in light of the fact that China and Cuba are drilling within 60 miles of our Florida coast while we are not allowed to drill off our coast.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (EXTENDING PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   We're gathered here today to debate or support H.R. 4848, a bill which extends that which Congress has passed before, and that was an important bill for its time. It's an important bill to extend for, in doing so, we acknowledge the innate value of helping those suffering from mental illness. We acknowledge in Congress that for those who suffer these afflictions, they may be relieved of that suffering through receiving necessary treatment. 
   In compassion, we as a body extend our hand in support of those who suffer the pains of mental illness. We acknowledge that their illnesses are real, and that the appropriate treatments give them hope to slough off the yoke of their illness and again become a fully productive member of our Nation, our workplace and our family. 
   The significance of this act may be overshadowed by other events of the day, but it is essential that we not fail to appreciate the value of this moment, not only in terms of what this bill does but what it does not do and, moreover, why we need to enact this law at all. 
   First to the reasons for this bill. As John Adams said, ``Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.'' 
   He made that comment not because our Constitution is a vehicle to support any particular religion; rather, he noted the inherent inadequacies of any body of laws, and that they cannot replace the moral light that should guide us when no law has yet been writ to define that path. 
   Indeed, we cannot legislate common sense, we cannot mandate morality, and we cannot litigate compassion. We can, however, establish laws to define the limits of what can be tolerated. And where the laws do not apply, we hope that the goodness and faith that guides our hearts is sufficient to drive us to do the right thing.  
   Unfortunately, when it comes to dealing with mental illness, our society, our culture and our government has failed to do the right thing. We have spent billions, hundreds of billions, I dare say, over the years to help those with mental illness, but we have remained short-sighted at best, or blind at worst as to what we truly must do. 
   It is my wish that people would be personally guided by their own sense of justice and compassion to do the right thing in the treatment of mental illness. Instead, we remain willfully and woefully ignorant to the causes, the diagnoses, and the treatment of mental illness. We have denied its very existence, perhaps wasting our hope in the hope it would go away. We have instead tried to wish away its effects. We have minimized the impact, trivialized the causes, and criticized the patients. We have used words to make mental illness the butt of cruel jokes. We have used words like ``crazy'' or ``retarded'' or ``idiot,'' as if attaching a derogatory label would free us from the responsibility for helping or treating those with these illnesses. 
   I ask you: Would we use such disparaging remarks to describe persons with cancer, with diabetes, with heart disease? Could demeaning words make any of those diseases disappear or less painful? Can derisive words motivate someone to seek help? No, instead they drive the person further into the shadows to deny their own illness, to avoid treatment and not even help themselves. 
   In many ways, we have not advanced very far beyond the days of the Salem witch trials when those with mental illness were ignorantly tried as criminals, sentenced to death, or cruelly treated with torture. 
   Think this is not true today? Well, think again. Our prisons are filled with persons who suffer from mental illness. Our courts are packed with victims of child abuse or sex abuse. Our churches are filled with those who are praying to be relieved of the terrible strains befalling them. Families break up. Jobs are lost. Children fail in school and lives are lost from untreated mental illness. And yet we continue to deny it is there and place barriers between the patient and the cure. 
   In my many years of practicing psychology, I have never, never met a patient who was cured by denial. But denial is the common treatment for so many when it comes to acknowledging or treating mental illness. 
   Listen, you cannot whisper it away, for even in the silence, even in the darkness, mental illness cries out for help. 
   One in five Americans will suffer from a diagnosable mental illness. One in 10 young people suffer from mental illness severe enough to cause some form of impairment. 
   Untreated drug and alcohol addictions cost Americans $400 billion each year. A Rand study estimated that depression alone cost employers $51 billion per year in absenteeism and lost productivity. 
   Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. More years of life are lost to suicide than any other single cause except heart disease and cancer. 
   Thirty thousand Americans commit suicide annually, and half a million attempt it. Among college students, three die each day from suicide. 
   The Federal Government estimates that about 12 1/2 million people have alcohol problems. It costs businesses $134 billion a year in lost productivity. 
   Does treatment work to help people with mental illness? Yes, it does. Studies of depression in the workplace have shown thousands of dollars of savings per employee when they receive treatment. 
   We note that when 80 percent of health care costs are used to treat chronic illness, that the risk for depression doubles among those who are chronically ill and not receiving treatment. The cost doubles as well. 
   The combination of appropriate medication and treatments have been very effective in treating anxiety, depression, bipolar illness and behavior disorders. But when health plans do not pay for appropriate professional care, where does the treatment come from? 
   Seventy-five percent of psychiatric medications are prescribed by non-psychiatrists. Now look at that in the context of other illnesses. Would we tolerate it if 75 percent of insurance plans said that most babies would be delivered by people with minimal training? How about requiring that brain surgery is done by those who only had a few weeks of training in medical school. Would we accept that? We would not. 
   This bill extends what we have done before. It helps in a small but important way. But it does not move us to where we need to be. Perhaps the lesson here is that there are many things we need to do for ourselves, many things we need to do to reach out to others and help. But it does not cure the barriers. It does not identify which diagnoses need to be treated. We will need to do more. Eventually we as a Nation need to come to terms with what needs to be done. The cost savings of providing the right treatment are huge. The costs of continuing to provide the wrong care, or denying care, are massive. 
   As Benjamin Franklin said, ``By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, one of the important points that we need to recognize as we address these issues of mental health and mental illness today are the causes. For so often, as I described earlier, when people are thinking about or talking about mental illness, we oftentimes do not understand that it really  is a problem of brain functioning. It's written off too often as the worried well of people complaining or malingering, when really we need to understand the following. 
   When we're talking about problems with heart disease, it's easy to look upon those problems, to look at X-rays and other tests and MRIs and see if the function of the heart is appropriate, if the valves are working, if the arteries and veins are blocked or free. 
   When we look at other illnesses throughout the body, there are so many tests which we have grown accustomed to, MRIs, CT scans, EKGs, et cetera. And we look at those things and we're able to see that something is wrong based upon the results of those tests. 
   One of the problems with mental illness, leading to the prejudices about mental illness, is that there are no tests like that. One cannot take an X-ray of the brain and say that the person has depression or anxiety disorder or bipolar illness. There have been multiple studies looking at patterns that may show up on some tests. But my point is this: Just because we cannot see it on a medical test like that does not mean it does not exist. 
   Back in the 1800s, Louis Pasteur described the microbes that finally led us to understand about germs and diseases. Before that, no one had any tests to look at that. It did not mean they didn't exist. That merely meant that we did not know that they were there. But it was a full century later before we found that one could treat diseases with antibiotics, and we're still learning more about it. 
   So, too, it is important we understand that so often when discussing these issues of mental illness treatment, people raise the question that you cannot really test for it. Now, those are areas that science and research are still needed to determine what we can do, but it does not mean they don't exist just because we cannot find those. 
   Instead, what we rely on is the comments made by persons themselves or watching the behavior of persons because, indeed, those are the indicators that tell us something is wrong with the function of the human brain. It is a neurological problem. It is a neurobehavioral exhibition of those problems. It is those problems that we have to understand that sometimes are treated with medication and sometimes are treated with counseling and sometimes both, but we have to make sure we understand that we cannot write these off with treatments just by ignoring them or just saying that someone else without treatment because an insurance plan will cover that is enough.     
   Many times cardiologists will tell us that they recognize when they give someone a diagnosis that it's terminal or severe, that many of those patients will themselves exhibit symptoms of depression, so they automatically write a prescription for an anti-depressant drug. That's not enough. 
   The comments I made before about how, when a person has a chronic illness, their health care costs can double if they have untreated depression, that alone should wake us up to understand that we need to be treating mental illness, not ignoring it. That alone should wake up employers to understand that improved productivity and lowered health care costs should be enough to motivate us to do that. That alone should be information that the Congressional Budget Office, who scores these bills, should tell us that there are scores that are important in terms of savings. Unfortunately, they don't tell us scores for prevention. And so it goes on. 
   These are things we need to be continuing to do, and that's why we will continue to support this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, many important things have been said by several Members, and passionately, on this bill. What we also have to remember, as we wrap this up, is somewhere in America there are people who are suffering in silence, there are children who are facing abuse, angry spouses who are attacking one another, anxious mothers struggling to care for their children, and, of course, throughout the workplace, as has been so carefully documented here, so many problems. It is important that we not only pass this bill strongly but also continue to work together. 
   I commend my colleague, Chairman Pallone, and the work that he does and to continue the work that he does in leading this. Myself and many Members from our side of the aisle continue to stand ready to make sure we work out any issues with regard to expanding issues of mental health parity. We know that all of us care deeply about those in need and all of us remain committed to helping those in need from our side of the aisle.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, over 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson told us: ``I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just and that His justice cannot sleep forever.'' Although he was talking about the issues of the day, those words ring true for all of us in this Chamber because all of us want to do the right and the just thing. Our words here for or against embryonic stem cell research will not change what is true and just. We seek knowledge, we pray for wisdom, but our thinking does not make it so in one way or the other. 
   I believe life begins at conception. Others do not. If we are to err on any side, on what side should we err? There are opinions on each side of this issue about when life begins. There are common opinions that we all must work together to help treat disease. There is confused information regarding what works. Research tells us adult stem cell research works. Amniotic stem cell research has been revealed to have much promise. Embryonic stem cells after 20 years of research tells us it does not. 
   What is important to know is there is nothing in Federal law that limits academic research. We do not stop the States from pursuing research. We do not limit private companies. Research has not been hampered. And nothing is stopping research from treating disease. What we are all commonly pursuing is ways to treat disease, and our concern is how do we do this in a just and ethical way. 
   When I would be involved in pursuing medical research studies at the University of Pittsburgh, we had to put forth our study in front of the human subjects review panel. They scrutinized research very carefully to make sure it did no harm to anyone. Sometimes what one researcher considered to be a small and innocuous risk, others said, no, you cannot get involved in that portion of research. Whatever it is, sometimes just evaluating the outcome of some treatment on a child that someone thought, as small as it might be, might be invasive. That was because we were guided by the ethical principle of ``first do no harm.'' 
   But here we are faced with recent studies that say amniotic stem cell research has tremendous promise, and for some reason we are rushing this week to say we must pass this bill on embryonic stem cell research when perhaps we should really be pursuing further scientific information so this House can do its job with hearings, with gathering information to give us the knowledge we need and pray for the wisdom we seek. 
   I hope in all of this that we would continue to be guided by the idea of first doing no harm, and I would hope that we would also look at the fundamental basis of this bill that refers to the idea that these children would otherwise be discarded. I don't think that is a road we want to use.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (INFECTIONS AND HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I am here to talk about a sad but true problem in our health care institutions in this country, and that is this. The Centers for Disease Control tells us in any given year some 2 million people will catch an infection while either in their hospital or health care center. Some 90,000 people will die, and some $50 billion is spent on this each year in our hospitals. 
   Now this chart here depicts what we have as of this evening, 853,747 cases so far, over 38,000 deaths and over $21 billion already spent as of today. These are bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites that cause these common hospital infections. Most common are influenza, flu or colds. The thing about this is so many can be prevented, but a huge problem among the bacteria types, some 70 percent of the bacteria are resistant to at least one medication. There is a huge problem in American hospitals, which is causing so many deaths and a big part of our health care costs. 
   Now these microorganisms can be present when a patient comes in, and that's why it's so important to understand how the staff, the hospital staff, the doctors, the visitors, the patients themselves need to adhere to some special procedures in order to prevent this problem from occurring and killing so many and costing us so much on our health care dollars. 
   For example, diseases are passed on by poor hygiene from poor hand washing; clothes that are not necessarily clean on even the doctors, nurses and visitors; unclean equipment, catheters that are left in too long that lead to urinary tract infection; respiratory infections from those with colds or flu who are around patients; bed sores. The list goes on and on. 
   This is not rocket science how we prevent this, and some estimates are as high as 25 or 30 percent or more of things such as methicillin or resistant Staphylococcus Aureus can be prevented by hand washing before and after contact with any patient. 
   Many of these diseases can be prevented by sterilizing all equipment used with patients, including making sure that hospital staffs have clean stethoscopes, otoscopes, thermometers, et cetera, making sure they clean up after every procedure, the proper use of antibiotics, pretesting patients on admission to evaluate the presence of an infection, wearing masks if someone is suspected of having some illness, using infection control boards at hospitals to monitor and manage patients, empowering staff to stop or intervene on any procedure when clean rules are violated, and using aggressive educational campaigns for staff and visitors in the hospital. 
   The point is it can be done. Yes, indeed, it can be done. As a matter of fact, Allegheny Hospital in Pennsylvania reduced the rate of central line-acquired infections from 19 to almost zero within 90 days through staff training and control. 
   A major teaching hospital in Saint Louis found that they saved costs up to $1.5 million. Mercy Hospital in Oklahoma performed 400 surgeries without any infections. The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare system has reduced MRSA infections by 85 percent in an inpatient surgical unit because they paid attention to these things. 
   Now here is one of the sad truths in America. Hospitals don't have to report when they have infections. Although 13 States are considering legislation, only 6 States require reporting of health care associated infections: Florida, Illinois, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pennsylvania is the only State that makes its information available to the public. 
   It is time we change this. I have introduced H.R. 1174, the Healthy Hospital Act, to encourage others to reduce and eliminate these deadly infections and to take some of the savings from this and set aside 10 percent to allow the Secretary of Health to use this for grants back to hospitals that reduce their infection rates to zero. 
   We have got to transform our health care system into what it needs to be: an affordable, accessible, quality health care system that focuses on patient safety, patient qualify and patient choice. But in order to do that,  we need to have this information available. 
   Now, another sad truth. While I have been speaking, the number of cases has gone up. While I have been speaking, another person has died in the hospital. While I have been speaking, the costs have gone up $100,000. 
   Something is terribly wrong with this system. We know hospitals can clean this up. We also need to know that we need to stop wasting our health care dollars on preventable infections. Let's join together as a Nation and pass H.R. 1174.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (THE BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank my friend from Tennessee for yielding. 
   I was noticing today that oil is trading at $100 a barrel. This will probably continue to climb. It will continue to climb as long as we continue to embargo our own oil resources off the Atlantic Coast, the gulf coast, the Pacific Coast, the Western States, and Alaska. And, yes, we need to do a great deal to improve the efficiency of automobiles. We need to do a great deal to improve the efficiencies of our highways, which waste massive amounts of fuel. But in terms of our eco nomy, we cannot continue to have our families suffer the high prices that come when we say we will continue to be more and more dependent upon importation of foreign oil sources. We also are more and more dependent upon the marketplace with regard to natural gas. When we see our chemical companies shutting down plants in America and instead saying they'll build plants in the Mideast because the cost of natural gas is so much cheaper there, perhaps 25 cents to $1 per million Btus, whereas here it may fluctua te to $6 or $8 or $10 or $12, it is something that's costing jobs and costing our economy.     
   It is something that is costing jobs and costing our economy. It is difficult to see our President of the United States go and talk to Saudi leaders and ask them to increase production of oil recognizing that we are at their mercy as OPEC continues to set prices. We can change that by saying we will explore in environmentally responsible ways Americans' oil resources. 
   Let's look, for example, to shale oil in Colorado. Estimates are 2 trillion barrels of oil there, 2 trillion barrels of shale oil. We cut that off in our omnibus spending bill. This is forcing us to continue to import oil, some 60 percent. We limit development on natural gas. We also have situations where we are hurting our coal development. Our energy bills that w e are facing this week and have faced for a while have not done much to improve our use of coal, but we have some 300 years' worth of coal. 
   What we ought to be doing is focusing our research and development dollars into using coal and cleaning it up so it does not have emissions, so it does not have large levels of CO  
   2s, so it does not pollute. That is a scientific challenge of our time. That is something we should be challenging our students as they go through school to think about how they can solve these issues, how they can create clean energy from our abundant resources of coal, how they can continue to find ways of using oil resourcefully and with environmental respect. 
   This is not something we are doing enough of. So what happens? It costs families more to go to work, it costs families more to feed their families. Look at what is happening with wheat prices. Yes, there are problems with wheat production in other parts of the world, but a big part of those costs has to do with the cost o f transporting things. Last summer, flour was sold at about $16 per hundredweight. Now it is $40 or so, probably climbing to $60. How will we handle it if a loaf of bread doubles on top of the increased prices people have to pay driving their cars to get to the grocery store? It is too much of a burden. 
   If we treat our energy needs as our Apollo project of this 21st century, of this decade, we would find jobs and more jobs and more jobs come out of this. The best economic stimulus package is a job. That is where we should be focusing. What can we do to build our infrastructure there? What kind of jobs come from building energy power plants? What happens when we start to put all our laborers, carpenters, ironworkers, boilermakers and electrical workers to build these plants? 
   Let me tell you how big this demand is. We have 400 old coal-fired power plants with inefficient or no pollution controls on many of them. We need to replace those 400 coal power plants, and because our energy demands of this count ry are going to double by 2050, we have to build an additional 400. We have to replace 100 nuclear plants and build an additional 100. 
   What that means is, starting in 2010, a ribbon-cutting ceremony to open up a new coal-fired power plant every 2 weeks and a new nuclear plant every 2 1/2 months. These are massive jobs for America. We should be making those investments so we have those jobs. And the best thing we can be doing is finding ways to clean up our resources. Why, the Pittsburgh coal seam alone , as my friend from Tennessee knows, overlaps my State of Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama. And that is just one of our vast resources. 
   Let's focus our energy on doing what is right for the long-term for America, for America's jobs and America's economy, and stop saying ``no'' to energy security.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (USING PATIENT CARE MANAGEMENT TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, eighty percent of health care dollars are spent treating chronic illnesses. These are complex cases where patients have multiple doctors, treatments, medications and tests. Errors can result from confusion and miscommunication, but case management can be effective in reducing these errors. 
   However, Medicare and Medicaid do not reimburse for patient care management. Unnecessary hospitalizations increased from about 1 percent for a patient with just one condition to 27 percent for a person with eight chronic conditions. 
   The Federal Government will pay billions to treat chronic illness that could have been prevented. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center found that care management can reduce re-hospitalizations of diabetics by 75 percent. Another study reduced hospitalizations of patients with heart disease by 50 percent. We cannot continue to finance a broken health care system and expect different results. 
   We need to transform our health care system to make sure that we focus on patient safety, patient quality and patient choice. I urge my colleagues to learn more about patient management care programs by visiting my Web site at murphy.house.gov.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, an estimated 2 million seniors suffer from a depressive illness, and another 5 million may have depressive symptoms. The risk for depression doubles when a person has a chronic illness such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer or Parkinson's disease. People with mental illness can get better with the right treatment, but Medicare's current policy discriminates against mental health by charging 2 1/2  times more in copayments than for any other outpatient health care treatment. 
   Seniors who receive necessary mental health services reduce their hospital costs. One hospital offered mental health services for elderly patients with fractures, and reduced the length of stay by 2 days and hospital costs by over $160,000. 
   I will be reintroducing legislation to end Medicare discrimination for mental health services by adjusting copayments, and I ask my colleagues to cosponsor it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, what I am about to say may not be politically correct and it may not make folks in the White House or some of my colleagues in Congress happy, but every time I go home to my district, people ask me, when are we going to get serious about dealing with China? 
   For a long time, China has acted more like an enemy than a friend. Over and over again, they have sold our families harmful and contaminated products, they have spied on us, and now we find out they are shipping weapons to our enemies in the Middle East to kill our soldiers. This is not the behavior of an ally, but the behavior of an enemy. 
   They hurt our children. We have found toys containing lead paint and bibs and vinyl lunch boxes containing lead. Just this Wednesday, toy manufacturer Mattel announced it is recalling 700,000 Chinese-made toys because they contain excessive amounts of lead paint. This is the third recall of Chinese-made toys by the company in the past month. 
   On August 1, Mattel's Fisher-Price announced it was recalling 1.5 million  preschool toys, including nearly 1 million in the U.S. And then on August 14, the company announced a worldwide recall of 19 million toys. We all know the dangers caused by lead paint, which is why it is not used in American-made toys or homes. As a child psychologist, I can tell you firsthand exposure to lead paint can lead to attention deficit disorders, brain damage and medical ailments in children and in later life. 
   China has continuously sent us products that are harmful to our families, and even our pets. Their harmful products sold to Americans include contaminated pet foods, used chop sticks, tires that have caused fatal accidents, diapers containing a fungus, lipstick containing carcinogens, juices with unsafe color additives, baby bottles with ingredients that can alter a child's hormones, pacifiers containing chemicals linked to cancer, and teething rings with toxic chemicals. 
   In addition, China has systematically manipulated its currency to create an unfair trade advantage over the United States and other global competitors. They have repeatedly allowed their workers to counterfeit American products and steal our patents, costing us billions of dollars of trade each year, thus destroying American manufacturing jobs. 
   They have built power plants with cheaper outdated technology, causing excessive pollution and environmental hazards throughout the world, including the United States, and they have stolen national secrets from our U.S. energy labs. 
   Congress and the White House have allowed China to continue its blatant disregard for our country; and as a result, China has become more and more emboldened. They have now begun to directly and indirectly attack our military, actions that have taken the lives of American soldiers. 
   Beijing appears to be the culprit of a cyberattack launched against the Pentagon this past June. While this attack was not with missiles or guns, it is nonetheless an attack on our sovereignty that should not be unchecked. 
   Now we learn that China is supplying our enemies with weapons and ammunition being used to kill our soldiers. These weapons have included large-caliber sniper rifles; rocket-propelled grenades; improvised explosive devices, or IEDs; and shoulder-fired rockets. Millions of rounds of ammunition have also been linked to China. And many of these weapons are finding their way into the hands of the Taliban and insurgents in Iran. As U.S., Iraqi, and coalition forces try to prevent weapons from coming into Iraq, China has been directly aiding and abetting our enemies. 
   For far too long, China has been harming our children, our families, and our economy. Now they are killing our soldiers. 
   Well, enough is enough. China must be held accountable. If Congress can't act, the American people can, and Americans are saying no to China. From our food, to our clothes, to household goods, Americans are saying they will stop buying Chinese products. 
   Unless China stops its practices that hurt Americans, kill our soldiers and kill our jobs, I believe the American people will continue to stop buying Chinese-made goods. But Congress must also demand that if China does not stop these practices that hurt our soldiers and hurt our citizens, Congress, too, must act, and do so quickly.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (HONORING THE JEANNETTE HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAM -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, on Saturday, March 15, the Jeannette High School basketball team from my district won the State's Class AA championship. The Jeannette Jayhawks became the second high school in all of Pennsylvania history to reach the achievement of winning both the state basketball and state football championships. Led by players Terrelle Pryor, Shaw Sunder, and Jordan Hall, and Coach Jim Nesser, the Jayhawks won a game that will go down as one of the best in PIAA history and cap a remarkable season in which the team went 25-4. 
   This is a great accomplishment for a small school district in southwestern Pennsylvania which has excelled in the classroom. McKee Elementary was named a Blue Ribbon school, and all the district's schools received the Keystone Achievement Recognition this year, with the school district getting the bronze medal. 
   Congratulations to the entire Jeannette school district and to the entire Jeannette community.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois for yielding. 
   As you said, few things are as important as the health of our families. 
   A lot of times in this Congress we talk about issues of health care accessibility, and a lot of times that becomes a discussion of health insurance. But the bottom line is, for families, they want to know that when their child or they are sick, can they get to see a doctor that they can afford, or even having their well-child visits or other checkups and how do they do that. 
   Health care issues, being a top priority for the Suburban Caucus, includes my legislation, the Family Health Care Accessibility Act, which is an updated version of a bill I introduced last year to ensure that every family has a neighborhood doctor. Regardless of their income, regardless of whether or not they have insurance, families will have health care. 
   We oftentimes hear it quoted here, and sometimes misquoted, that there are millions of Americans without health insurance, and indeed there are, and we do not want Americans to do without that health care. But, in fact, many of these folks are covered, perhaps through their employer; and, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania was describing, when they are between jobs and they have that gap there, that is something that Mr. Dent's bill would help cover them. 
   But there are some who are also covered by Medicare and Medicaid and don't know it. We need to work with them to make sure they are aware of that. The census data simply asks who is covered. 
   But the other issue becomes what about those Americans, 12, 13, 14 million or so, who do not have anything, and those are the ones we need to recognize that there are some things we can do, and we need to act now. It is not a matter really of concern about spending vast amounts of money, but we have a solution at hand, a simple solution, a direct solution, and one that we should embrace quickly to help these families. 
   Understand that health care costs for families in the United States are rising. From 2004 to 2005, the medical costs for a four-person household increased by over 9 percent, to $12,200-plus. This is a growing burden on all families and often many look at this as they can't afford health care. 
   But, fortunately, there are community health centers out there. These are nonprofit, community supported health care facilities that provide affordable primary and preventative health care on a sliding fee scale so that every patient who walks through the door can receive access to health care services. This is low-cost, affordable quality. 
   So instead of a family saying that they look at a health insurance bill of several hundred dollars a month, that would not be the issue, because what they could spend was a small, small fraction of that on a sliding fee scale to help them cover a doctor's visit, a dentist's visit or something else. 
   In fact, community health centers provide this high-quality care to over 15 million families who are the low-income, underinsured and uninsured. They provide a medical home for these folks and save even 30 percent for those who are on Medicaid, which is about a $17 billion annual savings to the American taxpayer. 
   Community health centers provide a wide array of health care, such as prenatal, dental, podiatry, mental health, substance abuse counseling, hearing screening, vision screening, discount prescription drugs, case management, smoking cessation, blood pressure monitoring, blood cholesterol monitoring, weight reduction programs, a wide array of programs that are available there. But the issue is, are there enough of these centers around and are there enough doctors to staff them? 
   About 70 percent of those who use these community health centers have incomes below or at the poverty level, but there are also many other families who find themselves in a situation where they are working but are not insured and they can go to these, recognizing they 
   can hold their heads high, because they are getting good quality health care and they have a health care home. 
   For many folks, these are the only health care services available, and while the number of uninsured patients at community health centers is growing, the number of physicians available to them is decreasing. There is a critical shortage of physicians available at community health centers to meet the health care needs of the uninsured and underinsured. 
   The Journal of the American Medical Association reports a 13 percent vacancy rate for family physicians, a 9 percent vacancy rate for internists, a 20 percent vacancy rate for OB-GYNs, and over 20 percent for psychiatrists. So what can we do to get more doctors at the community health centers? 
   Well, interestingly enough, physicians and other specialists hired by community health centers are covered by the Federal Torts Claim Act for medical liability costs. However, those who want to volunteer are not covered. They would then have to get their own insurance. 
   We have heard it spoken many times in this Chamber and other places where the cost of medical liability insurance is so high that many doctors retire early, they limit their practice or they leave the States where those prices are so high, in the tens of thousands, many times over, dollars per year. For example, many OB-GYNs will stop delivering babies in order to reduce their costs. In Pennsylvania alone, there are about only 4 percent of physicians who are under the age of 35, and we are looking for more shortages in the future. 
   Well, community health centers have limited resources to meet the current needs of the uninsured and underinsured, but there are many physicians and psychologists and dentists and others who want to volunteer at community health centers, but the current laws are a barrier to them. So when they do approach community health centers and say they would like to offer some time every month, the centers oftentimes find themselves in a position of turning them down.  
   This bill simply does this: Whether you are working in a community health center or you want to give your time at no charge to help those in need, you can be covered under the Federal Tort Claims Act, something that this Congress has done for those who are employed by those centers. 
   Let's extend that to those who want to volunteer. There is then no cost to those centers to hire those folks, and it is very limited cost to provide that health insurance for them. So there is a huge savings. 
   But the main thing is we provide more coverage for families, families have more doctors that they can go to, we don't have these shortages, we don't have long lines at these centers, and people have a health care home. 
   It is such a simple task for Congress to pass this. This bill is one I hope my colleagues will help me in co-sponsoring and help support as it moves through the process. We simply cannot afford to continue to address health care by talking about health insurance only. That is an important part, but it isn't just financing this system. It is a matter of fixing this system in a compassionate, quality way. Community health care centers provide that, if we only open the door for more doctors and others to provide that care on a volunteer basis. 
   What could be more humanitarian, what could be more compassionate, than to remove this government barrier that stands in the way of people reaching out their hearts and providing this care at this very low cost? 
   I would hope that all of my colleagues would join me in co-sponsoring this bill and helping to move it through. But it is, as part of the Suburban Agenda, one where we recognize that working families have tremendous needs. 
   We have in this country, reaching out of compassion, have helped those with very little income through Medicaid. We have helped those who are veterans through the VA system. We have helped the elderly through Medicare. Let's also help those who are in different thresholds, in different categories, who cannot afford health care, and let's do this very low cost, perhaps even a cost offset plan, that can provide this care to them.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Well, what happens is, right now, those doctors who are paid are covered under the Federal Torts Claim Act. 
   What happens, if they can't see the patient, it is one of those things that medical care delayed is medical care denied. What they end up doing is sometimes going to emergency rooms, where the cost is many times over, and hospitals by law have to provide that care. They cannot turn them away. Again, we are taking children and families who should be seeing their physician for primary care, their immunizations, their flus and colds and earaches, and seeing a physician at a health center, and to have legal barriers are something that does not make sense to any family, let alone suburban families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Yes, indeed. Hospital emergency rooms should be for emergencies and traumas. Those who have flus and other illnesses can be seen by other doctors that don't overburden the emergency room at a very high cost. 
   Those, however, who do not have those illnesses yet, by a checkup with their doctor, adults and children alike, we can reduce costs because they can get to see the doctor early, or the nurse or the nurse practitioner or the dentist. 
   Our focus should be on providing quality care, accessible care at low cost. Community health centers are a tremendous asset for our Nation and something that we should all be supporting. It is perhaps the most compassionate thing we can be doing for the underinsured and the uninsured. 
   We will continue the battles in other areas, and we will continue to work to provide all the care that families need. But this is such an important answer that is in communities now and something I think we need to pass now.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for pointing that out. I am not clear whether there are any associations that oppose this part; maybe there are. But I would hope that they would reach out and say, these doctors are covered by some liability insurance. It is a lower cost to them. But the main thing is, let's get these families and these children to see doctors now and get the care that they need.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE FOR AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me on this critically important issue about energy. As American families look into the next few months about how they are going to be paying their gas bills as the cold winter sets upon us, as natural gas prices go up, of how they will be paying their automobile costs as gasoline prices go up, as we look at such things as jobs such as chemical industry as was just outlined by my friend from New Mexico, it is extremely important that as Congress looks at facing an energy bill this week that we note not only what is in there but what we expect is not in the bill. And unless we take on a comprehensive energy policy in America, America will be facing more brownouts, more times when the power is not there. And in a world where other countries, such as China, are opening up a new coal-fired power plant every couple of weeks without the scrubbers and environmental controls we have on, they will be able to undercut us even further with our costs of manufacturing. Unless Congress takes sizable action to back up energy legislation that looks to the big picture of diversifying our energy production and help to lower costs for consumers, our problems will only multiply. 
   Now, I represent a district in Pennsylvania coal country, directly above the Pittsburgh coal seam. It extends throughout western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. Some geologists tell me that the Pittsburgh coal seam has been the most valuable mineral deposit in the world. It was responsible for the growth of the American steel industry, glass, chemical industry, it has some 50,000 jobs in southwestern Pennsylvania dependent on the coal industry, railroads, barges, trucking, so many other industries involved. It allowed for the development of modern railroads, river navigation networks. It remains a valuable resource that will be able to serve us for many years to come, perhaps 250 more years, long after the Mideast is dry in its oil wells. 
   Closing the mines in Pennsylvania would be like closing the beaches in Florida or closing the harbors in New Orleans. The country can't afford to stop using coal, either. It is a valuable economic resource for our region as other resources available in other parts of the country. So we have to take advantage of every possible resource to meet our energy demands. The messages today are quite simple. We cannot achieve energy independence without coal. We cannot achieve energy security without coal. And our coal must be clean coal, not the other option of no coal at all. 
   Now, listen to these numbers. They are quite compelling. Over the next 40 years or so, the electricity demand in the United States will double. These are the demands of people in their homes. They are also the demands of increasing jobs in this country. We will conserve, and we will have make great strides in efficiency. But with the growth in the population and improving quality of life, it all dictates that electricity demands will still increase substantially.  
   Coal accounts for about 50 percent of our electricity, and nonhydro renewables like solar and wind account for about 2 percent. We have already built as much hydroelectric as possible, and it is doubtful that people will want to see more large super dams built around the country. But even if we triple the share of renewable electricity, we will still need coal for close to half of our electricity in 2050. This means we will still have approximately to double the available coal capacity by 2050 just to meet demand. 
   Right now there are about 400 coal plants in the United States. Many of them are old and inefficient, outdated. Most or all of them will need to be replaced over the next 40 years. So just to maintain our current level, we are going to need to build about 400 plants to replace those. And then to meet the new electrical demands over the next 40 years, we are going to have to build an additional 400. That is 800 new coal-fired power plants between now and 2050. This is twice as many plants as have been built since the start of the Industrial Revolution. This translates to about one coal plant every 2 to 3 weeks, even if we start in 2010, just to maintain the current capacity. It is a huge demand. And we can do that in a way that has clean coal technology, zero emissions, if we will choose to make the investments. MIT said about $8 billion or so will be needed to meet those investments in real dollars. That seems a lot cheaper than it took us back in the 1960s to put someone on the Moon. In the meantime, China is adding about one or two coal plants a week and they are going to continue. They put cheap power in the plants without scrubbers. In the U.S., renewable technologies such as solar and wind are expanding rapidly and will continue to do so. But they simply cannot match coal in terms of delivered power. 
   Here are some examples. This past August, power from West Virginia's largest wind farm was available only about 10 percent of the time that it was actually needed. 
   That is, the wind doesn't blow consistently every day. At 10 percent availability and 3 megawatts capacity, about 3,000 windmills would be needed to equal the useful output of just one coal plant. To completely replace coal with wind, we would need to build 1.2 million windmills by 2050. This assumes the utilities will actually be allowed to build all the new miles of transmission lines they will need. And will people want all those wind towers up? 
   Another area, the largest solar panel array in the United States is under construction at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. It is going to cover 140 acres of desert with 70,000 solar panels, but will produce only about 2 percent of the output of a modern coal-fired power plant. At that rate, we would have to destroy 11 square miles of beautiful southwestern Pennsylvania forest or consume this much valuable land from our farmers just to avoid building one coal plant. 
   The truth is, we need to increase the supply of all energy, coal, natural gas, nuclear and renewables. We can't afford to ignore any of them unless we are willing to put up with a series of brownouts and blackouts during times when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. So the key to solving this problem includes developing clean coal technologies with zero emissions and zero greenhouse gases. 
   Another option is to switch to natural gas, and what we are hearing in the energy bill is there will be more push for doing that, as was outlined by my friend from New Mexico. As natural gas prices continue to soar, that is more jobs out of America that use chemical plants and more families' gas bills going up. Natural gas provides about 19 percent of our current electricity demand, and its use will also have to double by 2050 to maintain its current market share. About 90 percent of the electric generating capacity installed since the year 2000 has been natural gas-based, and natural gas is about three times more expensive than coal per kilowatt of electricity generated. This has increased the demand for natural gas and raised the price of both gas and electricity. The increased use of natural gas for electricity combined with our policies that place off-limits much of our domestic gas resources has caused us to be become a gas-importing nation when we could be a gas-exporting nation. 
   Congress has repeatedly made vast areas of our coastlines off-limits, thus embargoing our own resources from ourselves, boycotting our own resources, and all the while countries like Cuba drill closer to our shore than we are allowed to. 
   We used to be self-sufficient in natural gas, but not anymore. Most of our imported gas still comes from Canada, but this is declining. Imports of liquid natural gas, or LNG, are increasing rapidly. Not only does this move us farther away from independence, but it is unsustainable because demand for liquefied natural gas throughout the world, especially in Europe, is also increasing rapidly. Chemical companies which use natural gas as their primary feedstock to make such chemicals and fertilizers and other products and other industries that depend heavily on natural gas are going to move their operations overseas where gas is cheaper. When natural gas costs in Middle East or Russia are $1 per unit or less compared to $6 to $12 at a fluctuating cost line in the United States, it is easy to see why the decisions are being made. 
   Already we have lost 3.2 million manufacturing jobs, almost 20 percent of the total since the year 2000. Chemical companies consistently say that natural gas costs are far more important than labor costs when making their decision to move overseas. Worse yet, if greenhouse gas legislation becomes reality in its current form, natural gas will become by default the fuel of choice for electric utilities. The trends we have already seen will only become worse. Prices will soar. 
   In the mix of which energy source is the cheapest, hydro is probably the cheapest, but as we said before, we doubt if people will want to build several more dams and dam up beautiful valleys across America. Next cheapest is nuclear power followed by coal, wind, natural gas and solar. 
   But let me briefly talk about nuclear. We need to decide whether nuclear power can pick up the required electricity supply. Nuclear plants currently provide about 19 percent of our electricity, about 30 percent in Pennsylvania. There are about 100 nuclear power plants in operation in the United States today, but we can't just keep relicensing them forever. They are also getting old and worn and will need to be replaced. By 2050, we will have to replace just about all of the existing nuclear fleet. They are long past their prime and will need to close. This means that by 2050, we will have to build about 200 new nuclear power plants. That is 100 replacements and 100 new to meet the expected demands of 2050. The trouble is we haven't built a single nuclear power plant in the last 30 years, given 
   all the delays and costs associated with nuclear construction. It is going to be difficult, if not impossible, to build plants in the U.S. at the rate needed. That is about five per year, about one every 2 1/2 months starting in 2010. Although the operating costs for nuclear plants are about the same or slightly cheaper than coal, the capital costs are much higher and the lead times for construction and permitting are much longer. The nuclear operating costs also do not include the long-term costs of nuclear waste disposal or storage. 
   As with natural gas, the enactment of greenhouse gas legislation in what we are understanding is the current form, without working to help the nuclear is going to increase the demand for nuclear power and place further strain on resources and increase costs. So there we are, two of our biggest resources for producing electricity, coal and nuclear, are areas that Congress has got to deal with seriously. 
   We have 250, perhaps 300 years' worth of coal in the ground. Scientists are working on ways of making sure we have zero emissions coal, zero greenhouse gases, massively reduce that. Right now I know in Pennsylvania about 40 percent of our coal-fired power plants have no scrubbers, or inadequate scrubbers. Unfortunately, the way new source review works is if a company says let's work to improve efficiency, let's put in new turbines or other things that improve efficiency by a few percent, at that point, the government comes in and says, no, we now have to review everything you do, and if you don't take care of everything with all the scrubbers, you can't do it at all. The companies say, well, we were  thinking of spending 20, or 50 or $150 million on some upgrades but we don't have four or $500 million to take care of this one plant. So they hold off. That is not cleaning the air. That is not taking care of our needs. 
   What we have to do is look at ways of promoting the new technology, helping private business make those investments in new technology, but above all, meet our current and our future needs by addressing the issues of America's abundant supplies of coal and expanding the use of nuclear power which is clean. It is one of those areas we have to deal with seriously. 
   I thank the gentleman from New Mexico for yielding me this time and his leadership on working in these areas which is so important for America's energy security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking member for the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, which I'm here to offer my strong support, and I thank Chairman Miller and Congressman McKeon for ensuring the language for my bill, H.R. 2220, the Mental Health Security for America's Families in Education Act, was included in the legislation. 
   This language directs the Secretary of Education to clarify how and when schools can communicate with the parent if a student demonstrates that they pose a significant risk of suicide, homicide, or assault. Schools acting in good faith by communicating with parents would also be protected from liability. 
   The current Family Education Rights and Privacy Act passed in 1974 was originally passed to protect the confidentiality of student records. However, it's a confusing array of regulations meant to notify parents but often stands in the way as schools are more prone to call an attorney to get clarification than they are to call parents. 
   As a child psychologist, I understand the importance of confidentiality, but there are times that it may be in the best interest of the student to inform those who can provide the necessary help to protect them and others. Parents are in the best position to help students suffering from mental illness by providing emotional support medical history, coordinating care with various mental health professionals, and long-term follow up. Parents will be around long after the school is gone. 
   Behind a law like this there are stories of beautiful lives tragically stopped in their youth. Children like Stephanie Cady from North Franklin Township who was a junior at Elizabethtown College until she withdrew for medical reasons. According to her parents, she was struggling with depression and paranoia during her sophomore year. Her friends persuaded her to get help, but her parents were never told that she was taking medication until just this past Christmas. Unfortunately, the right combination of help from her parents and therapists came too late and, sadly, she took her own life in April of 2008. 
   In 2002, Charles Mahoney from Burgettstown took his own life while in school at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania. 
   And since the passing of their children, the Mahoneys and the Cadys have advocated for change to existing laws so the parents can help before it is too late. 
   Families know the privacy laws that prevent schools from sharing information with parents have to be changed so the parents can get involved to help with the children that they love. Our shared hope is that through the important change of law, their actions will prevent other parents from suffering the same losses, and their children's lives can be remembered at least in saving the lives of others. 
   This bill we are dealing with today is taking an important step in saving those lives, and I want to thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for their support of this critically important and life-saving provision that will prevent other tragedies like this and Virginia Tech happening again in the future.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week Education Secretary Spellings released guidelines to clarify the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, but the current law does not go far enough to keep our campuses safe. Schools need to be able to talk with parents when they think a student is at risk for violence without fear that they are going to be sued. That is why I introduced H.R. 2220, the Mental Health Security for Families and Education, or the Mental Health SAFE Act, to allow universities to notify parents if a student is at risk of suicide or homicide or assault, while holding schools harmless if they act in good faith. Schools should be focused on the safety of students, not fear of being sued if they do take action or sued if they don't take action. We need a law to protect students and parents. 
   It is too late for Virginia Tech; it is too late for the many students who commit suicide or homicidal acts each year. It is not too late for other campuses. I ask my colleagues to please cosponsor the Mental Health SAFE Act. Let's work together to save lives.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, Greensburg, Pennsylvania, a town in my congressional district, is lucky to have had their fire chief for 55 years. John Edward Hutchinson, who prefers to be known just as Hutch, first took office in 1952, and he has no intention of slowing down. Were he standing with me, he would say that he simply wants to help. 
   And help he has. From developing training programs and specialized teams in his department to establishing burn classes in local schools, Hutch has put in countless hours of service to the community. 
   But it's not just Southwestern Pennsylvania that has benefited from Hutch's time as fire chief. Hutch has organized his teams to assist the victims of natural disasters throughout the country from hurricanes to floods. 
   Hutch always shies from attention, but he deserves our recognition for 55 years of tireless service to the community.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, we certainly appreciate and admire all of the citizens of the United States and all those from territories, and they participate in debate here. 
   One of the things that helps us understand what takes place here, I would like to go back to what happens in Alleghany County where I live in the city of Pittsburgh. We have an Alleghany County Council, and they meet in the city of Pittsburgh regularly, and some members of that council are citizens of the city of Pittsburgh; but their jurisdiction is not the city of Pittsburgh. What would happen if they decided it would be their jurisdiction to vote on issues that affected that city on matters of taxation and other issues that take place? I believe the courts would say that just because you are citizens of this area does not mean that your jurisdiction of your elected body extends to that city, and courts would strike it down. 
   This is not an issue of whether or not we respect and admire our friends and fellow citizens from these territories. It is the matter of the rules of what our Constitution states and what people can represent and what should be allowed in this body. It concerns me that on the tote boards here of the list of votes, it does not say whether somebody is a full Member or a Delegate. That, I believe, is something that is also going to mislead the American public as to the vote totals here. 
   But more than anything else, to be able to vote on issues that affect my constituents, whether it is taxation or other issues of representation, it is simply not in our Constitution to have that there, and I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, while Congress and the President are talking about an economic stimulus package, remember that the high costs of energy are costing us our economy. 
   Oil and gas prices continue to climb. Our President asked Saudi leaders to produce more oil to bring prices down. Well, something is wrong here. OPEC controls the price, OPEC funds the process, and we end up funding both sides of the war on terror. 
   The trade imbalance grew in November to record levels, primarily from the high cost of imported oil. But Congress votes to block drilling for U.S. oil on the Atlantic Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Western States and Alaska. Something is wrong here. We have hundreds of years of American coal to make electricity. We should fund research to clean up the coal, not ignore it. 
   In the meantime, energy costs go up, food costs go up, manufacturing jobs go down, the economy goes down. Something is wrong here. If we are serious about helping the economy, let's bring down the cost of energy. The best economic stimulus package is a job.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. In Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania, a town in my congressional district, Allegheny Police Detective Lawrence Carpico saved the life of 16-year-old Sarah Deiuliis, a victim of a school acquaintance, on October 31, 2007. Sarah had been lured into the woods by someone she considered a friend. When the young man attacked her with a hammer, she fended off her attacker and ran luckily into the path of Detective Carpico who happened upon the couple while walking a dog. Detective Carpico, who was off duty at the time, acted decisively and ushered the girl to safety and called for the assistance of on-duty officers and medics. For his actions, he will be presented with the Mount Lebanon Police Department's Chief's Award. 
   Likewise, let's recognize Sarah, who displayed extraordinary courage in the face of extreme danger. She fought back against her attacker using intelligence and quick thinking. For this, she will be recognized with the Survivor Award. 
   It is a great honor to represent such courageous citizens and to present  their story in this Chamber, and I commend both for their actions.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (THE HEALTHY HOSPITALS ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, over the last several months, and certainly over the last 2 weeks, Congress has had a number of accomplishments. Today we did a number of things that were important such as funding for our troops. We also improved toy safety. But there have been a number of other opportunities which, unfortunately, with the schedule that we missed, that we could have done and should have done and I hope next year we will do. And that is while we are looking at issues to improve health care and reduce health care costs, when we talk about Medicare or Medicaid or SCHIP, one of the things we should have done was really work to lower costs and save money and save lives. 
   We hear both sides of the aisle these days talking about the costs of everything: The national debt in the trillions, earmarks need to be reduced, health care is too expensive. But too often we keep talking about these problems or saying perhaps Congress can find a way to pay for these things. But shouldn't we look at how to fix the problem and not just finance it? 
   We had a solution in front of us that could have saved $50 billion in health care costs. But it didn't happen. 
   Earlier this year I introduced H.R. 1174, the Healthy Hospitals Act, which received strong bipartisan support. This legislation is a simple solution to lower costs associated with hospital- and health care-acquired infections. 
   The implementation of this bill is not expensive; it only requires hospitals to publicly disclose their hospital-acquired infection rates and follow simple cleanliness techniques that we already expect our caretakers to follow, things you assume that hospitals and clinics are doing, but, unfortunately, they are not always doing that: washing their hands, wearing gloves, sterilizing equipment before and after uses, testing patients for other diseases prior to treatment or admission to hospitals, giving antibiotics before and after surgery. These aren't  revolutionary ideas; they're just ideas that too often are not followed. 
   Well, how much of a difference does it really make letting the public know about hospital-acquired infection rates of individual hospitals? In my home State of Pennsylvania, to give a great example of what hospitals can do when they're held accountable for these infections, many hospitals, where they are now required by law to publicly post on the Internet their infection rates, have seen their rates drop to zero or near zero. Incredible, and a good story. 
   According to the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council, the average charge of hospitalization in 2005 for a patient who became infected with a hospital-acquired infection was over $185,000, but the average charge for a patient without infection was $31,000. That's $31,000 versus $185,000, a difference of over $150,000 per patient. Doesn't that tell us what we can be doing to save money and save lives? Now, multiply that statistic by 49 other States and we see what happens. We need to seek areas where we can reduce costs. 
   Let me point out the grim statistics of this year as of today. This year's toll of health care acquired infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or what's been called the ``super bug of methicillin-resistant infections,'' as of today, 1,934,246 cases, 87,010 deaths, and over $48 billion spent on infections people acquired when they go to the hospital or go to the doctor. 
   Twenty-two other States have taken some steps to reduce these, and we need to make sure we make this a universal system of recording. 
   I hope that we work this next year to emphasize patient choice, patient quality, and patient safety, and pass H.R. 1174.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank my distinguished ranking member. 
   In 2007, there have been 61 toy recalls, which translates to about 25 million toys. This number is up significantly from the 40 recalls of 5 million toys we had last year. And this is what we caught. 
   This bill will help protect consumers. The real culprits remain, however, the trading partners who refuse to abide by international standards, countries like China and others who have lax oversight, who happen to be the leading countries that are involved with these appalling rates. That's why this bill is so important, because it is up to us to set sound and safe standards and enforce them. 
   In addition, I am pleased the committee will be looking at further research to look at the issue of pet toys, pet toys that may themselves have lead and other toxic metals that are unregulated. Not only is this a concern in exposure for the family pet, but also because many of these toys themselves are inviting to children. Young children themselves may pick them up, put them in their mouth, and get these toxic substances on their hands. 
   As people do their shopping this holiday season, perhaps what we should be doing as a Nation, before this bill is signed by the President and goes into effect, instead of judging products by cheap prices, we should all be looking for quality and safety that comes from buying American products. 
   With that, I thank the committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last April, 33 students were killed at Virginia Tech. That tragedy exposed problems with Federal laws that are a barrier to schools communicating with parents when a student has a serious problem. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 states that students' records cannot be released except ``to protect the health and safety of the student and others.'' 
   Unfortunately, the interpretation of that law is so unclear that schools are fearful of being sued. 
   The just-released report from the National Association of Attorneys General Task Force on Campus Safety calls for an update of the FERPA law that would allow for protection from liability if schools make good-faith efforts to protect students, faculty and staff. 
   That is precisely what my bill, H.R. 2220, offers, a way to allow schools to communicate with parents when a student has significant mental health problems that increase the risk for suicide, homicide or violent acts while we still protect the confidentiality of records. 
   I ask that all my colleagues join me and Representative GRACE NAPOLITANO in cosponsoring our bill, the Mental Health Security for Families in Education Act, and work to protect our students. 
   Let's take down the walls between parents and schools. Let's take action now to save lives tomorrow.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the chairman. 
   One of the benefits of reviewing these publicly is to help get some facts on the table with regard to what these projects are. This project of the Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation program is one of 37 heritage sites around the Nation. It includes such other projects as the Tennessee Civil War Heritage Area, the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Area, Mississippi Gulf Coast Area, the National Aviation Area and, of course, the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area in Arizona. 
   This one in Pennsylvania involves nine counties in four congressional districts. It was something that started in 1988 at that time, signed into law by President Reagan. The purpose of this was to help promote some of the heritage of the industries of iron, steel, coal and transportation that were an important part of Pennsylvania's history and our Nation's history. Thus, designation as one of these national historic areas. 
   It has had an impact that goes far beyond the money that has been invested in it, and, that is, a construction boom has come out of this. Also, it has spawned other projects such as dealing with acid mine drainage remediation projects, river conservation projects, county heritage plans, the creation of growth of trail development groups. More than 65 local preservation, conservation, and community organizations have significantly expanded their missions in recognition of their role in developing a heritage resource for the region. All in all it has helped leverage some $90 million of grants from other sources to help promote these programs with this. 
   We recognize that as we look at these projects around the Nation, those of us who are in Pennsylvania may understand best those projects in Pennsylvania as those in some of these other areas. Mississippi, I may not know as much about those or the ones in Virginia or Arizona or Georgia, wherever these other projects are. But this is important to Pennsylvanians and it's important to our Nation, to a large extent because Pennsylvania and the region was the area that built the world literally with steel, with our coal. We are a State that has lost manufacturing jobs. In fact, tourism and agriculture are our two highest sources of income in Pennsylvania, and it is important that we understand that tourism is a source of jobs in Pennsylvania like many other States. It draws visitors in not only from our Nation but from around the world and it is worthy of working on ways to continue these jobs with some growth. 
   The vast majority of funding for these programs has come from other sources. But what it has done, also, is help preserve some of that heritage. Understanding the history of our Nation is important to understanding the future of our Nation. Thus, we need to learn the lessons from history to fund these things to understand how it is important and how to promote this. 
   This is not just something for my district, but it is important to several districts; and it is important to our Nation and the start-up tourism-related businesses that are otherwise unable to secure loans from other programs.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Reclaiming my time, I would like to add a couple of other things that relate to some Federal overlap with this particular project. This whole area of the heritage preservation group for southwestern Pennsylvania also overlaps with 218 nationally registered properties, 16 national historic landmarks, two national park units and one other national landmark all recognized by the Federal Government as a way of linking these things together. It is a way of helping to promote these things for jobs and for understanding the heritage of our Nation. 
   Someone once said that those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. Indeed, where we stand now with an importance of understanding what our economic heritage was, our industrial and manufacturing heritage, are important to the people of southwestern Pennsylvania and are important to the people of the Nation.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I also thank the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps) for her thoughts and input on this bill, which I'm pleased to be a cosponsor today. 
   Appropriately, National Women's Health Week began this Monday, May 12, the day after Mother's Day, and this past Monday was National Women's Checkup Day. To this end, we encourage all women to discuss with their doctor the importance of regular checkups, self exams. 
   We also should note that the government has a Web site on this; it's www.womenshealth.gov/whw. There they recommend several tests that women should get on a regular basis. 
   Also like to mention, as we're focusing on women's health, as my colleague, my friend from California stated, this is also of interest and importance to men. Whether you're fathers or spouses or relatives, it's important to also be supportive of women's health and be supportive of exams they may need to have. 
   As we focus on this, I want to mention a few other conditions that impact women and the importance of Federal research funding. Fibromyalgia, for example, is a chronic pain illness characterized by widespread musculoskeletal aches, pains and stiffness, soft tissue tenderness, general fatigue and sleep disturbances. 
   Depression is another very important condition to highlight. Women, during and after pregnancy, for example, are at much greater risk to develop depression, and folks who have a chronic illness are at risk to develop depression. 
   Oftentimes, we neglect these important symptoms and aspects of health care when meeting with a physician. It is very important to review any concerns that anyone has, that women have when they have their annual exams, such as sleep problems, changes in appetite, mood changes, persistent sadness and other things. These are treatable conditions and not ones to shun in bringing up and discussing openly and honestly with their physician. 
   We have other things to comment on this, but at this point I will reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding, and I thank the House for taking up this important bill. 
   In my 25-plus years of practicing as a child psychologist, I have treated many of the types of children that we're talking about today: young men and women, young boys and girls, who oftentimes characteristically really have reached the point in living with their family where the family has lost all ability to control these children. 
   As one group of parents told me when I was working them once in a group, the mother said, You know, it's like walking on eggshells when you're around my son. Another mother said, No, it's like walking on glass. You have to be so careful. You never know when you're going to have harm. 
   And so it is. I know so many of them move me so much when I wrote my book about these children called ``The Angry Child.'' I recognized what many of their characteristics are: They have difficulty solving problems; they tend to blame other people for their problems; their primary emotional reaction to difficulty is anger; they believe that anger is a source of power for them, and they have a great deal of destructive self-talk. It is so very, very difficult to change these children. 
   And thus it is important that we have residential treatment programs available as an option because these parents have certainly gone through the whole gamut of possible treatment options through psychotherapy, counseling, sometimes hospitalizations, medication, et cetera. And they're so moved by their love and affection and hope for their child they're willing to try anything. But we have to make sure that ``anything'' does not involve situations that can lead to more harm and abuse. 
   One of the reasons this bill is so important is because parents have to know at a time when they feel they can no longer trust their child to control themselves and they no longer can trust their own ability to parent, they have to trust someone. And sound, residential treatment programs that are there with proper staff properly trained in therapy, not there to physically abuse or harm the child, of which a majority of these programs are good programs, but parents have to know there is something they can trust. 
   It is so terribly, terribly heartbreaking to work with these families and work with these children and know that they have destroyed a family. Their threats of violence, the risk for drug and alcohol abuse, their attacking other children, all just on this side of law so they don't end up in jail. 
   Parents are desperately trying to help them. I'm pleased this legislation is taking some steps to help restore some sense of trust for parents to know that the child can get some treatment to know the risks of harm are eliminated for them. 
   But still we have to recognize we must keep options open for these families who no longer know how to handle their very, very angry and difficult child.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, over 17 percent of soldiers returning from Iraq, higher than any other measured military conflict, meet the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. Predeployment mental health screening, availability of treatment, perception toward treatment and public attitudes of the soldiers' actions all affect the vulnerability and prognosis for this disorder. 
   PTSD is a severe anxiety disorder that develops after a traumatic event involving physical danger. It is also called ``shell shock'' or ``battle fatigue'' in other wars and is particularly prevalent among soldiers who have experienced wartime combat. Symptoms can include insomnia, irritability, inability to concentrate, panic, terror, dread, despair, grief and include daytime recollections, traumatic nightmares or combat flashbacks. Most persons exposed to severe trauma do not develop symptoms. Onset can be immediate but more commonly occurs from a few months to years after the event. 
   Currently, the Department of Defense provides mental health services for 180 days following discharge and the VA offers its health care services, including mental health, to veterans at no cost for 2 years following discharge. Afterwards, veterans may continue to receive mental health treatment but are subject to copayments. 
   Unit support while still deployed helps reduce symptom risk. Once soldiers return home these supports end, but ongoing support is essential to reduce the risk, from families, friends, veterans, the VA and our society as a whole. Many with early symptoms of PTSD, however, isolate from social contact and do not benefit from these supports. 
   In the current war in Iraq, unlike Vietnam, society as a whole is generally able to separate support for the soldier from support for the war. However, as criticism for the war increases and the public questions the purpose and outcome of this war, a significant question remains as to the impact upon the soldier's mental health of these expressions of doubt. For those at risk for PTSD and since hopelessness may raise the risk, society's comments of the situation may increase the soldier's sense of personal blame and lead the soldiers to question if they did their job well. Or they may develop a sense of worthlessness and guilt that their fellow soldiers lost their lives for a cause that was not supported by the country. Further research must be done to explore this link, but it also raises an important issue. Not only is there a concern for a stigma for the war action itself but also getting help. The majority of soldiers who need treatment for PTSD and mental health symptoms do not seek help for fear of being seen as weak, for fear of being treated differently by their commander, or fear of future harm to their career. 
   Pictures, commentary and news coverage of this war affects not only recent combat veterans but extends to those of prior wars. A survey of 70 Vietnam veterans stated that 57 percent reported flashbacks after watching reports about this war on television, and almost half faced sleep disorders. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a need for specialized military mental health services. As of May last year, of the 5 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan soldiers who may have been at risk, only 22 percent sought help from mental health providers. The rest sought help from primary care doctors, many without mental health training. 
   The National Defense Authorization Act of last year created the defense task force on mental health. Within a year, they are to submit a report to us with a long-term plan to improve the effectiveness for Armed Forces who have experienced multiple deployments. But Congress can improve the Department of Defense referral process for mental health evaluations by psychiatrists/psychologists to better meet the needs of our troops. As chronic PTSD symptoms can continue for years, the VA should extend the 2-year universal coverage period for mental health services for our Nation's soldiers when they return from active duty and combat. And we need to study the effects of the 24-hour media exposure on the occurrence of PTSD symptoms upon returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress can also increase public awareness of PTSD to reduce the stigma for returning veterans and for them to take advantage of mental health services at the VA. 
   Working together, we can ensure that none of our Nation's veterans suffering with PTSD are left behind, but above all as Members of Congress we have to make sure that the things we do and say respond to the caveat to first do no harm.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it has been a few short weeks since the tragedies of Virginia Tech, which we cannot forget. Nor should we forget the fact that there are three suicides each day on college campuses and each year hundreds of thousands of acts of violence, many committed by those who have serious mental illness. 
   But under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, passed into law in 1974, school personnel, administrators, and teachers who have little or no training in mental health are burdened with the task of defining and determining if a student is at risk. These educational personnel are also reluctant to release information for fear of legal action. 
   That is why I have introduced H.R. 2220, the Mental Health Security for America's Families in Education Act, to break down these barriers to allow our schools to communicate with parents after consultation with a licensed mental health professional. 
   I ask my colleagues to join the Association of American Universities, the American Council on Education, and the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges to help support this bill.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I certainly support this and so many other amendments on this bill which are so very, very important not only to our veterans, but it serves as a model, as do so many veterans programs, of something we could be doing for other Americans. 
   Let me speak first to the point of what these do when we manage and coordinate patient care. We had an issue recently in the Energy and Commerce Committee which I serve on doing this, another aspect, and it was a very lively discussion. But recognize that someone who is wounded, as well as someone who has other medical illnesses, a single diagnosis is usually not something that stands loan. For example, a person with diabetes may have several other endocrine problems, problems with their kidneys, with their diet, their circulation, their limbs, their mobility, and of course there are emotions, too, all of which can be very, very complex to deal with. 
   When the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center did a study on coordinating the care of people with diabetes, for example, they found when they assign people to work on these cases, they reduce rehospitalization by 75 percent. Washington Hospital in Washington, Pennsylvania reduced rehospitalization of folks with heart disease by 50 percent. These are extremely important aspects. And we have to look upon these as things that not only save money, but they save lives and they save a lot of care. 
   Let me also point to an amendment offered by my dear friend, Mr. Kennedy of Rhode Island, when he talked about mental illness. When we are talking about the wounds of war or the wounds of life, not all of these wounds are visible. They are not necessarily scars one can see, they are not something you can put a bandage on, but they are very real. The psychological wounds of war are such that they can break up a family, keep someone from holding a job, perhaps lead someone to try to self-medicate their problems away with drugs or alcohol, all too common problems among our veterans. 
   And then when they are not dealt with, we find people who become more dependent upon others, that with difficulties with their families, with their  children, perhaps become hopeless, have trouble holding a job. And all of those continued effects of wounds of war go on. 
   It is extremely important that we recognize in Mr. Kennedy's amendment, as well as Ms. Johnson's amendment and other aspects of this whole bill that what is vitally important is we treat the whole person. 
   The time is long past due in this country where we look at medical symptoms and medical disease as something that shows up on an x-ray or a blood test or some other sophisticated test. Indeed, the wounds of war are not always visible, nor are they things that appear soon after the battle. Post traumatic stress disorder, other anxiety disorders can remain latent for years and suddenly reappear. I remember meeting a veteran at a VA hospital who ended up with some problems after 20 or 30 years after the Vietnam War. He had recently had a liver transplant. 
   Under the medications and other aspects, he suddenly began having nightmares that he never had before. He had all this psychological trauma that was never showing up before. 
   What is so important is that we work to train people to understand these issues, which the gentlelady's amendment talks about, that we work to deal with the mental illness issues, which Mr. Kennedy's amendment talks about, and we work as a unit, as a whole, as a Congress, as a Nation to recognize that many times the illnesses and wounds of war are things that may not be there now, may not be visible, but are aspects we have to treat in the long run. 
   I call on all of my colleagues to enthusiastically support these amendments. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (PUTTING SUPERBUGS ON THE DEFENSIVE -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. This Tuesday, a Wall Street Journal article written by Theo Francis started off by saying, ``Hospitals are prime breeding grounds for antibiotic-resistant `superbugs' that kill tens of thousands of Americans each year. But most people have had no way of knowing how well their hospital keeps these bacteria--and infections in general--under control.'' 
   Nineteen States have some version of requiring reporting of infection rates in hospitals, but there is no overall plan for this, and thus there is a great  deal of confusion. That is why I introduced H.R. 1174, the Healthy Hospitals Act, to help our Nation's citizens understand the infection rates in hospitals and get these under control. 
   Here are today's sad statistics. So far this year 1.6 million people have developed an infection in a hospital. There have been 73,000 deaths and a cost of over $40 billion. It is time we get these under control, and I ask my colleagues to help support by signing on as cosponsors of H.R. 1174. Let's stop these deadly diseases that are killing so many in our hospitals.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (HEALTH CENTERS RENEWAL ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Deal and I thank Mr. Green for this very, very important bill, this Health Centers Renewal Act to provide some very, very important coverage for some of our most needy citizens. 
   You know, when people oftentimes will comment upon how many people in America don't have health care, who recognize that actually many of them are covered by programs such as Medicaid, they may or may not know it, or SCHIP or some choose not to have health insurance. But there are also those millions of Americans who simply are not low-income enough for Medicaid. They don't have children, so they're not covered by SCHIP. And they're not old enough for Medicare. Where do they go? 
   Well, community health centers provide the very health care that they need, give them health care home, give them peace of mind. It is a place where, for a low fee, they can have ongoing health care, know that they have a doctor who knows them, and dentist and psychologist and other ones who provide the vital care for them, and it keeps costs down. Keeps costs down tremendously. 
   I believe some 30 percent of people who go to community health centers do not have health care insurance, and of those who do attend, it maintains even lower costs for Medicaid patients. So it is savings at all levels. 
   But unfortunately, there are huge vacancies with community health centers. Those vacancies have to do with normal family physicians or psychiatrists or OB/GYNs, and that has led to backups. That has led to delays in appointments. And the question is, is there a way we can resolve that? 
   Well, here's something we discovered that was odd, and this bill corrects that. Strangely enough, if physicians want to volunteer at a free clinic, they can do so, and they're covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act. On the other hand, if they are paid medical staff at a free clinic, they're not covered under the Federal Tort Claims Act. 
   Reverse that for a community health center. If they're paid staff at a community health center, they're covered under the Federal Tort Claims Act, but if they want to volunteer, they are not. 
   I introduced a bill, H.R. 1626, the Family Healthcare Accessibility Act, a couple of years ago to correct that, and I am pleased that Mr. Green has put this into this bill. That basically provides that physicians and other health professionals, nurse practitioners who want to volunteer are covered. 
   What does this mean? That means lower costs for clinics, and that means that physicians, for example, who may want to give some of their time each week or each month, a clinic will be there with welcome arms. It has not been something that's been allowed before, but it does provide lower health care costs. It is a way for physicians and other primary practitioners to be able to give back to the community. It is a way to lower health care costs. 
   In this Nation, where there are 760 primary care physician openings, 290 nurse practitioners openings and 310 dentist openings just a couple of years ago--and those numbers may have climbed--this provides a way that we can fulfill those needs at basically no cost. 
   I thank the chairman, I thank Ranking Member Deal and everybody else who has been part of this bill in making this a working bill to help bring health care costs down, help bring health care to America's needy citizens and help bring a health care home for so many Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (PREVENTABLE INFECTIONS OCCURRING IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, in the news headlines yesterday and today, we learned that more people die from an infection called MRSA than die from AIDS. The news, however, is much worse than this. And that is, if you look at the amount of preventable infections that occur in health care settings, it actually is more like 90,000 people die, will die this year from preventable infections in health care settings, and over 2 million cases will occur. 
   The cost to our health care system in America is over $50 billion. As we look at the cost of health care and how families cannot afford it, it is important that this Chamber take into account what we can do to reduce costs and fix the system and not just finance the system. And this is one of those areas. 
   Now, recently, the Center for Medicare Services, CMS, also said that they would move towards not funding treatment of preventable infections in hospitals. Now, although that is an important move, and one that will save a great deal of money and one that we believe will help motivate health care centers to take more action, it still does not help with a couple of issues. One is that there's not a universal system across America where citizens can find out what are the infection rates within certain health care settings. And those are important because when one is selecting a hospital for care or going to a clinic, it would be good to know what those infection rates are. 
   You know, for example, it's mandated by law that airlines have to report their on-time rates for when they depart or arrive at the gates at an airport. 
   However, you cannot find that information about the safety levels of the hospital which you may be going for treatment or surgery, and we need to make that available. 
   Nineteen different States require some level of this, but, quite frankly, it is a hodgepodge of different requirements. Some report to the Department of Health. Some report some diseases and not others. And we need to make this uniform across the Nation so that patients can tell and that it is an important aspect of helping people to understand before they go into a hospital. 
   Now, the thing about this is these infection rates are preventable. You have issues such as MRSA, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; pneumonias; urinary tract infections; and others that could be preventable by a couple of important procedures: washing hands; wearing gloves for procedures; sterilizing equipment; cleaning up before and after procedures, including patients' rooms and other areas;  making sure that visitors to the hospital follow these same procedures; wearing a hospital gown or other clothes so that patients do not get exposed from one doctor visiting one room to the next. Some countries even require visitors to wear masks and a gown and to scrub. I understand in the United Kingdom they require the doctor to make sure they scrub and not wear jewelry room to room and to put on a different gown as they go to each room so that diseases are not spread. These are important steps that can take place. However, we don't have any kind of universal reporting system in this country. 
   My bill I introduced called H.R. 1174, the Healthy Hospitals Act, would help to make this uniform. And that is it would require the Secretary of Health to come up with a system of reporting and hospitals would give their information and there would be an annual report to Congress of best practices to reduce these deadly diseases. 
   It is tragic that more people die from infection they pick up at a health care center each year than all of our soldiers who died in Vietnam. And if we saw this as the emergency that it is, if, for example, we had heard that a plane crashed somewhere and a couple hundred people died, we would know that all sorts of Federal agencies would be all over that investigating that. If the next day another plane crashed and a couple hundred more died, an uproar would be across America as to what is happening to airplane safety. If it happened a third day in a row, probably we would shut down the airports. But here, when someone dies every 5 minutes, new infections occur all the time, we do not take this kind of action. And we need to see this as an emergency, particularly because there has been a number of hospitals which have tackled this problem and have solved this problem and have virtually eliminated some of their infection rates. We need to do this as a nation. 
   In addition, my bill, H.R. 1174, would also provide, from the savings that come from reducing these infections, a grant program to hospitals that have been able to massively reduce or eliminate their infection rates. 
   We need to gather together as a Congress and no longer ignore this problem, which is leading to so many deaths. We need to acknowledge those hospitals and health care settings that are leading to major changes and cleaning this up and also help those hospitals that are not. We can no longer hide from this problem when we see in the news the number of deaths that are occurring there, and even now so many have this, the things that are occurring in schools as well. 
   We have to take vigorous action as a nation to save these lives. And I would hope that my colleagues would sign on as supporters of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (HEALTHY HOSPITALS ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, yesterday's headlines stated that more people will die from MRSA infections than die from AIDS, but that's just the beginning of the story, for actually some 90,000 people will likely die this year from an infection they pick up in a hospital or receiving health care. Tragic news. We also hear about students in school who have died from MRSA infections. But the point is hospitals are taking actions to reduce its infection rates, and yet Congress is not doing anything to help address this issue. 
   We can do something about it by passing legislation I've introduced, H.R. 1174, the Healthy Hospitals Act. My legislation would require hospitals to report infection rates. After all, people can find out if their airline is on time; why not be able to find out if your hospital is infection free. Nineteen States currently require reporting, and several other States are considering legislation. Medicare earlier this summer began denying hospitals reimbursement for hospital-related infections. 
   It is long overdue that Congress act. Let's standardize hospital reporting practices and fight hospital-related infections. I ask my colleagues to please cosponsor the Healthy Hospitals Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And I would also like to thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for assistance in putting a very important part into this bill. 
   Universities have no trouble finding parents when it comes time to ask for the tuition check. And, sadly, schools can find parents when tragedies occur, such as Virginia Tech, when it comes time to call a parent to give them bad news on what happened to their student. But one of the greatest fears parents have is their students' safety while they are at the university or college. And a while ago, when a gunman killed 32 people and wounded others, it was just one of the tragedies that occurs on campus. There are many other stories as well. 
   In my district in Pennsylvania, Charles and Debi Mahoney lost their son, Chuck, to suicide. And as he suffered from depression, his fraternity brothers, his ex-girlfriend, and college therapist, et cetera, all knew he was in danger and warned the college. But a legal barrier under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, known as FERPA, prevented the school from notifying Chuck's parents, who could have gotten him the help he needed. 
   Unfortunately, Chuck's story is not unusual. Each day an average of three college students commit suicide. While in college, 11 percent of men and 9 percent of women consider suicide. While they may not all act on their thoughts, we need to ensure schools are able to contact parents to get them the help they need not only for the safety of the child but also of others on campus. 
   Parents may be in the best position to help students suffering from significant mental illness by providing emotional support, medical history, coordinating care with various mental health and medical professionals, and long-term follow-up. Parents will be around long after the school is gone. 
   Today we are breaking down the legal barrier preventing schools from communicating with parents. Section 865 of the bill before us today is modeled after the Mental Health Security for America's Families in Education Act, H.R. 2220, which I authored. It will prevent future campus tragedies by requiring the Secretary of Education to clarify FERPA so schools can contact parents when a student is at risk of suicide, homicide, or physical assault. It will also protect schools acting in good faith from liability. 
   This is a good bill that will make college campuses safer. It will give families peace of mind.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, at least half of all cases of hospital-acquired infections are associated with medical devices. These medical devices include items ranging from tongue depressors to catheters and heart valves. 
   These preventable infections infect 2 million patients per year and end up costing 90,000 lives and over $50 billion annually. These are unacceptable costs for patients, taxpayers and Congress. 
   Up to this moment this morning, we already have over 1 million cases, you can see on this chart, 47,000 deaths and a cost of over $26 billion, and that's just as of today. 
   Yesterday we passed the Medical Device User Fee Act which included an amendment in there that I placed in that allows for the government, the GAO, to study these issues. They note that even after rigorous cleaning and sterilization, virus and bacteria still exist on reused medical devices. 
   Manufacturers, providers and facilities should take measures to reduce the rate of infections. I urge my colleagues to refocus our Nation's health care system on patient choice, patient safety and patient quality and join me in working on these things together where we can save lives and save money for our Nation.

   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I want the American men and women serving in Iraq to come home. I want this war to end. I want the violence to stop, the injuries to stop, the deaths to stop, and I also want terrorism to stop. 
   Over the last few weeks, many of my constituents told me these same feelings, their strong feelings in support of or against this resolution. 
   I hear your concerns. No one can doubt your love of your country. Like you, I am deeply concerned about the direction of this war. Like you, armed with the knowledge of the present, the strategies of the past were too often incomplete. The intelligence was misinterpreted or inadequate. 
   The comments made here today on this resolution will be listened to by Iraqis and al Qaeda and the soldiers in the field right now, the marines on the high seas headed that way, and the thousands who already are on the offensive. Here is my message to them: Arab countries have told us that if we left now the results would be catastrophic. I want those Arab countries to impress upon the Sunnis and the Shias the absolute need to work for peace now. I want the United States to actively engage in diplomatic efforts with all Arab nations. There is no more time for delay. I want the Iraqi military to step up and take over combat operations, to be the tip of the spear, and for our troops to shift our mission to training and support. I want to see the Iraqi Government stand strong where every group feels respected and protected and all feel they have a future of hope.     
   There is no time for delay. 
   I also want Republicans and Democrats to sit down together and discuss how to make these things come to fruition. I want us to review the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, to talk about which recommendations are worthy of implementation. I want us to thoughtfully, carefully and responsibly discuss not only what action we should take in Iraq, but to weigh the full consequences of any action and to offer real ideas, real strategies and real solutions. 
   I want this Congress to support our soldiers, every one of them; to tell them we value them and pray for them and their families and will give them what they need to do their job. I want all of them to know that we will stand with them until the last one returns home. And I want them to know that policy comes before politics, and that no poll, no political plan, no political threat should ever undermine our allegiance to doing what is right for our soldiers and our Nation. I want them to know that their work, their risks, their fighting, has meaning and purpose, and must be immune to the politics of Washington. 
   I want the soldiers and airmen from the 171st, the 99th and the 911th in Pittsburgh, and all our National Guard and Reservists and active duty to come home. I want their families to be able to embrace them, their children to be tucked in at night by them and our towns to be able to show the affection of a grateful Nation. But while they are there, while they stand sentry with eyes on the horizon, ride in their convoys or walk on patrol, I want their minds on the critical task of that moment. 
   I spoke this week to the mother of a soldier who was just killed in Iraq, Russell Kurtz. A finer and a braver man you will not find. I asked her what she thought about this discussion of sending more troops to Iraq, and she said, ``I would rather have more troops there helping my son.'' 
   Dom DeFranco, the Pennsylvania Commander of the VFW, wrote this letter to the editor of the Almanac Newspaper. I will submit the whole letter, but let me read this. He said, ``Even with their pride, honor and dedication motivating them patrol after patrol, bad morale can bring down even the toughest warrior. As a Vietnam veteran, trust me, it cuts deep. Regardless of where you stand on the current war on terror, troops get the message that they are wasting their time when politicians and citizens make headlines criticizing military action.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I include the entire letter for the Record.

   Sometimes active duty servicemembers don't have the luxury of knowing far in advance of when they will be able to leave, oftentimes having less than 24-hours' notice. And purchasing an airline ticket to get home can cost a family a fortune. Our troops deserve better, and Congress has twice asked airlines to give more flexibility for lower airfares for active servicemen and women. I have heard this over and over from soldiers that the airlines are not doing this. 
   When airlines have come to Congress asking for help with massive bailouts, we helped. Now it's time for airlines to help our most deserving brave men and women who protect our Nation and our Nation's skies. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting our troops and our families by cosponsoring the Heroes' Homecoming Act and help our soldiers get better fares when they're returning home.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, while Congress and our Nation is concerned about the crisis in our financial markets, it is important that we keep our ear to what the people of this Nation are saying. They're hearing words about liquidity, about the markets, about margins, there are even concerns about mortgage-backed securities. What they want to hear is the talk about three basic principles to get this Nation's economy back on track. 
   First and foremost is to protect the people--their nest eggs, their pensions, their homes. It is more important that we look at establishing that as the  base of what we should be working on and not simply talking about Wall Street and protecting millionaires there. It is what people have in their own funds, their own accounts that they want to make sure we're attending to. 
   Second is the issue of accountability. Most workers, most employers, most executives are good people, honest and decent, God-fearing, ethical people who are trying to do the right thing, whatever their job is. But there are also those who bend the rules, break the rules, ignore the rules, or create their own rules. This is what has gotten our Nation into this mess. And there has to be accountability, strong accountability to investigate and prosecute anyone who bankrupted their firms on Wall Street--or on Main Street--and then expect the taxpayers to pay for it. 
   Third, it is important that Congress, in the future, review the regulations carefully to close loopholes and to prevent further mismanagement and misconduct. 
   But there is a fourth principle which we have to make sure that we in Congress take care of, and that is to do something about our economy. 
   Over the last couple years, many times in this Congress we've debated and discussed issues where we could be boosting our economy. One of those has to do with health care. I have spoken many times about the $400 billion waste in our health care system each year, money that people pay out of their own pockets each month to pay for health care that we're wasting. We're spending money we don't have to try to protect our economy when we can save money on such things. In the health care area, for example, we waste $50 billion a year on health care acquired infections. We could be saving that money to make our hospitals accountable. Unfortunately, Congress has not acted on that. 
   We could save money by using electronic medical records or electronic prescribing to take care of the waste, fraud and abuse in our health care system, and we have far to go. But another major area where our economy can get going is to stop spending $700 billion a year on energy that we're purchasing oil and gas outside of our Nation.     
   Much of that, of course, several hundred billion dollars, is to go to OPEC. OPEC buys its lavish palaces, its beautiful hotels, its built islands, and unfortunately they also buy up our debt. We're going to owe them on our national debt for several years because they buy that up. And recognize also what OPEC is doing with that is not only are they owning our economy, they will own it for the future, they are also nations building weapons and threatening our national security and our economic security. 
   Oddly enough, while Secretary Paulson is asking us for $700 billion to help get Wall Street back on its feet, it's $700 billion a year we spend each year on energy. If we drilled our Outer Continental Shelf, if we went for the Colorado shale oil, if we looked at the North Slope of Alaska, while just drilling the Outer Continental Shelf alone would yield $2.6 trillion in Federal income. But we continue to set that off-limits. That does not include how much we could have in Federal income if we also use a shale oil in Colorado and also the North Slope of Alaska. 
   We put together a bipartisan bill. Congressman Abercrombie, Congressman Peterson and several of us worked and drafted a bill which unfortunately this Congress has ignored. It is not enough just to say we will open up by default these areas for oil drilling, because the oil companies know they won't invest in that because they expect Congress to once again pull the rug out from under them. 
   We have to take definitive action to get our economy back on its feet. So follow these principles. Protect people and their money, have accountability to those who did wrong, and work on reviewing the rules and regulations. But above all, I hope that Congress in these final waning days of this session does not continue to ignore how we could be boosting our economy and change it from the largest bust in our history to the largest boom in our economy. That is what we can do. That is what I still hold out some small ray of hope that our Nation can do.
