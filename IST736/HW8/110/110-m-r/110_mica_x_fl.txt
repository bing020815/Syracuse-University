<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (IN HONOR OF THE HONORABLE HENRY HYDE -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, one of the greatest voices to ever be heard in these Chambers has been lost to the ages. I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend, a great American and my former colleague, Henry Hyde. Tomorrow in Illinois, one of the State's most capable and eloquent Members of Congress will be laid to rest. 
   It was my distinct honor to meet Henry Hyde, to serve with Henry Hyde and to call Henry Hyde my friend. In this House Chamber over the past 150 years, there have been many who have spoken. I submit that if you had the privilege to hear Henry Hyde speak here, you were indeed most fortunate. 
   In this House of Representatives over the past several centuries, there have been many distinguished individuals. I submit that not only was Henry Hyde one of the most distinguished, but also one of the most appreciated individuals, one of the finest gentlemen, one of the greatest Americans to serve in this, the people's House. 
   Whether he was defending the unborn or relating his position to us on any matter before this House, Henry Hyde always spoke with dignity, conviction, principle and eloquence. When Henry Hyde addressed this House, its Members and all Americans listened. While everyone who knew Henry Hyde can tell us a very special story and personal experience about knowing Henry Hyde, there are several memories that I will always fondly cherish and remember. 
   I recall when Henry came to my district, came to my home in Florida. I will never forget when Henry Hyde stopped me, actually in this aisleway, here on the floor of the House, and in that aisleway he complimented me on my remarks that day. Imagine, Henry Hyde, the master orator, praising such common words. How honored I was by his compliment to so junior a Member on that day. There are many other stories I can tell about Henry Hyde and I know we can all share the other stories, but let me tell you in closing to relate one of my last memories of this great man. 
   I had the privilege of traveling with Henry to the United States European interparliamentary meetings overseas, and on my last trip with Henry to one of these meetings, one of the last times that Henry Hyde as I recall him serving as chairman of the International Relations Committee, we were flying together with others across the Atlantic to make our next day's meeting. I woke up in the middle of the night and everyone in the cabin on the plane was sleeping, with one exception, and that was Henry Hyde. Some of you may recall Henry had been quite ill towards the end of his service. He required assistance to walk, and I knew how uncomfortable and how difficult it was for him to travel. But here was Henry Hyde so committed to his responsibility, while in such great personal pain and discomfort that he could not rest, he had to sit up in his chair all night, but he was fulfilling his duties and his responsibilities. I knew that night and I knew when I first met him, I knew also when I first heard him, and I have known, and I have been honored to call him my friend, I have had the opportunity to know a great man, a great American, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde). 
   To Henry's wife and family, and on behalf of all the people of the Seventh Congressional District of Florida, and personally, I extend my deepest sympathies.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (THE ENERGY BILL -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, not only will the Americans receive a great surprise with a tax increase with the so-called energy bill that was just passed by the House of Representatives, and higher fuel costs; I want to announce, as the Republican leader on the Transportation Committee, you've also depleted the highway trust fund by some $2.1 billion in this measure. 
   The Congressional Budget Office is already predicting a $5 billion deficit in the highway trust fund by 2009. 
   Now, my friends in Congress, we can't keep this game up. Unfortunately, in the full year 2007 appropriations resolution that passed the House, we knocked another $3.47 billion and rescinded that from the highway trust fund, and another $3 billion recession from the highway program in the 2008 bill that passed the House recently. 
   Unfortunately, the game being played with our Nation's highway trust fund has consequences, and we will pay.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Again, I first have to compliment Mr. Oberstar. It has been a pleasure to work with him on this initiative. This is actually very historic in nature. The House of Representatives and the Congress has not passed an Amtrak reauthorization since 1997. That is 11 years. 
   One of the first things, when Mr. Oberstar and I met, when we took over the committee, I on the Republican side, he as the Chair of the committee for the new majority, we set some goals aside. One was to pass a WRDA bill, water resources, so our Nation would have water resources. We hadn't passed a bill in 7 years. And the last bill we passed was about a four or $5 billion authorization. We passed one for almost $24 billion, the first one, in, again, a long, long time. 
   We committed to try to reauthorize and authorize Amtrak, our national passenger rail service. And we have worked together. I have to compliment my colleague, Ms. Brown, who chairs the Rail Subcommittee, and also I want to thank the Republican side of the aisle, Mr. Shuster, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, who also rolled up his sleeves and worked diligently, and for that we were able to pass, by a very wide margin in the United States House, about a month ago, I think it was 311 votes, a very wide margin, Amtrak reauthorization. 
   Now we have an opportunity to take to conference, the other body, the Senate has passed legislation. What we are doing today is taking the Senate bill and we are adding the language from the House because we want to negotiate a bill that can become law and make the changes that the House voted on a month ago, and that we will get a chance to vote on again today. 
   It is my hope that many of the highlights and provisions of the House Amtrak reauthorization will be included in the final conference report, and that will be the measure that both the House and Senate vote on individually, and hopefully we can get the President to sign into law. 
   But the conference process also gives us a chance to make further improvements, even on what the other body passed and what we passed about a month ago, as I said, because it is important that we make good Amtrak reforms. And some things we have learned even since we passed legislation in the House. 
   We want to open the door to more competition. And in a time when we are struggling to find positive solutions to address the energy crisis that our Nation is facing, it is important that we look at transportation alternatives that are cost effective and that can improve passenger rail service, just not in one area, but across the whole country that we have responsibility for. 
   So the bill that we have before us, S. 294, will be amended, and it will have the text of the House bill that we passed, again, a month ago. But one of the most important provisions is something, again, that I have insisted on trying to do, and that is to drag the  United States, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century of high speed rail. 
   In the proposal that I crafted in the bill, and with the help of Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, and Mr. Shuster, what we have is a simple provision. And it says that the Department of Transportation can take proposals from the private sector to develop, to finance, to construct and to operate high speed rail service. 
   We do have a caveat that we want high speed rail service from Washington to New York in 2 hours, and we want stops along the way to service areas. Now, some folks say, well, we have Acela. Yes, we do have Acela, and Acela's come a long way, and had some difficulty in its implementation. But I am not going to go there. I don't want to talk about the past. I want to talk about the future. 
   And the future is, stop and think about this. Going just a few blocks from here, from Union Station to New York City, Center City to downtown Manhattan in less than 2 hours, with stops along the way. Now, think of how that would revolutionize travel in the Northeast Corridor and in the United States. 
   Why start there? Because that is the only corridor that Amtrak owns. Amtrak runs over 22,000 miles of rail track, but that 22,000 miles of rail track, with the exception of a little over 700 miles, is all on private freight rail. The only thing that Amtrak owns as far as right-of-way, the primary piece of real estate it owns, and one of the most valuable real estate assets in the world, if not the United States, is the Northeast Corridor. And that Northeast Corridor, right now the way it is constructed, with commuter service, freight service and Acela service, doesn't operate very well. 
   So what we are asking is the private sector to come in, give us the ideas on how we can have high speed rail. Give us the ideas. 
   Now, I always say, folks, that we are sitting on our assets; the Federal government is sitting on our assets. And that Northeast Corridor is a great public asset that we all have interest in, the taxpayers out there have interest in. So we can take that asset and we can maximize its utilization, both as a utility corridor, as a high speed rail corridor, as a better commuter service corridor and as a better freight service corridor. So we take that and we get a better return. We develop it so that we have jobs, we have construction, we have service between here and New York in less than 2 hours. Think about that. 
   Instead of going out to National Airport or to Dulles, waiting for an hour and then on the other end trying to commute back in. Think of the people that we take off of the road. Think of the change in the pattern of travel in the Northeast Corridor. And I can tell you, even with next generation air traffic control technology, this is the most important thing that will impact aviation congestion in our country, because 78 percent of all of the delays in our entire national air space system and in aviation in this country ripple from New York City's air space.     
   It's congested air space out to the rest of the country. When you can't get into New York or out of New York, the rest of the system goes down, and there is nothing, even next-generation air traffic control that can make planes fly that much closer, to solve this problem. 
   What we're going to have to do is go to a different system, and that system is high-speed rail. And I would like for Amtrak to do it by themselves, but they are running long-distance service, and they are running other services. And we think that it's our last hope to have the private sector come in, which Amtrak would have them do anyways, and give us proposals as to how we can maximize the utilization, separate the traffic, and get true high-speed service in that order. 
   So that's the proposal. As I said, Amtrak now chugs along at 83 miles an hour. It's almost embarrassing to call that high-speed rail. That's Acela, not the other service. It's 83 miles an hour. In the rest of the world, Europe and Asia, high-speed is defined as between 120 and 150 miles an hour on average. So we can do the same thing. There is no reason why the United States cannot do the same thing to maximize the developmental potential of the Northeast corridor, the most densely populated and valuable corridor in the Nation. 
   So I think, again, working with Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Mr. Shuster, we have a plan, we have a vision. We want the other body to go along with us. We think this is the way to go by substituting our bill this afternoon, and hopefully we can go to conference. Hopefully, we can go back to the American people and say we've done something that will impact energy, impact transportation, not just rail. Also, remember what I just said about aviation capacity in the United States, and we can do it all in this package. 
   This isn't an impossible dream. This is doable. 
   So I ask again that we give full consideration. I give full support, am pleased to join Mr. Oberstar in that effort as we change out the Senate bill 294, insert our legislation, and work with the other body again in bringing long-distance, high-speed, better passenger service rail service in not just the Northeast Corridor but with the reforms we've advocated for Amtrak for the whole Nation. We can do it. We must do it. And I look forward to doing it with Mr. Oberstar. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. If I may, I would yield myself the balance of the time on our side. 
   In closing, let me address a couple of comments that have been made. First, Ms. Brown was surprised to hear me speaking in favor of Amtrak reauthorization. And probably there are some people turning over in their graves that have since gone on to their higher rewards hearing me speak about that. But I have long been an advocate of public transit, transit alternatives, high-speed rail. 
   What I am not an advocate of is not good stewardship of the money that the hardworking Americans send to us. And people must realize we subsidize right now Amtrak to the tune of every single ticket sold to the tune of $50.12. Just take the number of passengers last year and divide it by the $1.2 billion given by Congress. So we've got to find a way to cut down that subsidization. We've got to find a way to actually get the most cost-effective transportation and make it available.     
   So it's not sometimes how much money we spend. It's how we spend it. 
   The reason I support this bill is because it has long-overdue reforms in it. Some of them deal with accounting and finance that Members don't want to hear about right now and mundane things. They may be mundane, but it will let us know what the bottom line is. 
   I come from a business background. I'm not an attorney. I want to know what the bottom line is, the cost, and we'll be able to determine the sum of Amtrak's finances, which we haven't been able to determine the costs in the past. We will be able to cut down that subsidization. 
   We will be able to bring in the private sector. Heaven forbid we should  have some of these routes--we can't tell how much they're costing us now exactly, and some routes, I hate to tell you exactly, some tickets are being underwritten as much as $300 per ticket according to the Government Accountability Office. 
   But that being said, how do we get the subsidization down and the relief for the taxpayers? And that's through some competition. This bill does provide, and the other body's also provided, for bringing in some competition. Let's see if it can be done for less, for a lower subsidy and cost effectively because we do want to provide transportation. 
   If you think people want transportation now, when we get through with this aviation crisis this year, they have already dropped 100 airports across the country or will drop by the end of the year in service because of high fuel costs. There will be an even greater demand for passenger rail service. 
   So we look at how we can do it most cost effectively. That should be the name of the game here, again, with these hardworking folks sending us their cash to expend it. 
   And this will never happen, even with the authorization. This authorization is a 5-year authorization, I believe in the neighborhood of $14 billion, give or take a billion here or there today, but $14 billion. Just do the math. If we're going from a $1.2 billion to a $1.9 billion subsidy and have $6 billion in backlog, plus they have debt, you can't make the kind of substantial improvements, say, for high-speed service that will cost billions of dollars. Only the private sector, in partnership with the Federal Government and again the State partners and others, can make that happen. 
   So that's the vision we have for making that happen, for putting in place the reforms that we need in Amtrak as far as its finances and getting better operations. 
   Let me also tell you an interesting thing I learned today. I never knew this. Today I was told that by authorizing this legislation for the first time in 11 years, listen to this, we will actually, by having authorization, the bond markets and finance markets will lower the amount that we have to pay, that the taxpayer has to pay, for the bonds and for the indebtedness that we already have for Amtrak. So we win again. Taxpayers will win again. We will have to pay less. We're paying about $300 million a year, I think, on bonded indebtedness in Amtrak, if my numbers are correct. So we win again with this reauthorization, those that are fiscal hawks like myself. 
   Finally, labor, how did somebody like a conservative Member from Florida sell this to some people in labor, and I said, When I came to Congress 16 years ago there were 28,000 people working for Amtrak. Today, there are 19,000 and the number is going down. Mr. LaTourette just talked about labor fighting with the Amtrak board to get their salary and wages when their brothers and sisters in the unions that represented the freight railroads were getting higher pay, better working conditions, better benefits, and settling with the private sector. They got it all. 
   So we can do that for people with the proposal that we have here, and we have the hope for more employment, a better transportation system, with benefits to the public and taking our asset, that asset that we're sitting on, the Northeast Corridor, and expanding it, making it something positive by any stretch of the imagination. 
   So with those couple of comments, Madam Speaker, I look forward to seeing high-speed rail because this will be a model, if we succeed in the Northeast Corridor, also for Speaker pro tem Tubbs Jones' communities that she serves, we can have a model, not just in the Northeast Corridor that Amtrak owns, but for communities throughout the Nation where it makes sense. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (AVIATION SAFETY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, first of all, I want to pay tribute to Chairman Oberstar, the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, whom I have had the honor of working with and leading the Republican side of the committee with him. And I might say that when Mr. Oberstar and I get to agree on moving forward a transportation initiative that's in the benefit of the Congress and the American people that things do happen, and this is a fine example of trying to take FAA and its safety measures and make them even better for the safety of the American public. So I commend Mr. Oberstar, Mr. Costello as the Chair of the Aviation Subcommittee, and Mr. Petri as our Republican ranking member all for working together. 
   I come to the floor today as the former Chair of the Aviation Subcommittee during six very difficult times of trying to take an industry that had a number of problems. I became the chairman in 2001, the beginning of 2001. When I came to Congress, Mr. Oberstar was the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee and did an outstanding job in his service. He was faced with challenges; I was faced with challenges. 
   Both of us, though, wanted to construct an FAA inspection system and safety system that assured the flying public that we had taken the very best measures and put them in place so that we would have a safe aviation national system. And I remember instituting early on and supporting the institution of a change in the way we did aviation inspection. What we did is we switched from sort of a we gotcha, we're-going-to-catch-you-if-we-can system or sort of a routine inspection system where it's Monday, we're going to inspect in Seattle at this aviation facility, or it's Tuesday, we're going to be in St. Louis, or it's Wednesday, we're going to be in New York and we are going to do these inspections whether we need to on a rotating basis or not. We switched to a somewhat controversial system of inspection of these aircraft called ``self-reporting.'' And some people don't understand that, but what we did is we said there are no penalties. Everyone would report incidents where there is some problem or they see some defect, something that should command attention and should be noted, and we had a reporting system. And that's the way we have operated with the self-reporting system. Some say it got a little too cozy, and probably when you repeat things and do things in a certain fashion, that does happen. It's part of human nature. 
   The reporting system is very important, though, because then we took and we adopted a risk-based inspection in going after problems. And since we have done that, ladies and gentlemen of the House, my colleagues, we have had the safest history for aviation ever in the United States and probably in the world. We instituted that. We put in some protections but probably not enough. 
   Now, as you know, in April of this year, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure held a hearing on the oversight of airline maintenance and brought to our attention, and through the investigative resources of the committee, we found lapses of proper attention, some conflict of possible interest, and some people who maybe got into too cozy a relationship. We held hearings on that, and as a result of that across the country, we asked that an audit be conducted. We wanted to see if what we saw in a limited incident or incidents was being repeated around the system. 
   The audit found that the United States carriers complied with more than 99 percent of the airworthiness directives sampled, and it's the remaining 1 percent that we want to make certain are addressed. So we instituted a new way of inspections. We instituted a new way of reporting. We found that we had some problems, and in this bipartisan effort, we are instituting corrective measures. 
   One of the things to deal with the cozy relationship is that we do establish a post-employment restriction for some of these FAA inspectors going back into industry for 2 years. I have some questions about the 2 years, but the other side of the aisle and the administration support the 2 years. I thought it might be a little bit too long. We will have to see how that works. It also requires that FAA principal supervisory inspectors rotate the office every 5 years, and we found also the cozy relationships, staying at one place, getting these relationships that sometimes might have a conflict of interest. We instituted that particular provision in this legislation. I have some questions about that too because it is difficult for these professionals and we want the very best to rotate and move their families around every 5 years, but we will see how that measure works. So those are the two questions that I probably have remaining. And what we have reached is a bipartisan accord. 
   But our intent here is to take a safe system where we found some problems and to correct it, institute some changes that will make certain that the system is even safer and that the problems that we have identified are corrected.  
   So I think this is an excellent measure. It shows what Congress can do working together to take a safe aviation system, make it even safer, correct some problems that we've identified, and make certain that the American public has the greatest confidence and that there are, in fact, measures being taken and having been instituted that will ensure that safety. 
   So with those comments, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, as we conclude the debate on H.R. 6493, which makes changes to the way we conduct FAA airline inspections and how we make certain that we have the safest aviation system possible, I believe that it is important to point out just a couple of things. First of all, since November of 2001, there has not been a single large passenger aircraft fatality in the United States. We have had several commuter airlines, smaller aircraft, I know at least one in Charlotte, another in Lexington, and any loss of life in any size aircraft is not acceptable. Some of those did not relate to the inspection. The reasons for the air crash or fatalities was not as a result of inspections or the procedures we have before us today. 
   What we do have historically is again instituted a self-reporting system, probably a half a dozen years ago we shifted to this system. We do collect that data. That data is supposed to be acted upon by inspectors on a risk base. So we look at the data where there is a problem. And that is where we put our resources to make certain that the aircraft is operating, inspected and mechanically sound. And that has worked fairly well. 
   We have, again, to reiterate what I said before, the committee did investigate when whistle-blowers came to us. We found an instance or instances of this cozy relationship, and we felt that we should take some steps to first eliminate sort of the revolving door, stop the revolving door, put some time between those that worked for the FAA and then going out to the airlines, and also instituting some other protective measures. 
   Now I must say that even when the inspector general of the Department of Transportation investigated what was going on and what we found, they did not find the problem systemic. What they did say was that the data that was being collected on which we based our inspections and assessed risk was not adequately being adhered to. That data and the information was not being adhered to by all levels of FAA, for example, management, and eventually the Congress. So we also changed in this bill the recommendation that the inspector general made when they found that, again, the problem wasn't just the revolving door, but paying attention to the red flags and the signals that were being sent by the data. 
   So this is a good bill. This is a bipartisan effort to take a safe system, make it even safer, make certain that those warning signs are paid attention to both by FAA at all levels, inspectors, managers in this self-reporting system, and also by Congress who has the ultimate responsibility. 
   Also, I might say that how did this affect folks? Well, when Congress started to say we weren't properly inspecting or there were conflicts, FAA said, we're going to give you inspections. And they did give us inspections. And we closed down thousands of flights. And hundreds of thousands of people paid the price. And the airlines paid the price to make sure that zero tolerance was applied and that we did inspect those planes. But that is not exactly what we want to happen in the future. 
   H.R. 6493 will help us to avoid any future mass airlines groundings like the ones we saw this spring and the horrible inconveniences suffered by hundreds of thousands of people in the traveling public. This is an important bill that will ensure our national aviation system remains the safest in the world and that FAA provides the proper oversight of airlines and their maintenance programs that are so important to that safety. 
   I commend Chairman Oberstar, Mr. Costello, Mr. Petri, who is not with us, our ranking member, the staffs that worked on both sides. This is a good bill. I support it. It will make a good system even better. 
   And I think with that, Mr. Speaker, to assist the House in moving forward with the business of the day, I will yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I must pay tribute to the chairman of our full committee, Mr. Oberstar, at this juncture. He began his remarks by saying this is a very historic occasion. And, indeed, for rail passenger service in the United States, this is a watershed moment. 
   I have been one of the harshest critics of Amtrak. I don't think I have ever voted for an Amtrak appropriation or authorization. In fact, we have not done an Amtrak reauthorization in Congress since 1997. And through the leadership of Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Mr. Shuster from Pennsylvania, today we have for the first time probably one of the most dramatic changes in rail passenger service proposed before the United States Congress in its history. This is really evolutionary because we have taken in a bipartisan fashion some of the desires, some of the ideas from the Democrat side, we have combined it with some of the ideas and initiatives proposed by the Republican side, and melded it into a piece of legislation. 
   Nothing could be more fitting to bring before the Congress today, on a day when gasoline has reached $4.05 a gallon across the United States on average, nothing that this Congress has considered to date that I know of will have a more dramatic, positive effect on the environment, and helping to change also the patterns of travel and the consumption of fossil fuel than this legislation proposed here today, and it is a bipartisan effort and I thank all of those involved for that. 
   Let me first address some of the concerns expressed by my administration. My administration has raised some concerns, one about the cost. Yes, the cost is higher; but for the first time we bring forward a program that doesn't just benefit Amtrak and an old Soviet-style train operation, it brings passenger rail service into the 21st century in the United States. It allows free enterprise and the best private sector initiatives to come in and help design, construct and finance high-speed rail service first in the Northeast corridor, but not just to the Northeast corridor, throughout the United States of America.     
   It takes ideas like Mr. Shuster brought forward also, also Ms. Brown contributed too, in taking some of the money-losing operations. And I've been a critic. We subsidize every ticket on Amtrak right now at $50.60, $50.60 for every ticket. 
   But what we do is we look at what the best solutions are, the best innovative private sector practices, and taking the money-losing operations and giving them a chance to succeed, to lower the cost to the taxpayers, and to provide service in public/private partnerships, and also partnerships with the State governments. Where we need service, we'll get service, and we have to help pay for service. 
   Now, people are saying this bill may be too much. That's bunk. $14 billion over 5 years? 
   I'll give you two projects, let me just give you two transportation projects that, one I visited a week ago in New York, a tunnel from Long Island Railroad down to Grand Central Station. $7.2 billion for one line.  
   The Federal Transit Administration just approved approximately $5 billion to extend 21 miles of light rail with the Dulles extension, 21 miles, $5 billion. Those two projects are equivalent to what we're talking about spending for a nationwide passenger rail system. 
   And also launching the first high-speed rail effort in the United States. Right now we don't have that. Amtrak Acela, they do their best, they run 83 miles an hour. But we need a dramatic investment in that route to get high-speed service. It's going to cost money, and Congress doesn't have to provide all the money. 
   Everybody finally woke up to the fact that, with the private sector involvement, we can create high-speed service, separate the traffic, improve commuter service in one of our most congested corridors. Commuters will do better, improve freight traffic. Freight traffic in the United States for rail moves at an average of 23 miles an hour. That's pitiful in a Nation like this. 
   So, finally, this proposal takes, I have a little diagram here. This is what we have across the country, from sea to shining sea. Congestion. And what we want to have is not just Acela, which runs at 83 miles an hour, the Japanese bullet train runs at 180 miles an hour. Maglev has gone 350 miles an hour. I've ridden it at 269 miles an hour. In China. That's where they have high-speed magnetic next generation technology. Not United States but in China. That's pitiful today. 
   What we do is we take an asset. Finally, this is an asset the public all owns. It's part of Amtrak. It's from Washington to Boston through New York City. 
   It's time that we stopped sitting on our assets. This is one of the most valuable assets that the public owns, that Amtrak owns, develop that to its maximum capability. 
   And finally, the benefits. We'll relieve northeast corridor congestion. We can take passenger cars and trucks off the highways. 
   The other thing is 75 percent of our delays in the air system that radiate throughout the entire United States start in the New York City airspace, in that Northeast airspace. So the first time we have a solution to deal with freeing up that airspace. It'll have positive economic development, reduce air pollution and emissions. 
   No project is more friendly to the environment than what we're proposing here today. We'll have reliable transportation alternatives, enhanced commuter and freight operations in that congested but important corridor. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MICA. Let me just conclude by again thanking folks. Around this place it is very difficult to bring new ideas forward. I've said in the past that sometimes trying to get a new idea through Congress is like giving birth to a porcupine. I can't say that this has been the easiest task we have undertaken, but we have given birth today to a new idea. 
   And the answer is not to just say ``no,'' or to zero out a program that is so essential to this country. The answer is to come up with a positive solution, a positive solution for energy. And today, again, when gas is $4.05 a gallon, this gives some little hope, but it is probably the biggest thing that we are going to do. And it will have the greatest positive impact on America's environment and its energy needs of anything we have done this session. 
   So I am pleased at this time to yield time to Mr. Oberstar. How much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I brought this chart that shows $4.05 a gallon gasoline today. That is the average national cost. In some jurisdictions it is more. This is not an energy policy. This is not acceptable to the American people, $4.05 a gallon gasoline. 
   First of all, I strongly support the manager's amendment. Contained in it are provisions that we would have high-speed rail service. We heard the gentleman, the former Governor of Delaware, Mr. Castle, the distinguished Representative now from Delaware, talk about having stops. I think when I visited Wilmington, when I visited Philadelphia and New York and stops along the way, people were excited about this proposal, because it offered them an option to expensive gasoline. 
   The proposal that we bring forward is revolutionary. It does allow the Secretary of Transportation to take proposals. The reason we took the Northeast Corridor first is because that is the only real estate and asset that Amtrak wholly owns, almost all of it all the way to Boston. There is a little bit between New York and Boston that they don't own. That is why we took the first leg of this high speed proposal from Washington, D.C., right down the block to downtown Manhattan. 
   We don't specify technology, but we say it must be there within 2 hours, and we have a provision that assures stops along the way. Revolutionary. Again, what it would do for air travel congestion would be monumental for this Nation. 
   This isn't limited to the Northeast Corridor, that first segment. Everyone has a possibility of doing that through the provision Mr. Shuster, Ms. Brown and Mr. Oberstar worked out. 
   We also have the possibility of opening for the first time public-private partnerships cutting the cost and the subsidy of some of the money-losing routes and bringing in private sector innovation. This whole attempt today, again, is revolutionary. 
   So, again, this outlines the high-speed rail proposal, and it shows that it is not just limited to Washington and to New York. It is open to the entire Nation, and it provides a cost-effective alternative to just saying no, to trying to zero out Amtrak, and to not having high-speed rail passenger service either in that corridor or any other corridor of the United States. 
   So I urge adoption of the manager's amendment and I urge passage of the final bill. I think most of the amendments are acceptable. We have a couple of questions on them. They will be debated here and Members will have to pick and choose between those amendments. But, all in all, this is a good, bipartisan effort to get us away from being dependent on $4.05 gasoline, escalating energy costs and limited choices for the traveling public. This is a very significant step forward, and I thank again Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown and Mr. Shuster.

   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I don't rise in opposition of the gentleman from Pennsylvania's amendment. In fact, he's looking for solutions in his district, in his area to provide commuter service to get people out of their cars to deal with increased congestion and high-rising fuel costs. 
   But the gentleman from Pennsylvania is no different from the gentleman from Connecticut, from the gentlewoman from Arizona, the gentleman from California, from the gentleman from Ohio. We're drowning in congestion in this country. This bill provides a first opportunity to look at cost-effective ways of providing that service. 
   So we've got to support commuter rail across the Nation. We've got to take some of these underutilized urban rail corridors that formally serve freight and convert those to commuter rail systems. We've got to find a host of solutions and incorporate private sector initiatives in these to make it happen because they can bring projects in on time and under budget and at the lowest cost possible. 
   It is true that we may have to subsidize commuter rail service, long-distance service, and some high-speed service, but we want that at the minimum cost to the taxpayer, the maximum benefit to those that we need to serve. 
   So we will support the amendment, but again, what you hear from the gentleman from Pennsylvania is what we're hearing from 435 congressional districts.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, I don't rise in opposition to the Former Vice President Protection Act; I appreciate the work that has been done by the committee on this measure. I don't come here to deride any of their efforts. It's legislation that we probably need to pass. 
   But I do have to say that I just returned from my district in Florida that extends all the way from the suburbs of Orlando to Jacksonville city limits and has the suburbs on the south of Jacksonville through six counties, 32 cities. I spent a wonderful weekend with my constituents, more than a dozen meetings, probably saw more than 1,000  folks this past weekend, enjoyed being home, Florida sun, actually, just a beautiful weekend. 
   But I have to tell you, my colleagues, from one end of my district, and my house is just within a few blocks of the southern border, all the way to the Jacksonville city limits, traveling through most of those six counties, not one person came to me and said, Mr. Mica, go back to Washington, pass the Vice Presidential Protection Act. But I will tell you that everywhere I went there was one thing on people's mind, and that's the cost of energy. 
   With the storms, our heart-felt thoughts and prayers go to the people of Texas and all the area that was hit along the coast and up through the heartland of America this past few days. Another natural disaster, my area was hit some time ago by three hurricanes. We have had tornadoes, and we have had floods. We all have to deal with those. 
   From that hurricane that we saw hit the coast, that had immediate impact in that we had, unfortunately, some price adjustments, some price gouging by people taking advantage of the situation with just the slight turnoff of the refineries and delay and production of energy. 
   As I traveled up and down my district, some of the gas stations closed early. Many of them had plastic bags over the lower cost grade of fuel. People were concerned about energy. 
   I am not talking about people, and I have some very wealthy people on the south end in the suburbs and in the north end, that don't have to worry about $4 and $5 fuel costs per gallon. I am talking about working men and women, single parents, people struggling, retirees that are trying to pay their bills. 
   Again, none of them talked to me about passing a vice presidential protection act, but they said, Congressman Mica, go back to Washington, and whether the cameras and lights are on, and whether the gallery is full or empty, whether the press is here, or whatever the subject, you bring, as our elected representative to the people's House, the House of Representatives, our concern that we want our government, our Congress, our House of Representatives and the United States Senate to act to pass a comprehensive energy plan. 
   Now, they get it out there. They understand that Congress has that responsibility, and it has the ability to do that. 
   Now, I served as a leader of the Transportation Committee, and let me tell you how quickly this place can work if it wants to. I have agreed with Mr. Oberstar, my Democrat counterpart. He is the Chair of the Transportation Committee; I am the Republican leader. I agreed on a Friday to introduce legislation which we agreed to, again, on a Friday. On a Monday, we introduced it in the House. On a Tuesday, we passed it through the House of Representatives. On a Wednesday we passed it through the United States Senate. On a Thursday night at 7 o'clock, the President signed it into law. 
   After 9/11 we came together in a national emergency. Now, we didn't have a terrorist hit, but we had a national emergency. Our people are hurting, people are hurting. It's the folks that the other side of the aisle claim to be trying to be the advocates for, and they have been standing in the way. 
   I have been around this place for more than two decades. I come from the most bipartisan family since 1889 to serve in the House of Representatives. I have never seen the House closed or Members denied the opportunity to discuss in a time of national crisis, and we have a crisis on our hands. Energy is not only affecting the price of gas, if you haven't been to the supermarket lately, my friends in the House, anyone who is in elected office who may not get to the supermarket, I advise you to get to the supermarket and see the sticker shock that the same folks are seeing, exorbitant prices at the fuel pump people are paying for average goods just to try to keep food on their table. 
   So we have a crisis. I have never seen a time when we weren't even allowed to bring an issue that would deal with a crisis, and here we know need a comprehensive approach. It's not just drilling, although I have a record way back to my days on the floor of the legislature of promoting responsible exploration, development of our domestic resources. 
   Sometimes it was a pretty lonely caucus that I belonged to. I was the only member from the Florida delegation, Democrat or Republican, to support us keeping energy independent in a responsible manner. Maybe I was ahead of my time, but I didn't want us to become dependent on foreign energy. That's where we are right now. 
   They have got us right where they want us. When you have a natural disaster, like we had this weekend, it drives speculation. It drives the cost up. It drove the availability up, because there is nothing like driving to a gas station and seeing a plastic bag over all of the pumps and no fuel available. 
   I am disappointed. Again, I don't want to detract, what this committee is doing is a responsible act, but no one asked me to come here to pass a Vice Presidential protection act. But I am telling you, they told me to come back to Washington to, to stay in Washington, to work in Washington, and, in a bipartisan fashion, to pass all of the above. 
   They get it, it's drilling, and we are not talking about the politics of drilling, and I have seen the politics of drilling in my own State of Florida for years. That was bad politics, and it got us in this bad situation. 
   What we need to do with extracting oil or gas or natural resources from off our shores is use the latest technology and base our exploration and development on sound science and good practices that do not harm the environment. Don't tell me you can't do it, you can do it. We can do it. We can extract it. 
   Why should we be dependent on the Mid East, Nigeria, Venezuela, and other foreign sources of energy? Folks, it doesn't make sense. 
   But you know what? The American people got it. They have been busy out there. They are trying to raise a family. They are trying to put food on the table. They are trying to send their kids to school. They are struggling to keep their jobs in a depressed market right now, and all they want is a little help from the people they sent here to do their job. 
   They get it about drilling. They get it about alternative sources. You know, just drilling isn't going to do it, and just developing our resources, which we can do, and we can do it in an expedited fashion. But they know the long-term fix is to get off that, to have alternative fuels. 
   I submit that the proposal by the Republicans, the American Energy Act, does just that. It's all of the above. Somehow we have gotten it. 
   Now we can't afford a sham in coming forward, and you know, some people are looking for political cover. They have an election around the corner. We have got to have a vote on something to make it look like we are doing something. But that does not solve the problem. 
   I plead, on behalf of those people that I saw this weekend in the Seventh Congressional District, to do something meaningful, to do a comprehensive energy act. It will start to solve some of our problems. 
   We can start becoming energy independent. We can lower the price of fuel and food that people depend on to feed their families. Then we can start building this economy again. The great opportunity that I have had in the last year and a half, leading the Transportation Committee, is not just see the projects and things going on in my district, but see the magnificence of this country from sea to shining sea. 
   This is an incredible country, and there isn't any challenge that we have never been able to undertake and also win at. We are creative people. We can do it. 
   All those people out there that are working so hard, sending their money here, relying on us to do something, to be their representative in this governing body that has so much say, let's just do our job. Put the politics aside, put November aside, put these people forward. That's all they are asking is for us to do our job.     
   So I stayed here when the lights went out last week until I had the opportunity to speak, and C-SPAN was turned off and the Speaker had left and  the place was closed down. I came back early today to tell you that they did not ask me, not one of them, to pass the Former Vice President Protection Act, but they did ask me, please do something about our energy, Mr. Mica. You are our Representative. Go back there and tell them that we need their help to get the economy going, to get this situation under control so we can give a great opportunity to our children, to our hopes and dreams for this great country. 
   I know we can do it. I know we can do it. Our predecessors have done it. I don't know why we are not doing it. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Chairwoman and Members of the House, normally I would be supportive of this legislation. I have tried to work in a bipartisan manner with Mr. Oberstar and other members of the committee on both sides of the aisle.  
   The underlying bill is basically a good bill. It does provide funding assistance to State revolving funds. However, the bill as reported out of the committee, I voted against it. I will vote against it again if it contains a Davis-Bacon provision. We will have an opportunity with an amendment offered by Mr. Baker and Mr. King that would repeal the provision that is put in the bill as it came from the committee. 
   Currently, 18 States have no prevailing wage law. My State, Florida, and 17 other States will be dramatically impacted. And, actually, what will happen is the opposite of what we will want to have happen: instead of having more money, we will have less money for these important projects. 
   This is an unprecedented expansion of Davis-Bacon requirements as they relate to the Clean Water Act. In fact, this is a mandate, and I call it ``The Mother of All Unfunded Mandates,'' which is in fact sort of an earmark to Big Labor interests and a payback to Big Labor. It is unfortunate that, again, those that will suffer are the States and local governments and the intent of this legislation, which is to provide wastewater funds. 
   And, finally, I hate to say it, but I have a statement from the administration. The President will veto the legislation if it contains the Davis-Bacon provisions. 
   So I urge Members to support an amendment by Mr. Baker and Mr. King to strike that language from this legislation, and let's pass legislation without this onerous provision.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me that time. 
   I just wanted to clear up a couple of statements that have been made and misconceptions that have been made. 
   First of all, from the other side, we did hear that this in fact is a Federal mandate, and I did refer in my opening remarks that this is in fact the mother of all unfunded mandates, because it does in an unprecedented fashion with the Davis-Bacon provision that is included in this bill expand the provisions of Davis-Bacon in, again, a fashion that has never been done before in this program. Mr. King spoke a little bit about this. 
   I think we all ought to clean up our water and have the best wastewater treatment possible. We do want to fund this program, but we want to do it in a responsible fashion. 
   But, again, what is unprecedented here, and the Members of the House of Representatives from some 18 States, let me read those States, Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, the Representatives from those States will have to go back over this weekend and next week and tell their constituents that they voted for this unfunded mandate, this unprecedented mandate on the use of their State revolving funds. 
   Now, if we are just talking about imposing this on Federal money, that is one thing. But the unprecedented part about this is they are imposing this, first of all, on repayments. It has never been done before. On interest into the State revolving loan fund, they are going to impose this, and also on the State match. 
   So what happens here is we put money in with good intention, you put more money in, and you get less in return, and we impose this mandate. We have tried not to impose mandates on our local governments. 
   So that is our objection to this, and that is the administration's objection to this. 
   We have no objection to providing assistance and a partnership with our local governments and State revolving wastewater treatment activities. That is a good thing. But what we are doing here is a bad thing. It is setting a precedent and imposing an unfunded mandate on our local governments, which we shouldn't be doing even with their money, their repayments, their interest and their match. It is setting a horrible precedent. 
   So I would like to be for this bill. I would like to vote for this legislation. But I can't support it if we don't adopt the Baker-King amendment that takes this provision out. 
   To those of you who come from those States, and I am from one of them, Florida, I can't go back and say I have done this to you when I am trying to do something for you. 
   With those comments, I do want to clarify the unprecedented mandate that this is imposing. It is a big earmark for big union bosses. Our folks at the State and local levels are going to have to pay the price. I don't want them to have to pay that price.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, and my colleagues, this debate is a perfect example of why we have an energy crisis in the United States, a lot of people talking about energy and not using many facts. 
   I rise in strong support of the gentleman from Pennsylvania's amendment here to open up gas exploration and extraction of natural gas wells up to 25 miles, I guess would be the limit he proposes. 
   Let's just go back in history. I was in the Florida legislature on the Select Energy Committee in the State House when we had gasoline shortages and cars lined up. I voted to drill in the Everglades. My opponents remind me about that all the time. 
   Did you know we still drill in the Everglades? We do it safely, and we're taking oil out of the Everglades without any harmful effects on the Everglades or the environment. 
   You hear fear, not facts, being proposed here. Damage to the economy. Well, back in the 1990s I participated in a 100-mile set off, and we set that as the policy. That's back in the 1990s. 
   The technology we have today in extracting natural gas and oil, and this is about natural gas. It's not about oil, but the same holds true. We won't even go into the oil extraction. 
   But we have technology today they didn't even dream about a decade ago. Off the coast of Scandinavia, they're taking out oil and natural gas. They're using technology. There's nothing above the surface of the water. Twenty-five miles, you won't see that. 
   Some of the proposals for wind, I challenge you to go to Scandinavia, to some of the other places where they have these huge windmills and see the visual pollution that is created. So it can be done. We have the technology to extract it. 
   Let me give you the irony of Florida and the history again. So we came back here, and this isn't just a Republican, Democrat issue, people talking about something they know nothing about. We had a Governor Bush, we had a President Bush, and they argued over it and we changed the areas that were eligible for extraction. When you drill for oil, or in this case, gas, it costs you hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to drill. 
   Are you going to drill when you're playing this hokey-pokey, first we put our right foot out then we put our left foot out. It's going to be 100, it's going to be a 120, it's going to be 150 or you can't do it. 
   No. It's absolutely incredible that we have a vast supply of natural gas right off of Florida. We can do it; we have the technology to extract it. We built a billion-dollar pipeline, a billion-dollar pipeline. We can't hook up to it. We have the supply. 
   The trade deficit, nobody's even talked about the trade deficit. Most of the trade deficit is importing oil. Look at the huge part of it. So we're bankrupting the United States, sending our resources overseas. 
   We've got this in our back yard. It's clean. In Florida, during the 1990s, the Clinton policy for the country was to go to natural gas for energy production for our power plants. Twenty-eight of 34 electrical power plants planned from Florida are designed for natural gas. Now we're switching back to coal and oil. What a crazy, mixed-up policy. 
   And here the gentleman from Pennsylvania offers us an opportunity to tap into a clean resource that doesn't emit these gas emissions that are detrimental to the environment and, again, this nonsensical debate that takes place. 
   Stop the politics. We had the gentleman from Florida a few minutes ago. Cuba, 90 miles. Within 45 miles the Chinese will soon be drilling for energy  resources. What a goofed-up debate and policy. 
   Shame on us. And the American people are paying. Wait till they get their bills. It's not going to get better, folks. 
   They said, well, we'll just wait for some other technology. We have this here. Solar and wind and all these other things are necessary, and we should use them. I'm a big fan of nuclear, but we have a proposal before us that makes sense. Let's adopt it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, I had the honor and privilege of chairing the House Aviation Subcommittee for some 6 years. I inherited that responsibility some months after September 11 and concluded my service as the Chair of that important subcommittee January of this year. I now am the ranking member on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 
   Just by way of my background, I have been involved in both the creation of TSA and the evolution of TSA over these years, and, trying to make certain, as I know Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite is doing, Representative Nita Lowey is trying to do, and I think they are very well intended and actually I hope to work with them, I just found out about this proposal coming up today last night, and I do pledge to work with them to try to make their intent the most effective intent, protecting the American public. And I know that is what Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite does. That is her intent. And I think that is Mrs. Lowey's intent here. 
   But what we have got to do is make certain that we aren't doing something that really won't achieve the results. And I think the normal screening of workers, as it has been done as we screen passengers, would not be that effective. So I have no objection to a demonstration project, but I think what we need is one that is sophisticated to try to deal with finding out what the bad intent of supposedly good aviation system workers may be.     
   Most of what we have at the airport today, I hate to tell you, the technology does not deal with the current threat. The current threat is not someone taking a gun or a weapon, as we traditionally know it, through airport screening checkpoints. In fact, USA Today has shown even how flawed this system is, in revealing some of the results of taking through not only those type items but also other items that may pose a risk today. 
   The problem we have is people with bad intent who obtain employment in this industry can do great harm. What we need to do is focus the screening on going after that bad intent, because once they get past the worker screening or passenger screening point, a worker has access to chemicals, substances, tools, a treasure trove of items that can be used to take down an aircraft, and that is what we want to prevent. 
   So I am not going to try to kill this measure. That is not my intent. In fact, I didn't come out here to call for  a roll call vote on this. But what I would like to do is work with them to see that their intent, which is to make certain that workers who may pose danger to the system, we find a way to screen them that would be most effective in protecting our passengers. 
   The worst thing we can do, and I will tell you this, I helped create the Department of Homeland Security, I helped author the TSA bill. But TSA and the Department of Homeland Security is 177,000 employees. I compare it to sort of like pigeons you may see in a plaza, and when Congress claps its hands, they will all fly off in whatever direction we send them, but it may not always be the best-intended. 
   I give you one final example. We ban lighters from being carried onboard aircraft. We ban lighters, but we didn't ban cell phones or cameras with a battery. Here's my cell phone. This is much more dangerous as an ignition electronic device than any lighter that you can carry onboard. 
   So sometimes we do things here with good intentions, like the lighter ban, but they may not have the results we would like to achieve. So I came here to tell both of the sponsors I appreciate what they are trying to do, but I think we can take and craft their demonstration project into a demonstration project that truly screens workers in a way that will be beneficial to catch the potentially bad players and that we can make this system safer. 
   So I compliment you on your well-intended efforts. I pledge to work with you, and we will take it from there.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First of all, I too want to welcome back Mr. Oberstar. Mr. Oberstar, he and I have had the great experience of working since 15 years ago when I came to Congress. He was chairman of Aviation. I became the ranking member on the Republican side when he became Chair of the committee. 
   We had a great year. We probably passed more legislation than any other committee. We passed an historic water resources bill. We actually did, I think, the 107th override of a Presidential veto. We agreed in a bipartisan fashion to invest in our Nation's infrastructure. I am sorry Mr. Oberstar wasn't here to see that glorious day. 
   It is very lonely not having either him fighting with you or not having him here to fight with. But we are pleased he is back, and hopefully had an experienced Republican physician doing all those titanium additions to his spine. But he looks great and we are pleased to have him here. 
   I am also pleased that through his leadership, and a joint bipartisan effort, and I wrote him on December 5, and I will include this letter as part of the RECORD, saying while I oppose taking other measures out of the pending FAA reauthorization, I want to keep the pressure on, we need to pass that bill, that there is a particular provision whose interest is paramount to that legislation, and that is doing away with an obsolete and unfair FAA mandatory retirement rule that every day is penalizing our pilots. In fact, more than 50 of our Nation's most experienced pilots of commercial airliners are forced to retire. 
   Now, this bill is entitled the Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act. I would like to also give a personal example of why I think this is important. The title is important. I might even want to amend the title in honor of one of the guys I went to college with, a buddy of mine. His name is Bob Fobes. 
   Most people in Congress don't know Bob Fobes, but Bob and I were fraternity brothers, went to the University of Florida. Let me tell you, there is nobody more devoted as far as a pilot. I think the only thing that Bob is devoted to, other than his wife Laurie and his family, is flying, and Bob has not failed on any occasion to mention to me that he is going to be affected by this particular outdated rule that was passed nearly a half a century ago when males and females didn't live as long as they do in our society. 
   So we are addressing something that personally affects folks like Bob Fobes and thousands of other pilots who are dedicated to one of the great professions that has given the world and America in particular a magic carpet to get around to places that people would not have even imagined they could be 50 years ago. 
   As of November 2006, we also know that foreign airline pilots are allowed to fly up to age 65, so our counterparts across the Atlantic are doing this. The U.S. sets up a double standard, unfortunately, and I think it is a disadvantage to the flying public to, again, not have our most experienced individuals in the cockpit and being able to fly. 
   As Chairman Oberstar pointed out, there are additional protections here for the flying public that these individuals will be subject to, even more medical exams, making certain that they are fit and capable even in these additional years that we grant. 
   The Freedom to Fly Act, H.R. 1125, was introduced earlier into the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee by one of our outstanding leaders in aviation, also a pilot, Robin Hayes, the gentleman from North Carolina, and he has 313 bipartisan sponsors on his legislation. Robin  Hayes cannot be here, so I also wanted to give credit to not only Chairman Oberstar, Mr. Costello and Mr. Petri, but also Robin Hayes, who has worked tirelessly to make certain that this legislation and this particular measure comes before the House. 
   This is the right thing to do at the right time. I would like to thank again all those who have been involved, and some of the staff members on both sides of the aisle who helped bring this measure forward. I encourage Members to vote ``yes'' on this very sensible and desperately needed legislation.  
   House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
   Washington, DC, December 5, 2007. Hon. JAMES L. OBERSTAR, Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC.

   Mr. MICA. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, I want to thank our chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, my Democrat counterpart, Mr. Oberstar, for his work on this piece of legislation that does deal with some of the issues that we are facing right now and follows some of the discussions that we have had on the floor relating to energy and energy conservation. 
   The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has a very small piece of the puzzle, but it is nonetheless an important piece and we have tried to exercise our jurisdictional responsibility in coming forth with this, again, small piece of the puzzle. 
   This bill does provide for expansion of some of the transit grants around the country, and I think that there are some beneficial provisions for those in rural areas, suburban areas, and for much of the public that relies on public transportation. 
   This bill further does allow sort of an unprecedented ability to use some of the money traditionally used for projects to assist some of the local transit authorities that are suffering now with high fuel costs. Just like the average family is suffering with high fuel costs, transit agencies have also experienced the same problem. They are cutting back on services, sometimes when people really need to have an option and don't have that option, by cutting out routes, and that has been announced even in my area. So I think we are doing a responsible thing. 
   This is a 2-year authorization. It is an expansion of the authorization of $1.7 billion that does give some of the folks on my side some hiccups, but it is authorization, it is not appropriation and each Member is going to have to judge their support or opposition based on the final product. But I have joined Chairman Oberstar in support of this authorizing bill. I think again it fills our small piece of the puzzle. 
   I did want to take just a minute or two, I didn't get a chance to speak on the rule or on the energy legislation that was before the House earlier, and there was quite a bit of banter. And some people were bashing the President and this administration for not having a plan. In fact, someone said he didn't recall a plan, which is kind of funny. 
   I am very fortunate to have outstanding staff, but this summer I also have some outstanding interns. They come from all over the country to Congress, and I have gotten some from my district and elsewhere. So you have a little more staff to do research rather than just keep on the track that we are on here every day. I said wasn't there a Bush plan? And all be darned, there was a Bush energy plan. So I had a little research done on that. 
   Lo and behold, very shortly into his term, it was May 17, 2001, the President of the United States, George Bush, just a few months into office, he set two major priorities, one being education. You remember on 9/11 he was in a Florida classroom talking about his plan to improve education. But even before that, in May as one of his first priorities, he announced his plan. He announced his plan actually in the home State of the chairman, in St. Paul, Minnesota. On that day when he announced it he said, ``If we fail to act, our country will become more reliant on foreign crude oil, putting our national energy security into the hands of foreign nations, some of whom do not share our interests.'' 
   On that same day when he announced his plan, he said regarding part of his plan, ``We will underwrite research and development into energy-saving technology. It'll require manufacturers to build more energy-efficient appliances. We will review and remove obstacles that prevent business from investing in energy-efficient technologies.'' 
   Furthermore, President Bush said, ``The second part of our energy plan will be to expand and diversify our Nation's energy supplies. America today imports,'' and now this is May of 2001, ``America today imports 52 percent of all of our oil. If we don't take action, those imports will only grow. As long as cars and trucks run on gasoline, we will need oil, and we should produce more of it at home.'' 
   The President called for burning coal more cleanly, expanding nuclear power, and drilling for new oil in new places, that included the Arctic area in Alaska. The President said that is banned now, but the President said it can be done safely. 
   Listen to this one. This is the President in St. Paul. ``ANWR can produce 600,000 barrels of oil a day for the next 40 years. What difference does 600,000 barrels a day make? Well, that happens to be exactly the amount we import from Saddam Hussein's Iraq. We're not just short of oil; we're short of the refineries that turn oil into fuel. So while the rest of our economy is functioning at 82 percent of capacity, our refineries are gasping at 96 percent of capacity.'' 
   That was part of the President's plan, and how prophetic could you be. This was before 9/11. This was in May of 2001, announcing his plan. 
   I can't take up all of the time, but I have Mr. Gephardt's response: Congress will take action to stop them. Mr. Kerry vowed to filibuster, and the Sierra Club is already running ads against it. Those were some of the responses. 
   It is interesting how quickly we forget that there have been plans, and those plans could have made a big difference. 
   Here today we are trying in a bipartisan fashion to make a small difference to give some of our Federal employees outside the Capital Beltway the opportunity to have the same transit advantages and payments that we give within the Beltway to Federal employees outside, expand some of the grants for transit, and also help some of those transit operations that are suffering like the American family is with cutbacks because of high fuel costs. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Well, again, I have to compliment Mr. Oberstar, and folks have to look at what we're doing here this afternoon. This is the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. We can't solve all the energy issues. We have a very small piece, and we're trying to take care of that small piece here today. 
   We don't get into some of the other issues that have been raised, but I must say that I'm going to be going back to Florida tomorrow, and I'll be talking to folks. And you know, it doesn't take you long to talk to folks at home and have them get your attention. And they are getting our attention by saying, what are you doing about $4 a gallon gasoline, what are you doing about energy costs that are soaring, what are you doing about the price of food and other things that are being affected by energy costs. 
   The people who are on a limited income, God bless them. I don't know how they're making it, or a fixed income, with the prices that they see both at the pump, at the store, in their lives. They want answers. 
   I'm sorry that some of the other committees are not acting and the Congress is not acting like the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, because when I go home I have to tell them that how things are left in their Congress was that we took care of a small piece. We provided transit grants for those Federal employees working outside of the Beltway. We provided additional grants through eight transit companies who are hurting because of increased fuel costs and trying to expand transit service that people are becoming reliant on now because of the high cost of fuel. But I can't tell them that I've done anything about supply, that, again, the supply has been cut off. 
   I even agree with the child that's crying in the gallery. People are not happy about this. They want a response from this Congress, and this Congress has the ability to act to increase the supplies so we're not reliant on reliable friends like Venezuela, the sheiks and leaders in the Middle East, and that dependable source of energy, Nigeria. 
   Folks, that isn't going to cut it for an answer when we get home, and this isn't complicated. It's a question of Economics 101. This is a question of supply and demand. Right now, in the short-term, we need to increase supply. If we had worked together over the past 7 years from that introduction by President Bush some 7 years ago, one of his first plans--and I cited his rollout statements, and let me just read also what he said on May 17. 
   President Bush said: ``Too often, Americans are asked to take sides between energy production and environmental protection--as if people who revere the Alaska wilderness do not also care about America's energy future; as if the people who produce America's energy do not care about the planet their children will inherit. The truth is energy production and environmental protection are not competing priorities. They're dual aspects of a single purpose--to live well and wisely upon the earth. Just as we need a new tone in Washington, we also need a new tone in discussing energy in the environment, one that is less suspicious, less punitive, less rancorous. We've yelled at each other enough. Now it's time to listen to each other and act.'' 
   Again, these are the words of our President before 9/11 on the energy issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Again, this is an important debate. It's a little piece of the big national debate that's going on now. Mr. Oberstar and I lead the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. We came forward with this measure. This measure is within our jurisdiction, as I said earlier, and it is just a small piece of the puzzle. 
   Many Members come to me on my side of the aisle and ask me how I am going to vote, and I am going to support this legislation. It does increase the authorization. That's a fairly substantial piece of change by any estimate, $1.7 billion over 2 years, and it does make some significant changes in policy, in opening up authorization to spend money to help transit companies and agencies that are suffering like the American public is suffering with high fuel costs, and I think that's a good thing. It expands some services for mass transit, which is also a good thing. And it also expands from just within the beltway to other Federal employees the benefits of using public transportation, and that's a good thing too. 
   This is general debate, and we have gotten into general debate, and I have heard the distinguished majority leader speak and he quoted George Soros. I don't use him as a quote too much or rely on him for my opinion seeking, but I did just happen to have some sources that quote the American public and their opinion. 
   The Los Angeles Times Bloomberg Poll said when all registered voters are asked whether they support increased exploration for oil and natural gas, 68 percent respond in the affirmative, and that was just within the last 2 days. Rasmussen reports, according to them, 67 percent of the American people support oil drilling off the Nation's coasts and 64 percent think it will lower gas prices. Now, they seem to get it. The other committees with jurisdiction and the rest of Congress don't seem to get it. 
   Now, don't tell me you can't do it. I mean this is an incredible institution  and can do anything. We represent the greatest ingenuity, the greatest people that ever walked the face of the Earth. God blessed this Nation so much, and we are the custodians of coming here and doing things. 
   Now, Mr. Oberstar and I on a Monday introduced a piece of legislation. We worked together on it, and within the same week on a Thursday night, we had the President of the United States at 7 o'clock at night sign the legislation as is. So we can do these things that the American people want. 
   Now, 1 week from tomorrow, people are going to try to celebrate Independence Day in this great country, this great country for which so many people made so many sacrifices, and I have to go back home and tell them I increased transit grants for Federal employees outside the beltway and I also helped transit agencies who are suffering like they are to pay their fuel bill, but I don't have an answer for them. That's not what they want to hear, folks. This is the Congress of the United States, and we can and we must do better. 
   I have been here going on my 16th year, not as long as Mr. Oberstar. He knows transportation inside and out and he's an expert renowned on a whole host of issues, but the good thing about being here just half as long as he is that you hear some of these things. 
   First, we're going to solve this problem; we'll tax it. So what do they do? They say, windfall taxes for the oil companies that are taking advantage. Windfall taxes, that's it. So first we'll tax it. 
   Well, that didn't work. People come up to me, did you ever hear of a time when you tax something and the price goes down for consumers? Duh. Well, that didn't work. 
   So now there's speculation; so we'll get 'em. We'll regulate. We're going to regulate those speculators. That'll take care of it. 
   Madam Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I have left.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Oh, good. So I can tell this story, Madam Chairman. 
   This reminds me of sitting on a committee coming here, and this took over some time. We always hear about high drug prices, and I sat on the committee, and everyone was railing about the price of vaccination drugs. So we dragged in the drug companies to sit them down, and I remember this guy who represented a drug company, and this was an investigative hearing. And he showed a little vial, and he said, this vial of vaccine, this medicine, only costs about $2 to produce. So we hammered him. It only cost $2 to produce, but he said that the liability on it was reaching $30, so $30 and increasing. 
   So then we dragged in the insurance company. ``You're charging them $30 for this vaccine?'' We hammered them. So they left. 
   And then the next thing we knew was we weren't producing any vaccine in the United States because no one would insure it. So the next hearing we held--remember this, now, folks--the next hearing we held was on its now being produced in Great Britain and we had some bad batches. Well, we hadn't sent enough FDA inspectors over to inspects the batches there. 
   Folks, these aren't the answers: additional taxation, additional regulation, chasing business off our shores. And the same thing isn't going to happen with energy. The American people get it. I just read the poll. It doesn't take a lot, folks. They know if you increase the supply, the price will go down. And we have the capability of doing that. We built the Alaska pipeline in 3 years. 
   Next Friday is Independence Day. It's going to be a sad Independence Day because instead of America's being independent, we will be dependent on energy. That's affecting all of us, and it's not right. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MICA. I claim the time in opposition, but I do rise in support of the manager's amendment. I particularly find most attractive in this measure the provision that would allow grant funding to subsidize increased full costs for some of our transit systems in the country. 
   My support is not based on some lobbyist from a transit agency in New York or Washington or Orlando. My support is based on probably a little lady whose face I have never seen, but she wrote me and said, Mr. Mica, she said, They are going to cut one of the routes and I have no other way to get to work, and I am a constituent in your district. They are going to cut off those routes because of the higher fuel cost. 
   So the reason I support this is because someone in my district is being dramatically affected. It may not be a big deal here in Congress, but I can assure you in that lady's life, if she can't get to work and make a living, it's a big deal to her. So that is why I support this manager's amendment and this bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   I don't want to take the time, but we are concluding debate on this amendment, the Hodes amendment. I urge its adoption. I urge those who feel it is appropriate to support the measure, as I said it does have an increased authorization, not appropriation, of $1.7 billion. It does expand some of the transit grants to transit agencies that are hurting across the country. It does expand the transit benefits that are now restricted to those within the Beltway to Federal employees outside. 
   It does not solve the problem. It is a small piece of the solution, and I have been pleased to work with Mr. Oberstar in a bipartisan fashion to do our small part. 
   I must conclude, however, by saying that the House and the Congress can do a better job. My side of the aisle does not control the Congress this time. We have heard that there is a larger energy plan. We need to bring that energy plan forward. 
   I didn't have the time that the majority leader had in his remarks, and this isn't a blame game situation nor should it be. People are suffering in this country with $4-plus a gallon gas. I just saw this $5.25, which must be from California. That's not why our constituents sent us here. They sent us here to solve problems. In the same bipartisan spirit that Mr. Oberstar and I are bringing forward this little piece, we need a much larger piece.  
   A week from tomorrow is Independence Day, and that is a day we should be celebrating, not lamenting that we are not independent of foreign oil. We can work our way out of this. We can't tax our way out, we can't regulate our way out, but we have the means of moving forward and increasing the supply and lowering the price for the American people. We haven't done this, this Congress hasn't done this, and I am sorry that I have that to report at the end of my remarks, both in favor of the Hodes amendment and in favor of this legislation. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   It's unfortunate that we're here today to consider an important piece of legislation, our Coast Guard reauthorization, and it's also unfortunate we're discussing the rule under which that legislation will be brought to the floor, and that's a closed rule. 
   Unfortunately, this is the first time in at least 20 years that this Coast Guard reauthorization has been considered under a closed rule, not an open rule. I think it's particularly unfortunate that this year, when the Democrat leadership has chosen to restrict debate on this important legislation that has a number of important provisions, including a provision to provide a transportation worker identification card and straighten out some of the problems we've had in trying to get a single transportation worker identification card at our ports and other facilities that we can use. 
   I had an amendment that would have allowed my State of Florida, and other States, a simpler method of obtaining an FBI background check on port workers than is currently available. It would also have saved port workers the cost of paying for the same background check twice. 
   I brought here the TWIC card. We've been waiting since 2002 for this TWIC card, Federal card. We still don't have this card. In fact, the irony of this is they allowed several amendments; one to allow any identification, there's going to be an amendment that's put in order. I can use my driver's license in the interim. 
   Then there's another amendment that they allowed to allow them to enroll for a TWIC card 24/7. The ironies of not allowing something to have a State, again, work with the Federal Government and even go beyond the requirements like Florida does in trying to look at the background, the criminal background of the individual. So that's been eliminated, and my opportunity to present that, from this rule and consideration of this legislation. 
   Also, I'm going to take great exception with this bill because of some other restrictions they put on. Bringing in liquefied natural gas. Natural gas prices are soaring. Prices are high, and this bill creates more red tape, more impediments, and actually will reduce the supply and increase the cost to the consumer out there who's trying to pay those expensive bills for energy. 
   So this bill does nothing for energy. And it takes a trusted port worker, transportation worker card and makes a continual farce out of the whole process, and not allowing a reasonable relationship between the State and Federal Government.

   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. I'm pleased to join Mr. Oberstar who chairs our committee, and as the ranking member, and you'll hear from our ranking member on the Aviation Subcommittee, also opposed to this amendment and, I believe, Mr. Costello, who's the Chair of the Aviation Subcommittee, which I previously chaired, is opposed to this amendment. So rarely have we had such bipartisan support in opposing an amendment. 
   As Mr. Oberstar said, too, maybe this may be well-intended to try to deal with some problems we've had in the past, but let me tell you, this amendment can have some very severe consequences. We're talking about closing down the modernization of our air traffic control system. 
   Here's the headline of today's Washington Times: ``FAA Target Airline Delays.'' I can't come to the floor and not be besieged by Members who haven't been delayed by flights. If you really want to close down our Nation's aviation system, pass this amendment. 
   We have successfully done these consolidations in the past. We'll do them and modernize and get the latest equipment. However, a moratorium on consolidations through January of 2009 will cause FAA to lose $110 million of expiring funds this year that are targeted toward modernizing these facilities, and nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in construction costs will be placed on hold for projects currently in process across the country. This would be a disaster. 
   Many of the airports affected are planning to make improvements, and all of this attempt to get our aviation industry moving and air traffic moving and modernization of the system will come to a grinding halt. May be well-intended, may try to solve a problem that the gentleman from Florida has experienced, but this is not the solution. 
   I urge opposition.

   Mr. MICA. It is, again, rare that we have the chairmen on both sides of the aisle, the appropriation and authorizing committee, all uniformly in opposition to an amendment. But let me tell you, if you want to close down air traffic in the United States indefinitely in the Northeast, adopt this amendment. 
   Now, this isn't something that we just cooked up, that we're going to redesign the air space in the Northeast corridor. We started on this in 1998. We haven't redesigned the air corridor in the northeast United States since 1988. Imagine not expanding the roads or the transportation system in the Northeast since 1998 and the congestion you would have, and that's exactly what we've got. 
   Now, I've been to the districts. I've been to Mr. Garrett's district, Mr. Fossella's district. I've been to Mr. Shays' district. And I continue to work with Members, when I chaired the Aviation Subcommittee, and now as ranking member, and we will work with them, but we have got to redesign the air space. Imagine having no expansion highways. Now, planes are no different than highways; they run in corridors. But we haven't changed it in the Northeast corridor since 1988. We have been working on this redesign since 1998, some 10 years. We have got to make these changes and move forward with them. 
   And we need to listen to the people. We need to make certain that we don't harm their environment, their noise levels, and take into consideration as many of the points that have been raised. But I urge you to defeat this amendment.

   Mr. MICA. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership, and I also thank Mr. Johnson for his comments. 
   When you don't have an energy policy and when you don't have a comprehensive plan to deal with the escalating costs of fuel, you create a crisis. We have created a crisis in the pocketbook and in the checkbook of most Americans. We have also created a crisis here in Congress and in the United States Department of Transportation, because the highway trust fund has gone bust. It is broke. There is no money in it. In fact, tomorrow they will be issuing, if we do not act, notices of termination of Federal participation. 
   That has consequences. That means not a few jobs will be lost, but there will be 380,000 jobs potentially lost across the country. There will be projects across the United States that are put on hold. So there are consequences to our inaction of adopting a sound energy policy and resolving this issue. And we can solve the energy issue, but we do need a comprehensive approach to do that. 
   People responded by driving less, so there is less money going into the fund. We have a more efficient fleet of cars on the roads, so we have less money coming also into the fund. And we have alternative fuels that are starting to be used, like plug-in electric and hybrids, that we don't collect the gas tax on. So the trust fund is broke. 
   Now the House did act responsibly. I partnered with Mr. Oberstar, the Chair of our Transportation Committee, with Mr. Rangel, and Mr. McCrery. We did act, and this House passed on July 23 a fix for what is wrong. Mr. Johnson is right, this is a Band-Aid on a major problem that we have in funding transportation, and we are just kicking the can down further down. But we have got to sit down immediately as a Congress and resolve these funding issues in our highway trust fund, or we will be back here taking money out of our children's future and out of our general treasury to fund transportation. That is not the way to do it. It's not the right way to go. 
   We must begin immediately, because the bill we are working under expires next September 30, and we have in place no mechanism to replace and replenish those funds. So this is a Band-Aid, it is a temporary fix. It is not the way I like to do business, but we need to get down to business, solve the energy problem, and have a long-term fix for the highway trust fund that is broken today.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (FEMA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2382, the FEMA Accountability Act of 2008, which would enable the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to better manage the thousands of excess trailers in its inventory since Hurricane Katrina. 
   First, I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Subcommittee Chairwoman Norton for working with me in a bipartisan manner to make an important revision to this bill. 
   I would also like to thank Congressman Mike Ross from Arkansas who has been working with me to cleanup FEMA's trailer mess for several years now. 
   In 2006 and 2007, several neighborhoods in our districts were devastated by tornados, and numerous families were left homeless. 
   After the Christmas Day 2006 tornados in my district it took almost 2 months to receive a federal disaster declaration and authorization for housing assistance. In the meantime my constituents had no place to turn for help after the temporary shelters closed. 
   At one point I had half a dozen of my congressional committee lawyers and FEMA lawyers on the telephone trying to figure out how FEMA could take a few of the hundreds of excess trailers it had stored near Orlando and use them to house these homeless tornado victims. 
   Ultimately we received a federal disaster declaration and several trailers before FEMA could figure out how to make some of its excess trailers available without a federal disaster declaration. 
   In Congressman Ross's case, his district was never declared a federal disaster area after several tornados struck his district, and it took months for FEMA to come up with a way to transfer excess trailers to the State and help his homeless tornado victims. 
   The ridiculous part of this story is that FEMA had over 60,000 excess trailers at the time and it was spending over $3 million a year to store them in 17 storage areas across the country. 
   In typical government fashion, the taxpayer spent almost a billion dollars on trailers after Hurricane Katrina. Tens of thousands of them were never used. And FEMA was unable to provide them to states to house homeless tornado victims. 
   In response to this mess, Congressman Ross and I introduced legislation to provide FEMA authority to transfer excess trailers to state and local governments and voluntary disaster relief organizations to house disaster victims even if a federal disaster has not been declared. 
   These are trailers that FEMA does not need for its own purposes and that FEMA is spending millions of dollars a year to store and maintain. 
   I am pleased we were able to include language addressing this problem in the bill we are approving today. 
   Again let me thank Chairman Oberstar and Subcommittee Chairwoman Norton for working with me in a bipartisan manner, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. I thank our ranking member, Mr. Duncan. 
   Mr. Speaker and colleagues, I rise today in support of H.R. 1773, the Safe American Roads Act of 2007. This bill has some good provisions in it. I regret that a bill which I consider even better and stronger, which was drafted by Mr. Hunter, the gentleman from California, and introduced in Congress, is not the bill that we are considering. 
   I am sorry Mr. Hunter is not with us today also to speak, but I know he has many important obligations in his responsibility in securing our national defense. 
   Again, I believe Mr. Hunter's bill would have been a stronger bill that would have even more teeth to make certain that Mexican trucks comply with not only our safety regulations, but also our economic regulations against cabotage. 
   Now, let me make the record clear that I served in Congress when NAFTA was voted on in 1993. I did not vote for that legislation, and one reason was some of the unfair provisions, the inequity between the economy of Mexico and the United States. I had no problem with Canada, but Mexico is a different situation. I am for open and fair trade, but what passed in NAFTA then and today was a trade agreement between unequal partners when it comes to Mexico. 
   This administration, the Bush administration, unfortunately, has inherited what I call the haunting legacy of the Clinton administration, one of the haunting legacies, which pushed for passage of a lopsided NAFTA agreement. Back in 1993, in October, actually in October of 1992, President Clinton had only positive things to say about NAFTA. 
   Also, I have quotes by current Speaker Pelosi, then the Representative from California: ``In supporting NAFTA, I am casting my vote for the young people of America and for the future.'' 
   The future isn't to send jobs to the south, to Mexico, and then now open up the borders and truck the product produced by those jobs to the north. The responsibility we have in Congress is to make certain that even though we have to comply with some of the terms of this unfair agreement, that we do protect the safety, that we do protect the economic opportunity and the disaster this unfair agreement has brought upon our economy. 
   So it's critical today that Congress, that what we are doing today maintain, at least at a minimum, in keeping the unfair provisions of the treaty enacted by a Democratic Congress, under the promotion of President Clinton, from doing even more damage to us at this time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1195 makes technical corrections to the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, or SAFETEA-LU. 
   This is the third time we have worked to finalize these technical corrections to SAFETEA-LU. During the 109th Congress, the House passed H.R. 5689, a bill to make technical corrections to SAFETEA-LU in June 2006. 
   During the summer and fall of 2006, we worked with the Senate to create H.R. 6233, which is a very similar product to the bill we are considering today. Now, we are trying again. 
   As my colleagues have just said, H.R. 1195 makes numerous technical corrections to Federal surface transportation programs authorized by SAFETEA-LU. The technical corrections included in this bill have been identified by the Department of Transportation and are mostly of a conforming nature, or to correct drafting errors. The most important correction we are making is to strengthen the Federal Highway research program by ensuring the continuation of the legacy research programs carried out by the Department of Transportation. 
   The majority of this bill is section 105, which makes changes to over 200 of the high priority projects in sec. 1702 of SAFETEA-LU. These changes address ``broken'' surface transportation projects, clarifying recipients and increasing certain project funding levels and decreasing others to achieve budget neutrality. 
   There is one purely technical correction that is not included in this package. SAFETEA-LU inadvertently changed certain regulations for trucks with a gross vehicle weight of less than 10,000 pounds. 
   One of the implications of this error is that operators of these trucks no longer have to register or file insurance with DOT. Consequently, DOT can not regulate them for safety purposes. 
   When Congress passed SAFETEA-LU, this change was not a policy change Congress knew about or intended to make. If Congress wanted to make this change, we would have debated and discussed it. Rather, this was something we were not aware of and has had very serious unintended consequences--especially for small businesses. 
   I hope the Chairman, along with our colleagues in the Senate, will work with me to correct this technical problem. 
   Despite the omission of this important correction, I still support this legislation and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.

   Now, people across the country woke up this morning and yesterday and saw the financial markets implode across the United States. Now, who's in charge, the Democrats or the Republicans? 
   Now, for 2 years they promised us change. Look at the financial leadership of the House of Representatives. Look at the leadership of the Ways and Means Committee, right now under siege. 
   They promised us and the American people that they would have a policy, the Pelosi Energy Policy, some 2 years ago when gas prices were hovering around $2. 
   They control the process. We don't control the process. Now, they have brought out a sham. They are in control, and we have the highest energy prices in a bill that does nothing to solve the problem.

   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, talking to folks in the district last night in a telephone town hall conference and visiting with folks in my district, they want to know what Congress is doing about gas prices and energy prices. People are struggling as they try to fill up their gas tank. They're struggling when they go to the store and see inflated food costs. And so far, we haven't seen any results from Congress. 
   Now the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, are in charge, they've been in charge. They said they were going to take over and they would have a plan. The Speaker, the then leader on the other side, said they would have a plan. Where is the plan? Gasoline prices when the Democrats took control were just a little over $2. Now they're reaching $4 in some areas. Where is the plan? 
   The only plan I've seen is the $870,000 plan to replace the light in the dome of the Capitol, a 200-year payout. Where is the plan? People in America want to know where the plan is and how we're going to reduce gas prices for them and food prices for them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As we consider before the House H.R. 1195, I want to express my support for this legislation. And, first off, I'd like to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Oberstar, for his work and efforts, for his staff; Mr. DeFazio, who chairs the Highway Subcommittee; and also Mr. Duncan on our side of the aisle. 
   Now, I know that this bill's being here didn't come by accident. As you heard, this has passed the House at least four other times. A great deal of credit for the achievement in bringing this legislation forward also must go to the former Chair of the committee, the distinguished gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young). Mr. Young worked closely with Mr. Oberstar in crafting legislation to deal with some of the needed changes that were necessary. When you pass a, I think it was, $286 billion transportation and highway transit authorization bill, there are always technical corrections that are needed. It's almost impossible to pass a bill of that magnitude with that many numbers, that many projects, and not come back and make adjustments, both in some of the formulas that are required and also in some of the requests from Members. So this is part of the process. 
   One of the most important things, as people also ask us what we are doing to move the economy forward, I think it's absolutely essential that our transportation and infrastructure projects move forward. And without this legislation that cannot be possible because, again, of some of the drafting requirements under the July, 2005, SAFETEA-LU bill that was passed. 
   So here we are, the fifth time the House of Representatives will pass this legislation. It should be on its way to the President. As you heard, this legislation passed in the 109th Congress. It passed in the 110th Congress. Under the leadership of Chairman Young and then ranking member of the committee Mr. Oberstar, it moved forward, and now we have it in this Congress. 
   The technical corrections in this bill have been clearly identified by the Department of Transportation and also by State Departments of Transportation and are mostly a conforming nature or correcting drafting errors. Again, a huge bill with many provisions. 
   The largest section of the bill, section 105, makes changes to 386 high-priority projects in section 1702 of the SAFETEA-LU bill. These changes address surface transportation projects that cannot be executed as they are currently drafted in the current law, again, that we passed back in July of 2005. And, of course, next year we will be doing another bill, and that's why it's so important that we get this on the President's desk as soon as possible so that these technical changes clarify who the recipients are and project descriptions and make corrections that in some instances will increase project funding levels and decrease others to achieve budget neutrality. 
   There are many Members of Congress in the House and Senate who have written to our committee or to the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works or the Banking Committee in the Senate supporting specific projects and policy corrections. These requests have been submitted, I believe, through an open and transparent process. On my side of the aisle, I've tried to keep all of these requests public, available to the press, and, again, in a very transparent manner for everyone to see what has been requested, what the projects are, and who has requested them. 
   In this legislation there are 150 corrections made at the request of Senators, 197 corrections made at the request of House Democrats, and 138 corrections made at the request of House Republicans. 
   I support this legislation. It's necessary, again, to move these projects forward to stimulate our economy and build our Nation's infrastructure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   In closing for our side, again I want to thank Mr. Oberstar and Mr. DeFazio and Mr. Duncan, who spoke previously, and Mr. Young, the previous Chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 
   Let me just respond to a couple of items here. First of all, I want to join Mr. Oberstar. Both of us worked very hard and intently with the Governor of Virginia and with the delegation from Virginia, the Northern Virginia congressional delegation. I am so delighted to see that the extension of the Metrorail will continue out to Dulles. 
   It is expensive, folks. It is not going to get any cheaper. If you are looking at solutions to help the environment and deal with congestion, that is one of them, and we have to move forward. I am very pleased, and I thank the gentleman for his efforts and our joint efforts in making that possible. 
   We are all joined together by one common denominator in transportation, from sea to shining sea: We face congestion everywhere, in small towns, middle-sized towns, metropolitan areas. This bill, more than any other legislation that we will do this year, will move projects forward. 
   Now, there has been some criticism that this changes earmarks or redefines some earmarks. Yes, it does. These are congressional earmarks, and I say from our side of the aisle, I can tell you that we have done everything we can to make this process transparent, open, and have Members publicly state what their intent is. So I feel good about what we have done. 
   I can't control what the other body does. Mr. Oberstar can't either. But we have done our best to vet these projects and move the interests of this country, which is building and moving the infrastructure of this country forward. This legislation will do that. I urge Members to support this legislation. 
   Now, I know it does have a provision in here that does allow the Department of Justice to conduct an investigation on one of the projects. The leadership of the House and Senate and Mr. Young and others have agreed to move forward with this. I don't think it sets a good precedent, because the House and Senate should be the judge of their own Members under the Constitution. Be that as it may, I will still support this bill, move forward with the process, and we will try to do our best to keep America moving forward with its infrastructure and transportation projects, which is absolutely vital to our economy at this time. 
   I ask Members to support this legislation, and again thank all those involved. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Chairman and Members of the House, I offer an amendment tonight to try to alleviate some of the pain that I believe will be inflicted on State departments of transportation across the United States, and that pain will be inflicted by a $3 billion rescission in highway contract authority that is included in this bill tonight. 
   My preference would be to strike this rescission from the bill altogether. I did not have an opportunity to do that the way the rules were crafted. A $3 billion rescission of highway contract authority will have an adverse effect on State highway work across the country and plans all across the country for construction projects. However, I do think we do have the votes to eliminate the rescission provision from this bill in its entirety. 
   If this bill were being considered pursuant to the rules of the House, we would not have to vote on striking this rescission. This rescission is authorizing in nature and actually under normal circumstances would have been subject to a point of order which I would have offered pursuant to clause 2 of rule XXI, authorizing on an appropriations measure. However, the rule that was adopted earlier this evening governing this debate waived this point of order; therefore, I am forced tonight to offer this amendment.  
   This amendment is designed to make it easier for our State departments of transportation to handle rescissions of this size and magnitude. This amendment strikes language in the bill that requires the State departments of transportation to apply part of their rescission proportionately across all highway programs. 
   I know you will hear some others say that this is going to not assist CMAQ and some of the air quality programs and all that. But when you have a rescission of this magnitude in this bill of $3 billion in size, this is going to dramatically affect some of the work projects in many of the districts of many of the Members who are listening tonight. 
   By striking this provision in the bill, this amendment will restore the flexibility of the State departments of transportation they had in applying rescissions contained in previous appropriations measures. 
   The current language in the bill will force all State departments of transportation to apply the rescission in the same way. Each State would have to rescind funding from its highway programs in the same ratio that it receives from the Federal Highway Administration. 
   Unfortunately, this cookie-cutter approach does not work for every State. Some States have very little balances in certain highway programs from which they will be required to apply this mandated rescission. This will have, unfortunately, a really severe impact on a State's highway work plan, many of them, as I said, in progress. Projects in every one of our districts will be impacted. 
   I have a letter here from the American Association of State and Highway Transportation Officials supporting my amendment. Attached to this letter is a table showing how this rescission will impact every State. I include these documents for the Record.

   Mr. MICA. I think the gentleman raised some good points on the other side. We had a vote on this, and it is a closely divided question. But I think all Members will hear from their State department of transportation. We have granted flexibility in the past. I am a great supporter of enhancements. I think we need things that some people may consider not asphalt and concrete, but things that enhance the beauty of our highways and transportation system in this country. 
   But when you take a rescission of $3 billion, and States have obligations, and we have done this in the past to them, we have rescinded money in the past to them, I think we need to give them as much flexibility as possible to make the decisions, to make those cuts and to adjust their budgets. 
   They get obligated for huge amounts of money and significant projects that are underway. And Members throughout this body will hear from their State department of transportation that they have projects underway that will have to be put on hold, that will be delayed, and that will cause a great disruption in their transportation planning and construction projects. So that's the reason that I think we should give them the same flexibility that they have had in the past. I am not asking for any more or any less.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. And I appreciate the work that the Rules Committee has done on this. I also appreciate the work of the Transportation, HUD, and related agencies appropriations subcommittee, and Mr. Olver, the gentleman from Massachusetts, and also the distinguished gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Knollenberg. 
   And I am not here to criticize their work product. I am here, though, to set a marker, partly a historical marker; and I will speak in opposition to this rule and also the way the rule was crafted. 
   Madam Speaker, while the Committee on Rules calls this resolution an open rule, it is unfortunately extremely restrictive in nature. While the rule will allow for most amendments, unfortunately it weighs most points of order against consideration of the bill. 
   Under clause 2 of rule XXI, the rules of the House allow for a point of order to be raised against any provision that is considered authorizing on an appropriations bill; however, this resolution that we are considering now waives that point of order. 
   Now, again, I come here because, as the ranking member, the Republican leader on the House Transportation Committee, I said we need to set a marker. I was checking with the Parliamentarian, and as far back as we can look, the Founding Fathers and those that preceded us in these Chambers separated the authorizing process, authorizing projects and policy, from the appropriations policy. And here, tonight, we abandon the prerogative of the authorizing committee to cite a point of order that should be raised against a number of provisions in this legislation that in fact authorize on an appropriations matter. What good is the transportation and infrastructure authorizing committee? It is the largest committee in the House of Representatives, and the action we take here tonight makes really chopped liver out of that process. I think that is unfair, and it also sets a bad precedent. 
   There are several provisions of the bill that we will consider tonight that are authorizing, as I said, in nature and that would be subject to a point of order if this is truly an open rule tonight. The most egregious of these provisions is the proposed rescission of $3 billion of unobligated highway contract authority. A rescission of this size will have a very severe impact on the ability of our State departments of transportation to implement their highway programs throughout the Nation. To compound the effect of this rescission, the provision also restricts how a State can apply the rescission. During consideration of H.R. 3074 this evening, I will offer an amendment that will address this issue. 
   My amendment is simple. It will seek to provide the State departments of transportation maximum flexibility in how the rescissions should be administered. It is nice for us to make these rescissions, but we should give the States some prerogative in how they apply those rescissions to their own States and their priority of projects. 
   If the rule was truly an open rule and did not waive points of order, then I would not have to offer this amendment. I could have simply raised a point of order, which I have done in the past. Mr. Young, who was the chairman, would have taken the same measure. He would have been out here if he was in the majority and Chair, Mr. Shuster before him, and the language would have been stricken from the bill. However, this rule waives that point of order, and for this reason I will vote against the rule this evening, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same. 
   I would insert in the Record at this point a letter from Chairman Oberstar of the T&I Committee dated July 18, 2007, to Mr. Obey, and it states a whole series of concerns that he raised about, again, authorizing on a legislative appropriations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. I think in 45 seconds let me cite for the record, then, verbally here the provisions authorizing in nature and rescissions in this bill: 
   In addition to the $3 billion in Federal Highway Contract Authority, a rescission of $172 million in Highway Research Funding; a rescission of $50 million in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration; a rescission of $20 million from the Highway National Traffic Safety Administration; a rescission of $30 million from the Federal Transit Administration; a rescission of more than $200 million from the Federal Aviation Administration; and, finally, there is authorizing for Amtrak that was poorly crafted in this bill that deals with the problem with MARC in Maryland. 
   In this poorly crafted authorizing on an appropriations legislative measure, they poorly drafted a provision that deals with the problem with MARC in Maryland, their transit system; and the bill requires that all leases and contracts entered into by Amtrak be governed by the laws of the District of Columbia, drafted in error, but authorizing that step in this important bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, actually I'm pleased to be here on a Saturday because we should be here on Saturday, Sunday, Monday and through the entire week to address the issue of energy independence for this Nation. People who drive up to the gas pump want some relief from high energy costs. People who get their bill at home and are struggling to pay that high power bill are being challenged, people on fixed incomes, and also, the country's being held hostage now importing so much fossil fuel. 
   And this is all supposed to be about climate change. We all want to preserve and protect the climate. We had a little piece of this in the T&I Committee. But actually we could make a big impact, because if you look at the emissions into the atmosphere that are causing global warming and some of the problems, power generation is one of the biggest generators of that pollution and degradation of our environment. And then transportation, all you've got to do is look at the cars and trucks and the use of energy and then polluting our environment and adding to the warming of the climate. 
   But unfortunately, in our committee markup, Republicans tried to add some real energy policy changes to this bill, and they didn't accept them, the Democrats didn't accept them. For example, Congresswoman THELMA DRAKE from Virginia, she had an excellent amendment to lift some of the limitation on congestion mitigation and air  quality funds to allow the CMAQ money, this type of money the Federal Government allows, to be used for capacity expansion projects. 
   The Democrats claim that this legislation is about climate change, and really, the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions, as I said, is traffic and, actually, congestion. 
   Addressing the problem of congestion, if we'd done that, we would really be doing much more for a solution to reduce emissions and improve our air quality. That was turned down by the other side. I could give you a lot of statistics, and I'll include them in the Record of what it would do. So the Democrats rejected this effort. 
   Let's look at another Republican recommendation. SAM GRAVES, an outstanding representative from Missouri and one of the ranking members, offered an amendment in committee, and it was included in the Republican alternative, to streamline the pipeline permitting process to allow just for repairs, and it was rejected. This is getting some of the fossil fuel on a temporary basis to where it needs to go and also for gas and other substances that make us less dependent on the fossil fuels that cause pollution. 
   And finally, the Republicans offered an alternative that the Democrats refused to make in order that identify deepwater ports that we can use for L&G facilities to bring in liquefied natural gas on an expedited basis when it's in the national interest. So, again, we become less reliant on the types of fossil fuels that pollute and cause global warming. 
   So we attempted to work with the other side for real solutions that we could have put in in addressing the problems that transportation contributes again to global warming and these bad emissions in our atmosphere were rejected. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   First, on the issue of capacity expansion process, studies have shown that improving traffic flow at more than 200 identified bottlenecks would reduce carbon emissions by as much as 77 percent. That's that single lane. 
   On the bridge in Massachusetts, the Democrats were all in favor of taking down a 100-year old bridge and replacing it. We are replacing that bridge. That new bridge will be in place. Now they found out that the old bridge will block the liquified natural gas tankers from going up. They wanted that bridge removed. That bridge is still going to be there and blocking their natural gas from getting to where it needs to go. Unbelievable.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, let me say at the outset, I have supported President Bush on many occasions. In fact, I pulled a list of some 43 measures on which I supported the President in an attempt to sustain a veto. 
   But today, my colleagues, I must respectfully disagree with President Bush's veto of this important and long overdue Water Resources Development Act. I believe it's far too important for both our Nation and for my State of Florida and, again, for all the projects that are in the backlog. I'm disappointed the President and the White House have decided to veto this legislation that includes many critically  needed infrastructure and restoration projects. 
   For the first time, you've heard this since 2000, the year 2000, Congress will enact legislation authorizing, and this is authorizing, we are setting Congress's priorities for authorization. All of these projects in this bill must come back for approval for funding. 
   But this particular bill includes all of the water resource projects to restore our endangered ecosystems across the country, construct new levees, dams, rebuild our beaches, and work on other important water resources projects. 
   A significant portion of the bill, I might say, deals with Everglades restoration, something that we've been working on for years. And also another significant portion of this legislation deals with work and reconstruction of some of our water resources projects in the damaged gulf of the United States. 
   There's been, as you've heard, a water resources bill introduced in every Congress since 2000; however, controversies always dash the hopes of approving a measure. 
   After I assumed responsibility for ranking member of the House Republican leader on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I met with the new chairman, Mr. Oberstar, and I sat down and we tried to decide what were our priorities. And this is a great example of how this body should work. This is a bipartisan measure. Mr. Oberstar, this was one of his priorities. He worked on it for a number of years. I came new to my leadership position, but pledged to work with him; and we did work together on this. 
   Let me say also, ironically, I feel sad today that Mr. Oberstar is not joining us. Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers are with him. He's recovering from surgery yesterday which he had scheduled some time in advance. 
   But he served this House for 32 years before he became the chairman of T & I. He made a commitment, a bipartisan commitment to work together, and we did that. And when you do that in this House, you can achieve anything. And in a few minutes we will achieve an override of the President's veto because we worked together in a bipartisan manner to rebuild our Nation's water resources. 
   Let me say also that earmarks, and this contains a number of projects, earmarks have gotten a somewhat tainted reputation and were criticized. But what we did, and what I tried to do on the Republican side, was make certain that this was a transparent process. Every Republican House project was publicly submitted, publicly available for review, and very carefully vetted. In fact, Mr. Oberstar and I cut more than 100 projects from the 2005 proposed House-passed WRDA proposal that did not pass. 
   The 2007 WRDA bill addresses what I believe are the important needs of our Nation. Again, I think this is a good bill that represents investment in America. These investments will improve trade, protect our homes, our businesses from flood damages, and from other ravages of Mother Nature we've seen. They'll enhance our quality of life by restoring aquatic ecosystems like in the State of Florida with the Everglades restoration. 
   This legislation ensures our ports and waterways remain viable in the international marketplace by authorizing critical navigational deepening projects. Maritime commerce is absolutely essential to the future of our economy. Congestion at an outdated port or waterway is becoming a national economic issue, and this bill addresses that economic problem. Products moving into our waterways aid our environment and lessen highway and rail congestion. 
   Efficient waterways must be, in fact, an integral part of America's intermodal transportation system, and this bill helps do that. 
   To maintain our place in the global economy, the United States must have modern ports and waterways. Our ports and waterways need to be improved to handle additional traffic. And what's coming are mega-ships, a new class of larger liners and freighters that are coming. We have almost no ports that can handle that type of traffic. This conference report addresses these needs in several ways, including improvements to waterways in my State of Florida, as well as in Texas, Louisiana, Virginia, and other areas. 
   In addition, this bill authorizes seven new locks and other navigational improvements on the upper Mississippi River. 
   The WRDA conference report authorizes critical projects to provide flood protection to millions of Americans. And we've all seen that if we neglect our waterway infrastructure or our water protection system, you've heard that adage, we pay now or we pay later. Well, I can tell you we'll pay much later if we don't protect ourselves from, again, reducing the potential flood damage that we've seen. 
   This bill includes many projects that protect our cities from floods and also from those coastal storms we've experienced. 
   The Corps of Engineers is the leader in planning and carrying out our environmental restoration projects. And this conference report that we will override a veto on in a few minutes is by far the greenest, most environmentally friendly Water Resources Development Act ever passed by Congress. This bill's major new focus is environmental restoration, and again, it contains the first work. In 2000 we authorized study of cleaning up the Everglades. This bill authorizes work on the Everglades. 
   Everglades restoration, as I said, has been talked about for years. And it is a national ecological treasure that must be protected for future generations of Americans. 
   I might say too that the restoration of the Everglades is in partnership with the State of Florida. And I have a message from a Republican Governor, Charlie Crist, was handed to me earlier: Greetings from Brazil, where he's now with 200 businessmen. And the Republican Governor of the State of Florida is urging that we override the President's veto, basically because of what I said about the Everglades and other critical water infrastructure projects in the State of Florida. 
   This bill does not, as I said, guarantee funding. Money will have to be appropriated to meet these authorization levels; but it represents a critical commitment by this Congress to restore, again, an ecological jewel in Florida and water resources projects throughout the United States. 
   Also addressed in the bill are policy issues that will improve how the Corps of Engineers actually conducts projects, and that's also important. There's a peer review process that I think is critical to monitoring and protecting whether the projects perform as designed. 
   I know the President is concerned that the conference report authorizes more projects than could actually be funded. All of those projects may not ultimately receive funding from Congress. They have to come back to Congress, even after this authorization. But it is important that we authorize, through this conference report, a good list of investments from which the Congress can later prioritize funding. 
   Finally, I know the White House has expressed concerns with this bill. However, again, the House bill in 2005 contained 784 projects. The House bill in 2007 that we worked to examine in a transparent manner the projects, contains 682. Over 100 projects were cut out of the previous House bill. Again, this was, I believe, an open and transparent and a bipartisan process that, hopefully, will restore some of the public's confidence in this process. 
   And, finally, we have to realize that this bill, since we haven't passed one since 2000, represents the equivalent of three WRDA bills. When we had a backup in 1986 we, in fact, funded $11 billion worth of projects back in 1986 because we hadn't passed a bill in a long time. 
   So while I wholeheartedly respect the President's veto, we, as Congress have a responsibility to provide for our Nation's resources and infrastructure, provide the leadership to get that job done. And I urge Members to support overriding the President's veto. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to yield myself one-half minute for the purpose of an introduction, and then I am going to yield 3 minutes to the individual I want to introduce. 
   Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues, it is now one of the greatest pleasures I have had to introduce a gentleman who I got to know for a brief period of time. He came into this House, and he has done an incredible job of representation in a difficult time for his State of Louisiana. I had the chance to go down with him and look at infrastructure projects after the damage. I think the people of Louisiana recognized, in an unprecedented historic fashion, his leadership, in electing him Governor in a tide that was historic in proportions. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, the gentleman and future Governor of the State of Louisiana, our colleague, Mr. Jindal, the gentleman from Louisiana, again, I recognize for 3 minutes.

   Mr. MICA. Understanding that Ms. Johnson will close, I yield myself the balance of our time. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, we come to the close of the debate on overriding the Presidential veto. Today, indeed, has been a strange day. That is the interesting thing about politics and government in the United States of America. Look at the people who have spoken here; a future Governor. We have heard people who have had their homes destroyed, their property. We had a strange day here today. My side of the aisle ended up voting not to end a particular debate on a possible impeachment resolution of the Vice President. Here I am, a staunch supporter of the President's effort to maintain fiscal responsibility, supporting override of his veto. 
   But this is a very difficult job. It is a difficult job for me. It is a difficult job for the President. I think we like to do everything we can. I think it is in the heart of the other side of the aisle, and I know in the heart of my fellow Republican Members to do as good a job  as we can in representing people. I know the President has had to make some difficult choices coming into office with the events of September 11 and the terrorist threat that we face and the line drawn in the sand by al Qaeda and Iraq. And national security is our primary responsibility, but we also have responsibility to our infrastructure. 
   So we have tried to sort out those priorities in this process. We do need an investment in our infrastructure. 
   The President is right in, probably, his stance. I think we are right in our stance. This is an authorization bill. This is not a spending bill. It does prioritize for the Congress bills that have been carefully considered and projects that have been considered by Members, and Members make very sincere requests based on the conditions of their particular districts.     
   It is a great system and it does work. I understand the President's commitment to fiscal responsibility, and I think we have tried to act in a responsible and good-steward fashion. 
   In closing, I again want to thank Mr. Oberstar. Unfortunately, he is not with us today, on this day that he worked so hard for. I thank Ms. Johnson. I want to thank Mr. Baker, our ranking member, and all of those who have worked, particularly the staff: Jim Coon, our staff director; David Heymsfeld on the Democrat staff side; John Anderson and Ryan Seiger; all of the staff, those named and others, who have worked to bring this bill together, all with the same intent, to improve the lives, the resources and the condition of our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (STOP THE POLITICAL GAMES; PROVIDE FUNDING FOR OUR TROOPS AND OUR VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Speaker and my colleagues, this is the first time I have come out for a 1-minute address, and I think it is necessary that I also voice my disapproval with what is happening. 
   Right now the Congress of the United States is at an 11 percent approval rating. And, unfortunately, the actions dealing with our veterans and military appropriations measures is going to, I think, further erode public confidence in this body. 
   Right now in what is going to play out in the next number of hours, our military and our veterans, unfortunately, will be held hostage. Unfortunately, too, our veterans and our military are going to suffer from this, all in an attempt to try to, I guess, embarrass the President of the United States. But in turn we will be embarrassing, and further eroding confidence in, this House. 
   We need to work together to pass in a bipartisan effort the funding for our troops and our veterans and stop the political games.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (SAFETEA-LU TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Duncan, Mr. DeFazio, who is the chairman of the Highways and Transit Subcommittee, everyone, including staff, for their work on this important technical corrections bill. 
   I am pleased to rise tonight and voice my support for H.R. 3248 and encourage my colleagues to do the same. This, in fact, is the fourth time we have brought this bill to the floor in the past 18 months. It is imperative that we pass this measure and for the Senate to follow our lead and pass it as well. I think we have a pretty good agreement with the Senate to do just that. 
   Once the President signs this legislation, SAFETEA-LU, which is the major transportation and highway transit funding bill that we passed less than 2 years ago, all the provisions of that will finally be able to accomplish what Congress set out to do. There are many minor errors, and that was a pretty massive bill, and there are some minor changes in policy, tweaks in policy and in Member projects in the SAFETEA-LU bill that we passed that need this technical correction. 
   We have heard from the Department of Transportation and also several State DOTs regarding fixes to different programs and also high-priority projects. I believe this bill tonight addresses most of the issues that have been brought to the attention of our committee. 
   This bill also makes critical corrections to the Federal Highway Research Program to ensure that the department can continue essential research programs, including the Future Strategic Highway Research Program and the University Transportation Center Research Program. 
   The bill also extends the deadline for the National Surface Transportation and Policy and Review Study Commission and corrects several drafting errors regarding the Magnetic Levitation Transportation Deployment Program. Extending the deadline on the National Transportation Surface Policy and Review Study Commission is very important, particularly as we take on in 2009 the important responsibility of putting in place another bill that will replace SAFETEA-LU to set our policy and projects and transportation priorities for the future. 
   So, it is important to note that this bill does not make any substantial policy changes to the SAFETEA-LU bill, but, again, it deals with technical corrections. Again, this bill corrects provisions that were not workable by the States or by the Department of Transportation. They have relayed their concerns and we have addressed them in this bill. 
   It also is important to note that the Congressional Budget Office has scored this bill and estimates that, over the 2007-2012 period, this bill will reduce contract authority by $1 million and will increase receipts by less than $500,000. 
   There is one purely technical correction that is not included in this package. SAFETEA-LU inadvertently changes certain regulations for trucks with a gross vehicle weight of less than 10,000 pounds. When Congress passed SAFETEA-LU, this change was not a policy change that Congress knew about or intended to make. If Congress wanted to make this change, we would have debated and discussed it. Rather, this was something we were not aware of, and this change has had, in effect, very serious unintended consequences, especially for our small businesses. 
   I had hoped to fix this problem with a technical fix. However, some groups who have benefited from this error have, unfortunately, prevented us from doing so tonight and in this legislation. It is unfortunate a policy change that no Member anticipated and voted on will not be corrected in this legislation tonight. 
   Despite this particular shortcoming and oversight, again, I am pleased to have worked with Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Duncan in revitalizing this very necessary technical corrections bill, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the bill tonight. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Again, I thank Mr. Oberstar working with our side of the aisle; Mr. Duncan, my ranking member; the lead Republican on the Highway Subcommittee, Mr. DeFazio; and all of the staff on both sides. They worked real hard on this and over some weekends. 
   We had originally planned to tack this onto the WRDA bill, but that was not meant to be. Actually, that might work out quite well because this might become law before WRDA, given the comments I have gotten from the White House on the WRDA legislation. 
   But I thank all those involved in making certain that the laws that we pass have the intent and the content and the necessary corrections.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Well, first of all, I can't begin this debate on this water resources legislation without congratulating Mr. Oberstar. As you heard Mr. Oberstar say that some 44 years ago he was a staffer for Chairman Blatnik, I think his name was, at that time and tonight he chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I'm pleased to be the Republican ranking member to have worked with him to bring forth a bill that is very important, not only to Mr. Oberstar, and his efforts and others in trying to bring a bill forward. 
   You know, we have not passed a water resources infrastructure bill since the year 2000. Normally, we pass it every 2 years in a cycle legislation that sets forth the projects and the policy and the priorities for building the Nation's infrastructure, and we haven't done that. 
   Now, one of the problems that we've had is that we've had a bad name given to earmarks, and this bill contains some 950 projects, almost all of them earmarks. There are a very significant number of earmarks in this bill. 
   From the time I assumed responsibility for the T&I Committee on the Republican side and in my discussions with Mr. Oberstar, I said we've got to make certain this process is open, this process is transparent and that we restore faith in this process. The choice is that we could pass a bill tonight for $20 billion and authorizing projects and not name those projects but let some bureaucrats down the street that are unelected make the decisions, but that's not way this process works. 
   The people sent us here, they send us here to renew the contract every 2 years to decide what the priorities are for our districts, and that's what this legislation is about. 
   There are 950 projects in this legislation, again a very high number, and the bill is a very high number, probably $20 billion when you total up all those projects in authorization. Now, all of them won't get funded, but we have a responsibility to set the priorities, and the people are setting the priorities through their elected representative, not some appointed bureaucrat. 
   I tried to make this a transparent process from the beginning. These are all of the Republican Water Resource Development Act of 2007 requests. These have been on file. These have been open to the public. The press has been in. They have been carefully vetted. Mr. Oberstar and I attempted to vet every single project on the House side, and the staff and others have been working to make certain that we vetted the Senate and all the projects in this bill. And I think we've done about as good a job and opened the process up to sunshine, to again a fair and open honest process and hopefully restored some of the faith in this process. 
   Now, I did receive today a communication notifying me that the White House will probably veto this legislation. That's unfortunate, and I've talked to the White House. We've tried to keep the dollars number down, but I tell the White House and anyone else, and I will support Mr. Oberstar and others if we have to override that veto. We need to do that. Our job is to make certain that we build the infrastructure of this country and we do it in a responsible manner. 
   We haven't had a bill since 2000. All you have to do is do the math. The math is simple. The bills in the past have been about $6 billion, 6X3 is 18, and you add a few billion dollars more for inflation, and this is the number we're at and the number of projects we're at. I've told this to the President's advisers, and I regret that we're in this situation, but we'll have to do what we have to do. The President's going to have to do what he has to do. 
   But let me tell you now, and Katrina should be a lesson to us all, you either pay now or you will pay later.     
   These are projects that will determine whether dams break, whether levees are secure, whether water resources for this Nation are available, whether we do important environmental restoration that's been left behind. 
   Again, I repeat that this is authorization, not funding. But we have a responsibility to pick and set those priorities as the people's elected representatives. 
   Let me tell you also again critical needs in this bill. I have had Members literally come to me with tears in their eyes and say that, in fact, a project is so important that people's homes, lives and properties may be destroyed if we don't move forward with authorizing their projects. 
   In my own State of Florida, I am pleased tonight, and there are ironies tonight, I remember working with Senator Dole when we tried to do the Everglades restoration. That was talked about for years, even when I was in the legislature back in Florida in the 1970s. 
   Tonight, in this bill is the authorization for the first construction money to restore Florida's Everglades, a national environmental treasure that, unfortunately, man and sometimes the Corps of Engineers in some unwise policies have nearly ruined. But we have a chance now to restore that through this legislation. 
   In 2000, we authorized study money. This is the actual work money, the first work money for that. In my own community, and I close on this, I have A1A, scenic and national highway designation A1A, through Flagler County, which is literally falling into the ocean. The beach has eroded. We have no more beach there. We need to restore that. Those are the kinds of projects that are in this bill, even for me as a ranking member. 
   I strongly support this measure. I think it's responsible. I don't want to get into a contest with the White House, but, again, I thank the staff; Mr. Baker, I will yield to in a few minutes; Ms. Johnson; Mr. Duncan, the former chairman of the water resources; and all others who have worked on this. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time; and I'll be pleased, if the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) needs additional time, to yield to him in light of the tragedy that has struck his State. 
   Mr. Speaker, again, my heartfelt sympathies are expressed to any of the Members from Minnesota as they deal with this very difficult tragedy and also to the families who've lost loved ones in the collapse of the span of Interstate 35 West, which I understand connects Minneapolis and St. Paul. 
   The information I have is that some of the sections were under construction, and the span was closed last night for construction and reopened this morning and scheduled to be closed again tonight. But, unfortunately, we have seen from news accounts a very significant disaster and loss of life in the failure of that infrastructure. 
   I, too, would pledge my support in working with Chairman Oberstar, with the Minnesota delegation and working with this administration and the Congress to bring whatever resources to reopen that span and try to repair that infrastructure. 
   While we can replace the infrastructure, we can't replace the lives; and, again, our sympathy goes to those who mourn their loved ones tonight. 
   As we conclude debate on this water resources infrastructure bill, once again we're reminded of the importance of infrastructure, whether it's bridges, dams, the highways that are along our beaches, the natural reserves we have in this country that depend on Congress to protect them and protect that water resource infrastructure. 
   I yielded earlier to our ranking member and thank him again, Mr. Baker; and I said the Good Lord sent us Mr. Baker to lead the Republican side of the Water Resources Committee. And again, we have the example of the failure of water resource infrastructure, the levees and some of the infrastructure in New Orleans and Louisiana. No one is more knowledgeable, has a better firsthand experience than Mr. Baker. And this bill also contains a considerable amount of authorization for projects in Louisiana and New Orleans. 
   Finally, I want to thank, again, Ms. Johnson. Next week, I'll get to travel to her district. Under her leadership they bring together all the transportation leaders in the State of Texas for probably one of the country's largest, it's grown to the country's largest infrastructure conferences, and they've asked me to come down and speak and be with them as they plan Texas' policy and transportation projects for the future. I look forward to that opportunity of being with her, and I thank her again for her distinguished leadership and working in a bipartisan fashion to craft this long-overdue legislation. 
   So again, I thank all of those. I have John Anderson, Mr. Speaker, with me, who represents all of the staff on the Republican side; and I thank the staff on the majority side for their hard work in trying to make this bill a reality. 
   And, again, I thought of one of the most important projects, as the gentleman from Florida, other gentleman from Florida pointed out tonight, that restoration, the first work on the Everglades being in this bill, important not only to Florida and our districts in Florida but also to the Nation because of the environmental treasure that we're trying to preserve. We do make positive steps towards its restoration and preservation for future generations. 
   So it's a good bill. I know the President's probably going to veto it. It'll be back here. We're going to, unfortunately, have to override that veto to make this a reality. 
   But, as I said earlier, the President has to do what he has to do, Congress has to do what the Congress has to do, and we will work together again to make certain that the infrastructure of this country and water resources are preserved for the future.  
   For the first time since 2000, the Congress is on the verge of passing a major bill authorizing projects, studies, policies, and programs related to the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   There has been a WRDA introduced in every Congress since 2000, however, controversy always seemed to arise that dashed our hopes for a new authorization bill. Over the years we have worked to bridge the gaps created by those controversies and have arrived at the point where we now have a product that the Congress can approve and send to the President. 
   This bill has been under development for many years. It is the result of much debate and much compromise. This is not the bill that  any of us in the room would have written, if we were writing a bill by ourselves. However, it is a bill that all of us can support because it addresses important needs of our Nation. 
   This is a good bill that represents investments in America. These investments will improve trade, protect our homes and businesses from flood damages, and enhance our quality of life by restoring aquatic ecosystems. This legislation ensures our ports and waterways remain viable in the international marketplace by authorizing critical navigation deepening projects. Without these projects shippers will go to other foreign ports like those in Canada and Central America. 
   For some goods, as much as 50% of the ultimate price paid by the consumer is attributable to transportation costs. Keeping these costs low not only benefits consumers here in the United States, it also makes products produced in the United States more competitive on the world market. Congestion at an outdated lock on a waterway can result in increased costs that rob the farmer of his or her profit. Delay and its associated costs also can rob a farmer of his or her market. This is not a speculative concern. 
   Recently, improved transportation systems in South America have allowed farmers there to keep their costs low enough to underbid United States grain farmers for customers located in the United States! America's farmers, like the rest of the United States economy, depend on modern and efficient waterways as an integral part of the intermodal transportation system. 
   Trade builds wealth. But to realize the economic benefits of trade, we must have a modern transportation system. To maintain our place in the global economy, the United States must have modern ports and waterways that can bring the world's goods to our door and make America's products competitive on the world market. Our ports and waterways need to be improved to handle the additional traffic and larger class of ships that we know are coming. This Conference Report addresses these needs in several ways including authorizing improvements to waterways in my home State of Florida, as well as in Texas, Louisiana, and Virginia. In addition, it authorizes 7 new locks and other navigation improvements on the upper Mississippi River. 
   The WRDA Conference Report authorizes critical projects to provide flood protection to millions of Americans. Flood damage reduction projects save Federal dollars by reducing the probability that disaster relief will have to be used in the future. This bill includes a multitude of projects that protect our cities from floods and coastal storms. 
   As our Nation has become more environmentally conscious, and sought ways to improve aquatic ecosystems, the Corps of Engineers has become a leader in planning and carrying our environmental restoration projects. This Conference Report is by far the ``greenest'', most environmentally-friendly Water Resources Development Act ever. The most frequent purpose of new Corps of Engineers project authorizations in this bill is environmental restoration. 
   This Conference Report contains critical provisions to restore the Everglades. Everglades restoration has been talked about for years, but with the projects authorized in this bill, actual work and construction of projects can begin. Not only is the Everglades vital to the economy, environment and people of Florida, it is a national treasure that must be cared for and protected for future generations of Americans. 
   These projects have been brought forward by the Corps in partnership with the State of Florida. The State of Florida has stepped up with their share of funds for these projects. Now that we have these first authorizations, Congress should be supportive of funding this important effort to save a national treasure. These are just the first of what will be many projects over the next several decades to clean up, store, and redirect water for the Everglades. 
   This bill does not provide guaranteed funding--money will have to be appropriated to meet these authorization levels, but it represents a critical commitment by the Congress to restore an ecological jewel of the United States. This legislation will help ensure a revitalized Everglades for generations to come. 
   Also addressed in this bill are policy issues that improve how the Corps of Engineers does projects. We have instituted an Independent Peer Review into the Corps' planning process to enhance the agency's credibility. We are improving project monitoring to determine if the projects are performing as designed. 
   I know that some are not happy with the size of this bill; however, we must remember that the Conference Report represents the pent-up demand of 3 WRDA bills. This legislation is overdue by 5 years. And if we wait any longer it will just be a bigger bill, because the Nation's needs are not going away by themselves. We must address them like we are doing here today. 
   I want to thank Don YOUNG, the former chairman of this Committee, who worked for many years to resolve the difficult issues surrounding this bill; and also Jimmy Duncan who chaired our Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee for 6 years and worked closely with the Ranking Members JERRY COSTELLO and PETER DEFAZIO to create many of the compromises that made this Conference Report possible. 
   I certainly want to thank you, Chairman OBERSTAR, for your leadership over the years both as Ranking Member and now as Chairman of the Full Committee. It has been very rewarding to work with you on this bill and it shows what we can accomplish when we work together in a bipartisan way to address the Nation's needs. 
   Under the leadership of Senator BOXER and Senator INHOFE, the Senate passed a bill that included many of the same projects addressed in the House bill. I think it is appropriate that the package before us today represents a compromise of the House and Senate bills into a good product that both chambers can proudly support. 
   Lastly, I want to thank the staff of the Full Committee, Jim Coon, Amy Steinmann, Charlie Ziegler, and Jason Rosa. I also want to thank the staff of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, John Anderson, Geoff Bowman, and William Collum for their dedication in finishing the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   And on Mr. OBERSTAR'S staff, I want to thank David Heymsfeld and Ward McCarragher of the Full Committee, and especially the Subcommittee staff of Ryan Seiger, Ted Illston, Beth Goldstein, and Mike Brain. 
   I urge all Members to support the Conference Report.  
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Minnesota.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (THE RETIREMENT OF CONGRESSMAN DAVE WELDON -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Well, thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House and my fellow Americans, this is an interesting time in the history of our Republic and in the history of Congress. It is probably one of the most contentious issues and difficult issues I've seen in my almost three decades in the Federal arena. 
   Tonight, before I get into a couple of comments that I want to make about the situation we have facing us with the financial crisis, I want to take just a minute--and I know some of my colleagues are going to join me, particularly those from Florida--to insert into the Record a statement relating to the retirement of one of our colleagues, the Honorable Dave Weldon of Florida--Dr. Weldon as he is known and also as he is professionally titled. 
   I've known Dave since he decided to run for Congress. He is one of, I think, at least 30 individuals on our side--and we have some incredibly dedicated and distinguished Members who have served many, many years in the House of Representatives--who is retiring. It's a little bit of a concern to me. You know, maybe this has become a very difficult job. It's not one for the faint of heart. It's a job to which people must devote all of their time awake--their hours in the days and on the weekends. Sometimes when they say they're going back to their districts on recess, those Members go back and have much more full schedules than we have even in Washington. 
   Dave is one of the Members who is retiring, Dave Weldon. This concerns me. It is going to be a loss to this Congress. Very often, we see people come to Congress from many different backgrounds. Dave Weldon is the kind of guy who we should encourage others with his qualifications and background to come to Congress.     
   He is a physician, and he probably can make four or five times as much as he has made in the service to the United States House of Representatives, but he has been in service to our Nation. This isn't the first time DAVE WELDON served our Nation. DAVE was also, besides being a practicing physician and Army veteran, he served our Nation in the United States military. 
   So on behalf of my colleagues from Florida, I want to thank him for stepping out of his role as a physician. The time he spent since I first met him working with all of us devoted to this institution, if you look at the Space Center and the space coast that he represented, David has always been a tireless advocate to the space coast and the space program. 
   DAVE, again since I met him, I have watched his children, Katie, and his son, David, grow up over the years of his service. I know the time and commitment he has extended to this House of Representatives, this country, for the good of all people. He is a shining example of the kind of devoted people that we have serving here. His lovely wife, Nancy, again, people have no idea how many days and nights, weekends and occasions DAVE has had to leave his wife and be in service to the House of Representatives. 
   We are really blessed. The good Lord sends us people like DAVE WELDON and his family who have been devoted to this House for 14 years. And it does make a difference. I know right now everybody is critical of the Congress. And I find people, you know, making hostile remarks about Members of Congress, but they have no idea what a great institution this is. And the people like DAVE WELDON who come here and serve, again, selflessly serve, sometimes leaving their family aside, but always meeting their responsibilities. But DAVE after 14 years is going to leave us, and the House will not have his service or his knowledge. 
   One of the things I would love to do with DAVE WELDON was listen to him speak. He would come to the floor, and very often there are well-intended folks who talk about subjects, and sometimes they know the subject fairly well and sometimes they have no idea. People expect Members of Congress to know everything, and most of us are generalists when it comes to legislation. And we are also products of our experience. 
   DAVE is a product of great professional experience and background. The thing I loved about DAVE WELDON, he could come here and talk about issues that are near and dear to my heart. He would talk about medical procedures. We have had debates about abortion and debates about different procedures. Some people sort of talk, again, on sort of their general knowledge. But DAVE WELDON is someone who can and has stood up here in the House of Representatives and spoken from knowledge, experience, from professional medical training, a very smart individual whose talents again we are going to lose. 
   I hope this isn't the case that the good get going in the House of Representatives because this institution, with all of its flaws, is just reflective of the United States of America. Representatives come, all 435, from all corners of our land. They are reflective of the land, and sometimes we get some exceptional Members like DAVE WELDON who leave, and I am hoping again that this is not the case, that others choose to leave. 
   It is tough duty, particularly in a time of financial crisis when you pick up the phone and people say I may lose my retirement, my business won't function, my opportunities are becoming limited for financial avenues. But there are folks who do step up to the plate and try to do the best they can. 
   What is neat is DAVE has been not only a hero for the unborn, but also a hero for the taxpayers. Sometimes when you get through all of this, people think there are a lot of special interests running the place. And sometimes you see again people spending lots of money lobbying Members of Congress and people get disgusted with that process. But I think for the most part, and particularly on the part of an individual like DAVE WELDON, you see someone who votes from his heart and also from his mind and also from his experience and knowledge. That has been a great thing for the House of Representatives. 
   I will miss DAVE. I will miss some of the others on both sides of the aisle who have been part of this institution and have contributed in a positive fashion. Again, I just come before the House tonight, and I am going to talk in a minute about some other issues, but I see DAVE WELDON has come to the floor. I didn't know whether or not he would be here. But, DAVE, on behalf of the whole Florida delegation, many who will be submitting statements to the Record as a part of our tribute to you and thanks for your service, I thank you on behalf of all of not only the Members of the Florida delegation and not just the Republican side of the aisle, but those on both sides of the aisle, I want to thank you for your years of service to your district, the State and the Nation. 
   I yield to DAVE.

   Mr. MICA. Again, we are so proud of DAVE WELDON and to his service to the House of Representatives. He is the first medical doctor to serve from the State of Florida. He is also one of the first Representatives from Florida's east central coast to serve on the Appropriations Committee, and we will certainly miss his presence on that committee. 
   On the Appropriations Committee, DAVE WELDON served on various subcommittee, including the Science, State Justice and Commerce Subcommittee. He also currently has served on the Labor, Health and Human Services as well as the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittees. 
   DAVE has been a very active advocate for the cause of autism. He has worked also with those interested in finding a cure on cancer, and it is great that we have had a physician to be part of the Cancer Caucus. He is also a strong advocate for renewable energies, and he has been active in that caucus and the Tourism Caucus that is so important to the State of Florida, and the Military and Veterans Caucus.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (THE RETIREMENT OF CONGRESSMAN DAVE WELDON -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Well, reclaiming my time, I do thank my colleague DAVE WELDON for his comments and also for his institutional recollection. And that's something we're going to lose with him departing from the Congress, and that's why it's so important--and I know people think there should be a turnover in Congress, but it is very important that we keep people here who have been through some of these hearings, heard some of the so-called song-and-dance and get sort of, as Paul Harvey says, ``the rest of the story.'' 
   But DAVE WELDON brought up several points. First of all, again, with Mr. Davis, the ranking member, I intend to ask that we, our committee, Government Reform and Oversight, conduct extensive review of all those who walked away with hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. We need to start with Franklin Raines, the former OMB Director under the Clinton administration, who headed up the agencies that, again, DAVE WELDON spoke about, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And I am told that just Mr. Raines alone walked away with $100 million. I know there have been some proceedings, and he got a slap on the hand, but Mr. Raines had accomplices in the cleaning out of that agency. Not only did they inflate, as I understand it, their returns so that they could get huge bonuses, but they were only slapped on the hand for their misdeeds, and now some of their misdeeds are becoming the responsibility or the potential responsibility of hardworking Americans who are going to have to pay for that. 
   So I will demand hearings, and we will find the individuals that allowed themselves to take advantage of these agencies and these activities and walked away with tens of millions and left us in the straits that we are in today. 
   Additionally, again, I think it's important for folks to know that some of the changes that were made, again, back in the 1990s with these agencies were to encourage homeownership. If I came to the Congress 4 years ago and gave a speech that said that people with limited incomes, people from certain areas of the community that may be blighted shouldn't get loans, or if I said we should limit the amount that we would lend to folks, there would probably be an outcry. 
   And what we saw was the creation of financial instruments, and we now know them to be called subprime, which assumed again some of the debt and responsibility, and these mortgages ended up being cast throughout and interwoven throughout our entire financial system and assumed as solid assets or assets that had some value. 
   Many of them may have value, but my point here is that the Congress and others in different administrations also encouraged homeownership. No one called for a breaking of loaning to marginal borrowers, and so this situation that we're all familiar with now was created. And we do have a responsibility, one, to hold people accountable who made errors not only in judgment but also fudged their books and walked away with huge amounts of profits, commissions, and salaries. 
   I know that everyone's concerned about the $700 billion that is proposed by Secretary Paulson and also passed by the other body, and they've tried to say that folks who took advantage of the situation previously should not actually have an opportunity in the future to participate. And I think there's no question that that restriction has to be placed there, but I think what's even more important is to make certain that those responsible for the situation we're in are held accountable, the people that, again, ran away with hundreds of millions of dollars and fled with the commissions and bonuses. 
   And I, again, will call on the Chair of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee, Mr. Waxman, and I think Mr. Davis will join me, in asking for those additional hearings and to hold those people's feet to the fire. 
   Again, we have gotten ourselves into a difficult situation. We have interwoven into banks and financial institutions these subprime instruments and paper. Suddenly no one wants to trade them. The value is a zero on balance sheets. We do have a credit crisis in the country. 
   I took some time to review how we got ourselves into this mess and tried to outline it as objectively as I could and what occurred, and we have pretty good documentation for what I offered here tonight and also for what Dr. Weldon offered here tonight. 
   The question now is how we work ourselves out of the mess without leaving the taxpayers at bay. I represent tens of thousands of hardworking folks, and every day they're doing their job, raising their family, going to work, paying their taxes, paying their mortgage, paying their bills, and now I'm being called on as a Representative to ask those folks to subsidize someone's bad judgment, bad investment or risk that they took, or someone who made bad decisions that allowed people to produce that now worthless paper. 
   I might say that that paper is not necessarily worthless. Some of it may not have any value. Some of the borrowers may be deadbeat, the properties may be defunct, but there are many properties that will have value, and there are people who do pay these loans. And what I believe the Congress has to do is work to get the credit market back in order to establish some value for paper that does have some value, and some of that subprime does have value. 
   I was the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and I recall the responsibility I had as chairman to try to bring some order to the financial stability of our aviation industry. Today, we're some 7 years away from that horrendous time when the entire industry collapsed, planes were halted from flying, markets totally ran away from the aviation industry, airlines. 
   And I look back on the history of that. In 11 days, working in a bipartisan manner, we were able to get to the President a bill that helped stabilize the finances for the industry. Most people don't know this story. We didn't provide loans. We didn't provide direct cash, although, we did pay airlines for auditable damages that were done by failure of the United States Government in protecting those aircraft. And I think that also stemmed a lot of the potential for suits and carrying the results of that disaster and terrorist attack on. 
   But what we did was we provided loan guarantees. We had about $10 billion worth of loan guarantees, and we required also very tight parameters in which those loan guarantees would be granted. 
   It's interesting that about 2 months ago every one of those loans--now, several of them were rescheduled but every loan was paid back. The taxpayer made $323 million, a third of $1 billion, and the fund was closed out. 
   It would be my hope that whatever measure we take--and I would prefer either backing with insurance or with some guarantee that paper that's there. Quite frankly, I do have a problem with the Paulson proposal. The Paulson proposal the Secretary brought us initially was to give us $700 billion and we'll buy these mortgages up, this bad paper or this paper doesn't that have worth right now, and sort of trust me. 
   Now, the House of Representatives, again being reflective of this Nation, did not want to allow that to happen, and we saw a vote in this House that did not allow that to happen. There were modifications and some protections and some improvement from the Paulson original proposal. The Paulson proposal was number one. 
   The measure voted on in the House, at the insistence of many of my colleagues on my side of the aisle to improve the package, was proposal number two. 
   I don't know if proposal number three will make it or not in a vote that we may have here in the House tomorrow. I think we're going to. I have not  seen all the details of it, and I hope to tonight before I cast my vote. 
   But, again, we have to think of the people that we represent out there, hardworking folks who have met their obligations. Some of those folks are retired and want their retirement funds secured. Some of the folks I represent are businessmen and -women who are having trouble getting credit, expanding business or even meeting payroll. So we do have an obligation to do something, but that should be based on a sound plan. 
   Again, I would prefer some sort of insurance backing or guarantee backing by the government for those instruments to give them some value, and if they have value, then they can be assessed on the balance sheets of all those who are holding them, and also for that guarantee or for that insurance, the lenders or those who have acquired that paper would have some financial obligation.     
   That obligation and money could be pooled and also help absorb any losses for bad investment or bad paper. That would be my approach. I'm one of 535; I don't necessarily get my approach. I'm not sure I'll get that opportunity to vote on that proposal. 
   But any proposal that we do have, in my judgment, will be based on how it treats the taxpayer and the person who has met their responsibility, not the individuals who have taken advantage of the system, who have taken business risks or investment risks or gone beyond what should be reasonable caution with investment of either their depositors' money, their investors' money, or, in this case, if we give it to them, taxpayers' money or backing. 
   I know the House will work its will. We've had tough times in the United States. The Congress has always risen to the occasion. And as I said, this is a great body. People, again, have been very critical of it this week, but it is a system that does work, that does allow for debate, does allow for opportunity to participate. And the public, each one of the public who have called my office or other offices to express their opinion are also participating in the development of hopefully what will be a positive outcome here. Do we know if whatever we pass will work or what I suggested will work? I don't know. You do your best. And I think people will try to do their best when we have that vote here tomorrow. But again, I think that if we all calm down, approach this from a rational standpoint, from a business-like and commonsense standpoint, and also for the true benefit of those people we represent, the American taxpayer, the American citizens across our great land. 
   And finally, I believe that there isn't any challenge that we can't tackle. While everyone is focused on the financial challenges that we face and the credit crunch crisis, I'm very pleased that I learned today that the President intends to sign the first Amtrak Reauthorization bill in 11 years, which also has a Rail Safety bill incorporated in it. 
   I've been the harshest critic of Amtrak. I've ordered more investigations and Inspector General reports, GAO reports of Amtrak; not that I oppose passenger rail service, I think it's needed in this country, but I had problems with the way our government--I call it ``Soviet-style'' Amtrak--operation ran. And, unfortunately, for many years, 11 years now, Congress has given Amtrak money without setting policy and parameters and reforms that are long overdue. 
   I'm pleased that, as the Republican leader of the House Transportation Committee, myself, Mr. Shuster, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, our ranking Republican member, Ms. Brown, the Chairwoman from Florida of the Rail Subcommittee, and Mr. Oberstar, my Democrat counterpart, the chairman of the T&I Committee, Transportation Infrastructure Committee, did work in a bipartisan fashion. We took Amtrak apart. We included reforms that are long overdue. We have opened the door for historic participation by the private sector in developing, financing, constructing, and also operating--for the first time across our country, where it makes sense and where it can be used in some 11 corridors that have been designated, high-speed rail. One of Mr. Shuster's ideas was to take some of the money-losing routes, put them up for private bid competition, which is also included in the legislation that's headed for, we hope, the President's signature soon. 
   We saw the opportunity to expand passenger rail service because our Nation is facing an energy crisis, and there is no better way to move people. Unfortunately, the United States has become somewhat of a third-world country when it comes to rail passenger service and we have no true high-speed rail service, passenger service in the United States. 
   So within that legislation we've incorporated dramatic changes, some opportunities for expanded service with partnerships, not with the Federal Government paying the whole tab, with a set out formula for participation; and again, expecting some accountability from the investment that we're making in passenger rail service in this new legislation. 
   Finally, in that bill, we did incorporate some needed rail safety measures. One of those measures relates to positive train separation, trying to get technology where we have passenger service that's mixed with freight lines and have the latest technology to ensure that we don't have a repeat of what we saw in California with the loss of lives several weeks ago. That was a horrible accident that possibly could be prevented. And by 2015, according to this legislation, with a little bit of help from the Federal Government, our freight and passenger partners--many of them who provide public transportation--will make certain that they have the latest safety train separation equipment in place. Also in the bill are other measures to improve safety; crossing improvements and rail safety inspections that will be enhanced. 
   So I think when you hear some of the bad news--Congress can't get it done, Congress doesn't do its work, you guys up there just don't have a clue--there are many things happening that are positive, that are done in a bipartisan fashion. 
   Now, the story I just told you, the story about the aviation so-called ``bailout,'' that won't be in the paper tomorrow. No one wants to print those stories; they want to print the story that the Congress is not doing its job, Congress is not acting responsibly, Congress is in a fight and this one is calling that one something. That's not what it's about. Sometimes that does occur, and probably in this Chamber. If we look at the history, they've almost had some duels and fisticuffs in the past and some very harsh language exchanged. But it is, again, a reflection upon our society, upon human nature. And these are all human beings, with all their pluses and minuses; for the most part, they're good folks and they do their best to represent people across this great land. 
   Finally, again, I just want to say that, in my years of service here--and I'm kind of unique in the Congress in that my brother served here as a Democrat Member, I'm a Republican, we're the only two brothers or siblings to serve here since 1889 from different parties, but we've seen it on both sides of the aisle, so to speak. But you do see the magnificence of the structure and the system created by our Founding Fathers, and it somehow does work. It probably shouldn't work with all the diversity of opinion and people and places and folks that they represent, but it does work, and that's what has made it a great Nation. And the Union has prevailed, even in some very difficult times. 
   So if it requires 24/7, if it requires us staying here through November, December, we need to get the job done for the American people and for the opportunity for those who come behind us, our children and our grandchildren and future generations, to have, again, the same opportunity that we've had. 
   So I'm sorry I can't come tonight and just condemn everybody and throw bodies around and create some difficulty that would set the House on fire, but I thought it would be better to come tonight and talk a little bit about the greatness of the institution and the ability of the Members that are here to solve any task that confronts them and do it in an honorable fashion. 
   So those are my comments tonight. I came originally to honor one of those Members from the Florida delegation that's leaving, Dr. DAVE WELDON. There are many others that are departing of their own volition, there are  some that will be taken out by the voters; but they all, in my estimation, have done their best to serve their representatives, each and every one of them, in their own way. 
   So with that, Mr. Speaker, could I ask how much time I have remaining?

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to take a minute to compliment Mr. Miller and also Mr. McKeon. This is one of the most important bills that this Congress will take up in this session because it deals with, as Mr. Miller said, as I listened to his opening statement, with our disadvantaged youth. And, unfortunately, we have many in this country. But it gives those youth the opportunity for the future and the opportunity that we have all shared that are here on this floor and many of us listening Members. 
   I think the bill is a step in the right direction in requiring that at least 50 percent of all Head Start teachers nationwide have a bachelor's or advanced degree in childhood education or related field by September 30, 2013. My amendment is a simple amendment. It would move up that date 2 years, to 2011. 
   I am not a newcomer to this debate. I could go back to 1993, when I came here, and give statements from the floor and back over the years. My degree is in education. I am usually here on transportation and enjoy my service on that committee. But as someone educated as an educator, nothing is more important than the quality of education and those professionals that we have. 
   The Mica amendment moves up the date to have professionals in place to 2011. We can do that. We have done it before. We have actually required qualifications, and now we have more than a majority having an associate degree. So we have done this in the past. Currently, 38 percent of all of our Head Start teachers already meet this goal, so we are only talking about 12 percent in 4 years as opposed to 6 years.     
   Does it really take 6 years to get an additional 12 percent of the teachers to be in our most important educational program with these qualifications? 
   Now, we've moved this program from what I called it 14 years ago, from a glorified babysitting program, to a program that is giving our students the opportunity for quality educational opportunity. And these young people, at this age, deserve the very best. They are coming from the very worst, the worst as far as disadvantage in our society, the worst as far as opportunity, as far as family setting, as far as their readiness for school. 
   Mr. Miller talked about making them ready for school. Well, do you want them ready with someone who is unqualified or someone with the best qualifications? 
   Better prepared, Mr. Miller talked about. We need the most skilled professionals to give them the preparation. And these are our toughest students, the very toughest students. Do you want someone with or without qualifications?  
   I posed a question, and probably the reason I got this amendment out here to the Rules Committee, which is mostly composed of Democrat Members listening, there are more Head Start programs in Democrat districts than there are in Republican districts, just by the sheer economics of it, the demographics. I said, what if I came with a proposal that said, in kindergarten I'm going to recommend that we only have 50 percent of the teachers having a bachelor's degree in Democrat districts; how would you like that? 
   Well, this is what's happening here as you're mandating that we have a poorer quality of teachers with quality for another additional 2 years. So I think we can do better. 
   You heard the $24,000 average pay. That's right. We're going to increase on average a half a billion dollars, from $6.9 billion to $7.4 billion. 
   In my schools, in closing, there are choices. I won't name the counties, but I have seven teachers in one program with $23,000 average salary. I have nine administrators with salaries from $32,000 to $41,600; another county, 21 teachers, $20,100 average salary, eight administrators with salaries from 31- to $42,000. So it's not always how much we spend, it's how we spend it. And we need to spend it on quality education for these, our most disadvantaged students. So I urge you to consider and pass my amendment.

   Mr. MICA. Thank you, Mr. Price, for yielding to me. Also, I want to thank you for the nights that you have spent on the floor during this session of Congress, the 110th, trying to bring the truth and also facts to the American people that are so important. 
   You said that I would talk tonight a little bit about my perspective, and I have an interesting family history. I have a brother who served as a Democratic Member of Congress from 1978 to 1988 here in the House of Representatives, Dan Mica; another brother, a Democrat, who served as an aid to Laughton Childs and to former Congressman Brademas. We are the first two Members and brothers to be from different political parties since 1889.  Almost everybody else is from the same party. 
   I say that because I truly am from a bipartisan family. When I came here some 14 years ago, we were in the minority, Mr. Speaker. And I served 2 years in the minority, and I want to tell you that I was treated very fairly by some of the Members of the majority. I will even cite Mr. ED TOWNS of New York, who took me in as a freshman new Member, gave me every opportunity to participate, recognized me. I was a full participant as a minority Member. 
   There were others who I will not name who did not allow me not to speak, who actually told me to be quiet, and who actually adjourned meetings, so I didn't have the opportunity to speak or participate. So I saw how bipartisanship and I saw how dictatorial rule works. And for some 12 years, the good Lord gave me the opportunity to be chairman of three subcommittees over 12 years. So I always employed the golden rule, the ED TOWNS rule, of treating everybody fairly. 
   I say that in context because today is January 31 and this month, the beginning of this Congress, is one of the saddest hours in the history of the Congress of the United States, at least that I am familiar with or that I have read about. 
   Now, we started here with the swearing in of Nancy Pelosi. I am an Italian American. I was proud of Nancy Pelosi's being the first Italian American and woman to take that position, and I think we were all very pleased for her on both sides of the aisle and congratulated her. 
   But then began, unfortunately, the saddest chapter in the history of Congress with the passage of six major pieces of legislation without the Congress even being organized, without the committees being organized, without one of those pieces of legislation going through the committee process. 
   What an incredible insult to the people of America who just finished an election. They elected us as representatives, 435. We, in turn, elected a new Speaker of the House, and the entire democratic process was obliterated. It has been the saddest month in the history of the United States Congress. Six major measures. 
   And the irony, I sat here in the week of celebrating and honoring Martin Luther King, one of the great civil rights leaders of our time, whose sole goal was to give rights to the minority that they had been denied. And the new majority completely obliterated in that week the rights of the minority. It was one of the saddest chapters I have seen. So all of their measures, all of them, are just floating out there. The other body hasn't taken them up. They were passed while trampling on the rights of the minority. 
   There are men and women fighting today, tonight, tomorrow for those rights to protect the minority. This is not Bolivia. This is not Venezuela. This is not Cuba, where someone takes power and tramples on the rights of the minority. This is the United States of America, and every representative should have the opportunity to participate in that democratic process. Again, I am just offended. 
   And then the final offense today, the 31st, to pass the largest spending measure in the history of Congress in one sole bill without consultation, without participation, without the democratic process is the ultimate insult to the citizens of the United States, who expect a representative form of government, and to the Congress, to the rights of the minority.     
   This was a $463 billion earmark. And we just got through an election in which the Republicans were chided for passing earmarks in the stealth of the night, for which the Democrats also were offenders. We paid a penalty. We lost the majority. 
   But you do not pass a bill of that size without the ability of even to participate in this bill, this $463 billion earmark, the most costly in the history. 
   Now they think they pulled one over on everybody. But I guarantee you. I guarantee in that bill, since no one had a chance to see it or participate in it, they will find day after day embarrassing provisions that we did not have an opportunity to take out, to adjust, to correct. 
   So they will pay the price. When you do things in the stealth of the night, when you illegitimately conduct the process of Government, you will pay the penalty. We paid the penalty. They will pay the penalty. Marital law is not the way this Congress was intended to run. 
   This should be, in fact, bipartisan. Bipartisan means two working together. I am committed to that. I will continue to be committed to working that way. I come from, as I said, a bipartisan family; and we have got to work together. 
   So I hope today, January 31, 2007, a very sad day, ending of a sad chapter in the history, mark my words. This will go down in the history of this Congress as one of the darkest hours ever. 
   I thank you.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (HONORING ALAN M. HANTMAN -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased tonight to come to the floor for a special order presentation. Let me start out by reading some names. Dr. William Thornton, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Charles Bulfinch, Thomas U. Walter, Edward Clark, Elliott Woods, David Lynn, J. George Stewart, George M. White, and Alan M. Hantman. 
   My colleagues, I read these names. They are the names of the 10 architects of the United States Capitol. 
   This week will mark the last days in service to the United States Congress, and this historic structure, of the Architect of the United States Capitol, Alan M. Hantman. And I am pleased to rise this evening to recognize his service. 
   Of course, we have had many presidents, we have had many Speakers of the House. We have only had 10 architects who have been in charge of this incredible structure that we call our United States Capitol. 
   Alan Hantman will leave his service, leaving a legacy untold by almost any of his predecessors. And it has been my honor and pleasure to work with him on a project that will dramatically change the nature of the United States Capitol, that is, the United States Capitol Visitors Center. 
   Let me reminisce for just a minute, as I thank him for his 10 years of dedicated and sometimes difficult and trying service to Congress. But let me reminisce, if I may, about Alan Hantman coming to serve as our United States Capitol architect. 
   I have been involved in the Capitol Visitors Center for some 14 years, since I came to Congress, committed that the people who visit this institution should have the opportunity to have an enjoyable, informative and memorable visit to the United States Capitol. Instead, in the past, they have stood in the rain, snow, sleet, cold, ice, without even common comforts or courtesy in front of our most historic structure, and sometimes denied access to the structure or again common conveniences. 
   I was a little bit afraid because I know the way this place runs, when they were selecting an architect, some 10 years ago, that they might find someone in this process that would deep six the project, so I spent a particular amount of time as author of two authorization measures for the project, talking to Alan Hantman, and I was convinced he was the right person at the right time in the history of the United States Capitol. 
   He undertook that expansion of the United States Capitol Building, the largest in history. It will increase the volume, the sheer volume of the Capitol by some 70 percent. And he has done an incredible job. 
   At the same time, he has had to make this Capitol run. I often joked when I first came here that the U.S. Capitol was run like a southern plantation with bad management. 
   Alan Hantman changed that. He brought professionalism to his position and to service and to, again, to the most monumental project, not on behalf of those who serve here. The Capitol Visitor Center, in fact, is the first structure and expansion to the Capitol in the history of the Capitol for the public, for those who own the place and to make, again, their visit an enjoyable, informative and educational experience. 
   Alan brought with him great experience from the private sector with more than 10 years heading up the Rockefeller Center Management Corporation  in New York City, overseeing that great project, and then coming here. 
   Now, I know he has had 535 bosses, a smaller group of Capitol preservation on which I serve, and then the leaders of the House and Senate and some of the appropriators and other authorizers. I call him working for 19 prima donnas. But he has completed the structure, planning, and under the most difficult circumstances you can imagine. 
   When people see the Visitor Center, the name of Alan Hantman will live forever in the history of the United States Congress and our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (JOHN F. KENNEDY CENTER REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding me time, and also recognize the efforts of our Subcommittee on Public Buildings of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Also we have Ms. Johnson here and Mr. Graves for this reauthorization bill on the Kennedy Center. 
   I just wanted to add my congratulations for the incredible work that this national cultural center does provide, not only to the District of Columbia and the northeast United States, but the entire country. 
   Mr. Oberstar, our chairman, and myself as ranking member, get to serve as honorary trustees on the Kennedy Center Board, and I had the honor and privilege of attending the reopening of the Eisenhower Theater. 
   Now, folks don't realize that the Kennedy Center was opened in 1971, and, of course, some of the facility does need rehabilitation. The Eisenhower Theater, one of the most prominent theaters, named after President Eisenhower, was closed for several years and underwent a complete renovation, and now is open. 
   But I had the opportunity to attend the little ceremony and dinner commemorating the reopening, and the Rogers family and others who have helped lead that effort are also to be commended in this commentary this afternoon. 
   Most folks don't know this now, and I really wasn't aware of it until this dinner, but the Kennedy Center was actually the idea and one of the primary projects of Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower actually was the author of creating a national cultural center, and it was during his administration and it was a bipartisan effort in 1958 that they authorized a national cultural center to be located in our Nation's Capital here, and it did open in 1971. 
   Now, it was interesting also to see the plans and vision that President Eisenhower had for a national cultural center back then. Of course, it was named for our slain and lost most distinguished President, John F. Kennedy, but the Eisenhower Theater within that complex still bears the visionary's name for this center. 
   So as you undertake this act today, and I commend again the committee members and staff who have worked on this and all those who do make the Kennedy Center one of the richest national cultural centers and facilities, not only in the United States, but the world, I just wanted to add that commentary for the record.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (PROVIDING THAT THE GREAT HALL OF THE CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER SHALL BE KNOWN AS EMANCIPATION HALL -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I support recognizing emancipation and honoring the contributions of slaves in the construction of the Capitol. However, as I discussed in the subcommittee hearing and full committee markup, I have concerns about renaming the Great Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center. 
   Throughout the history of the Capitol, none of the monumental spaces, such as the House and Senate chambers or the Rotunda, have been named after specific individuals or events in history. Instead, these great spaces of the Capitol have long been called by their functional names. By doing so, all people regardless of their race, ethnic heritage, contributions, or human travails are equally recognized. 
   These spaces are dramatic because of their physical settings and the unique historical events that took place within their walls. Similarly, the Great Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center will become a monumental space with its own unique history; and just as those spaces have not been named, I believe the Great Hall should be reserved and left to honor all Americans. 
   While I do not believe it is appropriate to rename the Great Hall, I do believe that it is important for Congress to acknowledge and honor the contributions slaves made to the Capitol. In the hearing held by the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management and again in the full committee markup of this legislation, I recommended that other spaces could better acknowledge emancipation and honor the slaves that helped build the Capitol. 
   It would be most appropriate to name the exhibition hall that will provide an important historical context to the name Emancipation Hall. It would also provide visitors an opportunity to learn about and pay tribute to emancipation. One of the first recommendations I made as a member of the Capitol Preservation Commission was to create a first class museum space within the CVC. I proposed the highest level museum 
   space so America could exhibit some of the Nation's treasurers--like the Emancipation Proclamation--which are rarely viewed by the public. 
   The exhibition hall will be 16,500 square feet. Outside of the National Archives Building, this will be our Nation's finest exhibition space. This hall will not only honor those who built the Capitol, but provide information about their contributions to American history. This exhibition hall will display and prominently house the catafalque that was built to support the casket of Abraham Lincoln--the Great Emancipator. This is the original funeral bier used as the Great Emancipator lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda. This hall will contain permanent exhibits on the Constitution and the post-Civil War amendments proposed by Congress and ratified by the States to abolish slavery, to guarantee equal protection under the law, and to ensure the right to vote. 
   This beautiful hall will have strong historical and contextual links to emancipation. It will be the primary venue for acknowledging and commemorating the slaves who helped build the Capitol and the country. It will help deepen the understanding of our Nation's long struggle with slavery and its ultimate abolition for all who visit here. For all of these reasons, nothing could be more appropriate or significant than naming this area of the Capitol Visitor Center Emancipation Hall. 
   Another possible Emancipation naming CVC venue would be the congressional auditorium. While it does not have the strong links to emancipation as the exhibition hall, it is the most significant functional space in the facility, a place where leaders will gather to discuss important ideas of their time. The auditorium is a grand space that is being designed to serve as an alternative House Chamber. Except for the current House and Senate Chambers, no other venue in the Capitol has such an important purpose. The name Emancipation Hall would serve as a valuable reminder of courage, leadership, and our unique commitment to advance the cause of human freedom and fulfill the promise of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. As such, I believe it would be appropriate and fitting to name the facility Emancipation Hall. 
   In sum, I believe there are more appropriate areas in the Capitol Visitor Center to name Emancipation Hall. Additionally, we have a tradition of leaving the monumental spaces of the Capitol un-named. As a monumental space in, and an introduction to, the Capitol, the Great Hall should retain its current functional name like the other great spaces within the Capitol.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, I am pleased to be here this morning to bring to the floor the FAA reauthorization legislation that is before us. As Members know, and those who follow this subject, our authorization runs out, I believe, the end of next week. That is our Federal policy and projects' financing ability to run our Nation's air traffic system. We had a responsibility to move forward legislation to renew that Federal law, and that's why we are here today. I think that is an important responsibility. 
   I have tried to work with Mr. Oberstar, who now chairs the full committee. He chaired the Aviation Subcommittee, ironically, when I was a freshman in Congress. And as he mentioned, I had the opportunity to chair that subcommittee for the past 6 years and developed a great working relationship with him. 
   I am pleased to work with my ranking member, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri), who has done yeoman's work to try to bring this legislation forward in a responsible manner, working with the now-chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello), who likewise has put his full efforts towards this important reauthorization. 
   We have been fortunate, too, to have great staff on both sides of the aisle working together to meet that responsibility. I am pleased that we could bring the bill forward. 
   However, I have to say, in all honesty, I have some mixed emotions. I must also state that when we come to final passage, and I have told Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Costello and others, that I will cast a vote not in support of this FAA reauthorization, and really for two reasons. 
   First of all, when we introduced the bill, there were several objectionable provisions that had been proposed that I opposed, and I do respect the gentlemen from Minnesota and also Illinois, in working cooperatively to introduce the bill without those objectionable provisions. However, right after we introduced it and we marked up the bill, we started sort of piling on, and there are two provisions which I cannot support, two major provisions, and I made them aware of my opposition. 
   The first one involves an unprecedented reach-back, and it is for the air traffic controllers. Let me say there are men and women, some 15,000 of them, who do an incredible job serving our air traffic control system. And back in the 1990s, I believe that they were underpaid, undercompensated for their responsibilities. But through a contract that was negotiated then under the Clinton administration, they did receive for the next 7 years an average increase of about 10 percent a year. In fact, it totals 75 percent over those 7 years. 
   Now, I would love to have it 10 percent guaranteed increase. I think people who work here in the Congress would like to have a 10 percent pay increase every year; 1.2 million Federal employees, maybe another 20,000 that work at FAA would all like to have this deal, and that deal wasn't to be. 
   This past Congress had the difficult task of receiving the contract that was being negotiated and the final offer that was made by FAA because the contract reached an impasse. And in an  unprecedented fashion also, the terms of that contract offer was brought to Congress, and the air traffic controllers lost in that vote here on the floor. 
   Now, I sympathize with Mr. Oberstar and also with Mr. Costello. The appropriators turned down the air traffic controllers in the House. We had several CRs where they attempted to reopen this contract; it was turned down. It was turned down by the appropriators in the Senate. It was turned down in the bill that is now before the other body. Each time that they have gone to the Democrat side, which now controls this body, they have been turned down. 
   Now, they did manage to put this provision to which I object in the bill, and it is unfortunate. It has a huge financial impact. It is estimated to be $1.9 billion, if this is allowed to go forward. And the money is one thing, but reaching back in an unfair manner to other Federal employees. We have some 20,000 professionals, engineers, people with Ph.D.s, a whole host of staff in FAA that aren't going to be treated in an equitable manner. 
   And then the bad precedent it sets for Congress. Folks, any time you get into a labor dispute, just bring it to Congress and we will up your salary when we are pressured. That can't be the way we operate. I have agreed to change the mechanism. Nobody in Congress likes to be the negotiator of salaries or contracts, and we shouldn't be, and I am committed to that.     
   I will also say that since we took up this bill and knowing that this is a pending controversial matter, I have worked day and night to try to get the administration and NATCA union representatives together to resolve those differences. I appreciate the work of all of those involved. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette) has also joined the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri) and myself and the Democrat members in that effort. Unfortunately, it's jammed into this bill and that's not fair. 
   There are other provisions that have been put in here for big labor. Now, I know labor won a big vote with the election and is attempting to increase its membership. I respect that, but I think that the grab they have attempted here goes beyond what I feel is reasonable, not only in expanding organizational opportunities that I think go beyond again a reasonable level but some of the other provisions in here that will add cost, that will add regulations, that will add complications to operating our system and not give us a fair return. Not only do we have a responsibility to bring forth this legislation that runs this system but we have an obligation and responsibility to taxpayers and others, the travelers who finance the system, that their funds be spent wisely. 
   I do also have some reservations about provisions that will be added in the manager's amendment. Again, it's not always how much money you spend, but how you spend that money, and we have a responsibility to spend that wisely and very efficiently for hardworking Americans who are paying in to also help finance this system. 
   And then, of course, the final point is the President has issued a veto statement, and he will veto this based on spending, based on the overreach by labor for their contract and other terms that have been put into this legislation. Even though I have opposition, I have pledged to work to move the process forward and continue to renew that pledge at this time as we move forward with the bill. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute and say I have the greatest respect for the gentleman who just spoke, but I think the facts are a little bit different on cutting the air traffic controllers' compensation. This chart, in fact, shows an 81 percent salary increase since 1998. 
   Unfortunately, also, there's a disparity now of almost 40 percent between air traffic controllers and other FAA employees in what they receive as far as increases. So that just doesn't jibe with the facts. And I have the respect of the air traffic controllers, and they should be adequately compensated, and I'll support that. But we can't do an unprecedented reach-back and try to do something that's not fair to everyone. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute at this time. 
   Just in closing for my part, again I want to thank the chairmen of both the subcommittee and the full committee and our ranking member, Mr. Petri, for their work. 
   And I said at the beginning, we have an obligation to move this process forward. Mr. Petri and I are committed to that. 
   Now, we do disagree with some of the provisions that have been incorporated into this measure. We will cast our votes in opposition. But we are trying to move this forward. We have a responsibility. We have an aviation system that is approaching a meltdown. We have an increase in passengers, and we want the safest possible system. So in that spirit we are going to move forward, and I hope that we can improve the bill if we can get it to conference and if we can move forward. 
   Mr. Chairman, with that pledge, I am pleased now to yield the balance of my time to Mr. Petri minus the 45 seconds I allotted to the other side.

   Mr. MICA. I thank the ranking member, Mr. Petri. 
   Unfortunately, I have to rise, also, in opposition to the manager's amendment. I did cite that the poison pill that was added after introduction of the bill was, of course, the reach-back for Big Labor, which has a $1.9 billion price tag over 5 years. We've had problems with the FedEx provision, which unfairly targets that company. 
   I agreed to raise some fees, but then in the main bill we would divert some funds to bicycle storage. We open up multi-billion dollar funding for purposes like that that are hard to explain to people who want airports expanded and improvements and get something else. 
   We have some 40-now studies as a result of the manager's amendment, I think we're up to at least 40, and $25 million costs, not to mention additional earmarks for union. 
   The OSHA provision for regulation on airplanes added in this, I think it's important that we have safe cabins for passengers, but again, we can have a nightmare in imposing OSHA regulations where they're very difficult to enforce and create, again, a nightmare not only for enforcement, but for those who work on the aircraft and for those who are involved in commercial aviation. 
   Firefighting standards are important, but to impose them, and we tried to get some more reasonable standards, but to impose them arbitrarily at huge expense for small and medium airports that don't have the traffic that warrant some of these mandates from the Federal level, diversion of additional funds. We want our foreign repair stations to have the best certified mechanics; but when you put a provision in, that is contrary to international treaties and agreements. So the list goes on and on. I guess ranking member, Mr. Petri, said the bug control notification is sort of the icing on the cake of why we can't support the manager's amendment. Just some well-intended provisions, but misguided. 
   We certainly will work with the other side. We tried up until the introduction, and we will continue honest efforts to take their good intentions and put it into good legislation rather than a maze of costs, mandates, and burdens that don't get us where we need to be.

   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I join in recognizing the distinguished career of one of my former colleagues, the Honorable Dan Miller of Bradenton, FL. My friendship with Dan actually dates back more than four decades to 1962, when we were best friends and members of the Delta Chi fraternity at the University of Florida. Throughout my time in college, our post-college years and finally our years serving in the House of Representatives together from the great State of Florida, I have always cherished his friendship, admired his public service and enjoyed knowing his wife Glenda and their wonderful family. 
   Dan Miller will always be remembered in these Halls for his congenial nature, his leadership on a host of issues, and his commitment to fiscal restraint. When he ran for Congress, he was a staunch advocate of shrinking the size and scope of the Federal Government and reducing the impact of onerous Federal regulation in the lives of average Americans. He remained true to his convictions throughout his 10 years in this institution and would be proud to know that he will be remembered that way. He served as a Member of Congress with an appreciation for the history around him and a passion for the job and the goals he came to Washington to achieve that we would all be well-served to emulate. I know that I join family friends and colleagues in supporting this well-deserved recognition by Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (RECOGNIZING SEPTEMBER 11 AS A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Thank you for yielding, Mr. Davis. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution in remembrance on the eve of September 11, the sixth anniversary of the attack on the United States. I am pleased that the committee on which I serve, the Government Reform Committee, and leadership of the House is remembering those who were lost as a result of that tragic attack on the United States. 
   I wanted to come out tonight to also remember those that I knew and remember, just as every American who was alive on September 11, remembers where they were and who they knew and how they were affected. 
   The morning of September 11 I was invited by Secretary Rumsfeld to have breakfast with him in the Pentagon. The topic of discussion, as you may recall, was a new administration working under an old budget, but we downsized the military, and the Secretary was concerned about the possibility of the United States coming under some other type of threat. How ironic. 
   That morning we sat and discussed that subject in the Pentagon, the morning of September 11 and what would follow. I learned, just as the Secretary of Defense learned, of the attack just a few minutes, around 9 o'clock in the morning. 
   The irony of that day is that being in the Pentagon, and I left shortly before the plane hit the Pentagon, that Barbara Olson, who served the Government Reform Committee, was on the plane that hit the Pentagon. I will never forget, and I am not one of these guys that is sort of sentimental, but I remember seeing Barbara at a reception. She had left the committee, but she pecked me on the cheek as she said goodbye. I will never forget that goodbye. That was the last time I saw Barbara. She was on the plane that hit the Pentagon. 
   In the Pentagon was Terry Lynch. I was chief of staff for then-Senator Hawkins, and he worked with Senator Shelby from Alabama. I lost a good friend in Terry Lynch. 
   Seven weeks before September 11, I was invited by a fellow by the name of Neil Levin, who was legislative director for Alfonse D'Amato, to come up. I had been named the chairman of Aviation. Neil Levin had been named director of the New York Port Authority. 
   I spent time with Neil. We held a hearing with about 13 Members of Congress on Monday morning. We conducted a hearing in the World Trade Center hearing room. Afterwards Neil took me, my wife, and I think two or three other Members and their spouses that accompanied us for that occasion. 
   In the Windows on the World restaurant, on the side, the New York Port Authority had a little reception in the dining room, and Neil hosted lunch for my wife and myself after that hearing. Neil and just about everyone who helped us with that hearing 7 weeks before happened to be in that same dining room the morning of September 11, and all of them were killed. 
   I remember tonight Neil Levin, his family, his wife, those he left behind, and everyone who was with us as I left them in that room where they all died. The only one who survived was Bill Dakota, the airport director, who was at a conference in Montreal. 
   So tonight has a meaning I wanted to leave on the Record of the House of Representatives. I remember each and every one of those individuals. 
   I stood with my wife at Shanksville just a few weeks ago. I had not been there before. We remembered those great heroes. 
   I might say in closing, those of Flight 93, the first responders, all those who helped in America's darkest hour, we saw our brightest and our shining heroes. With this resolution tonight, we remember all of them.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR SECURE ELECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. I want to thank Ranking Member Ehlers and others for working on this bill. 
   I join in opposition to the legislation. First of all, let me say, my colleagues, there's nothing more important than the integrity of the election process in the United States and confidence that all Americans would have in making certain our system of election is secure. 
   But let me tell you, folks, this is compounding error and mistake Congress made, and here it is on Tax Day, 2008, that we're going to commit another two-thirds of a billion dollar mistake. 
   I sat on House Administration that oversees elections. I was there in 2000 when we had the problems in Florida with the hanging chads. We've all heard of the hanging chads. And everybody rushed here, and every vote's got to count; we've got to spend taxpayer dollars and make sure that every vote is counted; and we're going to put in a system, and we have to make it look like we're doing something to make certain that system's secure. 
   Now, we listened to the witnesses and they came before House Administration and they told folks that an electronic voting system, which would cost billions of dollars to implement, would have the possibility of error and just about the same percentage of error if you choose a lever, if you use a hanging chad ballot, if you use optical scan, if you use a paper ballot. And you can mess up any of those elections. 
   They told us. And then everybody rushed down. They voted it out of committee. We passed it. We spent $2 billion or $3 billion to put in place a system that they told us, well, somebody can pull the plug, the electronic thing doesn't work. Duh. Somebody can come up with some sort of electronic device. Even one of these might set it off and you might get some results. 
   They told us there might be errors, and they told us they didn't have a paper trail. Duh. 
   So here we are putting in place the system. On Tax Day, spend another two-thirds of a billion dollars. Keep working out there, Americans. Send it here because they'll spend it in some dumb fashion, and this follows that. 
   Now, we do want the system to work, but there are errors in everything. You heard them talking about the scan. 
   I went down and sat all night and watched the scan voting. It's simple. You just take a pen and you fill in the space. My God, I couldn't believe, hundreds of people, they put X's all the way around, they circled optical scan. They could screw up any kind of a ballot. A paper ballot. Actually I'm told that the old levers are probably the  best, that we took out for $2 billion or $3 billion worth of hard-earned taxpayer dollars and replaced with these electronic machines which now we're coming to correct. But they still have the same rate of error. 
   I guess it never stops around here. But here we are again spending that money on another whim. But we'll do it.

   And they make errors. Folks make errors. They just don't circle one and it's very clear. I'd love to bring the ballots here. Sometime I'll have to do that to show you how people can mess it up. But an informed electorate is the cornerstone of democracy.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman and Members of the House, Mr. Chabot and the Chair of the Small Business Committee, I am pleased to present another amendment, as I indicated in withdrawing the first amendment, that is not mandatory in nature, but does bring to light and address some of the problems that we have had with an interpretation of acquisitions under the GSA Federal supply schedule, some different interpretation. 
   This amendment would state that it is, in fact, a sense of the House of Representatives that small business set-asides should be excluded from any acquisitions under the General Services Administration Federal supply schedule. 
   Let me explain, if I may, for just a moment here. The Small Business Act was adopted by Congress to, in fact, ensure that small businesses would receive fair access and a fair share of Federal Government contracts and subcontracts. In fact, section 15 of the act requires that all contracts below $100,000 be reserved for small businesses. 
   But, unfortunately, there are some questions that have been raised. The Small Business Act also requires set-aside opportunities for service-disabled veterans, for businesses in distress, and companies owned by women and disadvantaged persons. However, again, here is where some of the problem lies. There is a disagreement between GSA, the General Services Administration, and SBA on whether the small business set-aside applies to acquisitions under the Federal GSA Federal supply schedule. 
   Because of this GSA-SBA disagreement on provisions of the Small Business Act, some small businesses, in fact, are being excluded from GSA contracting opportunities; and that's not our intent. 
   What's taken place on September 4, 2007, just a short time ago, SBA issued an opinion that Small Business Act set-aside requirements do apply to the GSA schedule. My amendment today would only state that it is a sense of the House of Representatives that the small business set-aside should not be excluded from any acquisition under GSA's Federal supply schedule. 
   We tried to send a polite message. Part of my reason for being here is one of the small business persons in my district, Raul Espinosa, he is a St. Augustine small business owner, his company is a small business, again, in the heart of my district. He has a company called Fit Net Purchasing Alliance and Fit Net, is, in fact, a disadvantaged minority and emerging small business. They operate as a buying group specializing but not limited to athletic, wellness and rehab market segments. 
   This small business operator brought this to my attention, and it is a great example of how this system should work. When the agencies don't work, when you have lack of understanding and definition and law, or in procedures, it's small businesses and someone like Raul Espinosa who has brought to my attention, as his elected representative, some of the problems that have arisen.  
   This is a clarification amendment. We may want to go beyond this, as the chairlady has indicated her willingness to do, and possibly from my side of the aisle I think we can work together and make this work the way it's intended. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, while not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim time in opposition.

We are going to celebrate Memorial Day this weekend. We are still waiting for an energy plan. What have the Democrats done so far as an energy plan? Well, let's just take a look at it. 
   This is a spoon from the House cafeteria. They bought this spoon at great expense to the taxpayers, and it is a green spoon. In fact, it melts in your coffee. This is Exhibit 1. What have the Democrats done when gas is $4? Well, go down to the gift store and you will see these Green the Capitol bags. So now we have, at greater expense to the taxpayer, printed these little Green the Capitol bags. 
   Now what is the centerpiece of their energy policy when you're going to pay $4 a gallon and more around the country for gasoline? They are going to change the light and green the light on the top of the Capitol. Just the study, I'm told, is going to be $800,000, and then millions of dollars. And $4 gas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Speaker, I plan to vote to sustain the President's veto on H.R. 6331. 
   I wanted to clarify my action to sustain the President's veto on H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. First let me say that I in no way support a 10.6 percent reduction in payment to our physicians that participate in Medicare, nor do I support the meager .5 percent increase to physicians in this legislation. Both the proposed cuts and the increase are an insult to one of our Nation's most honorable and vital professions. 
   I did not support this measure when it came before the House of Representatives because of the aforementioned reasons, and furthermore I think it is degrading to the medical profession to force physicians and medical professionals to come before Congress time and time again since 2002 and most recently in December of last year to plead with Congress not to cut their Medicare reimbursements for services rendered. 
   The override of this Presidential veto is not a victory for the medical profession, the American Medical Association or the hard working dedicated physicians that I represent. In fact passage of this measure over the President's veto only exacerbates the situation and in 18 months physicians will face the prospect of a 20 percent cut in their payment. Furthermore this bill takes an estimated $48 billion from the Medicare Advantage Program--a program designed to provide our seniors with choices. 
   It is imperative that Congress address the deteriorating condition of the Medicare program and enacts corrective measures that will keep this reoccurring nightmare cast upon our medical professionals from happening again in the future. What is even worse, the bill has proposed budget gimmicks that will contribute to further unnecessary increases in Medicare spending and aid in the further financial destruction of the Medicare program. 
   Congress must get serious and address the deficiencies in our Medicare system especially as we face an onslaught of baby boomers soon to be eligible for the program.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1401, RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I do rise in opposition to this rule. 
   I have been here for 15 years, and this is probably one of the most egregious efforts to deny committees of jurisdiction input into this very important legislation. 
   We just heard from Mr. Lungren, a very distinguished Member and ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee. He stated again the partisan nature of the Rules decision. The Chair on the Republican side, the ranking member of that committee, Mr. King, indicated that there were zero amendments. Unprecedented. On the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, there were zero amendments accepted. 
   So I must strongly encourage that we vote against this rule. Again, in my experience, I have never heard of such an egregious abuse of minority rights or participation in the process. 
   Most importantly, I think that one of the amendments that we offered from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, while the manager's amendment does have some improvements in taking these important security grants from DHS, which has had difficulty in managing all their responsibilities, and we have the money going through DHS and the grants administered by the Department of Transportation, which is an improvement, it has been my experience that it is not how much money you spend, it is how you spend it. We had an amendment that offered a vast improvement, which was to conduct a needs and risk assessment on security risks relating to transit and rail, which has never been conducted. 
   So we are going to take $6 billion of hard-earned taxpayer money and put it through this system that I just described and not really address that money to the real threats and risks that we face. I don't think that is wise. 
   This weekend I spent some time in Pennsylvania. I went through a couple of towns and I saw a lot of people. I saw some tough towns in some of the rural areas traveling up there. But I saw a lot of people going to work and working hard, sending their money to Washington. They are counting on us to be good stewards of that money and to spend that money. 
   Our number one responsibility is the safety and security of those people, and here we are abandoning that responsibility. So they work very hard out there to send that money here and now see it not properly applied. 
   That is wrong, and I will oppose this rule.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Rule, H. Res. 270, for the consideration of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. 
   I strongly support effective security measures for America's railroads, transit systems, and intercity buses. 
   But the funding authorization levels in the bill that will be brought up today are based on a phony estimate of the surface transportation security needs. 
   The $6 billion authorized in H.R. 1401 is based on a 2003 member survey conducted by the American Public Transportation Association. 
   There was no discipline to the APTA survey--anyone could ask for anything they thought they might need at any time. 
   Yesterday, I offered two amendments to the Rules Committee, both of which were rejected on a straight party-line vote. 
   The first amendment was simply a requirement that DHS and DOT determine what the security needs of the Nation's transit systems and railroads are before authorizing $6 billion in grants. 
   This amendment was supported by the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Yet the Rules Committee refused to allow the amendment to be considered. 
   I also proposed an amendment to expand the current whistleblower protection law for both the safety and security of railroad employees under the Railway Labor Act. 
   This effective whistleblower protection law in title 49 of the U.S. Code has been in place since 1970. This law covers the reporting of all hazardous conditions, whether related to safety or security. 
   Under the Railway Labor Act whistleblower protection, railroad employees are fully protected against termination, harassment or discrimination. 
   There is absolutely no good reason to replace this functional and effective law with new whistleblower protection requirements under the Department of Labor. Don't fix it if it isn't broken. 
   But this amendment, despite support from both the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was also rejected by the Rules Committee on a party-line vote. 
   I strongly oppose this Rule. 
   The bill development was not bipartisan, and it is obvious that the development of the Rule was completely partisan. 
   The Democrat-led Congress's unwillingness to work with Republicans on this bill flies in the face of Speaker Pelosi's commitment to work in an open and bipartisan manner. 
   It's a shame that this Congress has put politics ahead of effective security for the traveling public.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would have liked to have come to the floor and supported this bill. However, the more I learn  about some of the provisions of the manager's amendment that will be offered, the more I learn about some of the special interest provisions that have been put in this bill in the name of some special interest, as opposed to national security, I find myself inclined to vote against the measure and final passage, if it continues as it is now crafted. 
   First of all, I truly believe that the security grants that are provided for under the provisions of this legislation will not prevent terrorist attacks. This isn't always a question, as I said earlier on the rule, of how much money we spend. I have no problem as a Member of Congress spending money on rail and transit security. It is how we effectively spend that money. 
   This bill is not going to prevent a Madrid, where cell phones and backpacks were used. This is not going to prevent a London, where clean, unknown suicide bombers exercised their will and slaughtered many people, both aboveground and underground. 
   I was there just weeks before and saw some of the measures that they put in place. Now they were nice surveillance measures, but we can't make the same mistakes. If we want to stop terrorism, we are going to have to penetrate the organizations, the finances and the communications of individuals that are willing to take their own lives and others. This bill is not going to, as it is crafted, provide that. 
   The other thing that was prohibited from both the Homeland Security Committee and the T&I Committee was the ability to amend this. As we saw this product developing, we did not put in a needs assessment or risk assessment, which has never been done for rail or transit security, so we don't know where to spend the money. 
   We heard some of the Members saying we are going to have 600 inspectors. Do we need those 600 inspectors? Someone else said we are going to make these grants available to unions. Is that the best interest or is that serving some special interest? 
   So I have grown to have some very serious concerns about the provisions of this legislation. And the American Association of Railroads has said that, in fact, this is going to dismantle safety and security as we know it under existing law with the preemption clause that has been provided here. 
   So from State to State under the provisions of the way this manager's amendment is crafted, the regulations will vary. Can you imagine a train going from jurisdiction to jurisdiction under those circumstances? 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I wish I could have come to the floor today and supported this measure, because rail and transit security are extremely important and it is one of our most important responsibilities as representatives of the people. People are working hard, trying to make a living, raise their families. They send us here to know the facts. And I can tell you, the facts are that this bill was done in haste, particularly the manager's amendment. It is a great example for the House of Representatives and the majority, the new majority and the minority. Because when you subvert and do not conduct yourself in the process that the Founding Fathers had envisioned, a bipartisan approach to crafting legislation, you get yourself tied up in these little knots. Now they are finding flaws in this legislation left and right, deregulating State traffic and railroads. They are scurrying around trying to figure out how are we going to fix this. 
   This is not the way to do the people's business, particularly on an important issue like security. So I will go home and tell people why I voted against this. Many others can go home and say, I voted $7 billion or $8 billion of your money for rail and transit security. But what did it do? Unfortunately, it didn't do the job we need to do in the situation we find ourselves in with terrorist threats and what we have seen in the rest of the world. We are abdicating our responsibility.

   I have to speak against the manager's amendment because the sponsor of the manager's amendment just stood and admitted to a flaw that is in the bill. Again, this is a lesson to all of us that if we craft these pieces of important legislation, we put partisan politics aside. This isn't the place for partisan politics. This is a national security issue critical to the survival of our people. If we put those aside and we work together on this, we wouldn't find ourselves tied in this little legislative knot that they are trying to figure out: Should we pass this flawed manager's amendment? 
   The bad news is that the flawed provision in section 3 of the manager's amendment allows every State to effectively override safety rules. That is the great part of this system, that the minority and the majority work together and craft legislation and we find some flaws and make some improvements, and we were denied that. The T&I side was denied even one amendment. 
   That is why I opposed the rule, and that is why I am going to oppose the manager's amendment, and that is why I am going to oppose this bill. 
   I will go back and tell folks in my district, I did not vote for this, and it was $7 billion, not because I didn't want to provide security, but I wanted to make sure that their hard-earned  money was well spent and we didn't pass in an arbitrary fashion, ignore the rights of the majority and the minority, legislation that would benefit this country, especially in the situation we find ourselves with the terrorist threats we have seen. 
   We don't want a Madrid or a London, but I don't want politics to override what should be good legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank our ranking member, Mr. LaTourette, for yielding time to me, and I am pleased to speak on an important reauthorization measure, and that's reauthorization of our Coast Guard. Unfortunately, I'm told that even if we pass this bill today, and it will not be passed in totality, it still must be conferenced with the other body, that this authorization is only good through the end of this fiscal year. And, unfortunately, this reauthorization has been delayed, and we will find ourselves back at the beginning gate, starting gate, so to speak. That's one of my disappointments. 
   First, though, before I get into my disappointments, let me commend, first of all, our ranking member, Mr. LaTourette. He's worked tirelessly as the Republican leader of the Coast Guard Subcommittee to try to bring this reauthorization legislation together. He's taken some absolutely terrible proposals that first came out and made them much, much better, and I commend Mr. LaTourette for his hard work on this and trying to reach compromise. 
   I also compliment Mr. Oberstar, my counterpart in the committee, heads up the Democrat side, our chairman, for his efforts to try to bring about bipartisan compromise on the legislation. Mr. Cummings, the chairman of the Coast Guard Subcommittee, has worked with our ranking member. 
   So I thank all of them. Their efforts have been good, and I'm going to cast a vote in favor of this to move the process forward, and I think that's incumbent in my particular position to try to continue to make the bill better. 
   This is a good reauthorization start. I do have two major concerns that I want to say that I am not pleased with, the administration is not pleased with, and I think the United States Coast Guard is not pleased with. 
   First of all, I have opposition to two provisions. Let me speak about the first one, and one you heard a lot about, the safety regime that's created in this bill. Unfortunately, this particular provision, while it may sound good that the safety is being addressed, it really destroys the command and control function that is so essential in a national security agency. 
   Now the Coast Guard's primary responsibility is one of national security. It's also safety, but it is first and foremost, a national security agency. And this regime sets up an unprecedented bureaucracy. It also destroys the command approach that we have had in our services. 
   In fact, it would prescribe the duties, qualifications, and set up a chain of command of senior Coast Guard officials. This represents an extraordinary intrusion upon the service chiefs' authority to command and control a branch of the Armed Forces and, ultimately, the ability of the Secretary and the President to deploy the Coast Guard in an emergency. 
   Now this isn't just my evaluation. This is the Coast Guard, this is the administration, the President's evaluation of what the current language would do. 
   Unfortunately again, we still have this provision that needs to be worked on, and we need to make certain that national security, the ability to command and control a branch of the armed services is not damaged. 
   The second reason that I have concern about this legislation is that unfortunately, the waterside security provisions here that relate to liquefied natural gas terminals and liquefied natural gas tankers requires the Coast Guard to provide security in a manner that is contrary to the existing assistance framework and also at odds with assisted risk-management practices. 
   In simple layman's terms, what's happening is right now when we're having a difficulty of getting a supply of natural gas, and gas prices are soaring. People are seeing natural gas prices reach record levels. We're creating more redtape, more impediments and setting up another regime in which we will limit the supply and also actually create more impediments to getting the supply so the cost can go down and the people who have access to probably one of the best sources of energy has the least amount of damage of any of the fossil fuels to our environment. 
   So those are my two concerns. 
   But, again, I'm going to support the measure. I'm hoping that through conference, we can make the bill much better, that we can address the command regime that's set up here in a new safety bureaucracy, that we can also make certain that we have a supply of liquefied natural gas, access to liquefied natural gas and also bring the prices down for the consumer who's under incredible pressure right now trying to pay bills, meet the costs of increasing energy. 
   So those are my concerns. 
   Again, I want to thank all of the members who've worked on this in the committee, the ranking member Mr. LaTourette, Mr. Oberstar, and Mr. Cummings for their efforts.

   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to come to the floor during what I consider to be probably one of the most important issues that we will consider, not only in this 100 hours, but in this entire session of Congress, because this issue determines and will determine the very security, not just the security as far as a terrorist attack on this Nation, but even our economic security; and the actions that are taken here have great implications. 
   While I believe that my good friends on the other side of the aisle are very well intended in what they propose today, unfortunately I believe they are misguided in what they are doing. 
   I have a copy of the 9/11 Commission report. I chaired for some 6 years the Aviation Subcommittee. I inherited it by fate of the good Lord and circumstances here in Congress. I followed from the very beginning the creation of TSA and all of the actions that we have taken from day one in protecting this great Nation against a terrorist attack.     
   I have read the proposals that are brought forth here today. Unfortunately, these proposals can result in turning in the wrong direction at this time in our vulnerability against terrorist attack. Let me be very frank, and I offered before, and I am sorry that the other side did not accept it, unanimous consent requests that we resolve into a committee for 1 hour, 1 hour of a secret session to discuss the pending threats against this Nation and also the status of our security systems in place to deal with those threats, and I was denied it. As part of the record of this Congress, now, I was denied that opportunity. 
   There are 54 Members who were elected, new Members, Republican and Democrat, who have not had access to that classified information. They will vote in a few hours on turning the direction of the system that we have put in place and a system we are trying to make work to protect us against a terrorist attack, and we have been denied the opportunity for 1 hour in closed session, with no cameras, no public, but the classified reports. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask that the titles of each of the classified reports that now are in possession of the Transportation Committee be included in this part of the RECORD.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (BARRING ACCESS OF LONG-HAUL MEXICAN TRUCKS -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. I appreciate the ranking member of our highway subcommittee, Mr. Duncan, yielding to me. And appreciate the hard work Mr. DeFazio, who chairs this subcommittee, has put into this legislation, and also Mr. Oberstar and others. 
   I apologize in actually getting in front of my ranking member of the subcommittee, but have a number of Senators and Representatives waiting on me. 
   I just want to weigh in and say that I support this legislation. I do want to also set, for the record, the conditions under which this administration is acting. 
   First of all, I voted against NAFTA back in 1993. It was touted as going to be the best thing since sliced bread for the country. While it has increased some exports and some opportunities on both sides of the border, I believe, overall, it sent many jobs south, and unfortunately, it hasn't been all that it was made out to be. 
   Additionally, one of the reasons I voted against NAFTA was, as far as the North American Free Trade Agreement, trading with Canada was a pretty level playing field. Trading with Mexico isn't the same deal. And within the original language was a provision that allowed Mexican trucks to transverse our borders and come into the United States, which I was opposed to then, and am opposed to now. Now, that has been contested over the years, both in the Clinton administration, also during the Bush administration. 
   Within, also, the language of NAFTA, folks should realize that they set up a panel, a NAFTA panel, to be the arbiter and the judge of how the U.S. must act. We really relegated our sovereignty to a panel, again, within NAFTA, which, every time the United States has acted in a contrary fashion to the provisions of the treaty, has ruled against the United States. 
   So here the Bush administration takes a minimal project, moves it forward. And it is a minimal. There is a limit on the number of trucks that can cross, et cetera. 
   But Congress has the authority now to stop that program, and I think this is the time to stop that program. There are those in Congress who have to make a decision whether they want these trucks now to continue. We don't have to comply with some agreement. Actually, we passed the treaty, and Congress has the responsibility now to act properly and stop, really, what they started, which was not in the interest of the United States in having, again, fleets of Mexican trucks come across our borders. 
   So this legislation stops a whole host of bad decisions that have been made in the past. And I strongly support this, in spite of any threats from anybody to act in stopping this legislation. We need to pass this legislation. We need to act responsibly and act now.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (AUTHORIZING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY REPAIRS AND RECONSTRUCTION OF INTERSTATE I-35 BRIDGE IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA -- (House of Representatives - August 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3311 and join the gentleman from Minnesota whose State and area has been hit by this terrible, horrible tragedy that's taken lives. 
   And on our side of the aisle, when we do have a national tragedy of this nature, we do try to pull together in a bipartisan manner to address the needs of people who have suffered this type of, again, horrible disaster. 
   I know that the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) has taken a leadership role today in approving this money; and I'm pleased, as the Republican leader, to also come forward and lend our support for this authorization. 
   Now, many people have asked me what we're doing here today. And we are authorizing $250 million for repair and reconstruction of the I-35 bridge over the Mississippi River. Now that's authorization and Federal authorization. It is not funding, and there must be appropriations. 
   I might say that we're doing that because the authorization fund, the Highway Emergency Relief Fund, unfortunately, we had $100 million and it's depleted. Not only is that $100 million depleted but also the reserve and additional money that was put in in the supplemental is depleted. So that's why we're doing this for our friends and colleagues and those who have suffered this loss in Minnesota. 
   It's my hope that this bridge will be built in rapid order and replaced; and I know that the good custodians in Minnesota, with their Transportation Department, will work to see that happen. 
   But let me say that the Minnesota bridge is only, unfortunately, the tip of the iceberg in an aging infrastructure and transportation system that we have in this country. We have, out of almost 600,000 bridges, about 80,000 bridges that are structurally deficient. Twenty-seven percent of our bridges are structurally deficient or obsolete, according to one of the most recent studies; and the infrastructure, not  just in bridges but in highways, in ports, in airports, in rail, is inadequate and it's outdated. 
   I proposed as a solution recently a national strategic transportation plan. The American Council of Civil Engineers has estimated this will take $1.7 trillion. 
   We need a national plan to restore our infrastructure from sea to shining sea, where we have congestion, where we have bridges falling into our rivers and where we have inadequate infrastructure on which to conduct the business of this country or just get around our congested communities. 
   So we need a bigger plan, and then we need a way to finance that plan, and I look forward to working with all of the Members in trying to develop that plan and with this administration and the next administration.     
   So finally, as I close with my initial thoughts, I want to say that our prayers go out to the people of Minnesota, especially the families of those affected by this tragedy. And I pledge from our side of the aisle again to work with every Member in Congress and with the folks in Minnesota to bring things back to regular order there. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I will yield myself the balance of our time. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, Mr. Oberstar, I thank you for paying attention to the important responsibility you have, not only as Chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee but as a good steward for the people of your State in a time of need. 
   And, you know, it's amazing what we can do in this House. It's absolutely incredible. Mr. Young has been here for many years, and I have always looked up to him as one of our leaders. We started some years ago, senior to me, but I followed his career and what he has been able to do on a bipartisan basis. 
   And when we do have an emergency, whether it's 9/11 or whether it's a bridge that collapses in Minnesota, it's amazing what this House of Representatives can do when it comes together in a bipartisan fashion. That tragedy just occurred a matter of hours ago, and here we are, in our system, working together, helping those people. We're not going to solve this all by the Federal Government; and, as I said, this is only an authorization. But people are in need, and we came together, as this body is designed to do. 
   But, as I said, the bridge is just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. Our Nation's infrastructure is collapsing. Our Nation's infrastructure is obsolete. We have got to come together. 
   We came together, Mr. Oberstar and I, with a Water Resources bill that hadn't been passed in 7 years, but we brought it here, it is now pending final approval, to build the Nation's dams and infrastructure, also important. And we see that if you don't pay now, you will pay later. 
   So we can do this. We can make the investment to build the infrastructure that makes our economy grow, that makes this a great country and allows free enterprise to give us the great life that we've had in this wonderful country. 
   So I look forward, Mr. Oberstar, to finalizing this with you and helping the people in this time of need and also in taking on a leadership position as we make the investment in our country that is so necessary in our infrastructure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (FEDERAL RAILROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Thank you, Mr. Shuster, for yielding me time, and also for managing the time today on this bill. Mr. Shuster is doing an outstanding job in leading the Republican side of the Rail Subcommittee, and I appreciate his fine efforts. Also, the great efforts of my colleague from Florida (Ms. Corrine Brown), who chairs the subcommittee. And indeed, we are fortunate to have someone with Mr. Oberstar's leadership at our helm, chairing the committee after a long wait of some 32 years. I know this has been one of his priorities, rail safety, and I'm pleased that he has an opportunity to bring his bill to the floor today. 
   Now, of course, ladies and gentlemen of the House, my colleagues, we all want safe rail, we want safe infrastructure in our Nation, and it is important that we do everything possible to move safety forward and to make certain that freight rail, passenger rail, that our crossings, that those that work and are employed in this great industry are as safe as possible. And I think that that was the original intent. 
   Now, let me say that I have an agreement with Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown and Mr. Shuster to support this bill on passage, and I intend to put my card in the reader and I will vote ``yes.'' That doesn't prohibit me from talking a little bit about the bill and the genesis of this bill.     
   Now, the intent is one thing about this legislation, and I think, again, it was safety and well-intended. But unfortunately, I think we started out with a bad bill. 
   The other side won the election, and there were some presents to be presented to labor. This doesn't have a red bow on it. But this started out as something I think that was sort of a gift to labor from the election. It is nice to approach legislation from that standpoint. But I think we have been able to take what I consider a very bad bill, that its intention was to actually codify some of the labor work rules relating to our rail industry. We have taken that bad legislation, and we have made it a little bit better. I think we still have a ways to go. 
   There are some good things in this. Mr. Oberstar pointed out that we did take the number one recommendation of the NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board. That is the board that does investigate accidents. It is important that we take from them the best information they have possible and then translate that into legislative action so that accident doesn't occur. So, one, we have taken their recommendation, a positive train separation, and it is part of this bill. I am complimentary of that. 
   I think Mr. Graves, the gentleman from Missouri, a member of our committee and outstanding subcommittee Chair, I am sorry, ranking member, of the Public Buildings Subcommittee, his crossing prioritization for changing out dangerous crossings is an excellent provision. I think also that there is a good provision in this for acquiring some of the technical equipment. You have to understand, Mr. Shuster said there are very few accidents. In fact, the latest statistics that we have, there were 16 employee deaths in 2006. Only six of the deaths involved train accidents. So it is a very low number. That is compared to 25 of 33 employee deaths in 1996. So there is substantial improvement in that regard. 
   But if you look at some of the factors, and we have the factors that cause train accidents, you find the human factor is number one. It accounts for some 35, almost 36 percent of train accidents. This bill doesn't do enough, really, to deal with the human factors, in my opinion. Some of that involves training and some other things that we should be addressing. 
   The second is track defects. I had a chance, when I was going to college, I worked 16 hours a day, 7 days a week on the rail to finance my college education, part of it, and I got to see some of what happens on the railroads firsthand. Track defects today are very difficult to detect just by some of the measures that we have, for example, in this bill. 
   This bill mandates that we have almost a doubling of track inspectors. Now, that is a nice gift also to the unions. We will get a few more union members. But is that what we need when the way to really detect track defects is with the latest technology and equipment? I did say the bill has authorization for acquisition of, I think, six additional track testing pieces of equipment. But if we really want to do that, we should be spending not just more money on bodies and inspectors and routine inspections, increasing those, kind of makework; we should be, first of all, making certain that we have a risk-based inspection system. 
   When I become chairman of Aviation, that was one of the things we did in Aviation, and I gave my blessings to, back in 1991. We have enjoyed the safest period of aviation safety, passenger aircraft safety, in the history of our Nation. I believe that is because it is a risk-based system. Rather than going out on a Monday, we are going to inspect this piece of equipment and then we schedule that for the next month on Monday and we go back and we do it and we add inspectors, we look at where the risks are and that is where we put our resources. It is not always how much we spend; it is how we spend it and how we apply those dollars. 
   Again, I have some questions about the approach in this bill. We do have an agreement. I am pleased to support this. My hope is that we can take this bill as we have done working with Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Mr. Shuster, and we can craft it into a better piece of legislation as it goes hopefully through conference, and I will support it. 
   In closing, there are some questions about the amendments. I will support the manager's amendment which I agreed to. The other three Members have asked me, and I say, you pick and choose. Mr. Oberstar and I did not make the decision on the three other amendments the Rules Committee brought forth, and you will have to assess them as to their own merits. 
   It is important that we take this legislation up. It is important that we move together in a bipartisan fashion. I have a little bit different set of priorities, again, on some of the issues that we have addressed in the legislation. But I have a fond hope that through a bipartisan future effort we can approve this legislation and continue to make certain that our rail employees, our rail passengers and those that cross the railroad tracks in our communities are safe.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, first of all, I would like to urge all Members of the House on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 1495, which is known as the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   As we have heard from the chairman, this bill authorizes and directs the Corps of Engineers to carry out various studies, projects and programs relating to navigation, flood damage reduction, shoreline protection, dam safety, shoreline protection and recreation and environmental restoration and protection. 
   Our subcommittee, led by Mr. Baker of Louisiana, held two days of hearings on projects, programs and policies during the development of this legislation. After a careful review, the committee was able to approve the authorization of more than 50 projects with the chiefs' reports relating to flood damage reduction, navigation, hurricane and storm damage reduction, and environmental restoration. 
   We also have in this legislation, navigation and ecosystem restoration projects for the upper Mississippi River. Illinois waterway system, and Everglades restoration project, which I would like to talk about in just a moment, and conserving and restoring the Louisiana coastal area. 
   We have in the bill a provision for streamlining and expediting the Corps of Engineers' project delivery and permits system. We have provisions for improvement of the Corps of Engineers' planning and project development process, including independent peer review of larger and more controversial studies. We also have authorization of a number of smaller project modifications, investigations, related to our civil works programs of the Corps of Engineers. I think all in all we have a good piece of legislation that we have worked on in a bipartisan fashion, and you see the product before us today. 
   Now, I know the administration has issued a position opposing this legislation. However, I want to talk to a couple of points that they have raised. They do have a responsibility to be good trustees of the public monies and  the difficult situation we find ourselves in financially. 
   But in this legislation between 3 and $4 billion would be typically spent during a WRDA cycle or authorization process on this type of legislation. We have not had a bill since the year 2000. So actually if you do simple math on that, you can see that the total cost of this bill in Federal dollars, $13.1 billion, is reasonable. The total cost with the State participation is $17.8 billion. But we do, indeed, have a backlog of projects over what would amount to at least three cycles. So this WRDA bill, this authorization legislation, in fact, combines the equivalent of all of those years of backlog of projects. The price tag, in fact, is consistent with that assumption. 
   While this bill is considered costly by some, the 2005 WRDA legislation contained almost 900 projects. That is another complaint of the administration, too many projects. This bill contains 682 project provisions. Not that Mr. Oberstar, myself, Ms. Johnson, Mr. Baker haven't had Members throughout the Congress come to us and beg and plead to have additional projects that are critical to their district included in this legislation. I think we, too, have been good custodians and responsible in crafting this legislation. 
   Let me say that the administration also raised some questions about cost benefits. We have gone through this. Mr. Oberstar, myself, Mr. Baker, Ms. Johnson, we have looked at cost benefits. We have done our very best to ensure that the taxpayers' dollars again are well spent and there is a good return for the investment that is being made here by the Federal taxpayer. 
   So those are the reasons that I disagree with my administration on this. I actively support this. I think we have done this in a very good fashion. 
   Finally, I want to talk to some of the measures that are in the bill. You have heard the chairman talk about some of the measures that are in this bill. This bill is important to me, not only as a Member of Congress, and I don't represent the Everglades, but I do represent the State of Florida. It is interesting how it takes time to undo some of the damage that mankind has done to our natural resources and national treasures. 
   I have a copy of the Palm Beach Post, which I kept in a file, from Sunday, April 11, 1993, irony, same month a number of years ago, talking about the Everglades, reversing man's mistakes. I started working on that along with the Clinton administration, Secretary Babbitt. Hear is an article from July 4, 1994, about a $465 million government industry agreement to start cleaning up the Everglades, which had been damaged by man's abuse. 
   Here is another article I pulled from the news journal Daytona Beach News-Journal that says: ``Representative John Mica and the other Members of central Florida's House delegation are in a fortunate position to finish the work the Senate started.'' This is the year 2000. Here we are in 2007. 
   Now, in 2000 we authorized a study. What is important about this bill is we authorize for the first time projects that actually do construction and work in restoring our precious national treasure, and Florida's national environmental treasure, the Everglades.     
   So that is one reason why I am excited about this piece of legislation. It does take a long time and a lot of money. 
   Finally, I do want to also cite that I just inherited the responsibility of the Transportation leader on the Republican side, and I never realized how important these projects are to individual Members. For example, not on our side of the aisle, but Ms. Matsui, a Democrat Member, she has a project in here that would provide a 100-year level of flood protection for the city of Sacramento. Almost a million Americans live in the capital of California, more than twice the population of the pre-Katrina New Orleans that today has only an 80-year level of flood protection. No other community in America of this size has this little flood protection. This is a project important to Ms. Matsui. 
   There are not Republican projects, there are not Democrat projects; there are projects for the people that are important to their survival. And we have seen the mistakes and the errors of our ways in Katrina. Mr. Baker can speak to what he has gone through in Louisiana. We need not repeat those errors. 
   So here we have in this legislation an opportunity to help her and 299 other districts. I wish it was 435. So it has been put together in a bipartisan way. 
   And finally, on my effort, I tried to do it in a transparent way. All of the Republican projects have been on file, open to the public, and any of the earmarks, open to public and press scrutiny. So I have tried to do it in a manner that restores public faith, because I would rather have elected Members of Congress make those decisions, fight for them, and have it done and conducted in a transparent fashion rather than have some bureaucrat down there decide where the taxpayer money, which they just paid in in huge amounts over the past week to Washington, get expended. That is our responsibility, it is elected officials' responsibility, not appointed bureaucrats who don't have the responsibility we have under the Constitution. 
   So, again, I recognize my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Johnson and Mr. Baker. I also want to thank Mr. Costello, who is no longer the Chair or the ranking member, and Mr. Duncan, who was the Chair because this is an inherited work. Again, several bills are combined that are long overdue. So I urge their passage. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MICA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First of all, I rise in strong support of the manager's amendment. Mr. Oberstar, after the election, became the Chair, I became the ranking member of the Transportation Committee. And we inherited, indeed, a huge backlog of projects. We also inherited a bill that required earmarking because they are Members' projects, and everyone knows the problems that we have had with earmarks in the past. So I can assure the Members that on both sides of the aisle we have done everything possible to vet these projects. I am also sorry that we can't put even more projects in. 
   We just had Mrs. BONO here, and her heart and soul in her work in Congress, which is something she inherited, actually the work, too, of her late husband, Sonny Bono, a good friend and colleague.     
   She wanted that so badly in this, and it is so important, the restoration of the Salton Sea, for her district. You can see how important these projects are to Members and their districts. So we have a good work product. 
   Let me make one point I did not make in opposition to the administration's position on this piece of legislation in that it cost too much. If you look at 2000 when we started these projects, maybe they did cost $5 million. I can tell you that just with inflation and the cost of doing construction projects, having been in the development business, that every day we delay will cost us more; and that is why these projects cost us more, and that is why I am in opposition to the administration's point there. 
   We have evenly divided the projects. I don't think we could have had a fairer distribution. They are Republican, they are not Democrat, but they are of national and district importance, and I think we have done as good a job as you can. I am sure you can find something wrong or questionable, if anyone seeks to do that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the manager's amendment, and I urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to move and urge the passage of this bill, not only through the House but through the other body and conference, so that we can do a better job for the people that we represent in these important environmental and water resources projects. 
   I thank the gentleman.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding me time and also for presenting my amendment. 
   My amendment would have required that the Department of Transportation participate in the infrastructure study that is required by this legislation. My amendment ensures that the government transportation experts are fully utilized to identify cost-effective measures for protecting critical infrastructure. Right now, as the bill is drafted, it is just limited to Homeland Security leading that effort. 
   Because our highest risk in this center is involved in addressing risks, terrorist risks, our highest risks are transportation and infrastructure under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation, it would only be logical to include them in this effort. I believe the bill as drafted was a mistake, and why the Congress would require a critical infrastructure study like this and not include the Federal agency that has the expertise and the private sector relationships necessary to get the job done. So, again, I have concerns about doing this further directive by the bill. 
   If you stop to look at what the risks are as far as terrorist risks: Look at the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center; look at the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack; look at the Oklahoma City bombing against an infrastructure facility; look at the 9/11 attack using aviation transportation equipment on the World Trade Center and on the Pentagon; look at the Madrid train bombings; look at the London underground train and bus bombings. 
   What do they all have in common? They have in common transportation. What does the provision that they have included in this bill have in it? Homeland Security, with no participation with the Department of Transportation. The Department of Transportation also handles these transportation and infrastructure issues and really should be a part of this study if it in fact goes forward. 
   Now, consider some of our greatest concerns, attacks on hazardous materials, pipelines, chlorine gas, tank cars and transit systems. These are all areas regulated by DOT. And they want to leave them out of this study. The DOT has a long working relationship with all of these transportation and infrastructure issues, and I believe DOT would be a vital partner in assessing the risks and economic analysis associated with the terrorist attacks on our critical infrastructure. 
   And part of the study here is to find out how to get the private sector to participate in this. Who else would be better equipped, a bureaucracy of 177,000 or whatever it is up to, 200,000, in Homeland Security that doesn't have a clue or people who actually work with people in transportation, on transportation projects and with those projects and systems that may be at risk? 
   Including DOT will help us avoid problems like throwing billions of dollars at transit systems without understanding its impact on our economy and mobility. 
   I should point out finally that DOT is already involved in some of the critical infrastructure planning, and my amendment is simply an extension of that effort. It is a reasonable amendment. It doesn't replace or duplicate the Department of Homeland Security or diminish their role over these critical infrastructure protection efforts. And if other appropriate agencies or sectors are being left out, I think they should also be included in the effort. But to leave out DOT is to leave out the success that we need to make any kind of study or future partnership of working together to address terrorist risks and threats.     
   So I thank also Ms. Castor from my State of Florida for offering an amendment today.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   My colleagues, I have spent some time on transportation security as chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee for some 6 years, helping to craft some of the TSA legislation, working actually with the 9/11 Commission. 
   First of all, if anyone thinks that this bill is going to make us safer by any of the major provisions in the bill, they are wrong. They are dead wrong. What is unfortunate is they are adopting today in this so-called 9/11 Commission Report many things that will actually take our limited resources and put us greater at risk by diverting those resources to programs that make no sense. And I will try to show you in a few minutes. 
   First of all, let's look at the major provisions of this bill. First, cargo security, maritime cargo security. Here is a picture of one of the test cargo security maritime screening operations. I brought a little model, I made my own little model to show you how this works. There is the truck going through there. It goes through. You can either have a fixed location for this screening equipment or a portable one; they can move it around. Then the truck goes through the screening like that. And then when it goes through, we have completed that. Then we take the cargo. 
   Now, if you have been to the ports, and I have been to the foreign ports that they are requiring this procedure for, this cargo goes and it sits on the dock somewhere. It may be days, weeks before it is ever loaded. What a complete farce for cargo containers to go through this exercise.  
   Then if you have been to the ports, let's try Marseilles, I have been to Marseilles, let's try Livorno. Let's try others. What about this guy who is a dock worker? That dock worker can take this cargo and penetrate it. We have talked to the dock workers and they say that what you are instituting is an absolute joke. And it is not a recommendation. I defy anyone to get a copy of this and look at it. 
   Page 393 is what they recommend. They said: TSA should expedite the installation of an advanced in-line baggage screening system. You are going to hear somebody tell you that we have done that. Folks, this is how many airports we have done out of 440 airports: five of our major airports in the United States. A total of 18, but five of our major airports; 29 airports handle 75 percent of the air passengers. And that is what they recommended. It is right here. It says: TSA also needs to intensify its efforts to identify, track, and appropriately screen dangerous cargo in both the aviation and maritime sectors. 
   I am telling you, this is an expensive exercise in diverting limited resources and will put us even greater at risk. The terrorists have to be laughing at us today. 
   Even worse are some of the other provisions. This lifts the 45,000 caps on screeners. We are paid $5.4 billion for 45,000 screeners. In fact, we should be spending that $5.4 billion on technology that does, I can't reveal the classified results, but it does an incredible job. Instead, we have an army of 16,800 screeners who are hand-checking checked baggage at the airport. A complete farce. And that is a provision. 
   Here is another provision that is a disaster: require the disclosure in the Intelligence budget, that is almost criminal, in 2007 and 2008 but not I guess not in 2009, to tell the other side exactly what we are doing. So this does a lot of damage. 
   And then, finally, it creates a whole new bureaucracy. I didn't think the conference committee, and I wouldn't sign the report, could create a bigger bureaucracy. But it did just that. 
   If you love bureaucracy, you will love this bill. Not only what I just described, but we have had a Department of Transportation that administers transit grants, has done so, has the bureaucracy in place, and can expedite the quick distribution. Instead, we have 185,000 people in the Department of Homeland Security who haven't done this before now are going to set up another bureaucracy in the Department of Homeland Security. This is a great bill; it is a nice bumper sticker thing to go back and say we did something about homeland security. But, folks, we are doing damage.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Speaker, first let me say to those who question our going into Iraq, I voted to go into Iraq and I would vote the same way again. We have found 300,000 mass graves to date, and standing right at this podium, the Iraqi leader told us that Saddam Hussein slaughtered 1 million of his fellow citizens. 
   The question before us tonight, and what Congress is now considering, is a nonbinding resolution that makes two points. The first point is it praises our troops. The second point is it speaks against the President's decision to increase or surge our U.S. troop numbers in our current attempt to end the civil and terrorist conflict in Iraq. 
   Let me say at this point that I do not fault individual Members and their choice made tonight or tomorrow to support or oppose the arbitrary nonbinding resolution that is before us. I do, however, fault the failed Democrat leaders who crafted this resolution behind closed doors, written in the dark of night. 
   The people should know that this is not a true debate. In fact, this exercise is a 3-day politically hatched farce. In fact, this exercise is absent of any legitimate legislative process. It is also, in fact, vacant of the two options provided Congress under our Constitution: first, to declare war or, second, to appropriate funds for the conduct of war. In fact, this is a stealth resolution brought to the floor absolutely void of the democratic process; that our men and women are fighting, as we are here tonight, to preserve our freedoms at home and the rights at home and extend those rights to oppressed people abroad. 
   This is not Cuba. This isn't Venezuela. This is not North Korea or some Third World country. This is the Congress of the United States. 
   But let me congratulate the authors of what history will surely record as a very dark chapter in the conduct of the House leadership and the House of Representatives, leadership, in fact, entrusted to them by the American people. 
   Let me congratulate the authors on the clever wording of a resolution to praise our Armed Forces and at the same time undermine our Commander in Chief. Very clever. 
   I also want to congratulate the very clever timing of the floor discussion of this worthless measure that disregards the fact that American troops have already been deployed for this mission. 
   Congratulations are also in order for duping the public and the media into creating the illusion that Congress is really doing something about the conflict in Iraq. 
   And again congratulations on making people think that this is bipartisan support, that this is going to be bipartisan support for a resolution that, in fact, achieves nothing but the discrediting of a President of the United States in a time of war. So I also want to extend congratulations to the crafters of this illegitimately drafted nonbinding resolution. Your accomplishments will be lauded by Hamas, al Qaeda, touted by Al Jazeera, and highly praised by America and Bush haters throughout the world. 
   Ironically, I pulled this up. Google it yourself. This is tomorrow, 8:17 Mecca time, Al Jazeera: ``Democrats Attack Bush War Policy,'' and the lead quote is from Speaker Pelosi. 
   Again, congratulations on your achievement. 
   Fortunately, though, folks, throughout history great Presidents have ignored Congress and have not wavered. George Washington was nearly recalled by Congress in the darkest hours of the American Revolution. He fought on for nearly 8 years to gain our independence and freedom. Abraham Lincoln endured untold criticism in Congress in his fight to ensure freedom for those once enslaved. Ronald Reagan never flinched in his quest to bring down the Iron Curtain and free millions. And George Bush will be remembered for freeing Iraq, giving women and the oppressed the right to vote, for conducting free elections, helping Iraq adopt a constitution, and combating terrorism and extremists. 
   The 110th Congress, however, will go down in history for adopting a nonbinding resolution. Think about it. 
   Yes, we all want our troops home. We all want our children to live in a world of peace. And this resolution will not help us achieve either of those goals.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (AMENDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 TO RESTORE THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND BALANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker and my colleagues, let me tell you the situation we're in. The highway trust fund is basically busted; it's busted for several reasons. 
   First of all, we depend on 18.4 cents of tax to come in on every gallon of gasoline to that fund. People are driving less, so there is less money coming into the fund. The fleet out there of cars and trucks are more efficient; people are buying more efficient hybrids. There are nine million hybrids, which are going further on one gallon and paying literally less; so we have less money coming in. We're also using more alternative fuels. 
   What's going to happen, folks--and I have many of my conservative colleagues on this side of the aisle coming to me--$8 billion for the highway trust fund, why should I support this? I'm telling you, folks, we have no alternative but to support this right now. 
   I think Mr. McCrery is correct, that we do have a problem; we need to solve the funding problem. We can't do that today. But what we've got to do today is make certain that this trust fund is sound; otherwise, in States across the country, hundreds of projects in Members' districts, the Department of Transportation Secretaries are going to be telling you we're closing down projects. Madam Speaker, 380,000 jobs could be lost. We could have a shortfall of as much as $14 billion in funding transportation. We've got to do this now. 
   Now, the estimate came out last spring that we would be $3 billion short. We're going to get an estimate this week that will show us $5 to $6 billion short. That means the Federal Government is going to tell your States and your Secretaries to start closing down these projects if we don't have the Federal money to back the obligation that we made as a Federal Government to them. 
   Unfortunately, the bill has come due, and we've got to pay it today. And this is a national crisis. This is a transportation situation. We've all got to work with each other and come up with a solution. 
   Mr. McCrery is right, in the long term we've got to resolve the funding problem, the basic funding problem. Next September 30, the current legislation and policy we work on expires. I know Mr. Oberstar and I and others will work to come up with a formula that guarantees the solvency of this system. 
   This is absolutely essential. I wish, as one of the strongest conservatives in the House, to have some other alternative to bring you today, but I do not have that. 
   I thank the Ways and Means Committee for their cooperation, Mr. Oberstar for his cooperation. We must go forward, meet this obligation, and fund these projects.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Chairman and my colleagues, I am pleased to be with you tonight to discuss an important piece of legislation that has been brought forth by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 
   First of all I have to compliment the ranking member of the Highway Subcommittee, Mr. Duncan, the gentleman from Tennessee, for his leadership and his efforts in working together with his counterpart, Mr. DeFazio, and also my counterpart, Mr. Oberstar, to try to bring legislation to the floor that will make our bridges safer, that we have seen problems with our infrastructure in this Nation. 
   We have a responsibility from the Federal Government. We can't fix every bridge in every county, every city across every road in the country, but we do have an obligation where we have Federal funds, where we have interstate, where we have bridges and infrastructure that's so important for the commerce of this Nation to make certain that they are sound, that we have adequate protocols and procedures for inspection of those bridges, and that we try to make certain that those bridges are inspected on an appropriate basis and that there is remediation. It's one thing to make demands of local State government from the Federal level, but what we want to do is ask reasonable people to take reasonable actions and take corrective actions where they are needed, rather than dictate from on high. 
   First of all, let me say my sympathy goes out to everyone and all those who lost their loved ones in the tragedy that struck Minnesota. I was on the floor with Chairman Oberstar when we learned of the collapse of the I-35 bridge, and Congress acted immediately to replace that structure. That structure's replacement is actually an example I am going to use in the future for replacement of any infrastructure in this country. 
   In 437 days that bridge will be replaced, and if we could do that with other projects across the Nation, we would save so much time, money and hassle and red tape, but it shows that we can, if we want to take action, in replacing our infrastructure. 
   But, again, we had a tragedy. We weren't sure the day that it happened what the cause was, and we are still having information gathered by the National Safety Transportation Board, and they will file a final report. But I might also say that the loss of even one life in the collapse of a bridge is too much, and we have to act again to ensure bridge safety, but we have to also look at some of the conditions. 
   Even if we take the Minnesota bridge collapse, we do know now, and I have seen pictures of a design flaw of problems with the gusset plate, one of the structural support systems. That flaw was identified over several terms of different administrations in Minnesota. I have seen pictures that transcend, again, the flaw that was found, and not a lot was done about it. 
   We also have learned that the bridge was underdesigned, really, for the kind of traffic that it has today, and that's another problem we have with larger trucks and vehicles on our bridges, and we also know that bridge was under construction and a contractor had put a significant amount of weight which may have led to the collapse. We don't know that. There were other vehicles too, we know, on the bridge. All of that will give us a final determination of why that bridge went down. 
   But what we have got to do is not base our policy for the future, and this legislation, on presuming that certain things took place. We have got to deal with facts, and, again, in an appropriate and logical manner in which we proceed to ensure safety of bridges. 
   One of the things that I learned from all of this is that the trucks and vehicles that we have running over our bridges today, I think anyone who goes down the interstate, or down a major highway, sees a sign, a weight limit for bridges that's usually posted. 
   The amazing thing I found about today is that while we limit the weight of those vehicles, the violations of people going over those bridges with excessive weights is just mind-popping. It is happening across the country. So, many bridges like the Minnesota bridge that were built to a certain design for a certain era and certain weights, even though that weight limit is posted, one of the problems is that people drive vehicles that weigh far in excess, many times over. In fact, the Department of Transportation even publishes statistics on the estimates and the incidence of some of these violations. So that's something that we have got to address, too. 
   Again, I have a number of areas in this bill I think we have worked on that are good provisions, the training and certification of bridge inspectors, the requirement that States adopt a risk-based list and prioritization of the bridges that do need attention. There are good provisions in here. I do have a couple of things that give me hiccups, and I have expressed my concern about. I had attempted to go before the Rules Committee and offer an amendment that would have corrected two of the major flaws that I see in the approach we are taking here.     
   That was, unfortunately, rejected.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Chairman, this amendment is an amendment that deals with what I spoke of during general debate. It is nice that we consider adding additional authorization for money to repair our bridges. It is nice that we institute some corrective measures that will require States to prioritize bridges that are at risk. But I think that we need to go further in trying to look at some of the issues that have brought about the problems we have seen with maintaining some of our bridges, and also pinpointing the bridges that pose a risk that deserve our attention and that warrant action. 
   So the amendment that I am offering today requires that the Government Accountability Office, GAO, conduct a study on the effectiveness of the bridge-rating system used by the Federal Highway Administration. 
   Since the collapse of the I-35 bridge in Minneapolis, the terms ``structurally deficient'' bridge and ``functionally obsolete'' bridge have been commonly used and intertwined in describing the condition of highway bridges across the country. I think that is one of the problems that we've had in the whole bridge inspection system is the basic definition. 
   However, the general public has little understanding of what the terms actually mean. Most people, even Members of Congress, would assume that if a bridge is classified as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, that the bridge is immediately in danger of collapsing. That's not the case, and we need to differentiate, again a definition that makes sense, on the actual condition of the bridge. 
   According to the Federal Highway Administration, a rating of structurally deficient means that there are elements of the bridge that need to be monitored and/or repaired. The fact that a bridge is deficient does not imply that it is likely to collapse or that it is in fact unsafe. It means that the bridge must be monitored, inspected, and properly maintained. 
   In reality, there are structurally deficient bridges at the top end of the current bridge-rating scale that can safely remain in service for 20 years or more if the owner of the bridge, the State or whatever entity, performs the necessary maintenance to keep the bridge structurally sound. 
   At the same time, there are structurally deficient bridges at the bottom of the rating scale that are closed to all traffic because the bridge may collapse at any moment. 
   I believe it is a disservice to the American people to have a bridge-rating system that does very little to actually distinguish between the bridges that can stay open and are safe for 20 years or more with a comprehensive maintenance plan, and a 100-year-old bridge that may collapse tomorrow if it remains open to traffic. 
   So to get to the heart of the issue that we are discussing, to try to approach this on a reasonable basis, if we are going to put money into these programs, repair these bridges and repair bridges that need repair, we need an amendment like this that will require GAO to evaluate the existing bridge-rating system, which is deficient, and it will also evaluate the rating systems used by the State Departments of Transportation and make recommendations on how the existing rating system can be improved to more accurately convey the condition of bridges throughout the United States. 
   So that's the purpose of this amendment. It is a simple amendment trying to get to the heart of the problem. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MICA. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   In conclusion, the intent of this legislation is excellent to identify bridges that are deficient, that are obsolete, that need repair, that need attention, and provide the resources to do that.     
   But, again, the rating system by which we determine whether a bridge is structurally deficient or structurally obsolete, that rating system is out of date. We need the General Accounting Office to come up with a better rating system, one that makes sense in the 21st century, so that we can do a better job in assessing those bridges that do need repair, targeting the money to those bridges, but having a good rating system, and that's what this simple amendment does. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICA. (PROVIDING FOR AGREEMENT BY HOUSE WITH AMENDMENT TO SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2095, RAIL SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker and my colleagues, first I have to say, again, as Mr. Oberstar said, this is a very historic moment for passenger rail service in the United States. I have to first preface any comments I would make by expressing my sincere thanks to Mr. Oberstar, my partner on the Transportation Committee and our Chair; Ms. Brown, who chairs the Rail Subcommittee, my colleague from Florida; and also Mr. Shuster, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, who is the ranking Republican member on the Rail Subcommittee. I would be remiss if I did not also thank staff on both sides of the aisle for their tireless effort to bring us to this point today. 
   Mr. Oberstar and I sat down when we assumed responsibility for the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and we set out some goals that we hoped to achieve. This is one of the final goals that we felt was important. And it's not a Republican issue, it's not a Democrat issue, it's not a liberal, it's not a conservative. It's an issue that affects the transportation system as we know as a Nation and it hopefully, with the action today, will take us into the 21st century. 
   This is one of the most historic occasions because the Congress has not been able to pass an Amtrak reauthorization for some 11 years, since 1997. I think I voted against every bill that came out. I probably ordered more studies and reviews of Amtrak, not that I was opposed to passenger rail service or high-speed rail service, but what I wanted was the most efficient operation for the taxpayer and also for the traveling public. 
   We made a commitment almost 18 months ago, Mr. Oberstar and I, and we've worked together and staff have worked together. What we've come up with tonight is a combination not only of Amtrak reauthorization but also rail safety. And we worked together on that issue to try to make passenger rail service across the Nation safer for our passengers. 
   So, the two bills now I might mention, for folks who may be listening and coming to vote on this, Madam Speaker, is we passed by 311 votes the Amtrak, again a historic vote, and nearly 400 votes, the rail safety measure.     
   So tonight we will vote on a combination of those two measures in a bipartisan agreement. 
   This couldn't be a better time to pass something, first because we need an economic infusion in this country. This country has become a third world nation when it comes to passenger rail service, and in particular high-speed rail. 
   We have no high-speed rail service in this country. Acela moves rather slow up the Northeast corridor. This is a proposal that will bring the potential of bringing high-speed rail not only to that corridor, but to all of the corridors across the country that have been designated by Congress. 
   It has a well-thought-out progression and plan for the first time for the private sector to become engaged in high-speed rail service in this country. It opens the door to competition for the development, for the financing, for the  construction, and also for the operation of high-speed rail systems. Those proposals go first to a stakeholder commission, those involved in communities around the country that want and desire service, then to the Secretary of Transportation, and then finally to the Congress for approval, a good progression and a logical order. So this is dramatic for a change the way in which we approach high-speed rail service. 
   This also has reforms in the bill for Amtrak that we all feel are long overdue. It also opens up some of the money-losing routes that Amtrak has to private competition. I have to give Mr. Shuster from Pennsylvania credit for negotiating that particular provision. 
   One of the interesting things too as we talk about finances, and I didn't know this, without reauthorization legislation we have had to pay a premium for the indebtedness that Amtrak has and for all of our projects. With reauthorization, we actually will save the taxpayer money, move projects forward in a cost-effective manner and also have the ability to finance them, particularly when we have some shaky markets out here. But these projects are based on cooperative efforts. 
   We also dramatically expand the opportunity for intercity rail service so we can get some cars off the roads and so we can move people in the most cost-effective, energy efficient manner in the history of our Nation. So all that is rolled into this legislation. 
   Finally, we have the provision for safety. We enhance again rail passenger safety. We saw the horrible crash we had a few weeks ago in California, so we couldn't pass rail safety provisions at a more appropriate time really to help prevent an accident like we saw and the tragedy many families had to experience in California. So this is the combination. 
   Again, I hope that we can get the administration to join us in making certain that our country moves forward with a transportation alternative that is cost-effective, energy efficient and protects the environment. I am hoping the other body will act soon. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MICA. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   I'm just sitting here, thinking that sometimes you have ideas, you know, that you come up with, that you think about and that you dream about that have an opportunity to become reality. I've got one in this bill. Will it work? Honestly, I don't know. I've given it my best try, but my intent has been to try to take the things I've seen around the world, the best from them, and adapt them to the United States of America, this great country where, I don't think, anything is impossible. 
   When I see other countries that have high-speed rail systems which take people from one end of their land to the other, I think about our country and think: Why not? Why can't we? 
   We wouldn't be here today if it weren't, again, for the cooperative effort of my counterpart, Mr. Oberstar--our Chair of the T&I Committee--and for the two of us and others--Mr. Shuster and Ms. Brown--all working together. In closing, I do want to just thank a couple of other people. 
   I didn't know Mayor Bloomberg very well when I took this idea to him in New York City. New York, of course, is at the center of the east coast, at the center of the Northeast Corridor. I explained the proposal to him. I said that we'd like to see high-speed rail. Right now, from Washington to New York, on average, Acela runs at 83 miles an hour. On average from New York to Boston, it runs at 66 miles an hour. 
   I said, ``Mayor, what if we could go from Washington, D.C. to Center City New York in less than 2 hours? What would that do?'' Of course, his eyes lit up, and he endorsed the proposal. It would make a dramatic change in the Northeast Corridor. 
   I chaired Aviation for 6 years. I remember the congestion we had in 2001. The congestion is back today. Seventy percent of all of the air traffic control delays in the country emanate from New York City. So, if we could, let's put in place high-speed rail in this corridor. I don't know any other transportation solution that's more cost effective and environmentally sound than what we're proposing here tonight. Again, here, the leader of our largest city endorsed the proposal. 
   Then I went to Mike Castle. Congressman Castle is the former Governor of Delaware. He heads the Rail Caucus in the House. I explained it to him, and he supported the proposal. Then I went to folks like Susan Molinari, who was our Chair, who tried to reform Amtrak when she was here, and she supported the proposal. 
   Now, as a Republican, I come to the floor also to thank America's rail labor unions and their employees. When I had the opportunity to sit down and say you've seen your employment dwindle from 28,000 to 19,000 on Amtrak and that you've seen proposals to zero out your budgets, just saying ``no'' is not the answer both on your side and on our side. We can do better and we must do better. 
   I want to thank America's rail unions for working together to make this possible. In working together, we can expand employment, and we can improve transportation. We can develop that corridor and can make it a shining asset, something we can all be proud of in development along the way. So we'll create jobs and opportunities both in their industry and along that corridor. 
   So, in closing, I also want to thank some of the folks from the Federal Railroad Administration, including Jo Strang, Grady Cothen, Mark Yachmetz, and Mark Lindsay. They provided us valuable technical assistance. 
   I want to also thank the committee staffers who worked in a bipartisan way on the bill on the Democrats' side: David Heymsfeld, Jennifer Esposito, John Drake, and Niels Knutson. On our Republican side, I want to thank Jim Coon, our staff director for the committee; Amy Steinmann, our policy director; Joyce Rose; Mike Meenan; and Allison Cullin for all of their hard work. 
   You don't get here by one person's coming up with an idea or by one person's trying to move a proposal or by one person's trying to dominate the legislation. You come here through the concerted effort of many people joining together. 
   So, in closing, again, I thank Mr. Oberstar and all of those. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.
