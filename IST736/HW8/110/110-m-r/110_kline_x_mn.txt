<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, day after day, we come to this floor to address the important issues facing our Nation. A quick review, however, of the last few weeks shows we have voted on new names for post offices and to congratulate our sports teams. But Congress has not taken any real steps to address the rapidly rising price of gasoline and ease American's pain at the pump. And apparently, House Democrats again are not going to let Members vote to ease that pain. 
   This month, I have been touring energy facilities in Minnesota's Second District that highlight a variety of new, clean and reliable sources of energy being produced right there in Minnesota. I visited a hydropower plant on the Mississippi River in Hastings, a nuclear power plant in Welch, an energy-from-waste in Red Wing, an oil refinery in Rosemont, a wind turbine in Northfield, and an electric-generating facility in Faribault. 
   Madam Speaker, I visited all of these energy producers to learn more and to illustrate that we need an ``all of the above'' energy plan and we need to enact it now. Congress should not adjourn for 5 weeks of vacation and politics without dealing with the number one issue in the minds of the American people, high energy prices.

   I could not agree more with what the distinguished majority leader just said. This is not about business versus labor. We should all be pro-worker, and I believe that this bill is anti-worker. 
   I agreed with the distinguished Speaker of the House who said it is about liberty and justice. I would add it is about the American way. It is about the sanctity of the private ballot, the secret ballot. It is about preserving the security of our workers, and make no mistake, despite claims to the contrary, the effect of this bill would be to eliminate the secret ballot and the process of selecting a union. Now, there is a subparagraph in there, 6(c) or something like that, but the effect of this will be to eliminate the secret ballot. 
   Madam Chairman, let us, today, protect the essence of democracy. Let us protect the American workers. Let us support Mr. McKeon's substitute and let us oppose this bad legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (THE ROLE GOD AND FAITH HAVE PLAYED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR GREAT NATION -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, many of us have been discussing the role God and faith have played in the development of our great Nation and how this foundation is ever present today in our Nation's capital. 
   Washington is replete with examples of how our founders viewed faith as an integral part of our culture. The subtle manner in which our faith history is portrayed in our monuments and landmarks underscores the fact that faith is a part of who we are. That these references often go unnoticed is simply a testament to the fact that faith in God has been inextricably woven into the fabric of our Nation. As a Nation and as a people, we believe in God. 
   The Washington Monument, a tribute to our first President, contains in its very cornerstone a copy of the Holy Bible, the Declaration of Independence, and the U.S. Constitution. The symbolism is simply profound. From the beginning of our founding, we have paid homage to the ideas of freedom and liberty under God. The presence of these sacred documents, housed together in what can be viewed as the metaphorical cornerstone of the United States, transcends the simplicity of separation of church and State, and reclaims for us the fact that our Nation was indeed founded with faith as our guiding light.  
   As a Member of Congress and a man of faith, I am encouraged by the presence of faith in our daily rituals. We here in this body, as we enter the Chamber of this House, we are greeted by the inscription, ``In God We Trust,'' inscribed above the Speaker's desk. We seek favor in His grace and pray His blessings upon our work each day, and we open with the Pledge of Allegiance, acknowledging ``one Nation under God.'' 
   The universal nature of faith and the acknowledgment of our goals as a Nation of faith are often the unifying force that brings Republicans and Democrats together. Across the table, we bow our heads in prayer, and we readily accept the spirit of the Almighty working through us. 
   Throughout Washington, we can easily find examples of our Judeo-Christian roots. If we step across the street to the Supreme Court, we are presented with the image of Moses bearing the Ten Commandments, often considered the basis for much of modern law. Its presence within the halls of the Supreme Court recognizes the origins of our modern day laws and serves as a reminder that we are a Nation seeking justice in the eyes of God. 
   One of my favorite buildings is the Library of Congress. As you enter the Great Hall, you are greeted by two permanent displays. The first is the handwritten Giant Bible of Mainz. The second is the Gutenberg Bible, the first mass printed book. These Bibles are coupled with the inscribed scripture passage from Proverbs 4:7, ``Wisdom is the principle thing; therefore, get wisdom and with all thy getting, get understanding.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, last week one of my constituents, a young high schoolgirl, came in and expressed her concern that she had heard there was an effort underway to remove God from these walls. And I told her I certainly prayed that was not the case, but I was concerned because we are about to open the new Capitol Visitor Center which, in many respects, is an extension and a reflection of the Capitol that it will be the entrance to, in many ways, in many respects, but not in its reference to God, as part of our founding. 
   Faith is the underpinning of this great Nation. Thomas Jefferson's words, seen in the Jefferson Memorial, remind us of the importance of that underpinning: ``God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a Nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?'' 
   That, Mr. Speaker, is the question.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership here. I think many of us miss the presence of our former colleague Mr. Hefley from Colorado, and I am very pleased to see that Mr. Price has stepped up to fill that gap, because what we are talking about here is trying to control runaway spending. 
   We are spending billions and billions of dollars, and this proposal suggests that we try to pare back 1 percent, $316 million in this bill. 
   Some speakers from the other side have said when the Republicans were in charge, the Republicans spent too much. In fact, the gentleman from Ohio just reminded us of that. He is right. Republicans, when we were in the majority, spent too much. 
   But the Democrat answer to spend more just doesn't make sense. We are increasing spending here by billions and billions of dollars, and that apparently is backed up by a budget which is reportedly balanced in 5 years by giving us the largest tax increase in American history. That is how you balance the budget in 5 years, with the level of spending that is being proposed here today, billions of dollars too much. 
   My friend, the great gentleman from Georgia, is proposing a 1 percent, 1 percent across-the-board cut. I commend him for that. 
   We are spending too much. Let's get this under control. This is a very modest proposal. I commend him for it.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank my friend and colleague, Mr. Wilson, for his leadership. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise because we have had a debate here about how much money we're spending and how much we're taxing. There seems to be some confusion about that. We on this side of the aisle have been accused of having spent too much money. And, as I said in discussing an earlier amendment, I fully agree. The Republican majority spent too much money. But what we have before us is a proposal to spend even more money while we're getting criticism for having spent too much, and I have a hard time balancing those out. 
   We need to get spending under control. And we've had my colleagues, colleague after colleague have come to the floor to propose amendments to make modest reductions in what appears to be runaway spending, billions of dollars too much. And then we've had an argument that said, well, we're not taxing too much because we're not going to add to the tax burden in 2008. I suppose that remains to be seen before the process is over, but I think it's undeniable that the Democrats passed a budget which in order to balance in 5 years results in the largest tax increase in American history. And as the spending goes up to make that match in the end, they force all of the tax cuts which we have fought so hard to get into place, that have spurred this economy and caused jobs to be created and rapid growth in the economy, all those tax cuts would go away, taxes would go up, and we would in fact see the largest tax increase in American history. So we have a huge tax increase, huge spending, that's not the way to see this economy grow. Let's take some steps to curb this explosive rate of spending and stop the semantic arguments here. Let's slow down this runaway spending.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF CAMPUS FIRE SAFETY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 95, a measure to support the goals and ideals of Campus Fire Safety Month. We passed a similar resolution last Congress promoting the establishment of September as Campus Fire Safety Month. Since that time, 31 States have issued proclamations recognizing September as Campus Fire Safety Month. 
   Our Nation's college students should be able to live on campus with the confidence that they will be safe in their dorms, apartments or other housing. This measure will take a key step toward ensuring greater awareness of campus fire prevention and safety. I  thank my colleagues, Representatives TUBBS JONES and WHITFIELD, for taking the lead on this important topic. 
   There are numerous examples nationwide that demonstrate a renewed commitment to campus fire safety. In my home State of Minnesota, the University of Minnesota system equips dorms with smoke detectors and is working now to ensure that residence halls and individual dormitory rooms have sprinkler systems. They use flame-resistant mattresses and other materials to provide students with the safest furniture available. In another example, New York State Office of Fire Prevention and Control trains college officials and distributes materials that can be used in training college students on campus fire safety. These are just two examples of the good work being done at the State level to increase awareness of fire safety on college campuses. 
   The legislation before us today is sure to raise awareness even further. This is not the first time that campus safety has been discussed in the House. In the 109th Congress, we passed the College Access and Opportunity Act which endorsed an effort to ask colleges and universities to report annually on fire safety efforts. The report would include information such as a list of all student housing facilities and whether or not each is equipped with a sprinkler system or other fire safety system, statistics on occurrences of fires and false alarms, information on various fire safety rules and regulations, and information about training provided to students, faculty and staff. Moreover, the measure asks schools to keep a publicly available log of all on-campus fires and false alarms. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE IN NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL MOCK TRIAL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 25. I thank my colleague for his opening remarks. This resolution calls on the board of directors of the National High School Mock Trial Championship to accommodate students of all religious faiths. Among our most basic human rights, the right to follow one's conscience in matters of religion and belief, is undoubtedly one of the most cherished, so much so that people have been willing to endure the severest trials and even to lay down their lives rather than surrender this fundamental right. 
   Throughout history, men and women of religion have fought for the natural right of all individuals to practice their own faith and beliefs free from harassment, suppression and persecution. One can also point to many shining examples of established religions tolerating each other's beliefs and practices. The National High School Mock Trial Championship, which is based on constitutional law, is a prestigious event that requires a tremendous amount of preparation, skill and dedication on behalf of those students who are competing. The competition espouses the goals of heightening ``appreciation of the principle of equal justice for all'' and promoting the ``exchange of ideas among students from throughout the United States.'' 
   This participatory program engages students, legal professionals and the  educational community to advance the understanding of the American justice system and the important role of lawyers. I have to admit sometimes that I have a prejudice against some of my lawyer friends. Nevertheless, they are clearly an integral part of our system of the rule of law and justice for all. 
   On October 15, 2005, the board of directors of the National High School Mock Trial Championship voted to refuse any future accommodations for students who observe the Sabbath on Friday and/or Saturday. This decision of the board of directors to refuse any future accommodations adversely and wrongly impacts observant Jewish, Muslim and Seventh Day Adventist students and is inconsistent with the spirit of freedom of religion and equal protection guaranteed by our Constitution.     
   During the 2005 championships, satisfactory accommodations were made to allow Torah Academy of Teaneck, New Jersey, to compete at the National High School Mock Trial Championship held in Charlotte, North Carolina. A review of the post-host report compiled afterward showed a majority of the comments supported the accommodations made for the Torah Academy students and the benefit of competing with the Torah Academy students. 
   I think that is an important point in this debate. All the other participants, even recognizing the challenge from a significant competitor, thought this was the right thing to do. One respondent replied, ``The compromise demonstrated fairness, tolerance and problem-solving, all values that I try to encourage in my students.'' 
   The simple fact is that all students should be allowed to both compete fully in the National High School Mock Trial Championship and uphold the practice of their religion. We stand here today calling the National Board of Directors to accommodate the religious beliefs of students participating in the competition and urge the Board of Directors of the National High School Mock Trial Championship to restructure the rules of the competition to allow qualifying students of all faiths to compete fully in this national championship without betraying their religious beliefs. 
   I thank my colleague, Mr. Rothman, for bringing this matter to the floor today, and I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 590, supporting the goals and ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month and expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Congress should raise awareness of domestic violence in the United States and its devastating effects on families and communities. 
   October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month and is recognized as such in communities across the country. This designation helps to focus public attention on this widespread and devastating crime. 
   The problem of domestic violence is centuries old, and our attention to the matter has grown, but we need to do more to raise awareness of this problem.     
   One in every four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime. Boys who witness domestic violence are twice as likely to abuse their partners and children when they become adults. The cost of intimate partner violence exceeds $5.8 billion each year. As evidenced by these staggering statistics, domestic violence has far-reaching effects on society. 
   Domestic violence is the willful intimidation, assault, battery, sexual assault and/or other abusive behavior perpetrated by an intimate partner against another. It is an epidemic that affects men, women and children in every community regardless of age, economic status, religion, nationality, educational background, or gender. 
   When we think of domestic violence, we often think of women being the victims. However, men are victimized by violence as well. Male victims are less likely than women to report violence and seek services due to concerns over the stigma associated with being a male victim, or not being believed. Both men and women experience the same dynamics of interpersonal violence including experiences of disbelief, ridicule, and shame that only enhance their silence. 
   Unfortunately, the youngest victims are the children who witness the abuse. Research has shown that children witnessing domestic violence and living in an environment where violence occurs may experience some of the same trauma as abused children. They may become fearful, aggressive, or withdrawn. Adolescents may act out or exhibit risk-taking behaviors such as drug and alcohol use, running away, sexual promiscuity, and criminal behavior. All of this behavior has an effect on society as a whole, and we must continue to keep domestic violence in the forefront so this cycle can be broken now. 
   Domestic violence harms the victim, children, the abuser and the entire health of American families and communities. Nearly 20 years ago, Congress passed legislation recognizing the first Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Designating October as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month allows organizations and communities concerned about domestic violence to leverage this public recognition for activities that raise awareness and link victims to services. 
   In our role as Members of Congress, we can help galvanize public awareness for the victims of domestic violence. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 590. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of permanently extending the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003, or HEROES. This extension will ensure that all of our men and women serving in the military will always receive the flexibility they need in dealing with their student loans and post-secondary education commitments. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have championed this act since coming to Congress, and support for this legislation has always transcended party lines. I appreciate that Members on both sides of the aisle have joined together once again this year. I would like to thank senior Republican Member McKeon and Chairmen MILLER and HINOJOSA for their continued support for higher education and this legislation. And I extend my  personal thanks to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak) with his many years of distinguished naval service for joining me in this effort to protect the higher education interest of members of the Armed Forces. 
   The HEROES Act will ensure support for military personnel by continuing to allow the U.S. Secretary of Education to provide the appropriate assistance and flexibility to men and women in uniform as they transfer in and out of post-secondary education during time of war. I must say, this has worked very well and successfully, giving the Secretary the flexibility, but we in Congress need to provide that flexibility. 
   Throughout our involvement in this war on terrorism, many thousands of men and women who serve our Nation in the Reserves or National Guard have been called to active duty. Many of these men and women are also college and university students who are called away from their families, class work and studies to defend the Nation. Unfortunately, due to a number of restrictions in the Higher Education Act, these individuals are at risk of losing financial assistance and educational credit as a result of their service. Such a scenario is clearly not acceptable. 
   The HEROES Act provides assurance to our men and women in uniform that they will not face education-related financial or administrative difficulties while they defend our Nation. 
   This bill is specific in its intent to insure that, as a result of a war or military contingency operation or national emergency, our men and women in uniform are protected. By granting flexibility to the Secretary of Education, the HEROES Act will protect recipients of student financial assistance from further financial difficulty generated when they are called to serve, minimize administrative requirements without affecting the integrity of the programs, adjust the calculation used to determine financial need to accurately reflect the financial condition of the individual and his or her family, and provide the Secretary with the authority to address issues not yet foreseen. 
   I think all of us recognize the absurdity of a young man or woman being deployed to a foreign shore, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, while they are a student and getting in financial difficulties because of that service. 
   I am pleased to offer this legislation which provides a permanent extension of the HEROES Act. By permanently extending this act, we not only send a strong message of support to our troops, but we also provide them with the peace of mind that this program will continue throughout the duration of their current or any subsequent deployment. 
   The legislation before us today is an indication of Congress's commitment to our military, our students, our families and our schools. I urge my colleagues to stand in strong support of the HEROES Act and join me in voting ``yes'' on H.R. 3625. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in favor of mine safety but in strong opposition to the S-MINER Act. 
   Unfortunately, the bill as written does little to improve safety in our Nation's mines. As someone who voted for the MINER Act, I am concerned that this legislation derails much of what has already been achieved. I appreciate that there is concern about the speed of implementation, but the answer is not to call a halt to the work that has already been done and completely turn direction. 
   We have heard from mine engineering academics that this bill is flawed. We have heard from over 28 industry groups that this bill interrupts the progress being made in mine safety, while the Mine Safety and Health Administration's opinion has been dismissed by the other side, apparently until today, when we are going to turn over to MSHA the issue of drug testing. The President has issued a veto threat citing safety concerns. 
   The statement of administration policy specifically states, ``The requirement to use boreholes to sample behind mine seals weakens existing safety standards since boreholes have metal casings that could introduce an ignition source, such as lightning, into an area of the mine that may contain explosive methane. The S-MINER bill would weaken current regulations requiring a mine operator to contact the Mine Safety and Health Administration within 15 minutes of a serious accident by creating a two-tiered notification system of 15 minutes or 1 hour depending on the severity of the incident.'' 
   I question how in good conscience we can be considering legislation that, according to the very people who enforce the law, weakens current regulations. 
   This bill is going to mandate the use of refuge chambers, examples of which were demonstrated on Capitol Hill. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, tested several of these units and found serious deficiencies. 
   In a letter to the State of West Virginia, NIOSH expressed concerns stating, ``Since findings from our field testing raise issues about the performance of such refuge chambers, NIOSH believes it is imperative to inform you of our findings as soon as possible before deployment of refuge chambers.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, later today I will join my committee colleague, Mr. Wilson, in offering an amendment in the nature of a substitute. This is a Republican substitute that does not upend the mine safety progress currently under way. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the S-MINER Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. 
   Mr. Chairman, like my colleague from South Carolina, I rise today in strong support of mine safety and in opposition to the base bill. Rather than supporting this flawed bill, I would ask Members to support the Wilson/Kline amendment. This amendment is a sensible alternative that will enhance mine safety without undoing the significant reforms already underway. During the numerous hearings we have held in the Education and Labor Committee on mining issues, one thing we have heard frequently from miners themselves and from their family members and from their representatives is that when it comes to mines and mine safety, it is the men and women who go into the mines every day that know best. 
   I would like to focus my comments today, first, on one particular aspect of our amendment, and that is to engage miners in their own safety. Our amendment recognizes that miners themselves do know best and seeks to ensure that mine owners and operators are allowed to avail themselves of the knowledge, experience, and talents of their employees. To that end, this amendment would allow mine operators to incorporate meaningful employee involvement in safety committees, which include representatives of workers and mine operators, and work together to ensure that the safest workplace conditions are possible. 
   Although cooperation between miners and mine operators seems obvious, if not imperative, it is, unfortunately, not always a reality. Under archaic provisions of Federal labor law, too often employer-employee safety committees that actually do something have been found to run afoul of Depression-era mandates. 
   Mr. Chairman, we are no longer living in the 1930s, and neither should our laws. Nearly 2 years ago, we began to bring the mining industry into the 21st century by considering and enacting the MINER Act. Though it is not yet fully implemented, that law is already working. Today, my colleague Mr. Wilson and I are offering an amendment that builds on the MINER Act, rather than tearing it down.     
   A key element of our plan is to ensure that antiquated laws don't get in the way of mine worker safety. In fact, our amendment is based on the eminently sensible TEAM Act which was considered by this Congress some years ago and would have provided for safer workplaces for all employees, not just miners. 
   I don't know that anyone can argue that safety committees in mines should not make full use of their workers' wisdom and experience. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support the Wilson/Kline amendment as a commonsense, pro-miner alternative. Use of miner-involved safety committees is just one element of our substitute, but I believe it accurately captures our goal of enhancing safety while maintaining momentum of the MINER Act. 
   I have been interested today to listen to the proponents of the bill and the opponents of our amendment talk about the importance of breathable air and getting these containers into the mines, but I don't understand if the chamber is not available, what is the mine supposed to do while we are waiting what is admittedly 6 months or 12 months for the chamber to arrive? The base bill is so prescriptive, it prevents any alternative to the prescribed chamber, and those chambers are simply not available. I really wish we had the answer to that question.

   On the other hand, Washington Democrats would rather use our troops to make a political statement than work in a bipartisan fashion to get our brave men and women in uniform the funding they need to succeed in their mission. 
   I thought the San Diego Union Tribune made a good point in an editorial stating: ``And even though this sham bill is merely a political show, the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate managed to lard it up in nearly $25 billion in wasteful pork, most of it entirely unrelated to war funding.'' 
   It's time the Democratic leadership send the President a clean supplemental. It is simply unacceptable for Democrat leaders to restrict the necessary funds our troops need so political points can be scored with their defeatist base.

And I don't know that I can add to the passion and to the caring that he has already conveyed for us, but I just have to say that I can't remember being so outraged by such a cowardly act. 
   Visitors from around the world who come to visit the Memorial are moved by the simple but powerful image of the etched granite wall. For those of us who served in Vietnam, however, the names on the wall hold an even stronger significance. Those names bolster our sometimes failing memories of the friends and comrades who didn't return with us. 
   It is with these memories in minds that I express my complete, my total, utter outrage at this recent desecration. The person or persons who did this have violated a sacred trust, and I consider their actions deplorable. Their cowardice, yes, their cowardice, stands in sharp contrast to the bravery and valor of those for whom this memorial was erected, and we as a country will simply not tolerate such behavior. Just as we honor and pay tribute to those who served and sacrificed so much, so too must we condemn, we as a Congress, we as a people, we as a Nation, those who would denigrate that sacrifice through such cowardly actions. 
   If there are those who applaud or somehow justify this desecration, I would only remind them of the hypocrisy of their beliefs and their actions. Our freedom was won and maintained by brave men and women such as those honored on this wall, and we should all hold them reverently in our hearts. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague Mr. Carter for bringing this important resolution to the floor, to the chairman and ranking member of the committee for bringing it to the floor. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Let's support it unanimously.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Corporal Charles W. Lindberg, and I offer my most sincere condolences to his family. 
   Mr. Lindberg, a fellow marine and fellow Minnesotan, was the last survivor of the six U.S. Marines who raised the first flag over Iwo Jima during World War II. 
   On the morning of February 23, 1945, Corporal Lindberg and his fellow marines made their way to the top of Mount Suribachi. At the request of their battalion commander, they placed an American flag at the summit. 
   Years later, as he reflected on that fateful day, Corporal Lindberg said, ``Down below the troops started to cheer, the ship's whistles went off, and it was just something that you would never forget.'' 
   This was the first time a foreign flag was flown on Japanese soil. The moment was captured in a photo by Sergeant Lou Lowery. This event, along with the famous photo made by Joe Rosenthal of the second flag raising, became a symbol of courage and victory in our country. 
   Just weeks after the flag raising in Iwo Jima, Corporal Lindberg was injured in the line of duty. For his bravery, he was awarded a Purple Heart and the Silver Star. 
   Mr. Speaker, in this Chamber we often speak of service to our country. Corporal Lindberg's story is a symbol for generations on the importance of service and duty. 
   After his retirement, Corporal Lindberg spoke to hundreds of veterans groups and student groups, inspiring all who heard him. He is much loved and admired by those who knew him. 
   God bless the Lindberg family, and God bless America.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, of course I rise today in strong opposition to this resolution. 
   It occurs to me, Mr. Hunter, that I need to thank you not only for your service, but for your son's service in the Marine Corps. It is one of those little twists of those things that I served my whole life in the Marine Corps, and my son is serving in the Army. You served in the Army, and your son is serving in the Marine Corps. And I don't know if we will ever untwist this. But I thank you and him for his service. 
   Mr. Speaker, the proponents of this resolution will have us believe that this resolution supports and protects our military personnel while criticizing the President for changing course. 
   We have listened to several speakers today who, like me, served in Vietnam and witnessed firsthand the micromanagement of the war from Washington. Ironically, they stand here today endorsing the same incompetent policy of interference. Instead of President Johnson choosing bombing targets, however, we have 535 legislators dictating General Petraeus's reinforcement levels; yes, dictating his tactics. It was wrong in 1967, Mr. Speaker, and it is wrong in 2007. 
   I notice that the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee has risen several times today to point out his belief that what the President is doing is not a change of strategy, it is a change of tactics. And I would say to my good friend, that great gentleman from Missouri, that if that is right, if this is tactics, then in fact this resolution is trying to do just that, micromanage the tactics of this war. 
   If congressional micromanagement were the only problem with this resolution, I would still argue vigorously for its defeat. But it is not the only problem. Understanding the purpose and intent of this resolution, its proponents have revealed their true intentions in the course of this debate. They intend for this resolution to be the first step on the path to defunding our troops, withdrawing them, and allowing Iraq to become a chaotic, ungoverned space that will act as a training ground for al Qaeda and the radical jihadists that we are at war with.  
   Though few in the West knew it, a new war had already begun during my days as commander of Marine aviation forces in Somalia. In the intense battle in the back alleys of Mogadishu that inspired the movie ``Blackhawk Down'' and the bombing of vulnerable U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya captured America's attention briefly, but it took an unprecedented attack on our homeland for the country to realize what Islamic extremists had long known: The United States was at war. And I think Mr. Saxton did a very thorough and eloquent job of explaining the length and nature of this war. Every country was now a potential front and every city a battlefield in the enemy's war against Zionist crusaders and nonbelievers. Whether by design or not, Iraq has become the front in not only a physical war of attrition, but in the war of wills between free societies and Islamic jihadists who seek to destroy them. 
   The proponents of this flawed resolution prefer to ignore reality. They believe that repeating the mistaken belief that Iraq is not a central front in the war against Islamic jihadists will make that perception real. Unfortunately for those who hold this belief, the enemy, our enemy has a say in the matter. Al Qaeda's second in command, al-Zawahiri, in December 2006, made it quite clear where al Qaeda stands. In a video posted on jihadist Web sites, al-Zawahiri sent a clear message: ``The backing of Jihad in Afghanistan and Iraq today is to back the most important battlefields in which the crusade against Islam and Muslims is in progress. And the defeat of the Crusaders there, soon, Allah permitting, will have a far-reaching effect on the future of the Muslim Ummah, Allah willing.'' 
   We have heard repeatedly that al Qaeda and the jihadist terrorists understand that Iraq is the central front in this war against radical Islam. Thankfully, the U.S. military leadership has also recognized this fact. 
   In his recent testimony before the Senate, General David Petraeus was asked if he believes that Iraq affects the overall war on terror. His response was clear and unequivocal: ``I do, sir.'' 
   Clearly, there are elements of the greater al Qaeda network of international extremists that want something very different than most Iraqis want, and want something very different in that region and in the world. 
   Many mistakes have been made as our military, unparalleled in conventional strength and maneuver, has changed strategy and tactics to fight the counterinsurgency battle. In response to the frustration at the lack of progress felt by those in Iraq and at home, the American military demonstrated its greatest strength: the ability to adapt to new conditions on the ground and develop new strategy. 
   To those who have lived and studied the art of military strategy and tactics, the plan we debate this week, developed by American commanders in Iraq and here at home, represents a fundamental shift. In a study updated last week, Anthony Cordesman from the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, declared that, ``Much of the criticism of the new Bush approach has been unfair. The new strategy is considerably more sophisticated and comprehensive than the details the President could fit into his 20-minute address,'' or, I might add, Mr. Speaker, than I can include in this 10-minute address, ``presuming it combines political, military and economic action in ways that do offer a significant hope of success.'' 
   But rather than acknowledge the comprehensive nature of the new Baghdad and al-Anbar security plan, opponents prefer to ignore the pleas of General Petraeus to provide him with the troops necessary to turn the security situation in Iraq's capital city around. Instead, they pat him on the back, wish him ``Godspeed'' in his endeavor, and then promptly move to deny him that which he has requested and needs to succeed. As a Vietnam veteran, I cannot in good conscience watch as Congress once again undercuts the morale of those in uniform. 
   I will not stand idly by and watch others resurrect the ghost of that painful conflict, and we have heard it resurrected many times this day, Mr. Speaker, without acknowledging the slaughter and humanitarian disaster that resulted from the fall of Saigon. And it was a humanitarian disaster. Millions died. Just as in 1974, decisions we make today in this body will have consequences for entire nations and generations to come. History stands ready to judge the wisdom of this body, its ability to learn from past mistakes and its ability to comprehend the ramifications of its actions. In spite of countless warnings, I fear we will come up short in the eyes of posterity. 
   Opponents call for the administration to heed the advice of its generals, only to reject the commanders' pronouncement when such states are at odds with their own misguided perceptions. They criticize the ``cherry-picking'' of prewar intelligence, and then proceed to do just that, while reading the most recent National Intelligence Estimate, choosing to ignore the dire warnings of the Intelligence Community's most authoritative written judgments on national security issues. 
   But to those who criticize this new security plan and offer no solutions for success, only demands for capitulation, we must demand that they answer a vital question they choose to ignore: What will happen if the Iraqi Government does not succeed and we withdraw prematurely? 
   One critic of the administration's handling of Iraq, a very vocal critic, and a man who I knew and admired throughout my Marine Corps career, retired General Anthony Zinni, the former commander of Central Command, spelled it out bluntly when he noted that, ``We cannot simply pull out, as much as we may want to. The consequences of a destabilized and chaotic Iraq sitting in the center of a critical region in the world could have catastrophic implications.''     
   The recent National Intelligence Estimate was even more specific in its analysis. If the United States were to withdraw rapidly, the Iraqi security forces would likely collapse, neighboring countries might intervene openly in the conflict; massive civilian casualties and forced population displacement would be probable; and al Qaeda in Iraq would attempt to use parts of the country to plan increased attacks in and outside of Iraq. 
   It seems pretty clear to me, Mr. Speaker, what we are debating here is success or failure. 
   Let us not support that catastrophe. Let us not promote a humanitarian disaster which is almost unimaginable. Let us support success in Iraq. Let us support the new commander in Iraq and give him what he needs to succeed in this mission.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (JOSHUA OMVIG VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act. 
   I would like to thank my friend, the gentleman from Iowa, for bringing this important piece of legislation to the floor. This bill bears the name of a constituent of Mr. Boswell's, Joshua Omvig, who tragically took his life. 
   I wish that I could stand here today and say that Joshua was the last soldier, sailor, airman, or marine to fall through the cracks, the last young life to end prematurely because the system was unwilling or unable to assist them. But if that were true, the gentleman would not have had to introduce this bill, and we would not be here today discussing it. 
   In January of this year, this tragedy repeated itself when Jonathan Schulze, a young marine from my district who had served honorably in Iraq, took his life after seeking assistance from two VA medical facilities in Minnesota. The loss of such a promising young life has sparked both sadness and outrage throughout Minnesota and the Nation; outrage not only at the loss of a young life, but because the VA system in which he was enrolled had apparently and tragically failed him. 
   In the months since Jonathan's unnecessary death, the VA has launched two investigations to find out why this marine did not receive the care he so desperately needed. An initial medical inspector's investigation was inconclusive, but it is my sincere hope that the ongoing VA Inspector General's investigation will fully explain the circumstances that led to his death. 
   Along with the full accounting of the VA's action in Jonathan Schulze's case, I am hopeful the passage of this bill today will provide the professionals of the VA medical system with the tools necessary to prevent the tragic deaths of young veterans like Joshua and Jonathan. 
   Once again, Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Iowa for introducing this vital legislation. I urge my colleagues, all of them, to support H.R. 327.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank my colleague, the gentleman from California, for yielding the time. 
   Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, H.R. 3685. 
   As the ranking member of the Health, Employment, Labor and Pension Subcommittee, I have reviewed this legislation in several different forms over the last several weeks. I've participated in debates and conversations that have brought this bill to the  floor, and I have to report that this legislation is still flawed. 
   The bill before us is drafted in such a way that it creates confusion and uncertainty. My colleagues offered a number of amendments to correct the inherent problems in this bill. Unfortunately, one critical amendment offered by Mr. Souder removing the word ``perceived'' was not accepted by the majority. My colleague has already introduced that point of confusion; I would like to expand on it. 
   This bill, and I quote, ``prohibits employers from discriminating against an individual because of an individual's actual or perceived sexual orientation.'' What does that mean, ``perceived sexual orientation''? We do not know because the bill fails to provide a definition. This raises a number of practical and legal concerns. The term ``perceived'' is overly broad, vague, and will inevitably lead to increased litigation, lots of increased litigation. 
   We cannot abdicate our constitutional duty by knowingly creating a law that is so vague that the courts must necessarily determine a definition. This is, frankly, a trial lawyer's dream. I would point out that in the course of our hearings one of our colleagues did express faith in ``Attorney World'' to clarify this issue. Well, it is kind of funny; I just don't think that's a theme park that we want to visit. 
   Employers may have difficulty in identifying noninherent characteristics of a person but could still be liable. Under the statute, employers would be accountable to prove that they did not make an employment decision based on either their own perception of an individual's sexual orientation or on that person's perception of themselves. I can see why ``Attorney World'' could be called upon here. Employers would find themselves in the unenviable position of defending themselves in lawsuits by proving a negative, that they did not perceive the individual to be part of a newly protected class. 
   Further, the term ``perceived'' does not appear in any other civil rights legislation. Let me be clear, we are not talking about the definition of gays, lesbians and bisexuals; we are talking about those individuals that may be ``perceived'' to be such. The Civil Rights Act protects individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Nowhere do we see the term ``perceived.'' 
   Madam Chair, those who favor this bill presented on the floor today are motivated only by the end goals of this legislation and are failing to recognize the difficulty presented by vague terms and loose definitions. We are left with a bill that is filled with confusion and uncertainty. 
   I would ask that my colleagues carefully consider the inherent problems in enforcement of this legislation and vote against H.R. 3685.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of our time. 
   Today, we're considering a truly far-reaching modification to civil rights policy. There are some here who want this proposal to go even further, and we've heard that, while many of us believe that it already goes too far. 
   The free exercise of religion is fundamental; yet this bill could infringe upon it. The right of States to define and protect marriage is fundamental; yet this bill would undermine it. When enacting new Federal mandates, we should be seeking policies that employers can successfully implement; yet this bill is vague and subjective and invites costly litigation. 
   We heard a discussion earlier about the concerns in employment law around a hostile work environment and what this newly protected class, how this would fit into that. It was asked, could an employee have a quote from the Bible that soundly condemns homosexuality, would that in itself create a hostile work environment. I would say we do not know the answer to that question. This is a boon for trial lawyers and court cases stacked up like cordwood. 
   Because of these concerns, Madam Chairman, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy indicating that if this bill were to reach the President's desk, his senior advisers would recommend that it be vetoed. The administration identified a number of concerns, both on a constitutional level and with the underlying policy. Unfortunately, these concerns have not been given the full attention they deserve in this debate. 
   The number of amendments has been seriously limited. We have seen an extraordinary step of putting in the rule a mandatory withdrawal of a proposed amendment. This deserves a fuller examination. 
   Republicans were prevented from offering key amendments that would have highlighted and attempted to correct some of the more glaring problems which we see in the underlying bill. As a result, Madam Chair, H.R. 3685 remains fatally flawed. 
   I oppose the bill and urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on this overreaching proposal. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this issue and so many others. 
   Mr. Speaker, a number of my colleagues have come to the floor today to argue passionately, as we have just heard, about the principles of free trade and whether we should pass the trade agreement between the United States and Peru. This is a historic moment for U.S.-Andean relations. The United States and Peru have agreed to formalize this mutually beneficial economic relationship with this ground-breaking U.S.-Peru trade promotion agreement. 
   This agreement opens new markets for U.S. businesses and provides strong protections for U.S. workers and companies. Additionally, it furthers the Peruvian market-oriented policies and advances the agenda that has made Peru one of the fastest growing emerging economies. 
   Mr. Speaker, this stands in sharp contrast to the policies of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. We are at the beginning of a new day in the Andean  region, and this trade agreement is the first step in a successful campaign to spread democracy, expand free trade, and stabilize the region while also taking a stand against poverty and crime. 
   For our part, this agreement builds on Peru's many strengths and solidifies an important economic relationship between our two nations, presenting new market access for U.S. businesses, farmers, ranchers and consumers. U.S. exporters currently face Peruvian tariffs while Peruvian exporters are not generally subjected to any tariffs. This point has been raised many times but cannot be raised enough. We are working in a one-way street that has been working against us. This is the time to fix that and make this trade fair. 
   In my home State of Minnesota, we exported over $24 million worth of goods to Peru in 2006. These exports cut across all industries, from high tech computer manufacturers to our local farmers. Passage of this agreement would provide immediate elimination of tariffs on nearly 90 percent of current U.S. exports to Peru. This would allow producers and exporters the opportunity to not only preserve but to increase market share in Peru. As our market share increases, it naturally follows that prices and income increase and jobs. 
   A vote in favor of this bill supports job growth, sustains small- and medium-sized businesses and enhances agricultural competitiveness. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues here today join me in support of this important legislation and vote in favor of America's workers, America's farmers and American businesses.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would reduce funding for the fossil energy research and development account in this bill by $142 million. These funds appropriated in this account go toward research of oil, gasoline, coal and natural gas. 
   Funding this account at $709 million, as in this bill, would be a 19 1/2 percent increase over last year's appropriation amount and 20 percent higher than what was requested by the administration. 
   This massive increase in spending is aimed at research of oil, coal and natural gas. With energy prices rising, our research dollars are better spent by going toward alternative and diversified energy sources like nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower and others. 
   You may be interested to know that some of the research projects funded by this account include: a submersible-deployed micro-drill for sampling of shallow gas deposits, ultra-lightweight cement, and an oil and gas resource assessment of the Russian Arctic. 
   Given the record profits being made by oil, gas and coal companies, the research of oil and gas resources of the Russian Arctic should be done and paid for by those oil companies, not by American taxpayers who have already paid for it at the pump. 
   A half a billion dollars in Federal funds appropriated to this account, as was the case last year, should be more than enough for the government's share of this research. 
   Any additional funding, and I'm talking about funding over the half a billion dollar plus what's already in last year's bill, any additional funding should be borne by the private sector. 
   My amendment would save the taxpayers $142 million and remove that 20 percent increase in spending on fossil fuel research. 
   Solutions to our rising energy prices are not found in a massive increase in deficit spending, and we've been talking a lot about deficit spending today. 
   Not only does this bill have a 20 percent increase in spending for fossil fuel research, it contains a $1.3 billion increase over last year's Energy and Water appropriation. 
   It seems that this appropriation bill is another example of ballooning Federal spending and increasing Federal deficits to be paid for by ever-higher taxes. 
   We know it's been discussed today that the Federal budget that was passed by House Democrats earlier this year does indeed include the largest tax increase in American history. It would raise taxes by at least $217 billion. We're looking for ways to reduce spending, modest ways. That's all that these appropriation bills allow us. We can't address the massive spending that comes from entitlement spending, but we can get at sensible ways to control the spending in these discretionary funds. 
   My amendment is a step in the right direction. Let's save the taxpayers $142 million and remove this huge 20 percent increase in spending for fossil fuel research. 
   There have been proposals to put price controls on oil companies. I vehemently oppose those, but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask them to put some of those profits back into this essential research and development, take the burden off the taxpayers. Let's in a bipartisan way support this amendment.

   Money magazine confirmed what many of us in the great State of Minnesota already knew by naming Chaska as one of the top 10 best places to live in America. Money magazine accurately describes Chaska as having both beauty and brains. A stroll downtown Chaska by City Square Park brings to life images from Norman Rockwell paintings, depicting all that is good about small town America. Chaska's small 19th-century downtown quickly yields to open fields, farmland and the Minnesota River. It is also home to innovation, with more than a dozen technology and biotech companies. It is no wonder why this town is a magnet for families who can find reasonably priced homes, low taxes and quality schools. 
   Congratulations again to the entire community of Chaska for earning this prestigious distinction. We in Minnesota's Second District are proud.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Georgia, for yielding the time and for bringing up this amendment. 
   Each time he does, of course, I am reminded of our former colleague, our great friend, Joel Hefley from Colorado who brought this amendment up in past Congresses. 
   Mr. Chairman, I didn't understand, perhaps I would have to admit, the full significance and importance of what he was trying to do, and that was just to, in a very, very, very modest way, curtail the spending spree that we have here in Washington, that spending spree that our friend and colleague, the gentleman from North Carolina, was just explaining. 
   Of course, this is a modest effort, 1 percent on one spending bill. We know that the real issue here in Washington is the explosion in entitlement spending. The gentleman from New York earlier said that there was no tax increase in this bill. Of course, we understand that. This isn't a tax bill; this is a spending bill. 
   But it is tied to a budget, to a budget that significantly did one thing: it brought us the largest tax increase in American history. Yes, that tax increase won't hit in a significant way in this year, but in order to make that budget balance, it was necessary to bring us the largest tax increase in American history so that by the end of the budget period, the budget could balance. 
   The other thing that budget had, or, more significantly, did not have, it didn't have anything to constrain entitlement spending. Well, it did. It had a small piece, a very small piece, where there was an effort to save less than $1 billion in entitlement spending; and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle stepped up to the plate to save that less than $1 billion and created nine new entitlement spending programs. 
   We do have a spending problem here, and that is followed by an enormous taxing problem. This is a spend-and-tax issue that I think the American people can understand. Their budgets aren't growing by 7 percent. The Federal Government is growing its spending by more than that. This effort by my good friend from Georgia is, indeed, a modest effort. 
   This is a tiny, let's save one penny, one penny on the dollar that this spending bill has. We can't seem to find a way to save that one penny, and yet we are letting entitlement spending grow by trillions of dollars. 
   I think the American people are going to grow increasingly aware that we have an unfunded liability in entitlement spending of trillions and trillions of dollars, well over $50 trillion. 
   So this is a modest effort, but I would call on my colleagues to take this tiny step that Mr. Hefley brought us in the past and that my colleague, Mr. Price, has brought us here. 
   Let's support the amendment.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I appreciate the gentleman yielding me time. I appreciate that because I would like  to respond to the gentleman from Massachusetts on just a couple of points. 
   One, we had a number of discussions on zeros and what that means when we talk about the debt, nine zeros, 12 zero, six zeros, I would say there are a lot of American families that are concerned about five zeros and what the impact of the tax increase is going to have on that. 
   With all respect to my friend from Massachusetts, the Democrat budget does have the largest tax increase in American history. In order to make that budget balance, all of the tax relief which we have worked so hard to achieve in the last few years, and which is behind the growth and the economy, all that would go away, tax relief for married families, tax relief for every American worker who pays taxes. All that's erased in the Democrat's budget that is behind this spending bill that we are in today. 
   I think he helps me make the point that this is, when he talks about trillions of dollars, that this bill, that this amendment is a very modest step in curtailing that spending.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer this motion to recommit on H.R. 1424 with instructions forthwith, to substitute the Kline amendment for the underlying bill. 
   Last night the Rules Committee issued its 50th closed rule of this Congress and did not allow consideration of the Wilson-Kline-Camp substitute amendment. This motion to recommit gives us the opportunity to pass a mental health parity bill that has both bipartisan and bicameral support, and it does so immediately, allowing the House to approve a real mental health parity bill this very night. 
   My motion is a viable, commonsense alternative that, contrary to H.R. 1424, achieves real parity in the treatment of employer-sponsored coverage for mental and behavioral illnesses. The motion to recommit substitutes H.R. 1424 with the version similar to the mental health parity legislation S. 558 that passed the U.S. Senate last year under unanimous consent. 
   During the markup of H.R. 1424 before the Committee on Education and Labor, I offered a version of the compromise Senate bill as an amendment, believing that if Congress intends to move forward with mental health parity legislation, this compromise language is the most sensible alternative and our best chance of enacting legislation on this issue this year. 
   Unlike H.R. 1424, this motion is a product of over 2 years of bipartisan negotiations between mental health advocates, health care providers, and business groups representing virtually all sides in this debate. The motion accomplishes what it sets out to do. It  provides parity for mental health and substance abuse benefits. It provides parity while preserving the foundation of the ERISA benefit structure, protecting the ability of group health plans to medically manage their claims and providing plans with the flexibility to determine and administer on a voluntary basis the benefits provided to working men and women and their families. By steering clear of the benefit mandates and litigation traps contained in H.R. 1424, this motion makes it possible for employers to continue to provide high-quality affordable benefits, and it does so while responsibly offsetting the cost. 
   This motion to recommit includes an important provision that will save the American taxpayers billions of dollars by reducing the fraud in the Medicaid system by requiring all States to implement an electronic asset verification program within their Medicaid eligibility systems. Many States have balanced budget requirements and thus have limited dollars to allocate for the Medicaid programs. These new State-level Medicaid asset verification systems would ensure that Medicaid applicants are not intentionally hiding significant amounts of funds in undisclosed bank accounts in order to fraudulently enroll in a State's Medicaid program. This is a responsible way to pay for mental health parity benefits. 
   Finally, this motion to recommit includes language to clarify that the bill does not require a group health plan to cover abortion as a treatment. For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit and vote in favor of this commonsense alternative. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson).

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today in support of H. Res. 606 to honor all of those who so bravely risked their lives in the face of this catastrophe. I had the privilege of meeting with many of the first responders, volunteer organizations, local and State officials in my tours of the site of the collapse. 
   The first emergency personnel on the scene responded to the tragedy without hesitation, as has been discussed by my colleagues here today. They risked their health and safety to rescue victims and to provide emergency care to the injured. Scores of ordinary people did, indeed, become extraordinary citizens following the tragedy by rushing to the aid of their fellow Minnesotans. The outpouring of support and assistance from surrounding communities, including more than 50 volunteer organizations, was tremendous. Throughout the rescue and recovery mission, there have been countless stories of the generosity by the citizens of Minnesota. From organizing blood drives to caring for the needs of the bridge recovery workers, Minnesotans continue to go above and beyond the call of duty. In a  time of sadness and sorrow for so many, we remain thankful for the true kindness and compassion of Minnesotans. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to take just a minute here to discuss, as some of my colleagues have alluded to, another catastrophe which struck the State of Minnesota in Mr. Walz's district. My family has a farm down in Houston, Minnesota, in the very southeastern tip, and I spent 3 days there at the end of the August break. It is distressing. It is an awesome power that we saw when those creeks and rivers flooded and the destruction is immense. Again, it is not just the first responders in Minneapolis and the surrounding communities, but I am sure that my friend and colleague from the First District, Mr. Walz, can attest to the fact that first responders throughout the State came to the aid of those in southeast Minnesota. 
   So, Madam Speaker, as always, we are mindful of the lives that were lost in both tragedies and our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and their families and with all Minnesotans as we recover and rebuild. 
   I want to thank the gentleman, my colleague, Mr. Ellison, for offering this legislation and bringing it forward and Mr. Walz for his leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I want to commend my colleagues for their activities over the last day. Many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have come to the floor and offered amendments, in some cases, to do something, perhaps small but something to try to control the explosion of spending that we're seeing come forward through this budget and through this appropriations process. And so I want to commend my colleagues from North Carolina, Mr. McHenry, whose amendment we are debating now, which is a secondary amendment to our colleague, Ms. Foxx from North Carolina. I know it's a little confusing sometimes. These are efforts to try to control runaway spending, billions and billions of dollars, to be paid for, as we have heard in this debate, by the largest tax increase in American history. I applaud the efforts of my colleagues to try to do something to get our arms around that spending. 
   But there is another reason why we have been coming to the floor, and that is to shed some light into a horribly flawed process of earmarks. One of our colleagues, the gentleman from New York, I believe, earlier came down and said, ``Why are we talking about earmarks? There aren't any earmarks in this bill.'' Well, you see, that's the point. We don't know if there are earmarks in this bill. We don't know if there will be earmarks in this bill, but frankly the suspicion that we have is that sometime in July, or perhaps August, we will find out that indeed there are going to be earmarks in this bill and we, Members of this House, are not going to have a chance to challenge those earmarks on this floor, and that is simply unacceptable. 
   Now, there has been a great deal of media interest to bring focus to this. In fact, in this morning's paper, a local paper here, Roll Call, there is an editorial called Pork Rules that ought to underscore the very problem. I am just going to quote a couple of paragraphs from that story, because I think it does underscore the very issue that we're talking about on the floor of this House. 
   It says: 
   ``Under furious attack from editorial writers and Republicans, House Appropriations Chairman David Obey (D-Wis.) has come up with a new disclosure policy on earmarks. It's better than his previous one, the airdrop policy, but it's a far cry from full transparency.'' It's that transparency issue that we've been trying to get at. 
   Continuing the quote: 
   ``In a remarkable press conference Monday in which he read nearly every word of a 14-page earmark policy declaration before taking questions, Obey pledged that Democrats would fully disclose every earmark and its sponsor by the end of July.'' 
   I would say to my colleagues, that is well past the proposed date that we are supposed to be voting on this and every appropriations bill in this House. So we will know every earmark and its sponsor by the end of July, at which point we can do absolutely nothing about it. 
   Continuing the quote: 
   ``That kind of disclosure would be only partially in keeping with the earmark rules Republicans put into place in September, after they got into no end of political trouble for corrupt, opaque special-interest pork trading. But the GOP rule made it possible for earmarks to be individually challenged in debate on appropriations bills.'' And that's the point. 
   We heard the debate last night repeatedly that went something like this: Well, you Republicans put in earmarks, thousands of earmarks, and you airdropped earmarks into bills in conference, and so you did it, we're going to do it. But we're going to do it better because we're going to post a list sometime in July or August, at which time nobody will be able to vote on it. 
   Mr. Chairman and my colleagues, the earmark process in this body, in this Congress, on both sides of this Capitol, has been broken for years. There is no question about it. There is a reason why many of us have decided that the process is so broken that we won't participate in it. So claiming that you were bad and, therefore, we can do it,  strikes me as a very hollow and weak argument. I hope my colleagues would agree with me on that. Just because somebody made a mistake doesn't mean that we are then authorized to make a mistake. We are seeking transparency. That was the promise made to us and the American people, that we would be able to look at these earmarks and be able to debate them on this floor and be able to vote on them on this floor, not have them given to us, pulled from what has been called a secret slush fund. Frankly, I don't know what else to call it. Because in this very bill that we are debating today, we simply don't know where that money is and where it's going.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, this has been a fascinating debate. I have heard, unfortunately, some language that I certainly find offensive, that we are dishonoring, for example, those who have died in this country. I certainly don't believe that is the case. I don't understand how our insistence on making sure that we are appropriating the taxpayers' dollars responsibly dishonors anyone. 
   Repeatedly I have heard that in this bill there are no earmarks. Again, I would reiterate, that is the point. We simply don't know if that is the case. The gentleman from Texas just stood down here and said he has requests for two earmarks in this bill. I don't know how many earmarks will end up at the end of the process, and, frankly, none of us do, because there is no transparency and we do not have visibility into this very, very flawed system for Members' projects for earmarks. 
   Mr. Chairman, I know that my dear friend and colleague from North Carolina would like the opportunity to talk about his amendment and this process once again, so I would be happy to yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry).

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to this legislation, Mr. Speaker. I have been and continue to be a major proponent of trade, but this Trade Adjustment Assistance program that we have today has, seems to me, gone astray. There are a number of reasons why I would urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, from the massive expansion of what was intended to be a targeted Trade Adjustment Assistance program to the dramatic increase in litigation and liability employers will face under the WARN Act provisions contained in this bill. 
   The gentleman from California mentioned COBRA eligibility in his remarks. I'd like to talk about that for just a minute. 
   Under the law as it stands today, when a worker loses his or her job, he or she is generally able to elect to continue health care coverage under COBRA for 18, or sometimes as long as 36, months. This balances the legitimate need of the workers to obtain gap or bridge health insurance coverage, while recognizing the administrative needs of employers and, in particular, the need for employers who voluntarily offer health benefits to manage costs and risk. 
   The bill before us dramatically expands COBRA benefits for certain classes of workers potentially at the expense of others. Under the Rangel substitute, a worker who loses his or her job ``because of trade'' is afforded significantly more COBRA rights than an employee who simply loses his or her job because, for example, his employer closes shop. Indeed, for some of these workers, expansion of COBRA rights can last for decades, plainly not what was intended under the original law. 
   The bill also includes provisions extending COBRA benefits for PBGC beneficiaries without any regard to the issue of trade. Individuals pay for COBRA, but because of the nature of how this was put together, the provisions are paid for through an increase in the taxpayer-funded health care tax credit, at least through the period of TAA eligibility, again, extending and complicating it in a way that was never intended in the original law. 
   Just a couple of more things that come under the WARN provision of this. This bill expands the WARN Act coverage to apply to businesses which employ 100 or more employees, including part-time workers. It expands the definitions of plant closures and mass layoffs. It increases the notice requirements so that employers must provide 90 days' notice of an intended plant closure or mass layoff. It expands damages for lost wages and benefits to include double wages, benefits and interest for up to 90 calendar days. It includes new requirements that employers post notice of WARN Act requirements and information on how to file a complaint and provide notice of benefits and services available to employees. It expands enforcement to allow the Secretary of Labor to investigate alleged violations. 
   Some of these are probably very worthwhile, but clearly, a tremendous expansion and opportunity for almost unlimited litigation, placing a very large burden on employers, and I don't think we want to do that at a time when we're trying to preserve jobs for our employees. 
   So I oppose this legislation. It reaches too far. It is too complicated. It opens up employers to too much litigation. We can do better than this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to add my voice to those deeply disappointed by conditions found at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The physical infrastructure and administrative problems revealed are absolutely inexcusable. As a Nation and as a military, we have a responsibility to provide both top-quality acute care and top-quality outpatient treatment. 
   The fine doctors and nurses in Iraq; at Landstuhl, Germany; and at Walter Reed provide excellent medical care that has saved countless lives. But it is clear that a lack of leadership and administrative initiative at the top created these shameful conditions. 
   The American military has historically entrusted the ultimate responsibility and accountability to those in command. I was pleased that the Army leadership followed that proud tradition, and I am hopeful that Walter  Reed's new commander, Major General Eric R. Schoomaker, will rebuild trust in the Army's medical service. I am also hopeful that a number of corrective actions announced last week by Army Chief of Staff Peter Schoomaker will help ensure each soldier receives the care which he or she deserves and that no one, no one, falls through the cracks.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a huge topic that we are talking about tonight of tremendous personal importance to every American. My dear friend and colleague from South Carolina said that we want to talk a little bit tonight about budgeting and about things that are broken in Washington and about spending and all manner of things. 
   You know, when we budget, whether the President sends over a budget and then Congress works its will on that budget, we are assigning priorities on how we spend taxpayer money, how the government is going to spend that money, and that ought to be a deliberative process, and it is a deliberative process. But then we throw it out the window. 
   We have a couple of things that I wanted to touch on tonight which break the system. One of them is a subject that has been much in the news lately, and that is porkbarrel spending, earmarks. This is a system that is completely broken in Congress and in Washington, DC. 
   Spending for pet projects for Members of Congress has nothing to do with an orderly, reasoned system for setting priorities on how we set spending. Decisions are made not on the merits of a proposed project. No, not at all. Decisions are made based on how long a Member has been in Congress, perhaps what committee they are assigned to, perhaps what party they are in. It has nothing to do with the merits of the project. 
   So we spent last year over $15 billion, that is the entire yearly budget for the State of Minnesota, $15 billion on these pet projects, and done in a way that had nothing to do with an orderly system for assigning priorities on how we spend money. 
   I don't think I ought to be asking the people of the Second District of Minnesota to spend money on a project for the LA fashion district. I am sorry, I just don't think that is the right set of priorities. We ought to establish those priorities through the institutional system that is here in Congress. We don't do that. We award money based on an entirely arbitrary system. 
   My friend, our friend, my friend from South Carolina, Mr. Barrett, and others that are here with us tonight know that we have a friend, Congressman Jeff Flake from Arizona, and every time we have a spending bill he brings up six or eight or 10 or 12 examples of this porkbarrel spending and tries to shed some light on it and get a debate and give us a chance to vote on whether or not we think that is the right priority for how we spend taxpayer dollars. But do you know what? It is not a debate. It is not a debate. It is not going to have anything to do with the merits of the project. 
   Mr. Flake's amendments almost, I can only think of one exception, never pass. And why is that? Because the system is broken. Members of Congress don't want to vote against that earmark, because they are afraid that somebody will vote against their pet project. It is a broken system. We need to check it. 
   Is it a lot of money? Well, the entire annual budget for the State of Minnesota, we think that is a lot of money, and we ought to get that under control. And it is symptomatic of problems we have here. 
   Another problem that is symptomatic of a broken system is what happens after we go through the process of debating the budget, deciding on a budget, deciding on how much money we are going to spend for defense, for education, for transportation and roads, setting 
   priorities in the way we should be setting priorities. 
   Then what happens? The system here in Washington, in Congress, says that we have to have a spending bill, an appropriations bill that dictates how much money we are going to spend in theory in keeping with that budget. But what happens? These bills come up. They are loaded down with this porkbarrel spending. We get to the end of the fiscal year here in Washington, which is the end of September, and we don't have these bills passed. 
   We get to the end of October, we get to the end of November, and suddenly there is pressure to get the spending bills passed, and the system that has been in place here for a long time is to do what? Take all of these spending bills and roll them up into one great big monstrous bill of spending which they call an omnibus. This omnibus ends up breaking every rule, every priority of spending. It is just one big, huge massive spending bill. That is part of what is broken in Washington. 
   Now, my friend Mr. Barrett is talking about entitlement spending, and I am sure we have colleagues here tonight that are going to talk about that and other issues that are trillions of dollars, but we can't even get the relatively small pieces right here. 
   I am very pleased to say that many people in my party, in the Republican Party, have stepped up and said we have had enough of this porkbarrel spending. We need to take serious action to stop this nonsense. Some of us have said we are not going to participate, me included, until it is fixed. Many of my colleagues have done the same thing, some of them here in this room tonight. But as a party we have taken the position that we need to fix this. 
   I was very pleased to see that one of our Democrat colleagues today was in the paper saying no more earmarks, because the system is broken, and we welcome that sort of bipartisan support and recognition of a system that is completely, absolutely broken and needs to be fixed. 
   I know it is symptomatic of some bigger problems. It is not huge money, but it is big enough money that we ought to step up and fix it. And then we ought to fix these other underlying problems like this gigantic omnibus mess, because the green line that my friend showed of this increased spending has got to be brought under control. Even in the wildest dreams of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they can't raise taxes enough to fix that. We have to get the spending part of this equation under control. 
   I believe, as I know Mr. Barrett does and some of our other colleagues here tonight, that keeping the tax burden low and allowing American families and businesses to spend money according to their priorities will keep this economy growing and tax revenues will continue to flow. We just have to get the spending side under control.  
   I thank my friend for yielding some time to me and letting me address a couple of the issues in this big picture that he has been trying to lay out for us tonight. I know we have other colleagues, so I yield back.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, for 5 weeks, all during the month of August and September, Republicans were on the floor of this House with the microphones off and the cameras off demanding a comprehensive all-of-the-above energy plan. We were demanding that we have open debate and  that we have a vote, the very thing that then-minority leader Nancy Pelosi demanded, saying that the minority party should have the right to present its alternatives, have a debate and have a vote. That's what we've been asking for for weeks and weeks and weeks. 
   We believe that we need a comprehensive all-of-the-above energy plan. This is not a comprehensive, all-of-the-above energy plan. This is not. 
   Just for example, in the American Energy Act, the Republican bill, we call for emission-free nuclear power. This is the one place in the world I can think of where the French actually have it right. They get 80 percent of their electrical power from nuclear energy. 
   We haven't built a new nuclear energy plant in this country in years, and we never will if we adopt this plan. We need a comprehensive all-of-the-above plan.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, along with my colleagues. Though the memorial stands primarily as a tribute to the 58,000 who were killed in Vietnam, the Wall, as it is more commonly known, continues to surpass its original purpose by acting as a quiet reminder of the price of our freedom and honoring the more than 153,000 men and women wounded in action. Perhaps most importantly, it serves as a source of healing for the 3 million men and women who served in the United States military during this war. 
   The design was inspired by a need to bring reconciliation and healing to a country that was deeply divided. Its simplicity is transcended by a powerful message of remembrance. Each name is a person with a story. These soldiers served with honor and distinction, and the memorial helps us to remember them with the highest regard. 
   As a Vietnam veteran myself, the memorial carries particular significance. I am reminded of the friends and comrades who gave their lives and of a far different time and place in my life. 
   It is with these memories in mind that I express my sadness and disappointment at the reports of the recent desecration of the Wall. The people who did this have violated a sacred trust, and I consider their actions deplorable. If there are those who applaud this behavior, I would only remind them of the hypocrisy of their beliefs. Our freedom was won by brave men and women such as those honored on this Wall, and we should hold them all reverently in our hearts, as I know that we do when we visit that very powerful memorial. Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I hope these reports are not true or are exaggerated. I was appalled to hear them. 
   I cannot help but draw parallels between the Vietnam war and the situation in Iraq. We have men and women today who are carrying the mantle for this generation. We must be mindful to accord them the respect that they deserve and honor their service. 
   After 25 years, the memorial is unparalleled in terms of the sheer power of its presence. And there is irony because it was built into the ground. I remember the great debate that was taking place in this city and around the country when that memorial was put into place. There were those who thought it was a dishonor, frankly, to the men and women who served, to have this memorial be in the ground. But I know that every Vietnam veteran and their family and friends and Americans who have taken that walk down and stood at that powerful wall has reevaluated that opinion. Everyone who has been there has been moved, and for that I am very thankful.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Madam Chairman, my amendment is very simple. 
   The committee bill cuts the Office of Labor Management Standards, known as OLMS, down to fiscal 2006 levels. My amendment would restore just over $2 million to get this enforcement agency back to its fiscal 2007 level. To offset the increase for OLMS, we have reduced the International Labor Organization earmark from the International Labor Affairs Bureau by the requisite amount. 
   What is OLMS and why I am taking to the floor of the House to make a $2 million adjustment in this small agency? That's a fair question. 
   Without this amendment, the OLMS will have to cut staff. OLMS is the agency within the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Administration that enforces the Labor Management Reporting Disclosure Act of 1959. This Federal statute was championed by then-Senator John F. Kennedy and enacted as an outcome of the McCollum hearing on labor racketeering. 
   Then-Senator Kennedy knew, as we affirm today, that rank-and-file union members deserve the right to know how their unions were spending and investing their members' dues money; that their unions' books were clean; and that elections for union officers would be fair and free of intimidation or scandal. 
   Do labor unions need a government watchdog? Apparently so. Since 2001, OLMS has helped obtain 750 convictions and restitution of over $70 million for union members in criminal cases of embezzlement and election irregularities. 
   Some of my colleagues may dismiss these monetary results as just small change compared to the billions of assets held by labor unions, but they miss the point. Stealing from your fellow union members is against the law, regardless of whether the theft is $10,000 or $100,000. And anywhere in the country but Washington, D.C., $10,000 is a lot of money. 
   OLMS functions like the Securities and Exchange Commission for labor unions. Why should rank-and-file union members not be protected in the same way as individual shareholders of corporations? Senator Paul Sarbanes agreed. During the debate on the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation in 2002, he argued that if union financial disclosure and accountability was already required by law and wasn't being funded, he suggested that the Department of Labor request the money from Congress. 
   Madam Chairman, DOL is not only being denied the increase it asked for; it is being cut to the bone. Federal law requires financial transparency and disclosure from corporations, pension plans, lobbyists and Members of Congress. Why would we not enforce the one law on the books that enables rank-and-file union members to review the financial expenditures of their unions? 
   I find it ironic, Madam Chairman, that the House Financial Services Appropriations Subcommittee provided $3.1 million over the administration's budget request for the SEC, while OLMS was being cut below fiscal year 2007 levels. Clearly, we put a high priority on corporate accountability. We need to put the same high priority on union accountability. 
   Although this is a modest amendment, it will enable this enforcement agency within the Department of Labor to maintain its audit program and other activities under the Labor Management Reporting Disclosure Act. I cannot believe that this House would say to union members throughout America that we do not support your right to know and your right to union integrity. 
   I urge all Members to vote for this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   There are a couple of points I would like to address. It has been an interesting debate, as these things often turn in to be. We have heard the gentleman from Rhode Island say that this base bill just keeps it going presumably at the current level. And, as we have already heard established, this is in fact a $2 million cut, $11 million below the President's request. 
   The gentleman from Rhode Island is right, though, when he talked about this being about people checking their own books and covering their tracks. That is exactly what this is about. He was talking about perhaps corporations, and we have already talked about increasing the money to provide oversight and law enforcement for corporations. But this is about unions. This is about American workers. 
   We have looked at the money percentage cut/percentage increase. We have already confirmed that this is a $2 million cut, as my colleague from Georgia says. And I just find it interesting, looking at the figures here, we have added $935 million to President Bush's fiscal year 2008 budget request for the Department of Labor, and within that budget increase are individual funding increases for every single enforcement office within the agency except this one, this one whose job it is to make sure that union leaders who are misbehaving are not able to just check their own books and cover their tracks. Somebody else has got to hold them accountable. 
   And this embezzlement is not restricted to one or two people in one or two States. We have examples over the last 3 or 4 years of misconduct by union leaders in 48, at least, of the 50  States. A couple of examples here might be relevant. 
   Looking at the neighboring State of Wisconsin, on September 21, 2006, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, Felix A. Robinson, former president of the Industrial Division of the Communication Workers of America, Local 84101, pled guilty to one count of embezzling union funds. The guilty plea followed investigation by the OLMS Milwaukee district office. 
   Sad to say it happens in my own State. On February 22 of this year, 2007, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, Catherine Bronson, former business representative for Hotel and Restaurant Employees Local 21 in Rochester, Minnesota, was sentenced to 180 days of home confinement.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. We have pages and pages of examples. Let me just give another one so that my colleagues and the workers of America understand that we are talking about misbehavior, illegal behavior on the part of people who have the responsibility for taking care of their union dues. 
   November 7, 2006, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, Timothy J. Pulvermacher, former financial secretary for USWA Local 9444 pled guilty to embezzling union funds. 
   January 8, 2007, Kathryn Stark, former office manager for IBEW Local 31 was sentenced to a 6-month confinement. 
   Why? Because they are abusing their union members. They are stealing from them. And this is the only office that has the responsibility and authority for holding them accountable. 
   So we can debate for all day, I suppose, who is for the worker and who is not for the worker and whether the tax cuts are good for the worker. We certainly believe they are on this side of the aisle. But that is not what my amendment is about. My amendment is about making sure that the office who has the responsibility for holding union leaders accountable for their workers' funds has the staff it needs to do the job. 
   The base bill, cutting $2 million would force that office to cut staff members, the very people who conduct the investigations and bring these people to justice. 
   Again, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment which supports the union workers of America and holds those who misbehave accountable. And I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 2,600 men and women of the Minnesota National Guard who, after serving our country with great honor and courage, are returning home from their 16-month deployment to Iraq. 
   Last Friday my friend and colleague, Congressman Tim Walz, and I had the privilege of visiting Volk Field near Fort McCoy in Wisconsin and welcoming home soldiers from the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division, the famed ``Red Bulls.'' It was truly a memorable experience greeting these proud soldiers as they returned from the longest combat deployment of any Army brigade combat team in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Minnesota's ``Red Bulls'' escorted supply convoys and traveled 2.4 million miles in Iraq. Other members of the BCT provided essential security to U.S. bases throughout the country. 
   Speaking with the fine men and women of the ``Red Bulls'' as they stepped off the plane and smelled that clean, fresh air and stepped on American soil, it became clear that these soldiers are justifiably proud of their accomplishments. The great State of Minnesota and all Americans can be proud as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 185, which commends the men and women of the 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry Division, Minnesota National Guard, for completing the longest continuous deployment of any United States combat team in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Mr. Speaker, these men and women did not want to set this record. They didn't seek this record. In fact, when they left these shores, they had no idea this record was going to be theirs: 16 months in a combat zone, 22 months of mobilization. But when the word came, they didn't flinch. They set forward, they did their duty and they set a record, one which I certainly hope no other unit will ever be asked to surpass. 
   The men and women of the 1st Brigade Combat Team are some of this Nation's finest soldiers. Their first-rate service in Iraq carries on the tradition of excellence established by previous generations of the 1st Brigade, through service in the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, and both world wars. 
   The more than 2,200 Minnesotans and 1,300 more Midwestern soldiers who served in the 1st Brigade in Iraq performed remarkably during their unrivaled tour of duty. These soldiers completed more than 5,200 combat logistics patrols, secured 2.4 million convoy miles, captured over 400 suspected insurgents, and discovered 462 improvised explosive devices prior to detonation. They also helped to start two Iraqi newspapers and completed 137 reconstruction projects. 
   As a mark of their commitment to the unit and to this Nation, more than 1,400 members of the brigade reenlisted, reenlisted, while in Iraq, and 21 members became United States citizens. 
   Throughout their long tour of duty, their historic tour of duty, the soldiers of the 1st Brigade Combat Team had the steady support of families and employers. The soldiers are now home and beginning the process of reintegration through the Minnesota National Guard's extensive Beyond the Yellow Ribbon program. 
   Mr. Speaker, given their admirable and courageous service over so long a period of time, and in recognition of their willingness to put service to country over personal interest, it is only fitting that we take this opportunity to commend the men and women of the 1st Brigade Combat Team. 
   I want to thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) for bringing this measure forward and for his service with the National Guard. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in strong support of this concurrent resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (COMBUSTIBLE DUST EXPLOSION AND FIRE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in support of workplace safety, but in opposition to H.R. 5522, the Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Prevention Act. We all share, I believe, the common goal of working to protect employees from hazards in the workplace. The accident at the Imperial Sugar refinery in Georgia is a tragedy. It must be fully investigated. The Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has undertaken the investigation that, by law, must be completed within 6 months. The results of this investigation will help identify the cause of the Imperial Sugar accident. 
   I appreciate the concern about workers' safety, but as lawmakers, we have the responsibility to debate and enact laws that are reasonable. The bill before us today is an impulsive attempt to rush into action before OSHA can complete the investigation. 
   Under this bill, OSHA will be required to adopt an interim rule within 90 days of enactment and a final rule within 18 months. This accelerated time frame is not only unrealistic, but would also deny stakeholder input ranging from industry, to academia, to organized labor, and other groups who could provide important and insightful contributions. By undermining the process, this legislation could have negative consequences and actually undercut workers' safety. 
   In a letter to the committee dated April 8, 2008, the Department of Labor's Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health, Edwin Foulke, states: ``The time constraints of this legislation would give OSHA no choice but to ignore other statutory and regulatory requirements for rulemaking under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Administrative Procedures Act, numerous executive orders, and Office of Management and Budget bulletins and guidelines.'' 
   H.R. 5522 also disregards the preventive efforts that have been under way well before the tragic accident in Georgia. Last year, based on the recommendations by the Chemical Safety Board, OSHA initiated a National Emphasis Program that aims to identify any gaps that may exist among the standards that currently apply to workplaces with combustible dust. While OSHA's opinion has been dismissed by the other side, yesterday the President issued a veto threat, reiterating serious concerns with this hasty regulatory proposal. 
   Again, we should not rush to legislative action. Rather, we should take the time to thoroughly and thoughtfully review all the facts. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this rule. Once again, the majority has seen fit to stifle debate when considering significant legislation. 
   Yesterday, I and several other members of the Education and Labor Committee presented amendments to the members of the Rules Committee with the expectation that those amendments would be seriously considered. It's now become apparent that that hearing was really just a facade; the decision had already been made to exclude those amendments. 
   If I had had the opportunity to offer my amendment today under a fair rule, House Members would have seen that the concept of my amendment was simple: to ensure that those most in need, college graduates that serve the public interest and college students in need of government grants, are the direct beneficiaries of Federal interest rate reductions. Instead, the majority has treated us to a show worthy of the best Las Vegas illusionist, a reconciliation process intended to reduce the growth in entitlement spending that instead creates nine new entitlement programs. That's right. The reconciliation process is designed to reduce the growth in entitlement spending to cut the Federal deficit; and, instead, this bill creates nine new entitlement programs.  
   While openly declaring that the underlying bill expands educational benefits for students, a little sleight of hand instead reveals legislation that fails to target aid to those students most in need. 
   My amendment, rejected by the Rules Committee along party lines, would have focused our limited Federal funding on those college graduates that chose a path offering less monetary reward, but serving, arguably, a much greater public purpose. My amendment achieved this goal by ensuring that those graduates who can pay their loans under a higher interest rate do so by establishing an income cap of $65,000 for single graduates and $135,000 for married couples, the income levels at which the existing student loan tax reductions are phased out. 
   After reaching that income level, which is almost twice the average family income of a student eligible to receive a subsidized student loan, the interest rate for a loan would have reverted to the current level of 6.8 percent. Those graduates who may not have as high an income, however, would have seen their interest rates stay at the reduced level. This includes, of course, those most in need because they chose to serve the public interest: members of the Armed Forces, first responders, nurses, teachers, and other graduates who choose careers in public service. By adding a fair, balanced income cap adjustment, we would have generated additional savings that could have been directed toward another truly deserving group, those utilizing need-based aid through the Pell Grant program. 
   Unfortunately, more than 400,000 students, Mr. Speaker, are fully prepared to attend a 4-year college but will be unable to do so because of enormous financial barriers. As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, it is paramount for me to prioritize the expansion of secondary education access for low- and middle-income students whenever possible. I am disappointed, but sadly, not surprised, the majority has instead chosen to rely on the same tired strategy of expanding entitlement spending for institutions to the detriment of currently college students struggling to pay their high tuition costs.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, the tax relief and fiscal policies passed in recent years by, frankly, House Republicans, provide a track record of proactive and successful economic reform. As we take our first steps in the 110th Congress, we must build upon that record and ensure that any minimum wage increase includes meaningful considerations for America's small businesses, while protecting and expanding benefits for working families that depend upon them. 
   Less than a week ago, the Labor Department announced the creation of 167,000 new jobs in December. We have experienced more than 3 years of uninterrupted job growth that includes the creation of more than seven million new jobs since August, 2003. Worker wages have risen more than 150 percent faster than in the early 1990s. Per capita disposable income has risen over 9 percent since 2001. 
   Let's not stop the momentum we have built together. Let's not pass a minimum wage increase without keeping employers in mind. Let's not fall into the temptation of passing a bill that is nothing more than symbolism, lacking the necessary substance to help our economy continue to grow. 
   As we consider an increase in the minimum wage, we must consider the impact it will have on businesses that create two-thirds of our Nation's new jobs. I was proud to support Mr. McKeon and Mr. McCrery's Working Families Wage and Access to Health Care legislation, which advances this discussion and also offers meaningful measures that will benefit those employers who bear the brunt of any minimum wage increase. If we don't support them, the cruel irony of any minimum wage increase will be a loss of jobs. 
   Independent studies confirm that the proposal by the House Democrats to raise the minimum wage without including considerations for those who pay the minimum wage and their workers would halt the momentum of recent economic growth dead in its tracks. According to a Federal Reserve economist, as many as one million workers in the restaurant industry alone could lose their jobs under this current proposal. 
   Recently, my office received a phone call from Mr. John Wiederholt, the owner of Wiederholt's Supper Club in Miesville, Minnesota, a wonderful little community of 135 people located in the heart of my district. Miesville is known for amateur baseball, a historic hamburger joint and Wiederholt's. 
   The Democrats scaled-down proposal would cost Mr. Wiederholt's charming supper club nearly $2,000 a year. He says: ``I've been at this 34 years. If this passes, because my waitresses get tips already, they just walked into my place and gave the highest-paid people in my place a raise.'' 
   Throughout the country, there are tens of thousands of stories just like Mr. Wiederholt's. Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. It is absolutely essential that Congress keeps these creators of jobs in mind when we consider this legislation. We must make sure a minimum wage increase does not have harmful effects on businesses and their ability to foster job growth and provide benefits for working families.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (HONORING THE MARE ISLAND ORIGINAL 21ERS -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res 31. 
   First, I would like to thank the gentleman from California, my friend and our committee's new chairman, for bringing this important legislation to the floor of the House. 
   Madam Speaker, the British political philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke famously observed many years ago that, ``The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.'' 
   Forty-five years ago, at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, there was such a group of good men who chose not to do nothing, but instead to do something. These men whom today we know as the Mare Island Original 21ers took a brave step by coming forward and raising complaints about how they felt they were being treated and about the discrimination they faced based on their race. 
   Madam Speaker, we lived in a different time then. The year was 1961, and there was no Civil Rights Act protecting Americans from discrimination in the workplace based on race or color. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which today works to ensure that our workplaces are free of discrimination, did not yet exist. Indeed, then-President Kennedy had only just established the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and the things we take for granted in our society today. That the color of one's skin, whether in a boardroom or a boiler room, simply does not matter was not yet ingrained in our national consciousness. 
   Now, the Original 21ers' complaint did not immediately serve to address all of the issues they faced. As with all struggles, they faced backlash and challenge. In the end, though, they prevailed. 
   Today, I can state with authority from firsthand experience as a former United States Marine that our Armed Forces are a model of integration and  nondiscrimination, that in today's military it truly is one's skills, talents, ability, and merit that allows men and women of any color, race, or creed to advance to the highest levels of leadership. That is exactly how it should be. 
   I would also echo the gentleman from California's comments with respect to the importance of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the continued good work done by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the hundreds and thousands of employers and businesses in this country who have worked to ensure that the workplace of 2007 is free from discrimination on any racial or any other grounds. 
   Today, as our military looks forward and continues to prepare itself for the challenge of the 21st century and beyond, we pause for a moment to look back and remember some of those who took brave first steps. The Mare Island Original 21ers are among those courageous men, and it is proper that Congress today should pause to commemorate their efforts.     
   I thank the gentleman from California for his leadership and initiative on this issue. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am saddened and, frankly, appalled that today in this House of Representatives we are debating a bill to put ``retreat and defeat'' into law at a time when we have our young men and women engaged in combat. There are many things, Mr. Speaker, which affect the morale of men and women in uniform and men and women in combat, but putting into law mandating their defeat is certainly one of them. 
   Mr. Speaker, on February 10, 2007, General Petraeus addressed the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and civilians under his command in a short letter. In that letter, General Petraeus explained quite clearly that ``the way ahead will not be easy. There will be difficult times in the months to come. But hard is not hopeless, and we must remain steadfast to help improve security for the Iraqi people.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill makes hard hopeless. 
   As a 25-year veteran of the Marine Corps and the father of a soldier recently returned from Iraq, it is with great hardship that I now oppose this emergency supplemental. This supplemental does not support our military; it undermines the best opportunity to prevent the dire predictions of our Intelligence Community when they put out that NIE saying that this course of action which will be driven by this bill will increase sectarian violence, cause massive civilian casualties, create a terror safe haven and a potential for wider conflict that would draw in other regional powers. 
   Again, General Petraeus said, in talking to his soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, ``Success will require discipline, fortitude and initiative, qualities that you have in abundance.'' Would that we have more of that here.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, al Qaeda and their terrorist allies are America's number one enemy. We all know that. They are constantly updating the way they communicate and dodge our intelligence networks. We should be doing nothing short of providing our intelligence officials with every tool necessary to always stay a step ahead of these radical extremists. 
   Admiral Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, when asked about the Protect America Act, said this, ``We must be able to continue effectively obtaining the information gained through this law if we are to stay ahead of terrorists who are determined to attack the United States.'' 
   House Republicans have led the way in delivering 21st century intelligence collection to protect our citizens. The law now gives enforcement the tools and flexibility needed to quickly respond to terrorist threats because House Republicans acted to close a dangerous loophole in an outdated intelligence law. But the law is threatened today by the House Democrat majority who are more interested in getting it for partisan reasons than to provide this country and our allies abroad the protection necessary as we continue to fight terrorism. 
   A short-term extension is not enough. We need a permanent fix now.

   Earlier this year, many of us felt the pain when a young marine in my district committed suicide after honorably serving in Iraq after he visited two VA hospitals. We recognize, as a body here, that we need to provide the funding for our VA. We passed the bill in this House, 409-2. This is a bill with bipartisan support. 
   We have heard rhetoric from the other side of the floor that says this is so important that we should pass this legislation no matter what pork-laden legislation it's tied to. That's what is the trouble here, my colleagues, is that the leadership of this House has taken a cynical action to attach an important bill that has strong bipartisan support to a piece of legislation they know that many of us did not support and the President has promised a veto. 
   I ask the leadership to reach out, as one of my colleagues said, and work in a bipartisan way, which is easily done by separating this legislation. Let's get it done today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for her thoughtfulness and leadership in bringing this resolution to the floor.  
   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 305. Mr. Speaker, next week will mark the 27th anniversary of Operation Eagle Claw, better known to most Americans as ``Desert One,'' which the distinguished chairman mentioned moments ago. 
   On April 24, 1980, a task force consisting of Army special forces, Army Rangers, Air Force special operations wing personnel and the Navy, Marines and Air Force succeeded in moving thousands of miles, undetected, until reaching a remote location in the Iranian desert 200 miles from Tehran in an effort to rescue the American hostages being held at the American Embassy. 
   A combination of helicopters and C-130 aircraft rendezvoused with the intention of rescuing these hostages in Tehran the following evening. Due to mechanical failures and weather problems, only six out of eight helicopters successfully arrived at the Desert One rendezvous. Once the six helicopters arrived, the rescue attempt was dealt a final blow when it was learned that one of the helicopters had lost its primary hydraulic system. 
   As the various aircraft began moving into position to return to their respective launching points, one of the helicopters, flown by one of my very best friends, collided with a C-130 aircraft on the ground. Flames engulfed the helicopter and the C-130, which resulted in the death of five airmen and three marines. 
   During my 25 years in the Marine Corps, I had the good fortune to know many of the heroes of that day, and I did, in fact, count many of them as my best friends. These brave men were asked, and all proudly volunteered, to undertake the challenge of rescuing their fellow Americans in a mission of the utmost secrecy and gravest danger. 
   Members from all branches of our armed services came together, bringing with them the best of skills and experience, but it was not enough to do the job. In the end, inadequate equipment, tremendous dust storms, extraordinary logistical challenges contributed to the mission's failure. But these circumstances in no way diminished the skill and bravery of the men who took on this hazardous mission against all odds. 
   Out of the ashes of Operation Eagle Claw arose the organization that we honor today. In 1986, Congress established a new unified command for special operations forces, designated as the U.S. Special Operations Command. And today we gratefully honor the 20th anniversary of SOCOM's founding and the men and women who fill its ranks. 
   Like their predecessors, the men and women that comprise today's special operations forces have accepted the challenge of tackling some of the most difficult and dangerous missions assigned to our military. As we have witnessed in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, the Philippines and in many other locations across the globe, they have handled these missions with honor and skillful professionalism. 
   To those who perished in Operation Eagle Claw and the many SOCOM missions since then, we offer our sincere appreciation. And to those who carry on their noble mission, we pledge our Nation's support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 2831. I think it's been really an interesting debate this evening. We've heard views on both sides, and clearly, we simply disagree on some fundamental aspects of this, and I want to address that as well during my 3 minutes. 
   Speaker after speaker on this side of the aisle has stood up and said that this legislation effectively eliminates the statute of limitations for a broad range of discrimination claims. I believe that's correct. 
   The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller) stood up here and recounted for us the activities of the Supreme Court, and he quoted from the justices the language that pertained, and it seemed clear to me that there was a fairness issue here. And while our hearts were all touched by the testimony of Lilly Ledbetter and by the circumstances of her case, it was clear to the court and to Mr. Keller and to me that it's simply unreasonable to allow year after year after year to go by after a discriminatory act occurs before you make the claim, when in some cases people will have left, perhaps have died and moved on. 
   This is a huge boon to the trial lawyers of America. It's going to bring forward endless litigation, case after case going on day after day. What businesses will have to do in terms of recordkeeping is staggering in its scale. 
   This imperils pensions. One of our colleagues brought up that issue. It is not at all clear, despite some findings language in the bill, that our pensions will be protected in this legislation. Potentially, you can have pensions who simply don't have the funds to pay the earned benefits. This is bad policy, Mr. Speaker, and it's made in haste. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that this legislation amounts to a significant change in our civil rights laws. It's very clear to me, and unfortunately, many of the questions of concern raised by the Ledbetter case have yet to be answered. In the normal legislative process, such questions would have been raised in committee hearings, subcommittee and full committee. Concerns would have been debated in good faith. 
   Unfortunately, this was not the process that brought this bill to the floor. The Committee on Education and Labor had no legislative hearings. The bill was not before us the one time we had some witnesses before us to talk about this at all. The time elapsed from the bill's introduction to committee markup was little more than 24 business hours, and we learned on Friday that we were going to be debating this bill on the floor today. Surely, a huge change like this to our civil rights laws deserves more of our time, attention and effort than the majority has seen fit to provide. 
   Once again, the majority has chosen haste and speed over quality in making public policy. My concerns and unanswered questions can only lead me to say that the Ledbetter bill makes for bad policy, creating a flawed legislative process. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and for his kind words. 
   I, like the gentleman from California, have a son serving in uniform and I am very proud of his service, proud of Mr. Hunter's son's service in the Marine Corps and my son's service in the Army in Iraq. I understand that on January 1 my son is heading to Afghanistan. So I do feel a certain personal importance to what we are discussing today and to the funding for our troops. But collectively we have all sent our sons and daughters into combat, into dangerous theaters in the world, and we need to make sure that we are giving them every chance for victory. 
   My good friend and colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey, said that we have learned some things not to do and some things to do. I would argue that the thing not to do is to take a strategy which is clearly working, which is bringing increased security to a dangerous spot in the world, to a strategy that is producing more electricity, more oil, opening schools, shops. You don't take that strategy and pull the rug out from under it. 
   Last July, Madam Speaker, I and other Members stood on this floor to ask our colleagues not to snatch the possibility of victory away from our soldiers and marines. In an atmosphere filled with overblown rhetoric predicting the failure of surge operations before they had begun in earnest, General Petraeus and those under his command pushed forward into the streets of Baghdad and into the tribal-dominated areas of al Anbar province. They engaged and destroyed al Qaeda cells while working closely with tribal leaders to establish a lasting stability in once hostile Sunni areas. 
   Just a few short months ago, critics in this body and the Senate declared defeat, declared defeat before giving success a chance. They did not believe our fighting men and women, implementing General Petraeus' new counterinsurgency strategy, could rout al Qaeda and insurgent forces and win over the Iraqi population. I am proud to say that they were wrong, and that is what has happened. 
   As we proceed with conference negotiations on this National Defense Authorization Act, I would urge my colleagues not to repeat the mistake we have sadly made many times before. We must not declare defeat while our military forces fight for victory. This motion to instruct conferees is just a small step to ensure that the position of this body is not to accept a strategy which will produce a failed state in Iraq. 
   In a letter to his troops before commencing the surge operations, General Petraeus noted that, ``Success will require discipline, fortitude and initiative, qualities that you have in abundance.'' 
   The question before us today, Madam Speaker, is the same one I asked in July: Do we in Congress have those same qualities?

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my colleagues in strong support of this legislation. At a time when our Nation is at war on multiple fronts, we must maintain a strong commitment to these brave men and women in uniform who stand in defense of our Nation. This legislation takes a responsible, forward-looking approach to the funding of our current operations and provides for the needs of our American heroes. 
   In addition to the things already mentioned by my colleagues, such as an increase in end strength and the very important pay raise, I am particularly pleased at the inclusion of two important legislative provisions that I introduced earlier this year, the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program and authorization for assignment incentive pay for National Guardsmen unfairly denied this benefit. 
   The Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program nationalizes a program created by the Minnesota National Guard. Through experiences drawn from the deployments of smaller units to Iraq and Afghanistan, the Minnesota Guard developed a unique combat veteran reintegration program with a focus on supporting servicemembers and their families throughout the entire deployment cycle. 
   With this focus, the Minnesota Yellow Ribbon program has proven an effective means to prepare every combat veteran and their family for a safe, healthy and successful reintegration. This multifaceted program includes workshops and training events at 30-day, 60-day and 90-day intervals for servicemembers following their demobilization. 
   This bill also moves us toward fixing a major disparity among Minnesota National Guardsmen. Congress created assignment incentive pay to recognize the hardship of prolonged mobilization periods for Reservists and Guardsmen called up under partial mobilization authority. The military services, however, deploy Guardsmen and Reservists under other mobilization authorities.  
   Through no fault of their own, many Minnesota National Guardsmen who served in Bosnia and Kosovo were mobilized using different authorities. When these same soldiers, many of them senior non-commissioned officers, were asked to deploy with their fellow Guardsmen to Iraq in 2006, those who had served in Kosovo were given $1,000 a month in assignment incentive pay while those who had served in Bosnia were not. Clearly this is not fair. I am very pleased that this legislation recognizes that and rectifies this disparity. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would encourage all of my colleagues to join me today in voting for this important legislation that supports our troops.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman. I have a remark I would like to make in a few minutes. I know our friend and colleague, the gentleman from Tennessee, has some comments he would like to make. But I was struck, in view of the discussion we are having right here, that today in that hearing that the gentleman was just talking about, the Joint House Armed Services Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, that General Petraeus was forced, I believe is the right word, to do something that I find absolutely extraordinary.     
   I have got his report right here to Congress on the situation in Iraq. 
   In the second paragraph, after he thanks the chairmen and ranking members, he says, ``At the outset, I would like to note that this is my testimony. Although I have briefed my assessment and recommendations to my chain of command, I wrote this testimony myself. It has not been cleared by nor shared with anyone in the Pentagon, the White House or Congress.'' 
   To think, one of the finest officers in the American Armed Forces felt it necessary to put this in the opening two sentences of his testimony, I find shocking and distressing. I am sure we will have more to say about that later. 
   But it is not only in response to this scurrilous ad, unforgivable ad that moveon.org has written, but, frankly, as my colleagues here know, there have been comments made by some of our colleagues directly challenging and questioning the integrity of General Petraeus. And when I saw this today, I was just appalled that we have reached that point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to pick up on some of the comments that our friend and colleague, the gentleman from Mississippi, was addressing when he was talking about some of the information in the testimony that we heard today from both General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. 
   I have the testimony from General Petraeus here in my hand. Mr. Speaker, I thought I would touch on a couple of the points that he made. He says that the progress our forces have achieved with the Iraqi counterparts has been substantial. He says, I see improvements in the security environment. The level of security incidents has decreased significantly since the start of the surge of offensive operations in mid-June. Civilian deaths have declined considerably. He says locals have increasingly supported our efforts. While he says al Qaeda certainly is not defeated, it is off balance and we are pursuing its leaders and operators aggressively. 
   This report is not all rosy. General Petraeus made the point several times during the over 6 hours of testimony that we had today that he doesn't want to look at this from a rosy standpoint or a pessimistic standpoint or an optimistic standpoint, but from a realistic standpoint; and I believe that this great leader, this great general, this man of great integrity and competence and capability did just that for us today. 
   One of the things that came up repeatedly during the hearing today was a reference to another report and another hearing that we on the Armed Services Committee heard about last week. General James Jones, a former commandant of the Marine Corps, the former Supreme Allied Commander Europe, was the head of a commission, a very distinguished commission, I might add, one of the most experienced I have ever seen, that had military officers and senior noncommissioned officers and experienced law enforcement personnel go over to Iraq with the charge to evaluate the Iraqi security forces.     
   Repeatedly today, and sometimes last week, we heard our colleagues saying, well, General Jones came with a very pessimistic report, and he had great concerns that things aren't going well. And one of our colleagues actually asked the question, General Petraeus, how do you square, how do you reconcile, if you will, these differences in reports. 
   And I remember thinking, Mr. Speaker, when I was in that Armed Services Committee hearing and listening to General Jones and his exceptionally well-qualified colleagues, that the hearing that we were experiencing was not at all like the news reports, perhaps like the ads we saw earlier today, but was not at all like the news reports we had seen before the testimony in the Armed Services Committee. 
   And just as an example, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to quote just a few things that General Jones and some of his colleagues said during that hearing. 
   He said, our first conclusion is that the Iraqi security forces as a whole cannot yet defend the territorial integrity of Iraq. This is not necessarily an alarming conclusion, he said. They're able to do more in terms of combating the internal security threats to Iraq, and that's positive. He said, we've noted improvement in the internal security missions such as denying the safe haven to terrorists, and this progress is likely to continue in the months ahead. He says, the Iraqi security forces can bring greater security to the provinces in the next 12 to 18 months, assuming a continuing rate of progress. He said, the impact of the surge has had a tactical success for both Iraqi and coalition forces in the Baghdad region. 
   That doesn't sound like a pessimistic report or out of step with what General Petraeus said today. It's what we have known for some time, and I'm sure that my colleagues on their trips to Iraq have had the same experiences and reports that I have, and that is, that the Iraqi Army has been making steady progress but the police forces are in some disarray and need of major improvements. 
   In fact, General Jones and his commission recommended that the national police force, a relatively small group of 25,000, be disbanded and distributed to other forces and that the much larger Iraqi security police be strengthened. Again, not at all out of sync with what we heard today. 
   And in fact, because I had heard in previous trips to Iraq that the Iraqi Army was doing well and the Iraqi police was not doing well, I said to General Jones, well, this seems very consistent with the message that we have heard for some time. So I'm not surprised to hear you say that, and you probably weren't surprised to find that yourself. 
   And I thought this was amazing. He said, and I will check my notes here to make sure that I've got this right, he says, I was pleasantly surprised. I'd been going to Iraq off and on since 2003 in my NATO hat, and again, he was the commander of NATO, but I think I did not expect to see the will that I saw in the Iraqi Armed Forces to take the fight to the enemy. I did not expect to see the length and breadth of the institutions that are functioning that you need to support an emerging army, the training bases, the recruiting, the recruit training, NCO schools, counterintelligence schools, training corpsmen. All of those things exist. We know that because we saw them.  
   This was a very highly experienced group of four-star and three-star generals, sergeants major, police chiefs that went, and this was their assessment when they came back. And again, this seems to me very consistent with General Petraeus' report today that said, well, things are still tough over there, but the surge is working and we're making progress. I know my colleague wants to talk about some of those recommendations in a bit, but I just want to go to one more.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for that. Reclaiming my time, if it's mine to reclaim, I'm not sure sometimes in these Special Orders whose time it is. I think it's the gentleman from Georgia's, but I don't want to have my colleagues or Americans believe that General Jones or General Petraeus came with nothing but good news. That's not the case. 
   As we discussed earlier, the Jones commission recommended some major changes in how the police is trained and equipped and how it functions and how it's organized, that they were highly critical of the Ministry of the Interior and how they're functioning and, in many cases, failing to function. So there are clearly problems, but the Jones report, the Jones commission did not come back and say that all is lost and Iraqi security forces are all failing. 
   In fact, that paragraph that I read quoting General Jones talking about how he was pleasantly surprised about the terrific progress of the Iraqi Army underscores that some good things are happening. 
   I thought it was interesting in that hearing, as my colleague from Georgia no doubt remembers, during the question-and-answer period, the former Deputy Secretary John Hamre, former Deputy Secretary of Defense, was asked some questions about what we should do in Iraq, should we leave or should we leave quickly or were things too bad. And he said in part, and again I'm quoting, but we have strategic interests that are larger than just Iraq. I mean our continued influence and presence in the region, the ability to get continued access to energy resources, providing a counterweight to Iran. We have large strategic interests. Every one of those interests would be seriously diminished if we had to crawl out of Iraq or run out of Iraq. 
   I think that is significant, Mr. Speaker. He made the point that when we leave Iraq, we walk out of Iraq on 
   our terms, having defeated in large measure al Qaeda and left an Iraq with a promising future with the violence under control and political progress being made. 
   And so I just think that we have seen some unfortunate, really strident partisan statements made in the last week or so, and I guess it's unavoidable that people tend to go to sources that match their perspective. But I thought that the constant referring to the Jones Commission's report as somehow undermining what General Petraeus was saying or not consistent with it or indicating that all was lost in Iraq was simply not correct. And these quotes were part of many in what I thought was a very thorough, complete testimony and thorough hearing when we had the members of that commission in before the Armed Services Committee.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. If the gentleman would yield for just a minute, that's what struck me is that, very much like General Petraeus' testimony today, the media discussion and the political discussion and the partisan discussion that led up to the testimony simply didn't match the testimony that we heard in either of these hearings. 
   For example, I'm sure that many of our colleagues were surprised, and frankly I was, to hear General Petraeus say that it's tough but we're making progress, and we're making progress to the point where I'm going to recommend that we draw down our forces to the presurge level of brigade combat teams and we do it by next July. I was surprised that he put that date in there and that certainty in there when he made that statement. 
   He said we're going to start drawing down this year, brigade combat team is going to come back, Marine expeditionary unit is going to come back, and we're going to continue to draw down through the spring and into the summer. And that is consistent with the original intent of the surge. It was temporary with what the Iraq Study Group said about a temporary surge, and in fact, I think it's very consistent with what the Jones commission said as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Madam Chair, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the committee members and Chairmen SKELTON and SNYDER for their support of the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program in this year's Defense authorization bill in the en bloc amendment. Inclusion of this program in the bill will move us forward as we seek to fill a gap that has only widened as our Nation has come to rely increasingly on the National Guard and Reserves to assist in combat operations. 
   Based upon his experiences as a returning Vietnam War veteran, Minnesota National Guard Adjutant General Larry Shellito took the lead to build a reintegration program for returning Guardsmen who lack the established support infrastructure of their active duty counterparts. General Shellito and the Minnesota National Guard leadership have developed an innovative program to change how returning soldiers and airmen are reintegrated back into their communities. 
   Through experiences drawn from the deployments of smaller units to Iraq and Afghanistan and Kosovo, they developed a unique combat veteran reintegration program with a focus on supporting soldiers and their families throughout the entire deployment cycle. This multifaceted program includes workshops for families and communities to help them for their servicemember's return and training events at 30, 60 and 90-day intervals for servicemembers following their demobilization. 
   The training events have given Guardsmen and Reservists the opportunity to engage VA and health care representatives, while also allowing platoon sergeants and commanders to check in with their troops. Experience has shown that catching signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or even marital problems early can prevent even more severe problems in the future. 
   I believe the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program represents the best ideas of not only Minnesota but also States and territories throughout the Nation that have stepped in to provide reintegration services to their troops. 
   As envisioned, the Yellow Ribbon program included members of the other Reserve components in only a voluntary, unpaid status due to financial constraints. So I would like to thank Chairmen SKELTON and SNYDER for their support in finding the additional funding necessary to expand this program beyond the National Guard to all Reservists.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank Dr. Price for yielding and for really exerting the leadership to take the floor week after week and shine the light of truth on a lot of the obfuscation which, unfortunately, takes place on this floor and in this House. 
   We had the opportunity to chat a little bit today about the Democrat Party's plan here in the upcoming weeks with the supplemental funding and, in general, their plans for the war against Islamist extremists, the war, if you will, which is being certainly heavily fought in Iraq. And they do kind of have a plan. Their plan is not a plan for victory, however, and that is what I think we need to keep in mind. Their plan simply says: get out; get out of Iraq. And that is not a plan for victory. 
   There is a very interesting headline; perhaps you had a chance to talk about it before I made it down to the floor. In the Los Angeles Times editorial, it starts with a little headline that says: ``Do we really need a General Pelosi?'' I will quote: ``Imagine if Dwight Eisenhower had been forced to adhere to a congressional war plan in scheduling the Normandy landing, or if, in 1863, President Lincoln had been forced by Congress to conclude the Civil War the following year. This is the worst kind of congressional meddling in military strategy.'' The Los Angeles Times, not the place I would normally go to find criticism of the Democrat majority. 
   Well, I think that you and I would certainly concur that we don't need a General Pelosi. But we do have a general. We have a new general on the ground in Iraq, General David Petraeus, named by the Commander in Chief to execute this new strategy in Iraq, and confirmed, by the way, with no dissenting votes in the United States Senate. 
   Let me just go through a few quotes that the new commander has shared with us in the last couple of months. This is General David Petraeus, the commander of multi-national forces in Iraq, senior commander on the ground. In looking at what would happen if we precipitously withdrew from Iraq, he said, a number of other potential outcomes, none of which are positive, could occur: ``Sectarian groups would obviously begin to stake out their turf, try to expand their turf. They would do that by greatly increased ethnic cleansing.'' 
   On another occasion he said: ``The very real possibility of involvement of countries from elsewhere in the region around Iraq entering Iraq to take sides with one or the other groups.'' 
   A new quote: ``The possibility of an international terrorist organization truly getting a grip on some substantial piece of Iraq.'' 
   New quote: ``There is the possibility of problems in the global economy, should in fact this cause a disruption to the flow of oil,'' and so forth. 
   We have a general on the ground, I would say to my colleagues, and it is General David Petraeus, and it should not be either General Pelosi or, for that matter, anybody else in this body. We cannot, we cannot prosecute foreign policy at all and certainly a military operation with 535, or maybe it is 540 with the delegates voting, different Commanders in Chief. You cannot run an operation like this by committee. And I think it would behoove us, certainly as Members of this body, but as American people, to go with the Constitution, recognize that the Commander in Chief is in fact elected by the Nation to be that, and to abide by one of the fundamental principles of military operations, and that is unity of command. That is now being exercised by the Commander in Chief overall, and by General David Petraeus in Iraq.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Yes. And I am smiling a little bit, but of course we learned a very tough and bitter lesson when we tried to use the Continental Congress to, in fact, command the Army of the soon-to-be the United States and it did not work well. We would be foolish to try to duplicate that now. And, in fact, the proposed  supplemental, which we can talk about in a little more detail perhaps a little later in this hour, is an attempt to dictate the tactics that are being involved. It is micromanaging the war. It is taking away the resources that our troops need. 
   I wonder if I could take just a minute of our time here. I know that I have been a big supporter and I am sure you have of a bill sponsored by our colleague, a real American hero, Congressman Sam Johnson from Texas, who, as my colleagues know, spent 7 years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi and understands the stakes here as well as I am sure anybody in America. He has a bill that this entire body ought to get behind. It cuts to the heart of the matter and reassures our troops, our allies, and our enemies that we are not going to undercut our troops. So if I could just read a little bit of that bill because I think that that is what we should be about. I will skip a couple of paragraphs, all of which are important, talking about previous acts and resolutions of Congress, but picking up on subparagraph (4), it says: ``Members of the United States Armed Forces have served honorably in their mission to fight terrorism and protect the greater security of the United States. 
   ``These members of the Armed Forces and their families have made many sacrifices, in many cases the ultimate sacrifice, to protect the security of the United States and the freedom Americans hold dear. 
   ``Congress and the American people are forever grateful to the members of the Armed Forces for the service they have provided to the United States.'' 
   In that light it says: ``Faithful support of Congress--Congress will not cut off or restrict funding for units and members of the Armed Forces that the Commander in Chief has deployed in harm's way in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.'' 
   And that is the road that we ought to be going forward on. I would hope that more and more of our colleagues would sign onto this bill and that this really awful effort to take central funding away from our men and women who are, as we stand here now on this floor, engaged in protecting our freedoms and advancing the cause of liberty around the world, to keep that funding from being taken away from them. 
   I have talked to Sam many times. He and I are a part of an ever-dwindling group of Vietnam veterans in this body, and he and I and others have watched what happens when our young men and women go fight and give it their all and have the rug pulled out from under them by politicians in Washington, D.C. 
   We watched what happens when combat operations are run from Washington, D.C., and it doesn't matter whether it is being run from the White House situation room, as bombing targets were selected sort of famously by President Johnson, or whether it is dictating from the floor of this House. We should not let that happen. And since this is the Official Truth Squad, I think that our colleagues need to understand that that is at the core of what this very dangerous supplemental bill has added. It is a terrible micromanaging of the war, and it will be forcing, forcing, our defeat in Iraq. And, unfortunately, with that defeat the war doesn't just end. We are still in a war that is going to last a long time against radical Islam, against jihadists. Were we to suffer defeat in Iraq, the war becomes tougher for us, not easier. 
   And I see we are joined by some of our colleagues.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. If the gentleman will yield, we forget and time slips by that following that disastrous day, not some people were killed, but millions died. Again, we have forgotten the boats, the ships, with hundreds and thousands of Vietnamese scrambling to stay on board, leaky boats, rafts, as they tried to escape the horror that followed that day. A movie was made called ``The Killing Fields'' that depicted quite graphically the humanitarian disaster that followed that withdrawal. 
   I think that that scenario of a humanitarian disaster has been painted for us by a number of true experts in the field, even those who have been harshly critical of the administration's conduct of this war. The recognition that you could have that kind of bloodbath is widely seen, except perhaps by the House leadership, who has, as we said earlier, a plan for defeat in Iraq, which I am afraid would in fact lead to that kind of disaster.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding. That is exactly the point. 
   You had a chart up earlier that said something about you are entitled to your own opinion, but not your own facts. We seem to be very selective. We have heard a lot of very selective fact-choosing recently. 
   I remember in the debate we had on the floor of this body a couple of weeks ago, there were people who said consistently that the President's troop surge was in violation of the recommendation of the Iraq Study Group. We know for a fact that is not true, that on page 73 the Iraq Study Group agreed that a surge would be appropriate if it was requested by the commander on the ground, and we have covered in this Special Order the fact that the commander on the ground, General David Petraeus, has in fact said that he needs those troops, and it will be for a temporary basis. 
   If I can take one more minute, because I know our colleagues have joined us and others want to speak on this critical issue, we do have some details of the Democrat supplemental so far that I have been looking at and trying to figure out. It is just a barrage of demands on the administration for reports and certifications which will make this unworkable for the Commander in Chief. It is in fact micromanagement. 
   There is by July 1, 2007, the President has to report on a whole series of things. By October 1, 2007, he has to have another report verifying the report from July 1. In either case, if that doesn't satisfy the majority in the Congress, we have to start withdrawing troops within 180 days. If none of that applies and nothing else pertains by March 1, that is less than a year away, we have to begin deployment and redeployment. We have to leave; we have to retreat from Iraq within 180 days. This indeed details a plan for defeat. 
   I don't know yet exactly all it is going to say, but one of the things that is in this bill would require that no Federal funds could be used to send any military unit to Iraq ``unless the chief of the military department concerned has certified in writing at least 15 days in advance as to the readiness of this unit.'' I don't know, but if you are in the 82nd Airborne, within 15 days you are already long since on the ground and in combat. 
   It is horrible micromanaging. As I said in my opening remarks joining you here on the floor, I agree with the L.A. Times, and I don't get to say that very often, so perhaps I should say it again: I agree with the L.A. Times that we don't need a General Pelosi or a General Murtha, or for that matter a General Price or a General Kline. We have a general on the ground, and we ought to be doing everything in our power to make sure that he and our young men and women have everything they need to succeed. 
   I know that all of us worry about our sons and daughters that we send over there, we as a body. I certainly worry. My son has been over and back and is planning to deploy again to Afghanistan. I worry about my son and about all sons and daughters. But I absolutely do not want to be part of sending our sons and daughters into conflict knowing that all we have is a plan for them to fail. That, in my mind, and I think in many of their minds, is a betrayal.  
   I had some of the $21 billion of extra spending here, but I know that we have other colleagues that are joining us, and for that I thank you again for your leadership and yield back. 
   Mr. Price of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota again for his participation here and great perspective and for outlining truly what the majority party has done, and that is outlined their plan for failure. This is not a plan for victory. It is not even a plan for the defense of the United States. It is a plan for failure.     
   I think it is important that as we bring truth and light to this discussion and this debate that the American people appreciate that. 
   It is not by any grand fabrication that we come up with this Commander in Chief notion, it comes out of the Constitution of the United States. Article II, Section 2, for those who are interested in looking it up for themselves, says the President shall be the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States and of the militia of several States when called into actual service of the United States. 
   It doesn't say as long as the Speaker of the House says it is okay. It says that the President shall be the Commander in Chief. So if the majority leadership in this House wants to have a debate about whether or not we ought to fund the military challenges that we have around the world, including in Iraq, let us have that debate and let's have that vote. But let's not go through a micromanagement and a slow-bleed process which would be the death knell of our military accomplishments in the Middle East and in Iraq. 
   With that, I am pleased to have join us the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. David Davis). I welcome you and look forward to your comments.

   President Lincoln once told this Nation, ``A house divided against itself cannot stand.'' Madam Speaker, for this past month, Democratic leadership has needlessly attempted to divide this Congress on a national security matter.

   The leadership has kept this House divided, and for what reason? This morning the newspapers are full of reports that we are jeopardizing our national security in order to benefit the trial lawyers, who stand to gain billions of dollars in suits against the telecommunications companies. These are the companies that reportedly responded to pleas from our government for help, and now they are subject to potentially crippling lawsuits.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I too rise today in support of House Resolution 1332, which recognizes the importance of connecting foster youth to the workplace. This resolution also encourages employers to employ former foster youth. 
   On any given day, Madam Speaker, there are more than 500,000 youth in foster care in the United States. Children are placed in foster care when their parents are no longer able to ensure their essential well-being. These children need stable loving care until they can either safely reunite with their families or cultivate other lasting relationships with nurturing adults. 
   Foster youth possess unique qualities and skills that make them ideal candidates for employment. But compared to youth nationally and youth from low-income families, they are less likely to be employed or employed regularly. 
   Foster youth experience challenges based on the instability in their home and school environments. Just over half of all foster youth complete high school. 30 percent continue to rely on public assistance into adulthood, and 25 percent will experience homelessness at one point in their lives. 
   Without positive intervention, youth who age out of foster care often have bouts of homelessness, criminal activity and incarceration. However, when afforded comprehensive support, the resilient foster youth population excels in the job market. 
   Foster youth who begin connecting to the workforce prior to release from foster care maintain the highest probability of employment. By addressing job readiness early in the transition to adulthood, employers are helping to shape the future trajectories of these youth. 
   This resolution encourages employers of all sectors, including Federal, State and local government agencies, to increase employment of the young men and women who have been discharged from foster care in the United States. By connecting foster youth to the workforce through internship programs, employers can assist in building the foundation for these youth to become successful members of the workforce and to build successful careers. That is why I stand in support of this resolution and ask for all my colleagues support. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentlelady from Colorado for yielding, and for her excellent, truly excellent amendment. 
   I have been following the debate for some time now. Like many of our colleagues, sometimes we have to follow it in our office as we are conducting other business. And I hate that we have stooped to sort of name calling, which unfortunately I have seen. 
   I guess the gentleman from Ohio says that we're embracing the ``fringe'' label, and so therefore I suppose I'm down here to make the fringe larger. And I guess there is a little humor in that, and I will just take it in that sense because I'm sure my friend from Ohio didn't mean any harm by it. 
   But as my good friend, Mr. Pence, said in his comments, that if the fringe are those hardworking Americans who think they make better decisions on how to spend the money that they earn than we do here in Congress, then I'm in the right place. 
   We heard that this amendment, this very modest amendment to look for .5 percent savings would place an increased burden, a .5 percent increased burden on the American people. There is no question that the largest tax increase in American history will place a huge burden on the working families of America. 
   And with all respect to my good friend and colleague from Ohio, the Democrats' budget, in order to balance as the rules require by the end of the budget period, does impose the largest tax increase in American history. And already we're starting to see the majority party have to start to pay the price for some of the budget gimmicks that have been involved in making that work. 
   Now, the Democrats, while increasing spending, it seems like almost across the board, certainly in the Department of Labor, couldn't manage to keep the spending for the Office of Labor Management Standards at last year's level. There they could find the cut. When it came to the office whose responsibility is to find the crooks who are stealing from union members, they found a way to impose a 4 percent cut in that office. And what a shame that is. 
   I offered an amendment, it received some bipartisan support, but nevertheless, on a largely partisan basis, that amendment was defeated. That amendment would have just restored the funding to last year's level for the only office in government who has the responsibility and the capability to hunt down and catch the crooks that steal from our American workers, but the majority party could find a way to cut there. 
   So, I think that the choice here is clear. It's been stated by many of my colleagues. Many of us, fringe or not fringe, believe that the American people can make better decisions on how to spend their money, and we should let them do it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I want to add my thanks to all of our colleagues here in the House, the Minnesota delegation certainly, and, of course, as Mr. Ramstad said, to our dean, the chairman of the Transportation Committee, Mr. Oberstar. 
   While reports continue to be updated due to the ongoing recovery operations, the number of victims is already shocking to us in Minnesota. But these numbers are not simply statistics that might roll off the tongue as a footnote to a tragedy which Governor Tim Pawlenty accurately described as, quote, a catastrophe of historic proportions for Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, these numbers are people. These numbers are the family, friends and neighbors who were simply going home to their loved ones after what appeared to be just another workday. Among the deceased is a mother of two from Savage, Minnesota, in my congressional district, and my heart and prayers go to her family and to all the victims. 
   Although this is a time of sorrow for many, there are countless stories emerging already about the generosity and compassion of the citizens of Minnesota. From organizing blood drives and volunteers, to caring for the needs of the recovery workers, Minnesotans are going above and beyond the call of duty. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the citizens of Minnesota have come together during this difficult time, my colleagues in the Minnesota delegation and I remain committed to helping restore the I-35W bridge. Together, we're working to provide the Federal resources necessary to recover from this tragedy, and the fine effort brought forward by our chairman, Mr. Oberstar, putting forth $250 million is so important to us in Minnesota. 
   In the wake of this disaster, it is difficult to imagine when all the questions will be answered, but the day will come when recovery efforts will be complete, investigations will conclude, and eventually a new I-35 bridge will reunite the banks of the Mississippi River. 
   Mr. Speaker, again our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and their families and with all Minnesotans as we recover and rebuild. Again, I want to thank the gentleman, the chairman, Mr. Oberstar, for authoring this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as has been said many times this evening and for the last days and weeks and months, indeed for years, we have Americans in harm's way in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in the Horn of Africa. Around the world, these Americans need our help, and they deserve our help. 
   It has been over 3 months since the President sent to us his request for emergency supplemental funding for our troops. It is time for us to stop playing politics and step up and do our part. We need to appropriate all of the funds our troops need, and we need to do it now. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee said this afternoon that our young men and women are entitled to have the funding that they need. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, this bill does not give them the funding that they need. It has been made very clear that the President will veto this legislation, and I believe that he should. He showed us that he would veto legislation that shackled our generals and made it impossible for our troops to do the job. This piecemeal approach, the 60-day funding, is unacceptable. 
   We have men and women not only in harm's way, but men and women here who are already starting to feel the pain of the restriction in funds. Secretary Gates said they are shifting funds now. It is not fair for our young men and women to serve overseas and come back here and not have what they need even here in the States. We need to move forward on legislation that genuinely funds the troops and allows us a chance for success. 
   I would like to close with just a couple of comments. General Petraeus said to his troops when he took over that the way there was going to be hard, but hard was not hopeless. As I said on this floor weeks ago, this legislation makes hard hopeless. In fact, this legislation is hopeless because it will not become law. We need to step up and take care of these troops.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, this amendment addresses the situation that we are facing on the ground overseas and at home. The United States Marine Corps is suffering a little over 30 percent of the combat casualties. My amendment makes sure that they and their program, in support of this very important bill, gets 20 percent of the money allocated in the fund established in this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, on October 7, 2004, Marine Lieutenant Colonel Tim Maxwell's life changed forever. While on his third tour in Iraq, an enemy mortar attack left him with a battered body and severe brain trauma. But Colonel Maxwell is a marine, and despite the frustration of relearning how to walk and read, he has refused to give in to his wounds. In an open letter posted on his Web site, Colonel Maxwell talks about what it is like to be a wounded warrior: 
   ``We tend not to complain about our injuries too much. Most of us know others who are worse off--a guy with a bad leg knows a guy who lost a leg, or both legs. I, with a brain that is `cracked,' know youngsters with brain injuries who are unable to walk or talk. We all know some who died. So it is not a good thing to complain. We are tough guys. We are all going to whip it.'' 
   Having experienced loneliness, frustration, and depression during his recovery, Tim Maxwell set out to ensure that fellow wounded marines would have a place to recover with others like them. He said: ``When you're in the hospital, your morale is okay. You are with other wounded warriors. You can chat about it. Sometimes we just look at each other in the hallway and nod. That's all. Acknowledgment. But once you are out of the hospital, it's tough. It sounds great on the day you leave. But there's irritation, frustration.'' 
   In May, 2005, Colonel Maxwell came across a 20-year-old wounded marine sitting alone inside a Camp Lejeune barracks. The young man couldn't use his arm and was lonely and lost, having seen his buddy killed in combat and with his family living far away in Florida. Colonel Maxwell decided that ``no marine was going to be left alone like that.'' 
   So along with Gunnery Sergeant Ken Barnes, he convinced the Marine Corps leadership that wounded marines needed their own barracks to help them heal among other wounded warriors. The Marine Corps leadership agreed, and in September 2005, Camp Lejeune opened the first barracks for wounded marines. The following month the barracks was dedicated to the man whose vision led to today's Wounded Warrior Battalion: Lieutenant Colonel Tim Maxwell. 
   Maxwell Hall at Camp Lejeune now houses 80 marines and provides them with the support structure necessary to heal. A similar barracks has also been established at Camp Pendleton, California, to care for west coast marines. The program has been so successful  that the concept was formalized by establishing the Wounded Warrior Battalions at Lejeune and Pendleton. 
   Simply put, Colonel Maxwell's vision of Wounded Warrior Battalions seeks to ensure that marines don't fall through the cracks that were so evident at Walter Reed. This amendment will help ensure this unique program succeeds and acts as a model for other services by assisting the Marine Corps transition this successful program from independent battalions on each coast into a single regiment with a headquarters located at Quantico. 
   The regiment's 54 staff members will help oversee the battalions at Pendleton and Lejeune, track active duty and discharged wounded marines through their recovery, and connect them with resources at the VA, other government agencies, and through private organizations. The battalions will continue to handle the day-to-day tasks of ensuring that marines are scheduled for medical appointments, that they are transported to those appointments, and that they receive counseling support to help heal their mental scars. 
   Earlier this week, I spoke with the newly appointed Wounded Warrior Regimental commander, Colonel Gregory Boyle. After the conversation I was even more convinced that the Wounded Warrior Regiment is the model for how to treat our wounded servicemembers. Colonel Boyle is motivated and ready to go forward. He came from infantry regimental command. Passage of this amendment will ensure he is able to do so. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to bring this amendment to the floor, and I very much appreciate the support of Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. This evening, we have heard some talk about the war that we're engaged in, the fighting in Iraq, the fighting in Afghanistan, this long war against Islamist extremists that we're engaged in. And tonight I am very pleased I am joined by a number of my colleagues here this evening to talk a little bit about that military action, to talk about that war and to talk about the military leaders that we are so blessed to have in this country. 
   I think sometimes we sort of forget that there are people who have devoted their entire lives to serving this country and to providing exemplary leadership to our young men and women as they fight for us in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world. We have some new officers in the lineup, and we will talk very briefly about those tonight, I suppose. We have a new commander of Central Command, Admiral William Fallon. We have, of course, General David Petraeus, named by the President to be the senior U.S. commander of the multinational forces in Iraq and confirmed unanimously, I might add, by the Members of the Senate. Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno, and other fine officers that are leading our young men and women. 
   I know some of my colleagues would like to talk about one of the officers who is going to be leaving that chain of command, the very fine Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the first Marine Corps officer ever to hold that position, my good friend and a great American, General Peter Pace. 
   I would like to afford a few minutes to my friend and colleague from South Carolina who I know has some words he wants to say about my friend, Pete, and give us a little idea of what his biography is. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

I know that all the people of South Carolina are grateful to their service to the National Guard, and for your service in the Guard and here in Congress. And I know that General Pace appreciates your kind remarks. 
   Pete and Lynne Pace were next-door neighbors for Vicky and I when I retired from active duty in the Marines in 1994. He is not only a fine man and a fine officer, but a good neighbor. 
   I understand that we are joined now by my colleague from Missouri, who had some words that he wanted to share with us concerning General Pace's forthrightness; is that right? I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Again, I thank the gentleman for his service and his son's service and obviously the good parenting job that you have done, having your sons go into the Marine Corps. My son went into the Army. I have got to tell you, I am so proud of him sometimes I just bust out, but occasionally I wonder where I may have gone wrong in that upbringing thing. But I know you are proud of your sons and I of mine and Joe of his and all of our sons and daughters who are serving so well and so bravely in this war and in wars past. 
   I want to just remind my colleagues and those who may be following this discussion tonight what is at the core of the fine men and women who are leading our men and women into combat, and I go back to the very, very famous words of General Douglas MacArthur after he retired and he went back to West Point, his alma mater, and gave a speech. In that speech, I am just going to read a paragraph of it here, he said some words that strike to the core of these men and women that we are talking about tonight. This was back on May 12, 1962. 
   General MacArthur said, ``For all eyes and for all time, it is an expression of the ethics of the American soldier. That I should be integrated in this way with so noble an ideal arouses a sense of pride and yet of humility which will be with me always. 
   `` `Duty,' 'Honor,' `Country,' those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you want to be, what you can be, what you will be. They are your rallying point to build courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when hope becomes forlorn.'' 
   I think it is important for us to understand, and a little bit later this evening I am going to talk about some of those values and some of the fine young men and women who go to these service academies and provide the outstanding leadership that we have. 
   Of course, tonight we are talking about that leadership and quite a bit about General Peter Pace, the first Marine Corps Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the man who is going to be retiring here in the coming months after he has served us so well in so many years. 
   I am joined now by my friend and colleague and classmate, I guess, we came to Congress together in the 108th Congress, Dr. Phil Gingrey. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his words and for his strong support of our men and women in uniform. I know the people down in North Carolina are very proud to have you serve. There is no greater champion for our Special Operations Forces than you are and for all those fine soldiers down there, and I know that General Pace appreciates your support. So I thank the gentleman for joining us this evening. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was thinking about the kind words that have been said tonight about General Pace. I certainly add to those. 
   I mentioned earlier that I thought that General Pace was a fine man and a fine marine and a fine commander and a great neighbor when he and Lynn lived next door to Vicky and I down at the Marine Base at Quantico. I just have to share another story with my colleagues standing here. 
   There was another time when General Pace and I were neighbors, and it was not such a nice location as the Marine Base at Quantico and the fine quarters there up on the hill. 
   We were serving together in Mogadishu in 1992 and 1993 in the rubble of that country, in some pretty tough times and bad weather and bad conditions and starving people. We had some folks who were intent on shooting each other and shooting us.     
   I remember going into the building one time and General Pace was sitting there, sort of an old, bombed-out room of the Embassy. 
   I said, ``General, how is it going?'' 
   He said, ``We are here, we are serving our country and we are in the Marines.'' 
   He was a fine friend and fine neighbor, whether he was in the idyllic hillside down in Prince William County or bombed-out rubble in Mogadishu. You couldn't have a finer man with you. I am very proud to have known him and served with him, and I am very grateful for his many years of distinguished service, living by those ideals we discussed earlier. 
   There are some more commanders that we want to refer to later tonight, but we want to put this in the context of this terrible war we are fighting. We are fighting an evil and adaptive enemy, and I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp).

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I couldn't agree with you more in your explanation of what we are up against; but it strikes me the differences we hear on the floor of this House. This evening some of our colleagues were saying we have to get out of Iraq now. We have to end the war. If we bring our troops tomorrow, say they, we will end this war. And presumably, then, everything will be fine. And that simply doesn't track with the history that the gentleman is describing. It does not describe the enemy that was willing to hijack planes and fly them into buildings and kill women and children. Every day we see the stories in Baghdad of people blowing up women and children. Our just bringing our troops home doesn't, wouldn't, couldn't, signal the end of this war and of the determination of that enemy. It strikes me the difference that we see in this body.

   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman very much for his insight and certainly his passion on this issue. I, too, want to thank all of the men and women in uniform. And certainly we are here tonight talking some about the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Peter Pace, who will be retiring this fall, but we are also here to talk about the other leaders and the values that are at their core. 
   Minnesota is like other States in the Union. We have members of our National Guard who have deployed, and deployed again in some cases. We have 2,600 members of the Minnesota National Guard serving in Iraq now as members of the Red Bulls, and we are so proud of them and looking forward to them coming back this summer. The sooner the better. 
   That is an issue that has been mentioned by Members on both sides of the aisle that there have been mistakes made, and there certainly have. One of the early mistakes was not building up the size of the active forces and relying so heavily on these men and women in the reserve component, the reserves that the gentleman from Tennessee mentioned, and the members of the National Guard from all over having to go, having to leave their civilian jobs and leave their families and go and serve, and they do so willingly and bravely and well. And then they come back and have to resume their civilian lives, and we have to do a better job of reintegrating them in this body. We need to not let up. 
   But I want to thank you, Mr. Wamp, for coming down here and helping us understand what it is that we are fighting. You put it so well. 
   I know the gentleman remembers way back when the 9/11 Commission came out, and in that report they said we are fighting Islamist extremists. They didn't say we were just fighting al Qaeda. Certainly we are fighting al Qaeda. And it seems so long ago now,  and as you pointed out, it is even clearer now that this enemy that we are fighting is very, very determined. It is the jihadists in that moment that are at the core of this, and they are not going to quit.     
   America's a great country, greatest in the world with great people. But we're an impatient people, and it's difficult; no, it is impossible for us to understand what's in the minds of people who are not only willing but apparently eager to strap bombs to children and blow them up and kill innocent, innocent men, women, and children in the name of their cause and reestablishing that sharia law and that caliphate and then moving on to the world. 
   And so like you, I am just grateful for the men and women in uniform and for all they have done and for their leaders. And before we wrap up here this evening, I want to mention briefly some of the other leaders that we don't sometimes talk so much about, but they are part of this fight, and they're an integral part. 
   We just got a new commander of Central Command, Admiral William Fallon, a new leader, will bring new ideas and a new face. We've been ably led in the past, but it's important sometimes that we get a change of face and a new idea, get a new team sometimes. And Admiral Fallon is bringing some new insights into this fight. 
   He was a naval aviator, a graduate of Villanova University in 1967, came through the Naval ROTC program, as I did. I have a lot of good things to say about the service academies. I think they do a terrific job, but there is no question that we get fine officers, men and women, who come through our other commissioning programs like the Naval ROTC program. 
   Admiral Fallon served as an aviator in Vietnam, has had a very distinguished career. He is going on now to take overall command of everything in Central Command which, of course, includes all of Iraq and the surrounding countries, and we're glad to have him. 
   General David Petraeus has been mentioned this evening, a really fine officer, graduate of the West Point Military Academy, has a Ph.D., very distinguished career. I've had the pleasure of sitting and talking with General Petraeus on two previous trips to Iraq. He was the commander of the 101st Airborne Division and Operation Iraqi Freedom One, and when I went over there, my first trip to Iraq, he was the commanding general up in Mosul. I had a chance to go and talk to him, and I was impressed then with his intelligence and his determination and his leadership. 
   What a fine job the 101st did, not only in winning the initial combat but in starting to establish some local government and progress amongst the people of Mosul. And I thought at the time, what a fine officer, and all my colleagues who traveled over there, Republicans and Democrats, came back with glowing reports of General David Petraeus. 
   It was later my son became a member of the 101st under a different commander and has gone to Iraq and served for a year and come back and served well, and General Petraeus left that division in good shape. 
   General Petraeus went back to Iraq and served as the man in charge of training the Iraqi security forces, and so he was able to see firsthand what the difficulties were and what we needed to do there. And then he went on to become probably the Nation's foremost authority in unconventional warfare, ideally suited to his job. And so when the President nominated him to be the senior American commander in Iraq, he was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate. 
   And under him is Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno, another fine officer with previous service in Iraq and a graduate of the United States Military Academy. All of these officers, too many awards and decorations to name. 
   My point this evening is that we are ably led by fine men who hew to an ethic of, as General Douglas MacArthur said, ``Duty, Honor, Country,'' but the core values seen at the Naval Academy and the United States Marine Corps of honor, courage, commitment, all of these men exemplify those core values, and they provide firm, steady, well-informed leadership to the men and women who serve us so well in all the corners of the world. And they're doing a good job. 
   I just want to share with you a couple of quotes that I've got here about things that are going on in Iraq. Goodness knows we see plenty of bad news, and there is certainly some to share. And every time there's an explosion and our soldiers are killed or wounded, it pains us deeply. And when civilians are killed, it's a tragedy. But we're fighting against an enemy that is fierce and determined, as my colleague Mr. Wamp from Tennessee outlined so well. 
   This is a tough enemy and we need tough soldiers to fight them, and all of us recognize that you cannot win this only militarily, that you need economics and you need politics and you need diplomacy. And I would say that these leaders that we've talked about tonight, Admiral Fallon, General Petraeus, General Odierno and certainly the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Peter Pace, understand that very well. But they're attending to the first order of business first. They want to make sure that our men and women are well-led. They're fighting to win. We in this body, my colleagues, need to make sure that we're giving them every chance to win. 
   And I just notice some quotes that have just been in the news in the last couple of days. U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker says, ``It is noteworthy that violence is down in the two areas where the surge is focused, Anbar and Baghdad.'' 
   And our friend from the other side of the Capitol, Senator Joe Lieberman says, ``Our troops have succeeded in improving security conditions in precisely those parts of Iraq where the surge has focused.'' 
   We can't win it all in a day. It's going to be a long fight. The men and women serving and fighting understand this. We need to understand this and make sure that we are, in fact, being true to ourselves and true to them. 
   I want to share just a brief story about the fine leadership that we have, not just these men that we've talked about tonight, but the fine young men and women who are stepping up to lead our Armed Forces today. 
   One of the great things we get to do as Members of Congress is nominate these fine young students to go forward to the academy. We're always thrilled when one is selected to go, and the joy that they have and the pride that their families feel is certainly moving. 
   In my first year here as a Member of this body, my niece graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Vicky and I went up for several days of ceremonies and to share with my sister and brother-in-law and nieces their joy and pride in my niece's accomplishment. 
   She, by the way, now Captain Stroecker, is serving in the United States Army. She served a year over in Kuwait. She served in Germany, and she's the kind of officer that makes us proud. 
   But while we were there at West Point, we were surrounded by these young cadets, some of them just getting ready to be commissioned. And we were there when the second lieutenants' bars were pinned on, but I remember sitting with Vicky in the audience and witnessing a ceremony that I found to be very moving. It was a very impressive thing to watch. 
   This is a ceremony where the graduating class turns over command, turns over command to the brigade, to the rising seniors, the juniors rising to be seniors, and you see the long gray line march out in that ceremony. 
   Movies are made about the long gray line, stories written, and it's moving to watch it, and they march out, and they pass command from one class to the next. 
   And I remember thinking as that ceremony was going on and looking at those fine, fine young men and women, I remember thinking, no wonder, no wonder that the United States has the finest Armed Forces in the world and no wonder that we're the best we've ever been, with all apologies to the Greatest Generation, my father's generation, an Army World War II veteran, but today's Army and today's Marine Corps and Navy and Air Force and Coast Guard are the best they have ever been, all volunteer, all eager, all determined. They understand that enemy that my colleague, the gentleman from Tennessee, was describing. They know that what they're doing is  important, that without their success we are in great danger. 
   But as you look at those fine young men and women and when you are there, when they move on to become second lieutenants, you just can't help but notice that that's the reason why our men and women in uniform today are led by very, very fine leaders. 
   Well, I see that we're nearing the end of the time for this Special Order. I'm sure there is more to be said about the fine men and women who are leading our military, and that's what we were about this evening, to talk a little bit about the conflict we're involved in, the importance of that leadership and the people who are leading and certainly to talk about General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   Pete, I think it was my colleague, Robin Hayes, who said, we love you, and we thank you, and we wish you all the best. And I know that sometimes you thought about these words, I certainly have over the years, President Ronald Reagan said way back in 1985; he said, some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world, but the Marines don't have that problem. And Pete Pace has never had that problem. He has been a great leader. He is a great leader. We're looking forward to his leadership in the closing months of his tour as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We thank him for everything that he has done, that he is doing and that he is going to do.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4137, COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this rule. 
   The bill under consideration today is a product of a multiyear, bipartisan effort by the Education and Labor Committee. Democrats and Republicans worked together to craft this legislation. Now the Rules Committee has thrown this bipartisan effort to the wind and revealed their true partisan colors that are flying there. By allowing 20 Democrat amendments and only four Republican amendments, the Rules Committee has effectively announced that the minority party is not to be a player. Folks, it isn't fair. It's not a democracy. 
   I submitted an amendment to the Rules Committee earlier this week. But my colleagues will not even have the chance to consider its merits because it was not made in order by the Rules Committee. 
   It is a particularly sad statement, given the nature of my amendment. On January 29, the City of Berkeley passed resolutions that, among other things, state that the United States Marine Corps recruiting office ``is not welcome in'' their ``city, and if recruiters choose to stay, they do so as uninvited and unwelcome intruders.'' 
   I am appalled. 
   My amendment addresses this action by denying Federal funding to colleges that contract with an entity that takes action to discriminate or condones discrimination against the military by denying equal public access. The amendment essentially holds colleges and universities accountable for maintaining agreements or contracts with entities that allow this open discrimination. 
   Mr. Speaker, during the Vietnam era, and I'm old enough to not only remember but to have experienced it, many of our servicemembers and veterans received shameful treatment at the hands of those who opposed our Nation's foreign policy. We must protect our current servicemembers from the same treatment by showing that the Berkeley City Council's appalling behavior is unacceptable in this great Nation. Demonizing the men and women serving our country in the military, as demonstrated by the Berkeley City Council, has no place in our Nation's political discourse. 
   As a graduate of the ROTC program and a 25-year veteran of the Marine Corps, I am profoundly disappointed with the appalling actions of the Berkeley City Council. Institutions that continue to maintain contracts and agreements with this city are, in effect, condoning this discriminatory and unjust treatment of our servicemembers. 
   They deserve better from us, Mr. Speaker. This structured rule excluding my amendment denies this body the opportunity to reaffirm our strong support for the men and women who so honorably and bravely defend our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this restrictive rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the proponents of this bill are fond of citing historical examples as they declare the futility of combat operations in Iraq. The Congressional Record is full of stories describing the failed British invasion of Gallipoli or the far more popular comparisons to the American experience in Vietnam. 
   Another more prescient historical comparison, however, was made by the British author George Orwell. Contemplating the defeatist rhetoric of the English intelligentsia during the German offensive against Britain in World War II, he remarked, ``The quickest way of ending a war is to lose it. And if one finds the prospect of a long war intolerable, it is natural to disbelieve in the possibility of victory.'' Those in favor of the bill presented on the floor today, Mr. Speaker, do not believe in the possibility of victory, despite the protests of the soldiers and Marines returning from the battlefield saying otherwise. 
   By advocating a rapid withdrawal, they endorse the quickest way of ending the war, by losing it. It has been less than a month since the full force of troops requested by military commanders arrived in Iraq, but already some have declared the operation to be a failure. General Petraeus arrived in Baghdad in February with a new strategy designed to reinforce the Iraqi security forces confronting al Qaeda, terrorists and Iranian-supplied insurgents. Rather than giving him the opportunity to fully implement his surge strategy, opponents in Congress immediately sought to undermine his credibility and his ability to command. 
   Mr. Speaker, our troops serving in Iraq don't need 435 armchair generals dictating the tactical movements of troops, as this legislation would surely do. They have true commanders whose professional military skills have been honed by decades of military service. They need us to renew our commitment to them and their commanders. And more importantly, they need us to trust their commanders' decisions. 
   General Petraeus said in a letter to his troops, ``Success will require discipline, fortitude and initiative, qualities that you have in abundance.'' The question before us today, Mr. Speaker, is, do we have those qualities?

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I will overlook the ``ex-Marine'' slight. Never an ex-Marine; always a Marine. 
   It is a tremendous honor for me today to even be on the same floor as this great American here. We heard earlier today the hardship of some of our servicemen and -women missing a holiday with their families, and I know in my 25 years in the Marines I missed a number of those. But there is nobody who has missed more holidays with his family than this great American next to me. 
   We have heard a lot of speeches during this so-called debate. I am not sure how much real debate there is, but certainly a lot of speeches. Some of them have been very eloquent. I think of Mr. McHugh the other night giving one of the best speeches I have ever heard on the floor of this House. Some of them have been partisan. Some of them have been shrill. Some persuasive; some not. We have heard a number of opinions expressed, and it reminds me a week or so ago we had a hearing in the Armed Services Committee and we had three experts, Ph.D.s all of them, experts in the field of international relations and military operations. 
   One of them, the former Secretary of Defense under President Clinton, and it turns out that at the end of the hearing, each of the three of them had a different idea about what we ought to do. None of them supported what the President had been doing. One of them sort of supported what the President was doing. But each of them had different ideas. They had an opinion, arguably an informed opinion, but an opinion nevertheless. 
   And on this floor we have heard more opinions. We have heard people say, I don't agree with this; I think this is a bad idea; or I think this is a good idea. We have heard some people say I have a better idea; or I am a member of a caucus who has a better idea; or I propose this; or I think that. And it kind of reminds me why it is a very bad idea to conduct a war by committee. But I fully acknowledge that people are allowed to have opinions and certainly every Member of this body can have an opinion. 
   I remember the principal author of this resolution before us, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, stood up on the other side of the aisle here on the first day of this debate and he said, ``Everybody is entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts.'' So I would just like to take a little bit of my remaining time here to talk about some of the claims and some of the facts that have been brought forward in this debate. 
   One of the proponents said the new plan ``ignores the recommendations of the military commanders on the ground.'' How many times have we heard that in these two days? Well, what is the truth? General Petraeus, the new commander of the multinational force in Iraq, confirmed by the Senate with no dissenting votes, said: ``If we are to carry out the multinational force-Iraq mission in accordance with the new strategy, the additional forces that have been directed to move to Iraq will be essential ..... '' He said that last month. 
   General Odierno, a new U.S. commander, Corps commander, says: ``This is about Iraqis taking charge of their own security. In order for them to do that, we have to buy them time to continue to train and for the government to become more legitimate to the eyes of the Iraqi people. They are doing that by moving forward. By bringing more troops in, it provides us the opportunity to work with them, to provide more time, and defeat this threat, which is both al Qaeda threat as well as sectarian violence.'' 
   Even General Casey last month said he thought we needed more troops. 
   Another claim has been by one of our colleagues: ``Prime Minister al-Maliki has indicated in virtually every way he can that he too opposes the surge.'' And yet on January 13, Prime Minister Maliki said: ``The strategic plan announced by U.S. President George W. Bush represents the common vision and mutual understanding between the Iraqi Government and the U.S. Administration''? 
   I have more examples here, but one that we have heard over and over and over again in various forms was stated by one of our colleagues yesterday saying: ``Our President, again, is ignoring ..... members of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group who opposed this escalation.'' 
   This is the book. I commend it to every American. 
   I would like to quote now from my dear, dear long-time friend and hunting partner, the former Secretary of State, James A. Baker III, who said on January 30 of this year: ``This is the language and all of the language of the report with respect to a surge: `We could, however, support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up the training and equipping mission if the U.S. commander in Iraq determines that such steps would be effective.' The only two conditions are `short term' and `the commander in Iraq determines it would be effective.' '' 
   Both of these conditions have been met. 
   There have been many claims of fact which I have some counterarguments with. 
   I would just say to all of my colleagues that I would concur with Chairman Skelton that we are entitled to our own opinion. We can certainly express it. But we are not, in fact, entitled to our own facts. So let's stick to the facts.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS DAY -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, as a lifetime member of VFW Post 210 in Lakeville, Minnesota, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 663, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
   The VFW traces its roots back to 1899, when veterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection founded local organizations to secure rights and benefits for their service. 
   Before that time, many of our veterans would return home wounded or sick. There was no medical care or veterans' pension for them, and they were left to care for themselves. 
   The founders of the VFW sought to remedy that and provide support and encouragement to all of our veterans who had served in foreign wars. Their mission statement was straightforward, ``to honor the dead by helping the living.'' Over time their mission expanded to ``ensuring rights, remembering sacrifices, promoting patriotism, performing community services, and advocating for a strong national defense.'' 
   They have a rich history of advocacy. The VFW has been instrumental in establishing the Veterans Administration, creating a GI bill for the 20th century, the development of the national cemetery system, and the fight to ensure combat wounded veterans from all wars receive proper compensation. 
   In addition, they have been a powerful force behind the creation of the Vietnam, Korean War, World War II and Women in Military Service Memorials. 
   Today, the organization has grown to more than 2.3 million members worldwide and continues to advocate for all of our foreign veterans. 
   I applaud the work of these individuals. Their continued commitment to each other and this great country of ours is truly inspirational. I am humbled by the work they have done for our veterans and I am honored to be bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   Today, as we stand to celebrate the establishment and achievements of an organization that was born of patriotism, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, I would ask each of my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 663.
