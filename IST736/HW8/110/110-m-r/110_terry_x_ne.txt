<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. We use, in this country, 20 million barrels of oil per day; 14 of that we import. In fact, a little over 14 million barrels per day we import. 
   It is my personal mission and dream that we can displace that 14 million barrels per day that we import, and use our own American-made resources instead. 
   This bill here today, releasing 10 percent of the SPR, equals 3 1/2 days of our total use. Now, that will, using my understanding of economics, will reduce the price at the pump by a few cents for a few days. So we have to balance that against the harm that is being caused by the high gas prices to our constituents, to people on lower income, especially with our national security needs, which is the intention of SPR. 
   It is intended that when we go through an OPEC crisis where they cut off the supply to us, that we have our domestic reserves ready in case of such an emergency. And when you look at world politics today, with Iran and Israel and Nigeria and Venezuela, that is a real issue that we have to deal with. 
   Now, the Speaker recognizes now that supply is the issue, that demand is outstripping world supply of oil, and we have to now add to our supply. I agree with the Speaker's statement when she says, free our resources.     
   So let's have a vote on freeing our resources. We've got American resources,  whether it's alternative energies, and why don't we make the tax credit permanent for alternative and renewable energy as opposed to the 1 year that was brought to us by the Democrat leadership? We can add, then, additional conservation. And the House did pass conservation in automobile fuel efficiency, but let's use the resources that we have with oil and get the resources in the middle of America and in Alaska and free our resources.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (RECOGNIZING THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS' 40TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. I want to first say thank you to the chairman and ranking member for allowing this to come to the House floor in such a rapid manner. It is my pleasure to have authored this resolution in working with Special Olympics on their 40th anniversary. 
   In those 40 years since Mrs. Eunice Shriver dreamed of helping those with intellectual disabilities by having them compete as a part of letting them know that they can achieve and as part of their therapies, in those 40 years since her vision came to be, we have seen many with intellectual disabilities win and let them be better in that competition. I am also pleased that my community is hosting the International Special Olympics competition in 2010 between Omaha and Lincoln. 
   As my colleagues have stated, Special Olympics is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to the great cause of empowering individuals with intellectual disabilities to become physically fit, productive, and respected members of society through sports training and competition. Participation in Special Olympics' year-round sports training and athletic competition is open to anyone with intellectual disabilities ages 8 and older. 
   Currently there are 700,000 volunteers and 500,000 coaches worldwide that serve over 2.5 million people with intellectual disabilities by helping them participate in over 200 programs in 180 countries. It is important to note that Special Olympics would not exist today and could not have been created without the time, energy, commitment, and enthusiasm of many of its volunteers. As a grassroots organization, Special Olympics relies on volunteers at all levels of the movement to ensure that every athlete is offered a quality sports training and competition experience. 
   The athletes have choices of just about any sport you can think of, from winter sports, aquatics, badminton, basketball, track and field, snowboarding, sailing, table tennis, handball, racquetball, volleyball. It goes on and on and on. 
   The Special Olympics oath is inspirational to all and was originally spoken by gladiators entering the arena in ancient Rome: ``Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.'' 
   Madam Speaker, as a Member of Congress, I strive every day to live up to these words. Again, I am proud to be associated with this resolution and Special Olympics and urge its passage on the floor today. Again, I thank Mr. Berman and Mr. Chabot for making sure that this arrived on the floor in such a rapid manner.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF AUGUST 2008 AS ``NATIONAL HEAT STROKE AWARENESS MONTH'' -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time has I may consume. 
   I, too, rise in support of H. Con. Res. 296, recognizing the goals and ideals of National Heat Stroke Awareness Month. I credit and thank my colleague from Arkansas, Mr. Boozman, for drafting and introducing this resolution. 
   As August hits, more people will be traveling to the beach, going to neighborhood pools, working outside, and football practice starts for many high schools and colleges. As people enjoy the outdoors, it is important for Americans to be cognizant of the dangers of heat stroke. 
   Friday, August 1, 2008, will mark the beginning of the National Heat Stroke Awareness Month. This month serves to commemorate the importance of educating Americans and their children about the need to stay hydrated during hot summer months, understand how much water and fluids their bodies need to replenish, and the appropriate ways to avoid heat-related illnesses. 
   National Heat Stroke Awareness Month is an important reminder that Americans and children participating in athletics continue to be impacted by the intense heat and physical activity that can dehydrate the body or even lead to a heat stroke. Local communities should work together to provide avenues to prevent dehydration, as well as ensuring that children, who are more vulnerable to heat illness, have access to fluids to rehydrate and a cool place to rest during hot summer months. 
   According to the National Centers for Health Statistics, 7,046 deaths were attributed to excessive heat exposure from 1979 to 1997, or an average of 371 deaths per year. Heat stroke and death from excessive heat exposure are more common during summers with prolonged heat waves, such as in 1980. Department statistics show that children and the elderly are among the hardest hit populations in the U.S., and, if not treated properly, it can be fatal. 
   A recent study found that 70 percent of after-school athletes arrive on the field already dehydrated, and because children have a reduced ability to dissipate heat through sweating, it puts them at an increased risk for a heat-related illness. It is alarming when 50 percent of those diagnosed with heat stroke will die, and it is important that parents, coaches, teachers and other members of the community look for the warning signs of heat illness. 
   I would like to thank Rhonda and Mike Fincher, who have worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the heat-related illness after they tragically lost their 13-year-old son Kendrick during an August preseason football practice. In honor of their son, they have founded the Kendrick Fincher Memorial Foundation, and have provided student athletes with the information and equipment needed to ensure they will not suffer from heat stroke. 
   I would also like to thank the Gatorade Company for leading the National Beat the Heat Campaign aimed at educating parents and football coaches about the importance of hydration in order to keep athletes safe in hot summer months.     
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman Boozman once again for introducing this resolution, my colleagues on Energy and Commerce, Mr. Pallone and Mr. Dingell and Mr. Barton, to make sure that it got to the House floor in a rapid, quick motion. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important resolution commemorating August as National Heat Stroke Awareness Month. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (PRIMARY LATERAL SCLEROSIS AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I too rise in support of House Resolution 896, recognizing February of 2009 as Primary Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month. I also wish to thank Mr. Baca for authoring this resolution. 
   While primary lateral sclerosis is not fatal, there is no cure, and the progression of symptoms varies. Some Americans affected by this disease may retain the ability to walk without assistance, but others eventually require wheelchairs, canes, or other assistive devices that limit their mobility. 
   Because primary lateral sclerosis is such a rare neuromuscular disease, its diagnosis is often delayed because of its resemblance to ALS, or better known as Lou Gehrig's disease. In PLS, there is no evidence of the degeneration of spinal motor neurons or muscle  wasting that occurs in ALS, and it is characterized by progressive muscle weakness in the voluntary muscles. PLS belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases that develop when the nerve cells that control voluntary muscle movement degenerate and die. This usually occurs after the age of 50, and causes a gradual weakness in the muscles. 
   Symptoms for the individuals afflicted by the disease may include difficulty with balance, weakness and stiffness in the legs, and clumsiness. Other symptoms may include sudden and involuntary muscle spasms in the hands, feet, or legs, and maybe speech problems due to the involvement of the facial muscles. The disease, which scientists believe is not hereditary, progresses gradually over a number of years or even decades. 
   The efforts of the Spastic Paraplegia Foundation have been paramount in raising funds dedicated to finding cures and providing information about PLS. Thanks to the dedication and hard work of many individuals at the Spastic Paraplegic Foundation, in just 5 years, more than $1 million has been targeted to research on SPF conditions and thousands of people have been helped. 
   I would like to thank the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institute of Health for conducting a broad range of research on neuromuscular disorders such as PLS. Their research has been aimed at developing techniques to diagnose, treat, prevent, and ultimately cure these devastating diseases. 
   In closing, I would like to thank again the author of this resolution, Mr. Joe Baca, my friend from California, for raising public awareness about PLS. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great sadness, for yesterday, at about 2 p.m., a tragedy occurred in my hometown, where eight people were killed, gunned down, some of them employees at Von Maur, others just shopping for the Christmas holidays. To those families, those eight families who lost a loved one so senselessly, my thoughts and my prayers go out to you. I can't imagine what you're going through today. 
   Our whole community across Nebraska, eastern Nebraska, western Iowa, not just Omaha, is scarred by this tragedy. A very disturbed 19-year-old man walks into this mall and this store and begins randomly shooting at people. 
   The victims of this terrible tragedy, this massacre: Gary Scharf, who was shopping, a resident of Lincoln, Nebraska; John McDonald, a customer, resident of Council Bluffs, Iowa. By the way, his daughter was an associate attorney for me. I have been communicating with her. To her, Suzanne Sheehan, and your family, my deepest condolences. 
   Also killed were six Von Maur employees: Angie Schuster, Maggie Webb, Janet Jorgenson, Diane Trent, Gary Joy, and Beverly Flynn, all of Omaha. Some of these were only 10 minutes from their shift being over and would be out of this store. Some of them are young mothers, leaving small children. There were others who were seriously injured, like Fred Wilson and Michelle Oldham. Others were also injured, like Jeff Schaffer and Brad Stafford. 
   Now just to put this in context, the first 911 call went out, and within 6 minutes our emergency response, our EMS, and our Omaha Police were in that store. But it was all done and over with by the time they could get there. The damage was already done. But they immediately began working on those that were injured and securing the mall for the other thousands of shoppers that were there. 
   I want to thank publicly our first responders from not only the city, but Douglas County, Sarpy County, the State Patrol, for their heroic efforts given in this tragedy. Now a tragedy of this scope and scale is just unthinkable. It's hard to get my mind around this. There's no way for us to understand this senseless act of violence, and I ask the entire country to pray for peace and healing during this difficult time for these families in our community. 
   God bless.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Ask yourselves why folks on the left who are more green than the Riddler and the Democrat leadership that has vowed to prevent any new drilling support this bill. Do I smell hypocrisy? No. Because this bill doesn't open up any new drilling. In fact on balance, it makes it more difficult to drill in an area already open for drilling. It poses new requirements to prove that you have to fully have used other leases before you can get any one there. A new requirement that any company must have a union contract in place before receiving a lease are just some of the couple of examples. 
   This is not a drilling bill that's going to get us more resources. It's a rhetorical political bill. Don't be suckered. Vote ``no.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of the Wynn amendment to the Energy & Water Appropriations bill. 
   Contrary to statements in the Energy & Water Committee Report questioning the level of hydrogen technology research and development, fuel cells technology is much closer than 2050. 
   Mr. Chairman, our Nation took 60 years from the first Wright Brothers flight to putting a man on the Moon; it will not take us that long to make hydrogen fuel cells mainstream. Hydrogen cars and fueling stations exist; we are almost there. The funding levels in the Fiscal Year 2008 Energy & Water appropriations bill will help provide the final push we need to overcome remaining obstacles and see hydrogen cars and fueling stations become a reality. 
   Additionally, Mr. Chairman, Hydrogen Fuel Cells are already in use in larger facilities. In my own District, the Henry Doorly Zoo uses fuel cells to generate electricity for its Lied Jungle exhibit, making it more energy efficient. Additionally, the U.S. Air Force is using fuel cell technology for its Global Observer program. 
   Mr. Chairman, energy security and independence have to become a reality. Hydrogen is a potentially limitless supply and a renewable, clean resource that deserves to be funded at its current level, if not more.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, let me first say I support this 1 percent, just like I did last year and the year before. Just to make sure that the American public understands, this is 1 percent off of the nearly 5 percent increase. So it isn't even a reduction from last year's number of 1 percent. It is simply shaving 1 percent off of the increase. 
   I came down here because I heard some of the speakers on the other side, or at least one, that was talking about they had to correct the problems of the Republicans spending like drunken sailors, which kind of amazed me considering that the debate on the House floor in the last 2 years on appropriations was how we weren't giving enough money. 
   When I looked up to see what the Republican bill was last year when we were in the majority, it was a 1.5-percent increase versus the nearly 5 percent this time. So they are up here talking about an increase of about 2 1/2 times, maybe three times what we originally proposed last year. And by the way, I supported the 1 percent when it was only a 1.5-percent increase below the rate of inflation. I think that is the type of drunken spending that the American taxpayers told us in the last election that they did not want. They want that type of fiscal restraint, not two or three times the rate of inflation. They want fiscal responsibility injected back into our reasoning and the bills that we are passing. 
   So I think a reduction of this 4.5-, 4.7-percent increase is simply the responsible thing to do. 
   The gentleman from Georgia, I appreciate you bringing this 1 percent. I think that this is something that the voters, strike voters, the American public thinks we should be doing this year. We come off the heels last week of voting for bills with double-digit increases. So this is a time to inject some reasonableness.

   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment to reduce the size of this bill, the cost of this bill. 
   I have got to tell you I grew up in the late 1970s. I remember pretty distinctly the policies of Jimmy Carter. I remember the high unemployment rates. I remember the high inflation rates. 
   I recall getting my driver's license and getting that 1970 station wagon to drive and waiting in a line for gas two blocks long; and when you got there, there was one pump yet working and the others had the 11 by 8 piece of paper that said ``out of gas'' on it. I think those are the policies which some of my friends on the left are advocating today. I just have to openly wonder how well Honda Civics would work in the sand in Iraq if we can't use military vehicles because of their gas mileage. 
   But let's get back to the real issue of what we're talking about here today, and that's ways of controlling spending. Yes, it is showing a difference between the majority party and the minority party in the sense of spending. 
   We are here fighting to reduce the size of their bill. We would like to bring it to last year's level where it was only a 1.6 percent increase, and they were yakking about how we needed to spend more, and when they got in control, they were able to do that. 
   They have a bill here before us today that increases the spending way above the President's request. This amendment just simply brings it down, $1.13 billion to the President's request. So either way we can fight to reduce the size of their bills, and last week's bill. Again, they were both double-digit increases. 
   I think this type of debate is healthy. It also does show, as one of the previous speakers mentioned, that there are policy differences. There are priority differences between the two parties, and we are showing how we are the party of fiscal responsibility.

   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition of this amendment. 
   As a member of the Energy Committee, I want to debunk a couple of myths that have been perpetrated today in the debate. First of all, that this was done hastily and thoughtlessly. The fact of the matter is the issue of the transmission of electricity has been an issue for many years. Many hearings have been held, much debate. It was part of the Energy Act. What we have to do is resolve the issue how we get energy from generator A to consumer B. In between we have to figure out how to do that. 
   Myth number two is that this runs roughshod over States' and communities' rights. The reality is that they are involved in the process. They are involved in working with FERC, and FERC has to work with them on the siting issues. And only when there is a conflict do they get to break that conflict by rising above it. 
   We in this Nation have to figure out how we get electricity from point A to consumer B. Think of this corridor as a transportation highway. And when we think of it as a highway, we understand why we have to do it this way.

   I stand here today in support of this resolution, as does the full committee Chair, Joe Barton, and Ranking Member Nathan Deal, supporting efforts of this resolution, House Resolution 470, supporting the efforts to increase childhood cancer awareness, treatment and research.

It is that much more devastating to see a young child suffer from cancer. This resolution serves to increase knowledge and awareness of cancer among children and how we can encourage research and education into the disease. 
   Deborah Pryce is a committed mother and a dedicated and tireless advocate. Through this resolution, she is honoring not only the memory of her daughter, but also those of all children who have suffered from cancer. Childhood cancers affect the whole family: mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters.

   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3580, which passed the House last week, was highly technical and addressed a number of very complicated FDA policy and regulatory matters. I commend the bipartisan Members and the staff who worked so hard on the language that passed with such broad support in the House. Inevitably, when these complicated matters are addressed, some drafting and technical issues need to be revisited in a technical corrections bill. 
   In the case of the FDA Amendments of 2007, we were especially mindful that the funding had to be secured to prevent the layoff of FDA reviewers prior to September 30. Given the importance of that deadline to protecting the public health, it is inevitable drafting and workability issues may need to be revisited.

   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I had a constituent come up to me over the weekend and say Congress has no energy plan. I corrected that person. The Democrats' leadership is no energy. 
   Just in the last few months, Congress has voted under their leadership to take shale from Colorado and Wyoming off limits for extracting the oil. Last week coal-to-liquid for aviation fuel was banned. The Air Force is not allowed to enter into a long-term contract to buy that type of synthetic fuel. We are going backwards. 
   The reality is if we bring all of our resources together, yes, conservation, yes, alternative fuels, and open up the resources that we have right here in America offshore where there is a moratorium that Congress can lift, a moratorium that was imposed by Congress on shale oil that can be lifted by Congress, and in Alaska where Congress can lift that moratorium, if we combine all of those resources, we can be free of OPEC. It is time for a real energy policy where we free our resources for American-made energy.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES REGARDING REBATE CHECKS -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, we rise not in any opposition to this at all and in support. We thank Mr. Braley for bringing this made-in-America resolution to the floor today. We too on this side of the aisle want to reach out and give our condolences and our best wishes to his constituents in Iowa that are dealing with the flooding. 
   Now, let's look at this resolution very quickly. It states some of the obvious things about our economy; that since the Democrats took over in 2007 that we have lost 17,000 jobs, and since that same time when the Democrats took over in Congress, we have lost another 269,000 jobs over the past 12 months within manufacturing, making it the lowest time in our modern history, where only 10 percent of the jobs, or first-time jobs being created, are in the manufacturing business. That has always been kind of the backbone of America's economy, and those things have been changing. 
   Then at the beginning of 2008, probably one of the more remarkable things and frankly what I think people look to Congress to actually do, you have the Republicans, Democrats and White House all working together, and within a couple of weeks had a pretty good stimulus bill. We knew that the economy was slowing down, that unemployment was increasing, and we did what the American public required of us and got a bill passed that stimulated the economy by helping small businesses with some accelerated depreciation. But the heart of it was getting money back out through what we call the stimulus checks to eligible families. 
   Mr. Bruce Braley suggests in this resolution, that I think we are going to adopt today, certainly we are in support of it, says that it helps our economy more if we buy products that are made in America. Of course, those products are made by people employed in America, and it will have a cyclical turn of the dollar where it goes to not only that company, but those people working there, which then in turn they get to spend within their community and it turns over. 
   But one of my fears, well, not fears, but let's just say concerns, is that now with the gas prices everywhere over $4, it hit $4 in almost every gas station back in Nebraska in my district yesterday, that the stimulus checks aren't going for what we thought they were going to go to, and that is for consumers to have a nice little chunk of change where they could go out and buy an appliance, something that they need in their home, something that they can reach out and really help with the bigger dollar item that helps to really stimulate the economy. Now it is probably going to go to just filling up the gas tank. 
   We have got two cars in our family that are smaller cars. My Camry, I put over $70 in filling up in Omaha this weekend. I can't imagine what bigger families are doing to keep up with this. So, frankly, if we want to go even a step further and stimulate our economy more, what we should do in addition to these stimulus checks is adopt an energy plan that will actually increase supply and lower the price of gasoline at the pump. 
   We can do this by embracing a very comprehensive approach to energy. We have got alternative fuels like coal-to-liquid. And, by the way, last week during the Department of Defense reauthorization, this Congress adopted a policy of banning the Air Force from engaging in contracts to buy coal-to-liquid as a synthetic aviation fuel. 
   We can use cellulosic energy. We are going to have about 13 small micro-pilot plants come on within the next couple of years. We can do things to speed that up, by passing a tax credit that is more than 1 year, like we did a couple of years ago, instead of adopting the 5-year plan that this side of the aisle was pushing. 
   We can also not only use those types of alternatives that have such great promise that we can use in a mix, but we can also do conservation. We want to encourage people to conserve not only the electricity in their home, but we are talking about fuel here to create a supply that will lower the price at the gas pump, which is a not-so-hidden tax on American families. We can do that by incenting, providing a tax credit for more than 1 year, for people to buy in plug-in electric hybrids. Some American manufacturers are going to start rolling those out next year, but they will be more expensive. So we want to incent people to buy those. If we can do a blend and conserve, we can take a large step towards energy independence. 
   We can get fully independent of all OPEC oil if we add one more prong to  this plan, and that is allow offshore drilling. Right now we have China working through Cuba that is getting to within about 60 miles of the Florida shore, but yet we can't have American companies do that. 
   We can open up oil shale. Last year, about November, we had a vote on this floor that banned the ability to get oil from oil shale in Colorado and Wyoming. We just found another large pocket of oil from oil shale in North Dakota. I wonder when that is going to be banned to use. 
   So if we bring our own resources together with all of the alternatives, we can bring the price of gas down rather dramatically and be independent. And if we can bring the price down, have a stable supply of energy under this type of a comprehensive plan, the American consumers, the families, can expect stable gas prices for a generation or more as we work towards completely going off of fossil fuels, to like a hydrogen economy. 
   So while we stand on this side of the aisle in favor of this resolution to buy American, my fear is that the reality is most of this stimulus money is going to be going to the OPEC countries when we fill up our tax tanks. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Speaker, I rise with Ranking Member Joe Barton and all of our Energy and Commerce colleagues in enthusiastic support of H.R. 1553 which is called appropriately the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act of 2008. 
   I would like to thank my friend from Ohio (Ms. Pryce) for introducing this important piece of legislation. I want to thank Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman Mr. Pallone for working in such a bipartisan manner as we moved this bill through our Energy and Commerce Committees 
   Because of the bipartisan efforts of all of those involved in this legislation, I'm proud to say that the legislation before us today will now work in conjunction with the NIH Reform Act of 2006, and I believe that this bill should serve as a model for others that seek to improve a particular field of research at the NIH. 
   As my colleagues are no doubt aware, I firmly believe that it is our responsibility as Members of Congress to ensure that the NIH has the latitude and flexibility to continue its research in all areas of health care. 
   Our focus in Congress should be on ensuring that the NIH, along with other relevant Federal agencies, receive the necessary funding to carry out their missions; and I believe that Congress must also strive to avoid micromanaging the NIH unless we want to inadvertently hamper the very scientific discoveries that we all want to see come to fruition. 
   Deborah Pryce is a committed mother and a dedicated, tireless advocate for ending the dreadful curse of childhood cancer in our great Nation and throughout the world. Through this legislation, she is honoring not only the memory of her daughter but also the memories of all the children and families who have suffered from cancer. As a parent, I can't imagine anything more tragic and devastating to see your child go through that. 
   So we've worked so hard to help improve the research capacity of the National Institutes of Health. Always keep in mind that it is my sincere desire that these efforts would lead to fewer parents knowing this awful feeling of loss. 
   We will all greatly miss Representative Pryce after her retirement from the House at the end of this Congress. Without question, she is leaving both a legacy for her work on behalf of the people of Ohio as well as further leadership of the Republicans in the House of Representatives. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues for their efforts, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Barton, and encourage all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle to support this legislation. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.

   Mr. TERRY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the rest of our time. 
   I've participated in some very intense debates on this House floor. And these are times that, on a bill like we have before us today, where truly we all come together. It's beyond bipartisanship, as people have heard from the rather dramatic and emotional testimony from all of the Members who have testified here today. Because there is nothing more emotional than a child who has been diagnosed with a cancer. There is just nothing more traumatic to a parent, to a family. And if there is anything that we can do as a congressional body to try and alleviate that type of pain a family could suffer in the future, we should undertake that. And we've done it here today. 
   I want to thank DEBORAH PRYCE for her strength, not only in her testimony here on the floor today, but for the years that she has continued to work this issue and push it forward to its House conclusion today. 
   I also want to just thank Mr. Pallone and Mr. Dingell, who participated in this bill and made sure that it moved through our committee in a timely way and onto the House floor, as well as Mr. Van Hollen and so many other supporters of this bill. Many thanks go out to them. 
   So we should be proud, as Mr. McCaul and many speakers said, of our efforts here today. I encourage every single member of our conference on this side of the aisle to join me in supporting the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Disease Act. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, yes, we enjoy, ranking member, former chairman, Michigan Stater, having that 1997 national championship trophy prominently displayed when you walk into the athletic facilities. It is too bad that we weren't able to leave that game on the field back then, but I am sure that Nebraska would have won by 30 or 40 points. 
   Now, I have to defend the football team, Mr. Speaker, when challenged like that. 
   But I am so proud of our women's volleyball team and to be a cosponsor with Adrian Smith of this resolution. What an incredible achievement. Our volleyball team started the season ranked number one with high expectations and ended the season number one in a hard-fought duel with Stanford, the number two rated team in the Nation. And some even had the audacity to think that Stanford was a better team. But, boy, it was the match of a century, two titans battling it out. And the University of Nebraska in the fifth game prevailed for the national championship. 
   Not only are we proud of the University of Nebraska women's volleyball team for their play on the court but also those in attendance. My hometown of Omaha hosted the national championship tournament, and we now hold the record for attendance for a women's volleyball match in America; 17,200 fans attended each session. I think that speaks well of the sports enthusiasm in Nebraska.  
   I also want to acknowledge one of the players on that team, Sarah Pavan, a junior, who has become the second player in NCAA history to be named the American Volleyball Coaches Association Player of the Year and Academic All-American of the year from ESPN Magazine. That is truly a student athlete. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join the Nebraska delegation today in recognizing the outstanding play of our volleyball team, the coaching and the support that this volleyball team has from its fans in Nebraska.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, I come here today with the common sense and hopefully consensus amendment that directs USAID to give priority to organizations based in the United States when awarding grants to NGOs to rebuild Afghanistan. 
   The experience and expertise of U.S. organizations in public institutions to rebuild Afghanistan should be utilized and recognized by USAID. It's also a fact that when people of Afghanistan see Americans helping to rebuild their schools and providing teachers and helping their economy, that a true and positive perception of our Nation increases. 
   My straightforward amendment states that USAID should give priority consideration to U.S.-based organizations that have a proven track record of assisting young nations like Afghanistan to educate its children and teach them skills that will lead to economic growth and revitalization. 
   The Center for Afghanistan Studies at the University of Nebraska's Omaha campus is a great example of a proven institution, experienced institution, in providing cost-effective services to Afghanistan, as well as other nations,  that has experience in administering programs within Afghanistan, and teaching the people of Afghanistan, and yet were not considered to be a subcontractor with USAID. 
   There are undoubtedly many more examples of expertise and assistance from United States programs dedicated to the betterment of nations and their citizens. It seems only right that USAID give priority to U.S. organizations with established records of service and success. 
   I urge my colleagues' support. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the ranking member.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AT OMAHA -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. I thank the gentleman, and I thank the committee leadership for bringing this resolution to the floor. I, of course, as the author, rise in support of H. Res. 1372, a resolution celebrating the 100th anniversary of the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I do want to start off at the beginning to tell my friend from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa) that this is not the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Huskers. This is the number-sixth-rated-in-the-Nation University of Nebraska at Omaha Division II football. That is a distinction that, once made, garnered a lot more supporters. So when it comes to voting, I want to make that distinction. 
   In October of 1908, 26 students gathered to form the first class at the University of Omaha, achieving the goal the city fathers decreed to create a nonsectarian university where local high school graduates could receive a college education. Over the tumultuous years ahead, the University of Omaha grew in size and reputation, outgrowing its original buildings and then relocating to its current home near Memorial Park in what was then the far west edge of the town and now known as ``Midtown.'' 
   In time, the University of Omaha would be known as the Municipal University of Omaha and in 1968 would become part of the University of Nebraska system, developing doctoral programs in conjunction with the flagship campus in Lincoln, as well as a number of independent programs in the field of public administration and criminal justice. UNO, as it then would become to be known, would become known for its remarkable programs in engineering, IS&T, and technology fields that are housed in the Peter Kiewit Institute as well as the university's renowned aviation program. 
   Today the University of Nebraska at Omaha has a significant impact on eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, serving over 250 communities and contributing nearly $300 million in economic impact to that area. With a current enrollment of nearly 15,000 students, the University of Nebraska at Omaha has grown significantly and in measurable ways. It has bettered the lives of the citizens of Omaha and has taken its place among some of the finest public universities of its size in the region. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Members to vote in favor of this resolution in recognition of a truly unique and outstanding educational institution as it celebrates its 100th anniversary in October of this year. And go Mavericks!

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1591, a pork-laden $124.3 billion war supplemental that would force U.S. troops to withdraw from Iraq. 
   I strongly support benchmarks and high accountability for military and political progress in Iraq, but not in a manner that hurts our chances of accomplishing those goals. Under this legislation, U.S. troops would be withdrawn from Iraq unless the President's benchmarks for progress are met by July. This unreasonable requirement would not give General Petraeus enough time to show if the new ``troop surge'' is effective. 
   In addition, this bill would force U.S. troops to withdraw by August 2008 regardless of whether the benchmarks are met. Members of Congress should not be dictating strategy to our generals in the field. 
   The authors of this bill are talking out of both sides of their mouths. In attempting to reach a compromise, they would fund the troop surge while dooming it to failure by not allowing enough time to see if it works. It is clear that a forthright and honest vote on withdrawing U.S. troops would fail. The Majority Party's Leadership has instead chosen to entice Members of Congress with pork-barrel spending in exchange for their vote on this bill. 
   The Washington Post reported: ``House Democratic leaders are offering billions in federal funds for lawmakers'' pet projects large and small to secure enough votes this week to pass an Iraq funding bill that would end the war next year.'' 
   This so-called ``emergency'' war supplemental includes non-defense spending such as $283 million in milk subsidies, $474 million in peanut subsidies, and $25 million in spinach subsidies. 
   This legislation abandons the Majority Party's supposed leadership on fiscal discipline. It is a hypocritical and blatant attempt to gain votes from Members of Congress through special interest spending. The bill includes non-military items such as an increase in the minimum wage, tax relief for small businesses, drought aid, hurricane relief, agricultural subsidies and funds for child health insurance. Each of these items should be debated under regular order in the House. 
   I strongly support the defense-related spending items in this legislation, including critical equipment for our troops and health care improvements for our veterans such as funding for Walter Reed Army Medical Center. I was also proud to sign the discharge petition to vote on Congressman SAM JOHNSON's legislation to ensure full funding of our troops. 
   We must demand meaningful progress in Iraq to curb sectarian violence, disarm militias, train security forces and strengthen the arm of the new Iraqi government until Iraq can govern itself. However, H.R. 1591 is clearly not the answer. Immediately withdrawing U.S. troops would be an irresponsible display of politics that would endanger future generations of Americans. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting against this legislation, and to demand a ``clean'' war supplemental that meets the needs of our troops without pork-barrel politics.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Chairman DINGELL, BARON HILL, JOHN CAMPBELL and others for their assistance in negotiating the landmark fuel economy provisions in this bill. Without the hard work of these Members, we would not have been able to reform our Nation's fuel economy standards in a manner that increases fuel economy by 40 percent while preserving jobs and vehicle choice. The Hill-Terry fuel economy reforms will reduce overall gasoline consumption and its attendant carbon emissions, goals that Members of both parties support. 
   This bill also has strong energy efficiency provisions, which like the Hill-Terry fuel economy reforms, will reduce demand for energy in the long term. While I support and will vote for the bill for these reasons, I am extremely disappointed this bill does nothing to address the supply side of energy. By not addressing the supply side of energy security, this bill is woefully deficient in preparing America for a future in which our energy supply must grow to continue supporting our domestic manufacturing base, as well as a future and present where other nations are locked in an ongoing competition around the world to secure energy resources for the future. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the Hill-Terry fuel economy reforms will help reduce the amount of gasoline our Nation imports. I am also proud of the increased renewable fuels standard, which will encourage more production of ethanol and biodiesel to further reduce demand for foreign imports. But these provisions coupled with energy efficiency measures are not enough. 
   To truly address the energy challenges our Nation will face in the future, we must embrace every available technology at our disposal. Given the majority's concern for carbon emissions, I am surprised they oppose further development of our Nation's nuclear power industry. Nuclear power is cheap, produces no emissions, generates good jobs and is a net benefit to the communities in which plants are located. 
   Additionally, the bill ignores America's greatest natural resource: coal. It is no understatement that Illinois is the Saudi Arabia of coal. Combined with coal resources in other States, our Nation has enough coal to supply all of America's energy needs for in excess of 150 years. Yet the bill contains no provisions to promote the use of coal. 
   I realize that when most Americans think of coal plants, images of black smoke emerging from dirty stacks come to mind. That is the coal industry of yesterday. Today's coal industry has been moving towards using cleaner coal, which produces less sulfur and nitrogen, and scientists around the world are developing technologies to make coal even cleaner and to reduce its carbon emissions. Technologies currently being researched and improved that accomplish these goals are carbon capture and sequestration, CCS, and Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles, IGCC. CCS captures carbon emissions at the source and then either pumps it deep underground where it is capped, or pumps it into partially depleted oilfields to force the oil closer to the surface and make domestic oil recovery cheaper, thus also increasing our domestic oil supply. 
   Coal can also be used to produce motor and aviation fuel through coal-to-liquids technology, which this bill does nothing to support. This technology is based on the Fischer-Tropes process developed early in the 20th century. South Africa derives over 30 percent of its energy needs from Fischer-Tropes produced fuels. Using the Fischer-Tropes process, America could be well on the way to producing motor and aviation fuel with fewer emissions than are produced by a typical gasoline refinery. 
   Opponents of using coal for any reason will say that these technologies are not fully developed or cost-effective enough for our Nation to adopt them. 
   Ironically, many of these are the same people who support the Hill-Terry fuel economy reforms even though meeting these new  standards will require industry to increase investment in and development of new technologies to meet the 35 mpg by 2020 goal set out by this energy bill. If the U.S. auto industry can do this in 12 years, there is no reason that similar technology can't be developed in the same timeframe by utility and coal companies. And best of all, opening new CTL refineries will create jobs both in the new refineries, and in associated industries. 
   Finally, just this week there were news reports that an American chemical company is moving some production overseas due to the difference in energy costs here compared with costs in their new host nation. By not increasing our domestic energy supply, our Nation is essentially asking U.S. companies to leave our shores and eliminate American jobs. 
   I encourage our distinguished Chairman, JOHN DINGELL, to work with Speaker PELOSI and the Democrat Leadership to enact a second energy bill this Congress, which focuses on increasing the supply of U.S. energy in order to protect our national manufacturing base and maintain good-paying U.S. jobs.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1424 because it is, in my opinion, our last opportunity to save jobs, save small businesses, and I pray prevent a collapse of our economy. I believe that is what we are facing today. 
   I have heard from hundreds of Nebraskans who have contacted me by phone, email, or have just come up to me when I was home. All of them are angry. Angry at the greed, arrogance, and just plain reckless nature of Wall Street. Angry at Congress and the administration who have now proposed using taxpayers' dollars to bail out those greedy investment bankers, traders, and CEOs. People have every right to be angry at these self-important Wall Street executives who cared more about themselves by making a quick buck no matter the risk or lack of ethics just so they could earn multi-million dollar salaries. 
   Madam Speaker, I share that anger. Maybe even a little more, as my constituents have transferred their anger onto the one who they can reach out to--me. I have to admit that listening to their anger and fright, sharing their true feelings, but knowing that I have the responsibility as their Representative in Congress to do something to help them, has increased my frustration to a level I've never experienced before as a Member of Congress. Still, something must be done. Inaction may be ``something,'' but it is not the answer. 
   I now know that to save ourselves we must also save the pigs. Those greedy pigs on Wall Street don't deserve help from hard-working Americans. But allowing them to fail will cause so many other businesses that conducted their business in good faith, ethically and conservatively to lose access to credit, lose business, and eventually maybe have to close their doors. Yes, even in Nebraska, far away from Wall Street. I have heard from several business leaders in Omaha who say they will have to lay off some employees if liquidity in our financial system is not restored. One business owner told me they are at risk of shutting their doors and every employee will be laid off. My vote today is to help the people of Nebraska, protect their jobs, and protect their savings. 
   So, is this bill the best answer? Probably not. I prefer stimulating the economy by eliminating or suspending the capital gains tax, providing an incentive to purchase of homes with a tax credit, transferring the toxic mortgage debt to the free market, using insurance to cover future debt, and encouraging the Federal Reserve to release more money to central banks for increased liquidity. I also support suspending an arcane federal accounting rule mandated on publicly traded companies known as ``mark to market''. 
   The mark to market rule forces firms to report the current market value of an asset. So when no market exists at a point in time for an asset then its value is zero or next to zero. But the asset has value and will have more value in the future. The rule is unforgiving and has caused companies to declare they are bankrupt--when they are really worth more. 
   Madam Speaker, the first bill brought to Congress by Treasury Secretary Paulson on Monday, September 22, was insulting. The bill would have given Secretary Paulson complete control over $700 billion, no questions asked, no transparency, no accountability, and no punishment of the hogs on Wall Street. 
   After several listening sessions with Members our leadership began negotiations with Secretary Paulson. These talks were painful and long with many starts and stops and a premature declaration of done deal. After several days, a true deal was announced. Some of the good ideas by Members to improve the bill were included, but very few. 
   I knew we could do a much better job to protect the taxpayers and I felt the responsibility to continue to try. I also knew that I could vote ``no,'' and allow the bill to fail. Then, maybe then, the administration would listen. 
   That's exactly what happened. I voted against it and once again offered seven provisions to the White House and leadership to make it a better bill. Those improvements included suspension of mark to market, more use of FDIC insurance, and reinstating the so-called ``uptick'' rule. The first two priorities were agreed to and made a part of the final bill. 
   This bill prohibits the use of tax dollars for executive severance packages, creates a board of directors to approve of the Secretary of Treasury's decisions spending tax dollars, greater oversight by Congress, slowing the release of tax dollars, allowing the SEC Chairman to waive the mark to market rule when no market exists for a particular asset (the SEC chairman agreed to do so), and providing insurance to limit the taxpayer's risk of loss where the Government purchased toxic debt. 
   Finally, I want to thank a number of individuals in the Omaha community who took the time to talk to me about the bill and legitimacy of the crisis. They made me better informed about this problem from a Nebraska perspective, thereby allowing me to step back and be more thoughtful on how to proceed. Your advice and assistance was much appreciated. 
   Madam Speaker, this is not the perfect solution, it's not even a good one, but it is the solution before us today. And I will support it because I can't look into the eyes of someone who has just lost their job and say, ``I did nothing to help.''

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, today the House is considering H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. I strongly support the mental health community and believe that millions of Americans living with mental health illness and addiction need access to treatment. Screening and early treatment remains an important and cost-effective way of combating mental health illness and addiction. 
   Unfortunately, the bill before us today seeks to extend mental health treatment by stifling innovation, increasing health insurance cost to employers and employees and mandates that ALL diagnoses, such as `jet lag' and `caffeine intoxication' listed in the DSM-IV be covered. 
   A provision in H.R. 1424 also seeks to limit physician ownership in hospitals, regardless of whether those hospitals are in rural or small communities. Physician owned hospitals strive to eliminate preventable complications and errors in order to improve patient care. Specialty care hospitals are an integral part of our community in Nebraska. They provide quality care and help keep costs down. A February article in Forbes highlighted a University of Iowa study which found that tens of thousands of Medicare patients' complication rates for hip and knee surgeries were 40 percent lower at specialty hospitals than at other hospitals. 
   Mr. Speaker, unlike the Senate bill which requires that insurance companies consider all mental ailments listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the legislation before us goes one step further by requiring groups which offer mental health benefits to cover all diagnoses under the DSM-IV, this includes disorders such as `jet lag' and `caffeine intoxication.' Furthermore, groups would be required to extend current mental health benefits regardless of religious or moral objections they may have to paying for the treatment of psycho-sexual disorders or dubious complaints of less serious problems. 
   Finally, the bill would increase health insurance costs. The CBO estimates that by 2012, H.R. 1424 would cost $3 billion annually, a cost which would be passed on to employers and employees. 
   I am concerned that the government mandate currently proposed by H.R. 1424, though well-intentioned, could actually reduce access to mental health care. Many health plans are already responding to customer demand by gradually implementing greater coverage of mental health treatments. Mandating that such coverage would be immediately equal with medical and surgical benefits could force some plans to drop mental health benefits altogether leaving Americans in need of coverage with none at all. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wanted to come to this floor and vote for a Mental Health Parity bill like the one I supported in the Energy and Commerce Committee last fall. Unfortunately, this is not the same legislation, and therefore I must reluctantly oppose it.

   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all of my colleagues here and the constituents of the Second Congressional District, our prayers go out to Barbara, his wife, and their five children. 
   Peter passed away yesterday. He was a mere 66 years old. Many of you know that served with him that he developed Parkinson's the last few years, and it slowly had worsened. But as is typical with Pete, instead of feeling sorry, he went out and became an advocate for those with Parkinson's disease, frequently coming to our office to talk about his advocacy and also about local politics back home. 
   Pete first ran for the State legislature in Nebraska in 1978, where he became known as this idealistic, principled, yet liberal Member from midtown Omaha, which was surprising because he grew up in a family of pretty hard-core, conservative Republicans. 
   But I got to know Pete. In fact, Pete even offered me a clerkship in his law office in 1986, and we became fast and good friends. 
   He then ran for Congress in 1988 where, with the utmost dedication, he represented the people of the Second District of Nebraska, carrying on that principled, idealistic nature that he brought to the Nebraska State legislature. 
   So on behalf of people of the State of Nebraska and the Second Congressional District, I'll say that we will miss our friend, Pete Hoagland. 
   At this time, I'd like to yield to my friend from New York.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate your patience as some of us exercise our frustration and try and make a point or two. And I want to commend the gentlelady from Virginia for offering this amendment to cut $1.241 million from the Office of General Counsel and the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management account from the fiscal year 2008 level that's being proposed here. 
   It would still be an increase, but there's two areas that I want to highlight with my frustration, and one is, with an overall level of antagonism and kind of vitriolic partisanship that's occurring here, and I think a lot of it's a frustration or results from our frustration. 
   For example, in the last year or so, as our friends in the now majority, then minority, were bringing up and talking about how we were spending so much and that we were out of control, and I've got to tell you, I voted against some of our appropriation bills because I thought that they were too high. 
   The interesting part is when people in my district would come up, having bought into this rhetoric, I said, but you don't understand that we're fighting with them every day to keep it as low as it is. I said, if they're in charge, just wait. 
   Well, here we are with the first bill, and it's a 13.6 percent increase over last year's appropriation. And we had a speaker up here earlier that talked about building that base. You increase it 13.6, and then next year, when you increase it 13.6, just the exponential increases in the budget. 
   When you look at those that we passed last year, we are barely above the inflation rate in these discretionary accounts, but yet we were criticized by the now majority for being too ``spendy.'' 
   So I see the irony, and most of it was, you know, we tried to tell people last year that this is just their campaign nasty rhetoric. But it seems odd to me that just their first bill they're going to increase it so dramatically. 
   Now, I'll tell you another area of my frustration was coupled with the criticism from the now majority last year about earmarks and the process. And we passed a bill last year that altered the process for earmarks, and it was one that I thought was very appropriate because it dealt with earmarks by spreading sunshine on the process. And I really believe that sunshine is always the best disinfectant. So we adopted a process that embraces sunshine. What it means is that somebody had to have ownership for an earmark request, and that the earmark request had to go through what we would deem regular order, which means you submit it to the appropriations subcommittee staff, then I would go and testify in front of that subcommittee on my earmark; we could have give and take and an intellectual conversation about that, and it would be then voted upon by that subcommittee, which would then raise up to the committee level where that earmark or that Member request would then be reviewed again. 
   The most important part of the process is when you get it out of the appropriations arena and bring it to the House floor where everyone can then see it and determine whether or not there should be an amendment to strike that particular provision from the appropriation bill. This is when everyone then gets to be part of the process of making sure that it's a valid, well, whatever is determined to be valid, but whether it's not, you know, a rainforest in Iowa City or some type of pet project like that. 
   I remember last year we voted probably almost on every appropriation bill at least a dozen amendments to strip out these type of really pet projects that just really didn't mean much for the Nation, but certainly may have meant something for a neighborhood. Now, most of those failed, although I voted in favor of most of them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. I move to strike the last word. 
   I do appreciate the gentleman's secondary or second-degree amendment. The good chairman stood up and gave an eloquent argument about what the primary and secondary amendment is not about. But what it is about, in my opinion, is the hypocrisy in two different areas, the hypocrisy of having boards out front of their offices talking about the mounting debt and then the first appropriation bill increasing the discretionary spending by 13.6 percent. Then, also, the hypocrisy of talking about a culture of corruption and how it spills over to earmarks. 
   Well, the way to cure that is transparency. The first appropriation bill out of the block hides them so we can't debate them on the House floor. That's what this is about. This is why we're upset and coming to the floor and discussing this issue. I'm very frustrated with this process of hiding these earmarks. 
   Well, they are not being hidden, they are just not being included in this bill so they can be dropped in at a later date, at a time when we don't have an opportunity to review them and determine them on an individual basis, the merits or lack of merit for any specific project listed. That's atrocious. 
   What's mostly atrocious and frustrating and hypocritical about it is the fact that these folks campaigned on reforming that, and they were the ones to throw out all the good forms of transparency so they can hide them from us. 
   That's wrong, and that's why we're down here. That's why we're down here, to show our frustration with blowing the lid off the spending now  and hiding these earmarks at a time when the people want to know what we're doing with earmarks here. They want them to stop. At the very least, they want to make sure that they're valid ones and not Members' pet projects. 
   Now, the gentleman from North Carolina with the second-degree amendment, you indicated you wanted to expand what Chairman Price mentioned as well. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. TERRY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 3042, the Calling Card Consumer Protection Act. 
   There is enormous fraud in the marketing and delivery of prepaid calling card services, reportedly up to as much as 30 percent to 40 percent of the industry's revenue. Prepaid card fraud is not a new problem, but has grown into a $1 billion industry that has attracted an increasing number of new providers, some better than others. 
   In many cases, the fraud is associated with the cards marketed to people from a specific region in the world with purported preferred rates to their country of origin. The States have responded to this problem with their own disclosure requirements and have increasingly brought enforcement actions against the bad actors, as has the Federal Trade Commission. 
   H.R. 3402 attempts to put the Federal Trade Commission in a strong position to go after the bad actors and to mandate proper disclosures to consumers. A national law is helpful, because it provides consistency for providers and consumers, consistency for enforcement, and it reduces confusion across this market. 
   In addition to preemption of State law for H.R. 3402 to be effective, it will have to apply to common carriers. We have crafted a very narrow enforcement authority for the FTC, solely for the purposes of this act, and I am glad we could do that on a bipartisan basis.

The core mission would be to promote tourism in the United States and provide travel information to people around the world. 
   I am a cosponsor of the bill and support promoting the country's tourism industry. Spending by international travelers while in this country is defined as a U.S. export, and many have said that it is strong U.S. export numbers that have kept the economy growing over the last few quarters, despite a slowdown in other parts of the economy and the huge problems that have presented themselves in the financial markets.

   Madam Speaker, as one of the coauthors of this bill, I rise in support of Senate 1382, or at least the House version of this ALS Registry Act. 
   ALS, sometimes called Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rapidly progressive and invariably fatal neurological disease that attacks the nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscles. The disease belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases, which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. 
   As many as 20,000 Americans have ALS, and an estimated 5,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease each year. ALS is one of the most common neuromuscular diseases worldwide, and people of all races and ethnic backgrounds are affected. ALS most commonly strikes people between 40 and 60 years of age, but younger and older people also can develop the disease. 
   Constituents suffering from what used to be called Lou Gehrig's disease have been visiting Congress and asking for help for years. The disease is brutal, and I believe that establishing a registry will help researchers cure ALS. An ALS registry will serve as an excellent resource for scientists. 
   I thank Mr. Engel and others like Mr. Deal who helped shepherd this through our subcommittee and committee and in making sure that it got here today.

   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, this is an extremely disappointing day for me, and I assume for America. Today is the day when we finally have an energy bill, except it doesn't have energy in it. And America wants us to work together, the Republicans and Democrats to work together, so that we have a comprehensive American energy plan that makes us independent of foreign oil where we can have price stability. 
   But unfortunately, as Republicans repeatedly reached out to the Democrat leadership to be involved in this process, we were totally shut out. The only negotiations occurred within the Speaker's office, and no Republican was allowed. We didn't even see the bill until late last night. This is not a true energy bill. If she would have included some of us, we could have made this hoax of a bill a lot better for the American public. 
   For example, they say that they open up 12 percent of the resources, but then put conditions on it that really can't be met. So even that 12 percent of the coastal waters are not going to be opened up while they pass a permanent moratorium on 88 percent. 
   This is a hoax, and America needs to see it for what it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my support for this resolution recognizing the 60th Anniversary of the U.S. Air Force as an independent military service. 
   Offutt Air Force Base is home to the 55th Wing, the Fightin' Fifty-Fifth. Offutt's diverse missions and global responsibilities put it on the cutting edge of the new U.S. Air Force. There are approximately 12,000 military and Federal employees representing all branches of the military that serve on or near Offutt AFB, which is located near the Missouri River just south of Omaha and is a major presence in my congressional district. 
   Offut is also the home of STRATCOM, the global integrated force that is charged with the missions of space operations; information operations; integrated missile defense; global command and control; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; global strike; and strategic deterrence. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Fifty-Fifth Wing operates a variety of aircraft to conduct operations from Offutt AFB, Nebraska; Kadena AB, Japan; RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom; Souda Bay Naval Support Activity, Crete; and other locations around the world. It is the largest wing in Air Combat Command and the second largest in the Air Force. 
   Air Combat Command is the principal provider of combat airpower that supports America's global national security strategy. It operates fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, battle-management and electronic-combat aircraft. It also provides command, control, communications, intelligence systems, and information operations in support of the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the U.S. Air Force celebrates its 60th Anniversary, I want to join my colleagues in recognizing the many contributions it has made to the defense of our Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (ENERGY SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am here tonight to talk about energy security. We have talked about energy independence, and I think that is a subset of energy security. 
   We have to look at the world in total, and we have to realize that we need to secure our own energy sources if we are going to secure the future of our country. Even as I look at probably the most immediate issue, the war with terrorists, their actions against us, but if we take that and look at the world in total, when I see the lowest common denominator, it's energy. It is a fight or a battle for energy. 
   Those who are going to be able to power themselves without relying on others will not only have more options and purer choices in foreign policy  matters, but the reality is in this new emerging global economy, those that cannot be economically hijacked by foreign countries are going to be the winners. I want to make sure that we have a policy in place that recognizes the need for independence so that we can secure our future. 
   Now this means that we have to do some things. I don't know how many of you out there remember high school economics. I remember Mr. Croft's lessons at Northwest High School, and basic supply and demand. 
   When we look at resolving our energy issues, and, by the way, a barrel of oil hit over $75 today, we have to look at both sides of the equation. That's what we tried to do in 2005, the energy bill that was signed by the President. We tried to increase the amount of supply of energy and, at the same time, looking at how to conserve or reduce the demand for energy in our country. 
   Now, overlaying this discussion about energy, supply and demand, is a new discussion amongst us about global warming. This is driving our discussions on energy today. I fear that we have become, how do I say this, but so spooked by global warming that we are willing to go to the extreme and hurt ourselves. 
   And I really believe that part of my role and the role of the minority party here is maybe to swing back to a more practical level as we talk about energy and global warming. 
   Now, what a lot of people don't know when we talk about global warming or the CO  
   2 emissions, that is the gas that is depleting our ozone, the vast majority of that is created naturally, not by humans. Yes, human activity that I am going to talk about in a minute does contribute to that. 
   Now, as I understand, the major contributor and the most significant contributor to CO  
   2 emissions is livestock. So, of course, some have joined hands with PETA to make sure that we eliminate all the cattle, pigs, chickens, and we should just become vegetarians. 
   The next is humans. Not by our activity of burning coal and the coal-generated electrical plant, but just ourselves and our existence, our exhaling. And, therefore, we should have mandated policies to control population, i.e., abortion, and reduce the number of people on Earth. That is one of the policies out there. 
   Now, the discussion that we are going to have here in the House in the next 2 weeks is going to be on what energy policies do we implement here to lower CO  
   2 emissions and become energy independent. Well, the reality of it is, the policies that we are going to hear from the majority party will help to some small degree on the demand side and absolutely drive up or put more pressures, increased pressures, on supply, because they are going to eliminate some of our sources that we use for energy, make it more difficult and more costly to use and, therefore, create bigger demand. What happens when there is bigger demand? Prices go up. 
   So any of you out there that want to turn on a light, use your computer, heat or cool your homes, drive to work, under the policies that we are looking at adopting in this House over the next couple weeks, expect to pay more. 
   Now, this is why I think it is becoming so important here. I want to get back to our supply-and-demand lesson here. In this chart, the United States, because of our economic engine, our ingenuity, our intellectual properties that are being put into action, we are the largest consuming Nation. Now, look down here, we also rank number one in oil importation. We have to import to drive our economy, literally drive our economy, about 65 percent of our energy needs. Now, that is 12 billion barrels that we have to import. 
   When I think of energy, I have to separate it into two different issues. One is driving. About two-thirds of the oil that we import goes to refining into gasoline, to use in jet fuel and trucks to move goods from one place to another, as well as cars to get us to the grocery store, to get us back to work. If we are going to become independent, we have to look at a full array of fuels that we can generate here. That means biofuels to some extent. That means that we adopt policies on hybrid type of cars or other experimental cars that are out there. And, by the way, that does lower emissions. But remember, car emissions are pretty far down the list of what actually contributes to CO  
   2 emissions and the ozone. We can then look at a lot of other technologies. I am a proponent of hydrogen, for example. 
   Now, let's look at the other side of generating electricity that powers our economy and is part of the equation. Most of our electrical generation, about 52 percent nationally, is from coal. In the policies adopted by various committees of this House and that are going to be brought to the floor in some capacity either in the next 2 weeks or maybe even September, they make it much more difficult to use coal. I mentioned, 52 percent of the electricity in this Nation is generated from coal. In my district, it is over 70 percent. It is the cheapest way to generate electricity. It is plentiful. We have something like a 500-year supply of coal to generate electricity in this country. 
   So I feel that instead of doing what the majority party wants to do and shut down coal-fired plants, crippling our ability to generate electricity; and, by the way, nuclear is bad, too. Remember that, no nuclear power? Let's make it as difficult. Let's not find ways to deal with the waste. And so if we shut down coal, make it more costly at least to do it, no nuclear, that means you have one area to really rely on in generating electricity, and that is natural gas. Oh, and by the way, our policies don't allow for any more domestic supply of natural gas and oil, so we are going to shift everything to natural gas to generate. We barely allow it to be imported. We can't drill any more for it within our own 48 continental United States or offshore any more than we are doing today. 
   I don't understand this energy policy that is going to be brought to us. It seems to me to be a negative energy policy. In fact, I think the only energy that is involved in this bill is perhaps if we burn the darn thing we could generate some power. But, as was just mentioned to me, that would result in CO  
   2 emission, so we can't even do that. 
   Mr. Speaker and the American public, we need to become more engaged in this. We are on a path to cripple our economy. China is adding at least one new power plant a week based on coal. They have no problems using coal. I saw a statistic that was 2 years old, so it is probably much more significant now, but the Chinese were adding 120,000 cars per day. That is not even talking about India, whose economy is expanding at near double digits as well, and they are adding power in their cars. 
   The competition is extreme for oil. We need to recognize that. We need to expand it. That doesn't mean that we shut down our domestic fossil fuels. That means we add to it so that we become independent and secure our Nation's future. 
   At this time, I yield to my friend from Texas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. I appreciate your comments and putting more meat onto the bones here. And I'll mention that in my district, again, it's about 70 percent, almost 70 percent coal. We do have nuclear. We use natural gas only as a peaking, which is basically this time of year. It was 99 degrees at home today, and I'll guarantee you Omaha Public Power is running their peaking plant during the day so that people can run their air conditioners. And there's a lot of things that we could do on the conservation side, as you said, and we need to push those.  
   But at the same time, we seem to be adopting policies that restrict the supply. And I think even though the policies that are going to be proposed here don't necessarily further restrict than already have been natural gas, what they do is move more energy, or force more energy to electrical generation by natural gas without doing anything to increase the supply of that natural gas. 
   And the gentleman from Pennsylvania has come to the floor many times. He is one of the leaders in the House in discussion of what we need to do to increase supplies of natural gas, and how ridiculous it is that our prices in the United States are probably five times more than anywhere else in the rest of the world. 
   So I yield to my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson).

So that is what happens when we find new pockets. We rule them off limits. That just astounds me that we have got that much. And when we are talking about securing our future, wanting to become independent, the other side and us are worried about global warming. And  this is a clean fuel. You have stressed it. It is a clean fuel, which is why the policies that we are seeing are moving electrical generations towards natural gas. It makes no sense to me that we won't increase supply at the same time.

   Mr. TERRY. Madam Speaker, I too am deeply disappointed today. I think part of the message from the electorate was that they want us to work together, that they want us to cooperate for the greater good. And, yes, that people were, at least in Nebraska, very upset with the examples of those who violated the public's trust. 
   We need to work together on an ethics plan. I am pleased that in this rule there are ethics measures that, by the way, the Republicans helped put together many months ago in reaction to the ethics violations we have seen from some of our colleagues. 
   So, as the people want us to work together in a partnership and not in partisanship, what we received was a partisan slap across the face. It is the mismatch between words and actions of which we are speaking today. 
   I have had a bill that was incorporated into the ethics package that we passed last May that the Democrats almost en banc opposed because it wasn't tough enough. The reality is that the package in today's rule, which we had no participation in, is, in many ways, weaker. And one of the examples is the fact that, as I worked on with our Speaker, that if you have violated the rules of this House and the public trust and you took money, you found $90,000 of cold hard cash or you took limousines or whatever the violations were, that you shouldn't be able to leave in the public disgust with the benefits of public service, i.e., a pension. That was in the ethics package passed months ago but isn't in this one. So this is a weaker package. 
   Now, I too wish I would have had the opportunity to take the bill that I have introduced today and did last year and work with our friends on the other side, but, in the partisan slap, have been denied the ability to do so.

   Mr. TERRY. Thank you, I appreciate this opportunity. 
   Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman from Ohio, the new Member who just spoke, I appreciate and respect his point of view. I will add, though, that the disgust, the frustration with the ethics violation, the disregard for the public's trust in this body because of a few of our colleagues isn't relegated to one side of the aisle or the other, nor one district or the other. 
   I think all of us in this institution today that took the oath of office are disgusted by the past; and that is why this body that last May passed a comprehensive ethics bill, which mostly was incorporated in this one, ironically, I think, it is fairly humorous, that most of our colleagues on the other side voted against it because it was not good enough, yet substantially similar to the one that is brought forward without our input into the process today. 
   Now I stand here today saying this isn't good enough. We could have done a better job of tightening down with lobbyists and gifts. Frankly, I don't know how to interpret the plane part, but I am concerned about establishing the public trust when someone accepts bribes. 
   In our package that was voted against by a lot of our colleagues from the other side of the aisle that are pounding their chests today, in that was saying that you cannot receive the fruits that you earned during your tenure in this office if you have violated the public's trust. 
   That is not part of the bill that stands before us today. If you have accepted a bribe, you are convicted of a felony and are sitting in jail, you should not be able to accept the part of the government-funded pension or other government-funded benefits that you earned while you were here. You just simply cannot do that. 
   My folks back in Nebraska think that is absolutely absurd. I just wish we had a process in place where we could have worked in a partnership to improve this bill, to make it better. But we didn't have that opportunity, and I don't have the opportunity on behalf of my Nebraskans, who feel that it is absurd that you have cash in a freezer, that you can accept bribes like we had in a California or in an Ohio district, and still accept your pension. I think it is absurd that we don't have that opportunity today. 
   Frankly, the fact that those folks that voted against a comprehensive ethics reform package introduced one without Republican input to improve the bill smacks of partisanship to me. I thought we were going to clear the decks of that and start working together for the public good, and it just doesn't seem like it is happening today. 
   That is a poor start for civility in this body.

   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep disappointment in the rules package we are considering today. 
   The message from the American public last fall was ``we want Republicans and Democrats to work together.'' We all had high expectations for a ``new way of doing business in Washington.'' 
   This past week during the Nation's remembrance of former President Gerald Ford, we were all reminded of the way Republicans and Democrats were able to find common ground to solve the country's problems. There was a time when the two parties could come together in the national interest. 
   Where, Mr. Speaker, did all of those grand and high-minded promises of bipartisanship go? I hope this is not a precedent for how the House will operate during the rest of the 110th Congress. Our constituents expect us to work together and get things done for the good of the country. 
   Included in this rules package are a number of ethics reforms, but they do not go far enough. We must have tougher and stronger ethics reform. 
   Today, there are Members serving in the House who have contributed to the American public's loss of confidence in this body. One Member was found to have $90,000 in cash in his freezer; another Member of the Appropriations Committee established separate entities that were recipients of appropriation funds. Yet, this rules package and the ethics reforms in it do nothing to punish such behavior. 
   We must adopt tougher and stronger measures if we are going to regain the trust of the American public. In my District, Nebraskans sent a clear message that said if Members take bribes and abuse the public's trust, they should not be protected and should not be allowed to reap the benefits of their House service such as a pension paid for by the taxpayers. Under this new Congressional leadership, Nebraska's voice will not be heard. I won't be allowed to even offer an amendment to be denied by the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am introducing today legislation that I introduced last year--to deny pension benefits to any Member or government official who is convicted of a crime that violates the public trust. Because of the lack of a fair and open process in this House, I have been denied the opportunity to offer this legislation as an amendment. 
   This is not what American voters wanted to see after last fall's election. We are being denied the chance to work together. We need to restore the public's confidence in this House and one way to do that is to work together to solve the problems facing this Nation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mental health deserves serious attention. We all share in this concern. The debate around mental health parity hinges on that principle, does government really know what is best? Isn't it better to allow consumers choice and not a one-size-fits-all government-dictated mandate? People should be able to decide if they want to pay more for health insurance. 
   We have been here before, and, from what I am told, this isn't the only time or possibility even this week that we will be considering a government-dictated mental health mandate. 
   Earlier this year, the House passed H.R. 1424, a bill that served as the House mental health parity bill for purposes of negotiation with the Senate. At the time, CBO estimated that H.R. 1424 would have increased premiums for group health insurance by an average of about four-tenths of 1 percent before accounting for the responses of health plans, employers and workers to the higher premiums. Those responses would include reductions in the number of employees enrolling in employer insurance, changes in the types of health plans that are offered, including eliminating coverage for mental health benefits and/or substance benefits, and reductions in the scope or generosity of health benefits, such as increased deductibles or higher copayments. 
   I opposed H.R. 1424 for these and other reasons regarding the offsets presented at that time, as well as many of my colleagues on Energy and Commerce. 
   The bill before us today is not H.R. 1424. It may be confusing to see this stand-alone mental health parity bill here today, since I know we just passed one a few months ago. After a little digging, I soon realized that this bill is a cut-and-paste of the same agreed-upon text from the tax extenders bill originating in the Senate to be sent over to this body to consider possibly as early as today or tomorrow. So what the majority has done is take language negotiated directly with the Senate without any House Democrats in the room and dropped into another stand-alone bill. 
   One has to wonder why we are considering this bill today, when the exact same language is on its way over to us pursuant to an agreement between the majority and the Senate. Is this just another political gimmick by the Democrat leadership? 
   This is a prime example of what happens when Democrats stop leading on issues and start politicking. The Democrat do-nothing Congress is doing something today. Instead of addressing outstanding issues our country faces, such as a need for real energy reform, they are hard at work to put in front of us a bill that already passed the House this year and will be arriving momentarily from the Senate. Are we really supposed to pass the same bill three times this year? That is not progress. That is a waste of taxpayer time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, this is a noncontroversial amendment that encourages government buildings to use geothermal technology. 
   Geothermal technology is simple; when you dig down and use the energy within and beneath the Earth, you save energy. For example, in Nebraska, and all over, you can dig down 100 feet where the temperature is a consistent 60 degrees. So therefore, for example, at this time of year when it's in the 90s and high humidity, instead of cooling the air from 100 degrees to 72, you're  bringing it up from 60 degrees to 72. You save anywhere from 60 percent and as high as up to 80 percent, depending on the time of year, on energy costs to heat and cool and also to create hot water. This is the major use of energy within buildings, whether commercial or residential, and I think government should be the leader in this. 
   Simple amendment. I appreciate the help and encouragement I have received on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.

   Reclaiming my time from the gentleman from Virginia, while the technology to implement geothermal, for example, a smaller building may increase the building cost by a mere $3,000 or $4,000, studies have shown that for commercial or residential buildings that they will recoup those costs within a matter of 3 years because of the energy savings by using the Earth's own energy to heat and cool.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 942, a resolution recognizing the significance of Black History Month. 
   It is a time to reflect on and honor the important contributions African-Americans have made to our Nation. We should especially take note of the extraordinary people who continue to help build our great Nation. 
   Of the thousands of African-Americans in my District, I have the privilege of representing two individuals and an outstanding group: Marguerita Washington and Rudy Smith, both of Omaha, and the Alfonza W. Davis chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen, based in Omaha. 
   Dr. Marguerita Washington is the editor of the Omaha Star newspaper in Omaha. The paper has been in existence for more than 69 years and is Nebraska's largest African-American newspaper. The policy of the Omaha Star has been to print only positive news and to be a vigilant champion for African-American progress. The paper is located in the heart of Omaha's African-American community. 
   The Omaha Star was founded by the late Mildred D. Brown in 1938. She is believed to be the first female, certainly the first African-American woman, to have founded a newspaper in the Nation's history. When Mrs. Brown expired unexpectedly in 1989, the paper was then placed in the very capable hands of Dr. Marguerita Washington, her niece, who now heads the newspaper. 
   Dr. Washington and the Omaha Star work for equal rights for all; the paper was on the forefront, leading the charge to open public accommodations to African-Americans, including hotels, restaurants, theaters and taverns. The paper was instrumental in working with Omaha Public Schools to ensure that black teachers had equal participation. Dr. Washington also worked hard to get the Omaha Star landmark status in the city of Omaha and the State of Nebraska. 
   Rudy Smith has lived in Omaha since age 6 and has been an Omaha World Herald photographer and editor for more than 40 years. He is in the process of completing a book of his photographs, many of which have been exhibited at black colleges, universities and museums around the country. As a journalist and photographer he has captured images of some of America's greatest heroes. 
   Rudy was more than just a photographer; he was able to chronicle historic moments in Omaha. Every picture he takes is a moment; each special moment holds a lifetime of memories that lives on after the moment has passed. Each of his photographs is a window to a memory and has the ability to deeply connect you to the beauty of life itself. His talent is endless. 
   Omaha native Alphonza Davis graduated from Omaha Tech High School and later Omaha University. He finished first in his class at Tuskegee and was chosen squadron leader. He was killed in combat in 1944 while over in Germany. The local Tuskegee Airmen chapter in Omaha is named after him.  
   The chapter is one of 45 nationwide, and its membership includes four original Tuskegee Airmen. They are LTC (Ret) Paul Adams, LTC (Ret) Charles A. Lane, Jr., LTC (Ret) Harrison A. Tull, and Mr. Robert D. Holts. These members continue their service to our community by mentoring and working with youth through the local Civil Air Patrol. 
   The Tuskegee Airmen and their record of success during the war are unmatched. Not a single American bomber protected by the Red Tails was ever shot down by enemy aircraft. By war's end, the Tuskegee Airmen had flown over 15,000 sorties, completed over 1,500 missions and destroyed more than 260 enemy aircraft. 
   I join my colleagues in recognizing these and the millions of African-Americans in our country for their numerous achievements throughout history, today and the future. This designation is only a small token of the thanks they deserve for all of their contributions to our society. I urge the adoption of H. Res. 942.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3, legislation to expand taxpayer funding of human embryonic stem cell research and give a ``stamp of approval'' from the Federal government for scientists to destroy human embryos to harvest stem cells for medical experiments. 
   The pain and suffering of citizens afflicted with debilitating diseases concerns me greatly. I served for 7 years on the board of directors for the Great Plains Region of the American Diabetes Association because I am committed to finding a cure for people afflicted with this disease. 
   I strongly support scientific research to find cures and effective treatments to relieve human suffering. I voted to double the Federal investment in biomedical research from $13.6 billion in fiscal year 1998 to $27.1 billion in fiscal year 2003. The National Institutes of Health received $28.5 billion from Congress last year to do research on new cures for diseases. 
   Embryonic stem cell research is not the ``silver bullet'' for every disease. The potential benefits of this research have been blown out of proportion by eager scientists and some in the news media. The fact is that 25 years of human embryonic stem cell research have not produced even one treatment for suffering Americans. 
   Adult stem cell research, on the other hand, is producing real and tangible results with no ethical concerns. In fact, adult stem cells have produced treatments for 72 serious diseases and conditions in humans, and shown strong potential for permanent reversal of severe diseases such as diabetes and Parkinson's. 
   Research has consistently shown that human embryonic stem cells grow tumors once implanted in an animal, became uncontrollable, or form various and wrong types of tissues. Some studies have shown moderate improvement in rats with spinal cord injuries, but some of those rats were not kept alive long enough to see if tumors formed. Many scientists argue this is a new medical field and limitations such as cancerous tendencies can be overcome through additional Federal funding and more time in the lab. 
   These arguments callously gloss over the fact that embryonic stem cell research requires the destruction of human embryos--and 48 percent of Americans surveyed last year opposed this type of research after being informed of that fact. We have a responsibility as public officials to direct limited Federal dollars toward the most promising and ethical research possible. 
   The strongest potential for cures at this time is not in embryonic stem cells, but in ethical research using adult stem cells, umbilical cord blood stem cells, and most recently, amniotic fluid stem cells, all of which uphold and support human life. These ethical approaches show promise that rivals the potential of embryonic stem cells without forcing many American taxpayers to fund research that threatens the dignity of human life. 
   Amid all the scientific jargon in today's debate, let us not forget the fact that each one of us started life as a human embryo. There is no way around that basic fact, no matter how many scientific terms are used to conceal or confuse it. Embryos are the tiniest of human lives, but they are nevertheless human lives, and we must defend the defenseless. 
   If embryos are not fundamentally human lives, how can you explain the fact that frozen embryos from in vitro fertility clinics grow into children once they are implanted in a woman's womb? Does an embryo somehow become less of a human being if we choose to donate it to a scientist to be experimented upon and ultimately destroyed? Those same human embryonic stem cells lying in a cold Petri dish will undeniably grow into a human child if given a chance at life. We must not allow scientific terminology to desensitize us to the miracle and sanctity of human life. 
   Here are some published examples of the differences between embryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research: 
   Numerous attempts over the last 5 years to use human embryonic stem cells to cure diabetes repeatedly produced tumors or failed to generate insulin to reverse the disease. In the most successful experiment, human embryonic stem cells produced only one-fiftieth the amount of insulin needed to sustain life, and the mice died. 
   For Parkinson's disease, researchers found that human embryonic stem cells grew uncontrollably in 100 percent of rats with the condition. All the animals showed indications of early tumor formation. These findings were duplicated by scientists in Sweden and Japan. 
   Adult stem cells, on the other hand, have treated multiple types of cancers, including breast cancer and Leukemia, as well as autoimmune diseases, heart defects, heart disease, osteoporosis and spinal cord injuries, and demonstrated excellent potential to treat diabetes and to reverse Parkinson's. 
   In 2003, researchers used adult stem cells to help regenerate pancreatic islet cells that produce insulin, permanently reversing diabetes in mice. The lead researcher stated that: ``Patients with fully established diabetes possibly could have their diabetes reversed.'' The FDA has approved a human clinical trial for diabetes based on this successful research. In 2005, a mother donated live stem cells for her diabetic daughter, alleviating the diabetic symptoms. Human umbilical cord blood stem cells can also generate insulin to reverse diabetes. 
   Just last year, scientists used adult umbilical cord stem cells to treat rats with Parkinson's, and found significant recovery in motion and behavior. In 2002, a Parkinson's patient testified that his symptoms were 80 percent reversed after being treated with his own adult neural stem cells. British researchers in 2003 injected a natural protein into the brains of five Parkinson's patients and found that it stimulated existing adult neural stem cell growth, yielding a 61 percent improvement in motor function. University of Kentucky researchers treated 10 Parkinson's patients with similar results. 
   And just this week, researchers at Harvard University and Wake Forest University reported a breakthrough discovery that stem cells found in amniotic fluid show incredible promise for cures without concerns for tumor growth or immune system rejection. 
   Amniotic stem cells can be safely and easily extracted from pregnant women, and are ``pluripotent'' like human embryonic stem cells, meaning they have the ability to transform into each of the three major types of tissue found in the body. The researchers stated: ``We conclude that amniotic fluid stem cells are pluripotent stem cells capable of giving rise to multiple lineages including representatives of all three embryonic germ layers.'' 
   Using amniotic stem cells, the research team created nerve cells, liver cells, endothelial cells that line blood vessels, and cells involved in the creation of bone, muscle and fat. In fact, the nerve cells successfully generated a neurotransmitter crucial to forming dopamine, which is lacking in Parkinson's patients. In testing on mice, amniotic stem cells were shown to re-grow and repair damaged areas of the brain. 
   The incredible promise of such ethical stem cell research is worthy of taxpayer funding. It holds real promise and real hope for citizens needing cures and tangible relief from pain and disease. 
   This debate today is not about whether we should fund stem cell research with tax dollars. The National Institutes of Health spends about $600 million every year on stem cell research, and almost $40 million of those funds are unfortunately being spent on research involving human embryonic stem cells. 
   The real debate today is about whether scientists will be able to create more embryonic stem cell lines by destroying more embryos. The next thing these scientists will be asking for is the ability to clone embryos because they cannot get enough stem cells from frozen human embryos at in vitro fertility clinics. This is no ``slippery slope,'' it is the ethical equivalent of jumping off a cliff. 
   As public officeholders sworn to uphold the United States Constitution, we will have failed in our duty if we fail today to protect the right to life of the youngest homo sapiens--human embryos. We cannot fail in defending the defenseless, and we must keep faith with American taxpayers by funding the most ethical research to relief the suffering of ailing Americans. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me today in voting against this unethical bill that would exploit human life while preying on the emotions of suffering American citizens.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come down and speak. 
   Certainly in every one of our districts, the housing crunch or crisis affects everyday people. And we have to look at the best way to resolve this. 
   And I think what we have today is kind of a best-intentions type of bill. But I don't think it's really getting to the heart of the matter. When I have talked to several economists that specialize in the real estate markets, all have told me that when you're looking back and trying to remedy or bail out what has occurred, that you are really not going to fix the problems or stimulate the housing industry.  
   So I have developed, with several of my colleagues, a bill that is forward looking. It is straightforward. It is an up to $10,000 tax credit for a purchaser of a home, not a foreclosed home only or a new build only or anything like that. Just if they want to buy a new home or a home they would be eligible. 
   I realize that there was at least a weak attempt to something like that in the amendment that is before us now. We have got a $7,500 tax credit. But when you look at the eligibility and the fact that, yes, it is a refundable tax credit that you have to pay back, it turns out to be rather useless in trying to stimulate the housing market. This is really a faux or phantom tax credit. So I don't think that can be used to help stimulate our economy or the housing market to get us out of the housing depression here. 
   And one of the issues that we're talking about here today is the devaluation of our homes because of the housing depression and that what we're going to do is make up the difference of a home that has been devalued that goes into--

   Mr. TERRY. What we are going to do is spend $300 billion to try and get us to right size that by bailing these folks out. That's just going to prolong the problem according to the economists. 
   Two points there: If that is all that we are really going to do here, we are not going to turn the tide of the devaluation of our homes. The only way to do that is to increase demand overall, which increasing your tax credit will do, not the phantom one that is here. 
   The other way is when you look at the market and the availability of credit, especially for lower income people, I think we are doing the right thing here by increasing the cap or the limit on credits for low-income housing. But there is also market-available tools that are out there. I have had people come to my office and present these market, nongovernment bailout programs, not programs but options, where they use a 501(c)(3) entity where you can put the life insurance in and cover the costs, reduce the house, and I thank you for the opportunity.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON H.R. 2419, FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise today with my motion to instruct to make sure that we keep a tax credit that the Senate has in its version of the farm bill for cellulosic energy and the blending. It's a dollar tax credit, and that's important that we have the higher number because cellulosic energy or cellulosic ethanol, I think, is where we are going to move to for our midterm energy strategy in this country, and that we really are at the very embryonic stages of its development, as I'm going to show here in a few minutes, and that because we are at the beginning stages of cellulosic energy, taking it literally from the research laboratories to the experimental market, trying to produce it more than at 1 gallon at a time, that we will need to, more heavily subsidize these beginning processes.     
   Now, I'm going to build our argument here of why I feel that cellulosic energy or cellulosic ethanol is important and why we need the $1 credit versus the lower number that was in the House version to get to our ultimate goal here, which is energy independence. 
   And by the way, I define ``energy independence'' as not relying on OPEC countries. We will need to use the natural gas and oil from Canada, and we will need to, for a variety of reasons, use the oil from Mexico; but wouldn't it be great if we were in a position that we didn't have to use the oil that's produced by countries that don't like us, that really hinders, as the gentleman from Tennessee, Zach Wamp, mentioned. Our foreign policy, we have to counsel, we have to do things for countries that really are trying to harm us economically, like Venezuela is right now. 
   Now, the bottom line here, the bottom line here is that every citizen of the United States is paying higher prices at the pump. They are paying more of their family budget to get to and from work, to and from the grocery store, and they're upset and rightfully so. So I am asked frequently, what is the plan. Well, the problem is there really isn't a cohesive plan. We do know that it is an issue of supply and demand. 
   Now, we've nibbled at the edges in an earlier bill this year that was signed by the President in December on the demand part. We did things to help incent electric cars, hybrids, battery technology; and probably the key component or foundation of that demand bill or lowering demand of oil was increasing the fuel efficiency of cars and light trucks. That was called the Hill-Terry bill. So I was one of the co-authors of that bill, and we got that in there. And that will increase fuel efficiency by 40 percent, in stages, to 2020, where I really see that we're going to end up earlier meeting those goals because of battery technology and ethanol. 
   We already have some vehicles out on the road today using ethanol blends as high as 85 percent that are hybrid. So you're combining ethanol, lowering the amount of oil that we have to use and refine, and battery technologies at lower speeds: for example, the Ford Escape. 
   Now, let me broach into an area here that I think is important for people to understand because our midterm strategy, at least as I envision it, is going to involve ethanol. And for some reason, ethanol has been blamed for every ill that has occurred globally. There has been severe droughts that have affected rice crops, and yet I read in U.S. papers that that's caused by ethanol. It's baffling how they make this connection, and it's wrong; but yet it seems like ethanol is causing more problems, as related by the media, than President Bush is. Maybe President Bush is happy that ethanol is pushing him off the front page. I don't know. 
   All I know is most of what you're reading about ethanol is completely bogus. And even people in the Corn Husker State are now starting to tell me, We can't rely on ethanol. We're learning that this is bad, because I am paying more at the grocery store. My eggs are more expensive because of ethanol. Huh? Well, okay. Maybe some of the grain-related foods have been impacted by ethanol. 
   I want to show you a few charts here. And by the way, these studies are done by the government. They've been reported in The Wall Street Journal and other major business magazines. 
   First of all, the problem with the higher prices at the grocery store in total is because of increased energy costs. The price per barrel of oil closed short of a $124 today. It's grown dramatically, and ethanol is actually helping with those energy costs. Every report that I have seen, and we will use this chart, has shown that we would be paying much more at the pump today if it were not for the ethanol that we're blending. 
   Here is a chart that shows today's average price at the pump of $3.65. That would be $4.20 at the pump today if we didn't have the ethanol to blend. 
   Now, you're saying, well, that's great but, you know, it's driving up the food costs so I'm actually paying more. Well, that's not true, but we're not hearing about it in our media. 
   The reality is that today, because of ethanol being blended into gasoline and that major difference of what you would pay at the pump, it would be as much as 40 cents more, maybe 60 cents more, according to that information. So actually the consumer is saving around $305 to as much as $420 a year because of ethanol. 
   Now, every study that I have seen has shown that the direct impact of ethanol, that part of the corn crop that's diverted from feed or shipped to be manufactured into food, impacts about 5 cents on a box of cereal. Every study that I have seen from Texas A&M, the government, University of Nebraska has said it is about 3 percent on grain-related foods. 3 percent. But yet you're saving 15 to 20 percent at the pump, and it is helping you in today's world. 
   Now, let's talk about cellulosic. Cellulosic is where you take a biofeed stock, it can be just about any living, growing thing, and you use an extra step in the process to take this and break down the gluten, kind of the glue that holds the cells together, that holds the sugars; and when we are able to dissolve those, then you can extract that and create ethanol. 
   Now this type of ethanol, by the way, has a higher Btu rating and has more energy involved in it. So actually this ethanol goes further for us. 
   What type of products can we use? Well, you can use things like switchgrass. You can use wood pulp. You can use sweet sorghum. You can use anything as long as it's a living, growing organism. You don't have to use food. So that's why it's important. 
   Now, I'm going to say that ethanol is here to stay, but I do believe ethanol, based on corn, is going to hit a ceiling; and so cellulosic, if we can then use these types of bioproducts and create more energy or liquid fuel, then that is more that we can displace. And we will need a complete national energy strategy, and that's why I was curious when Zach Wamp came up here and talked about Lamar Alexander announcing  his energy plan using one of our biolabs that's doing work on the cellulosic area. And I think their focus in that lab has been on switchgrass and wood pulp. And so that will be interesting. 
   But the beauty of cellulosic is not only that it gets us much closer to energy independence but that every region of the country has something to offer, whether it is wood in the northeast or northwest, or algae; switchgrass, and even in my State you can go from switchgrass in the Missouri Valley area where I live to corn to sweet sorghum out in the dry parts because sweet sorghum grows stalks 12 feet tall and requires less than 12 inches of rain. 
   Where are we, and I'm getting back to my friend from Colorado to why we need the higher, the $1, the higher amount for the blending credit. 
   USDA and Department of Energy are partnering together--it's nice to see two of our agencies actually working together--to open up several cellulosic ethanol plants over the next 2 years. They will produce a small amount, maybe 10 million gallons to start with, but if we can't use this product in the market and blend it, because we all know this is first generation so it's going to be expensive. It's going to be about $5.50 a gallon to produce this with the first-generation technology. They will get it down to $3, but if we can't get past this first generation stage, we're never going to get to second, third, fourth generation. So we need that higher level of subsidy or blending credit to make sure that the product that comes out of the new cellulosic ethanol plants is being used within the market. 
   Now, my expectation is while maybe 2 to 3 years from now we're producing maybe 50 million, that's a drop in the barrel, by the way, 50 million gallons; I really think that with this type of a blending credit that we can then double and triple and quadruple and maybe tenfold that 5 to 10 years later. And then we couple that with hybrid and electric technology, and man, I really am optimistic about the future of our country. 
   Now, the gentleman from Colorado, I have one speaker that would like to say a few things. Do you want to take some time right now or let us finish up and you can have some time and I will take 1 minute for close? 
   I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.

   Mr. TERRY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado. 
   In closing, what we're faced with is restricted supply, ever increasing demand on oil products, on oil and gasoline, $124, just shy of $124 per barrel today, and my friends, it's just going to keep going up. And we need a plan to make sure that we protect our economy and your budget. 
   We know that we can't continue to pay these type of prices at the pump. We know that what we're experiencing with our inflation at the grocery store is about 80 percent related to those high costs of energy. 
   We have a solution before us with ethanol, corn-based ethanol. Again, just in a summary here, the ethanol that is blended into the gasoline today is actually making it cheaper. That's allowing you to save more. You're not going to be spending as much on gasoline if it were not for the blend of ethanol in it.     
   The argument that food has increased because of ethanol is not accurate. In fact, these are just several of the publications that have gone on record, Wall Street Journal, CNN, have all said that it's a fallacy that food prices are going up because of ethanol. 
   So net, it's helping our citizens, but the future isn't with corn-based ethanol, it's with cellulosic. Cellulosic is going to supplement this ethanol. And its potential is immense. 
   So I'm proud to learn from the gentleman from Colorado that the dollar producers credit--I think I called it blenders credit a couple of times during the statement--but that 101 producers credit, coupled with the blending credit, is what's going to lift cellulosic ethanol for us into the market and make it a viable way that we can secure our independence from the OPEC producers. 
   Knowing that that is in the farm bill conference report, I feel comfortable, then, not instructing the farm conference, especially since there is no more conference. 
   I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my motion to instruct.

   Mr. TERRY. Yesterday, OPEC met. OPEC decided to cut production because they were frustrated that the price per barrel was nearing the $100 per barrel price. My goodness. What a tragedy for them. Isn't it a problem for this country that we rely so heavily on foreign oil? OPEC controls the majority of oil production. Our energy policy should not have to be begging OPEC for more production. 
   Yesterday, our electric company that serves my district announced they're raising the rates because the train company that hauls the coal to them had to raise their rates because the price of diesel fuel has gone up so much. So the electrical rates of every consumer, every household in Omaha, is going to have double digit inflation on their electric bill. 
   Please, Mr. Speaker, let the madness stop. Let's do a real energy bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (DEMOCRATS ATTEMPT TO NATIONALIZE HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Madam Speaker, I think most of us as Republicans want to be able to provide health care access to low-income uninsured children, but that is not the issue or the bill that comes to the floor today. As we have heard from many of the speakers, it is to cover all children despite income levels and despite whether or not they are currently enrolled in a health insurance plan. 
   In fact, one of the Republican amendments that was denied in the Rules Committee and we cannot bring to the floor today is a measure that would say if you are currently enrolled in health insurance, you are not eligible to participate in SCHIP. That is denied, and that is just one piece of evidence that we are going to bring out today showing that this is an attack on private health insurance coverage and the attempt to nationalize health care.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to state that I believe that we should cover our low-income uninsured children, and I do believe we should make efforts to get them all in. If it was just that, we would be all in agreement. But that is not before us today. And I do believe that part of this attacks health insurance as we know it today. 
   Number one, they defund Medicare Advantage, which is where people can opt out of Medicare and actually go into a managed program by a health insurance company. So they defund that, attacking that. 
   Next is, for the first time, they are going to place a tax on health insurance policies, driving up the costs, so making it more unaffordable so more people drop out. 
   Then probably just as egregious as the other, an amendment that was denied, a Republican amendment, that says if there is a child that is eligible by the requirements but already insured can't drop that insurance or their insurer can't drop them, forcing them to go into the State-run free health insurance. That was denied. 
   So what we see here is a step-by-step process of making health insurance companies less effective and nationalizing health care.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Let me say from the outset: I am strongly opposed to violent crimes committed against an individual, regardless of the motivation of the person committing it. That is why I support strong state and local prosecution measures to curb violent crime and increase safety in our communities. In fact, I am a principal supporter in Congress for increasing Federal funding for state and local law enforcement officers to curb gang and drug crimes, which often leads to violent crimes. 
   I have also spent considerable time in my district meeting with groups who have experienced discrimination or have been targets of violent behavior simply due to their race, religion or sexual orientation. The concerns they have raised with me have weighed heavily on my mind, and have caused me to reconsider my views on our Constitution's Tenth Amendment. 
   In the past, I have not supported Federal hate crimes legislation since it has traditionally been the responsibility of state and local prosecutors rather than the Federal Government. States have the right to apprehend and prosecute criminals under their own criminal codes, which must be respected. They also have the right to enhance penalties as they see fit, and many states have taken that step. My own state of Nebraska enacted comprehensive hate crimes legislation in 1997. 
   The Nebraska legislation authorizes judges to impose harsher penalties in criminal cases when a determination is made that the crime was committed due to the victim's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability or because of his or her association with persons who fit the specified classifications. The enhanced penalties for hate crimes provided for in the statute would be the next highest penalty classification above the one statutorily imposed for the crime, with the death penalty as the only exception. A broad variety of criminal charges could be enhanced, including manslaughter, assault, terroristic threats, stalking, kidnapping, false imprisonment, sexual assault of an adult or child, arson, criminal mischief, and criminal trespass. Our state statutes also provide victims with the authority to bring civil actions against attackers. 
   The actions taken by Nebraska and so many other states are appropriate because the states have the ability to expand their criminal codes as each sees fit. At the same time, there is no Federal nexus and thus no need for duplicative Federal legislation. 
   The Tenth Amendment is clear: ``The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.'' At some point, we have to stop federalizing every problem in the country, no matter how large or small. When the states are addressing a problem effectively, there is  no need for the Federal Government to add an extra layer of bureaucracy. Crime and punishment, with few exceptions, are in the purview of state legislative authority. I am unwilling to interfere with that constitutional balance, no matter how worthy the underlying subject matter might be. For these reasons, I must oppose H.R. 1592.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act of 2007. 
   This bipartisan legislation will benefit nearly one million disadvantaged children nationwide  by expanding Head Start's focus on school readiness. Low-income children will be taught key early learning skills such as alphabet, number, color and shape recognition to help them succeed in their school years. 
   This bill also opens poor-performing Head Start programs to greater public scrutiny and needful competition. Triennial program reviews by the Federal government and independent investigation by the Government Accountability Office have revealed that some Head Start programs operate with Federal tax dollars despite chronic financial mismanagement, health and safety concerns, and poor community involvement. 
   H.R. 1429 would help remedy this situation by requiring Head Start programs to demonstrate active partnerships with local school districts to ensure smooth transitions for children into kindergarten. Poor-performing programs would be opened to competition every 5 years. Annual disclosures of financial information and greater participation of parents in the decisions of Head Start governing boards will also make a difference. 
   I have personally seen the benefits of partnering local school districts with Head Start. Several years ago, a long-standing Head Start program serving 1,000 children in Douglas County, Nebraska was transferred to the control of the Omaha Public School District to end long-standing financial mismanagement and safety concerns for children. 
   Omaha Public Schools went the extra mile by partnering with EduCare, an outstanding private preschool program that involves the entire family, emphasizes best practices, and focuses on early learning skills to help disadvantaged children succeed in school and life. 
   EduCare was created by Susie Buffett and currently serves 239 children from Omaha families living below the poverty level. Families must either work, be in job training, or attending school to qualify. Enrollment is free, with costs covered by the Nebraska Department of Education, Omaha Public Schools, the Department of Health and Human Services and private sources. 
   EduCare has a low child-to-adult ratio: three infants per adult, and six preschoolers per adult. Bachelor level staff members are trained in early childhood education, and the program contains strong academic components to help children succeed in school, including limited english proficiency children. 
   Buffett has said: ``We look at the whole entire family, not just the child.'' Parents are directed to community resources to improve home life, such as food shelters and Christmas toy drives. Single mothers are helped with transportation and job searches. 
   Prelimary evaluation data indicates that the EduCare program is making a significant difference in the lives of children. Upon 
   entering the program, children's language, literacy and social emotional areas of development are assessed. Most children initially score in the borderline range of development. Annual assessment results have shown the majority of participating children gained more vocabulary words in the course of the school year than one would expect based on maturity. 
   By the time they transitioned to kindergarten, EduCare's children were scoring very close to the national average. Standardized assessments of children's literacy and kindergarten readiness skills show similar results. Because research has shown children's vocabulary and pre-literacy skills to predict later school success, every Head Start program should help children reach such strong learning potential while addressing the short and long-term needs of the child's family. EduCare is an incredible success story in the lives of low-income children. 
   I also want to draw the attention of my colleagues to a provision of this bill to protect Head Start for children of military families. The privatization of military housing created an artificial raise in a military family's income, making their children ineligible for Head Start. H.R. 1429 would disregard the Basic Housing Allowance from a family's income when determining Head Start eligibility. Servicemembers protecting our freedom need not worry about their children's continued access to Head Start. 
   Mr. Chairman, I hope we can go even further in the future to strengthen the academic emphasis in Head Start and give states and excellent programs such as EduCare a greater ability to improve the lives of low-income children and their families. H.R. 1429 makes good progress in this direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the process used by the majority party to write and debate the bill under consideration today. 
   Ranking minority members were not consulted on this legislation or provided an opportunity for input. In fact, most of the majority party's own members had no input in this process. Appropriations Committee Chairman DAVID OBEY instead directed his staff members to write major budget legislation behind closed doors without involving elected Members of Congress. It appears staff members of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman BOB BYRD conducted negotiations on behalf of the Senate. 
   As reported in CongressDaily AM today, ``most of the negotiations were conducted by staff.'' This information came from Chairman OBEY, who also said that Members of Congress only became involved in the negotiations ``when matters became difficult.'' Let me repeat that: Unelected congressional staff for Chairmen OBEY and BYRD conducted negotiations on 9 of 11 major spending bills that make up the annual budget of the United States Government. 
   Why do we have an Appropriations Committee if the committee members have no input in the appropriations process? I propose the next legislation this Congress should debate is a bill to dissolve the House Appropriations Committee. It is clearly unnecessary since major budget negotiations can be conducted by staff instead of elected Members. Apparently, the Appropriations Committee consists entirely of Chairman OBEY, who can single-handedly dictate the legislative process and assign his staff to take the place of elected Members of Congress. 
   Handing responsibilities for major budget negotiations to congressional staff for Chairmen OBEY and BYRD is an abdication of responsibility. It also sets the stage for corruption on many levels. These staff-level negotiations were unknown to the public and the majority of elected Members. I am deeply concerned that damage and corruption to our laws will occur if Members of Congress are not thoroughly involved in the creation of legislation and knowledgable about the contents of bills brought to a vote. 
   In addition, allowing only 1 hour of debate and no opportunity for amendments on major $463.5 billion legislation that Members had only 1 day to review is further evidence of the majority party's lack of consideration for our system of government and the responsibilities of elected Members. I also wish Congress had completed the budget process last year, but this fact does not excuse the closed process used to write H.J. Res. 20 this week. 
   I sincerely hope the majority party will begin including elected Members of Congress in the process of lawmaking, as the Constitution intended, and as the American people rightly expect. Our system of government of the people, for the people, and by the people depends upon our ability to work together to accomplish the business of the American people. I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me in calling for a return to the regular committee process and more fair and open debate of legislation with opportunities to offer amendments.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Con. Res 63. Our troops have made tremendous sacrifices in waging war against Islamic extremists who not only want to deny freedom to their fellow countrymen but remain committed to attacking America and our way of life. 
   We have lost some of the bravest, most dedicated and committed Americans we have been honored to know, love, and mourn. They deserve the highest honor and respect from this Congress and the American people for their service. Those brave men and women still in harm's way have earned the right to come home as quickly as possible. 
   This does not mean, however, that we should abandon this mission and leave Iraq to certain failure by prematurely pulling out our troops, nor should we cut military funding or adopt nonbinding resolutions that embolden our enemies and undermine our troop morale. 
   Now, that last statement has been accused by many speakers on the Democrat side as being a red herring to chase the American public away from the attention of this addition of 20,000 troops. But I read their authored resolution. And the words are that you support and protect members of the Armed Services who are serving, are serving or have served, which means that they will not support our troops, any uniformed member that is newly sent to Iraq, whether it is for training the Iraqi troops, whether to be embedded and help them, or any capacity. So the next logical step from their own wording of this resolution is to cut funding. That is the only way to stop supporting any new military member that goes to Iraq. 
   So we have to ask, how will they do that? Now, I believe the Iraqi Government needs our assistance to restore security and prevent a descent into anarchy and civil war, or, worse yet, a heightened foreign insurgency that results in terrorist control of that nation. 
   The situation in the Middle East is a powder keg that will explode if the United States abandons it. The resolution under debate today offers no military or diplomatic solutions apart from expressing disapproval over the plan to increase troops that will help train the Iraqis to go to the front and take more responsibilities to securing Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, in 2002, over 6 years ago, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs completed an independent study recommending that the Omaha, Nebraska general area of Eastern Nebraska be selected as the site for a new national veterans' cemetery. That cemetery was to be built no later than 2005. As we stand here today, there has been no decision or authorization for a national veterans' cemetery in Eastern Nebraska. 
   The State of Nebraska, the Governor and the legislature has determined a site in Sarpy County right next to Offutt Air Force Base as the site for this national veterans' cemetery. One of the issues supposedly that is delaying this cemetery is that, pursuant to the last census, we are a few thousand short of the requisite 170,000 that reside in a 75-mile radius, although Nebraska statistics differ with that census agreement, showing that we more than amply exceed that 170,000 within a 75-mile radius. 
   What this amendment does is allows us to include some contiguous counties, because what you have is a mass  populace within a small area around Offutt Air Force Base. But then, as you spread out, the population becomes far less dense. 
   So in order here to comply, this amendment includes contiguous counties to get within the U.S. Census that the Veterans Administration is using to block the building of this national cemetery. So I am here tonight to make sure that the promise is kept to the veterans of the Eastern Nebraska, Western Iowa, Northwest Missouri area. 
   As we know, our veterans population is aging. They are passing away. And I hear from their families quite often that they would prefer to be buried in a veterans' cemetery without having to travel 6 hours to the nearest Nebraska State veterans' cemetery. 
   So that is the purpose of this amendment, is to keep a promise by the VA and, frankly, the entire delegation, that we are going to fight for a veterans' cemetery that has been promised them. This has been the way that has been recommended. I think it is probably the best way, recognizing the geography of Nebraska.     
   At this point, I will ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. But I would like to work with the people, the appropriations and the veterans' committee to make sure that this promise is kept. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn. 
   There was no objection.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4299, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. This legislation revises and extends the Terrorism Risk Insurance program established under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA). TRIA has been a cornerstone of our Nation's comprehensive response to the events of September 11, 2001, providing a vital and necessary backstop for our insurance industry and its policyholders. 
   I am pleased that H.R. 4299 does not reduce TRIA's complete coverage for nuclear, chemical, biological, and radiological events. It should be noted that workers' compensation insurers are uniquely obligated by state law to provide coverage for these events to their policyholders; for them, especially, it is critical that TRIA provide a backstop for these events as well as for conventional acts of terrorism. 
   It is important that TRIA serve the industry and its policyholders equally. Over the course of TRIA's life, the ``trigger level,'' or threshold of losses insurers must suffer from an act of terrorism before TRIA can kick in, has been raised from $5 million to $100 million. For small- and medium-sized insurers--the majority of the industry--a trigger level of $100 million is too high. As a result, I support the provision which has survived in the House version in H.R. 4299 which returns the trigger level to the 2006 level of $50 million. 
   While I support H.R. 4299, it is important to note a significant omission which also affects our small- and medium-sized insurers and their policyholders. The deductible insurers' must pay under TRIA is potentially cost-prohibitive for these companies. Additionally, this deductible is calculated based on the amount of an insurer's direct earned premium over the previous year. Insurers' deductibles under TRIA should be tied to their capital, not the amount of their liabilities. As a result, I encourage the House to reexamine TRIA in the future to address this issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. I thank my friend, the gentleman from California, as well as the Government Reform Committee, for making sure that this got to the floor in such a timely manner. 
   December 5, 2007: that will be a day forever etched in Omaha's memory as the day a lone gunman took the lives of eight innocent people at the Westroads Mall, the Von Maur store, during the holiday shopping season. But it will also be remembered as a day that revealed the true character of Omaha. 
   Tragedy, no doubt, reveals the true meaning of unity in any community. Although I will never understand the senseless events that took place in my hometown on December 5, I stand here as a proud citizen, Congressman of that district, because it's in times like these it doesn't matter what party you belong to, what your political beliefs are, your race, creed, or color. People come together and they ask what can we do to help the city and the eight innocent people. I think this is not only the spirit of Omaha, or what defines the Omaha area, but also I think it is what exemplifies the spirit of America, and it is that spirit that we remember in each of the victims and the first responders. 
   Let me introduce the eight innocent lives that were lost on that day. There was 53-year-old Dianne Clavin Trent,  described by her family as a gentle, generous, soft-spoken woman who loved the Lord. She loved to shop and was always smiling. She had worked in customer service at Von Maur for about 8 years. 
   We have 65-year-old John McDonald, retired from Northern Natural Gas, whose daughter in fact worked with me in my law office. John was one of the heroes, when he left his place of safety to come out and start yelling, some people described it as rather passionately, at the gunman, to distract him from turning around, and a few feet away was a room where 12 other innocent people were holed up. John was shot. Amazingly, though, he was the last victim before the gunman turned the gun on himself. 
   The next victim, 48-year-old Gary Scharf, who just stopped by Von Maur to pick up some Christmas presents before catching a flight out of Omaha. He grew up on a ranch outside Curtis, Nebraska, where his funeral was held. He was a proud father who leaves behind a 19-year-old son. 
   Fifty-six-old Gary Joy was someone everyone could count on. He loved his job and liked to write poetry. His family followed his instructions to have his organs donated. They say it was just like Gary, to help someone else. His love was with us again, if not only in spirit. 
   There was 36-year-old Angie Schuster, born on Valentine's Day. Her boyfriend planned to give her an engagement ring this Christmas. The priest at her funeral called Angie and her soon-to-be fiance's love the ``real thing.'' 
   We have 67-year-old Janet Jorgensen, who just celebrated her golden anniversary, 50 years of marriage to her husband Ron just a few months ago. She went above and beyond at Van Maur, as there were many times she would shop for customers or deliver items to customers' homes. She was the seamstress and cake-maker of the family; and for her three children and eight grandchildren, she will be missed. 
   There was 47-year-old Beverly Flynn. She took a part-time job at Von Maur because she was a mother of three beautiful girls. She was also a real estate agent, and her trademark was planting rosebushes in the yard of every new homeowner. 
   The youngest victim, 24-year-old Maggie Webb, was the new store manager of Von Maur, one of Omaha's finest department stores. Coworkers described her as one of the nicest people they had ever worked for, someone whose whole face lit up when she smiled. A lot of people will miss her service and smile. 
   Last, I want to thank our first responders. The spirit of Omaha showed itself through the efforts of our first responders. The first phone call from the mall came to 911 dispatchers at 1:42. No voice was on the line. All that was heard were gunshots. What an eerie call. 
   By the time the first responders arrived, just under 6 minutes later, the Omaha sheriff opens the doors and enters the store. What a heroic effort by our police officers, paramedics, firefighters, and others, when they got to the mall and saw such a grisly scene. The images they saw will likely haunt them for the rest of their lives. I thank the men and women who came to face the horror. Thank you for keeping us safe and saving lives. I also want to praise the spirit of Omaha for coming together after this tragedy. 
   In closing, I am deeply saddened by the senseless act from a troubled and disturbed teenager. It's something our city will never forget. It has scarred the very heart of our community. But I am proud of our community for its reaction and the way we came together to support the victims and begin the healing of our city. 
   Thank you once again to Government Reform for allowing this resolution to come forward and be part of the continuing healing in Omaha.

   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today I rise in support of Senate 2484, an act to rename the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development as the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. 
   Ms. Shriver, along with her husband Sargent, was and is a champion for young people who suffer and strive under the extra load of developmental disabilities. Prior to the creation of the NICHD more than 40 years ago, many scientists were of the mind that money would be better off spent studying adult diseases, effectively shortchanging the younger populations with these conditions. 
   NICHD was established in 1962 under the Kennedy administration and many credit Ms. Shriver's tenacity. Ms. Shriver never stopped being a spokesperson and advocate, and the institute she helped found has never stopped benefiting from her determination and her spirit. 
   I would like to confer with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to determine if it is their understanding as well that nothing in this bill will change any of the authorities that the NIH Reform Act of 2006 provided the NIH and the director of the NIH. Specifically, nothing in this act will change any authorities of the Scientific Management Review Board or any other provisions provided in section 401 of that act. Is that your understanding as well?

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (ALS REGISTRY ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of The ALS Registry Act of 2007, originally introduced in May by my colleague Representative Eliot Engel of New York and myself. As the bill comes to the floor, we have been joined by 275 bipartisan cosponsors in support of this important legislation. 
   Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, progressive, neurodegenerative disease affecting motor nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Approximately 5,600 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, each year. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 Americans have the disease. The average life expectancy for a person with ALS is two to five years from the time of diagnosis. There is no known cure for ALS. 
   The most important provision in our bill establishes a national ALS registry. There is currently no single national registry which collects and stores information on the prevalence and incidence of ALS in existence in the United States. The establishment of a national registry will help identify the occurrence and frequency of ALS and other motor neuron disorders and collect data which is badly needed for ALS research, disease management and the development of standards of care in order to significantly enhance the nation's efforts to find a treatment and cure for ALS. 
   A recent article from the New England Journal of Medicine stated that ``approximately 90 percent of the persons with ALS have the sporadic form, which may be caused by the interaction of multiple environmental factors and previously unknown genes.'' The purpose of creating a registry is to identify if there are any geographic, genetic or environmental groups of people that have been diagnosed with this terrible disease. This would then allow scientists a better opportunity to identify any relevant factors. This registry may sound simple on the surface, but it is actually a significant tool in determining the root causes of ALS, which would hopefully lead to diagnostic tests and screenings to see who is susceptible to the disease. 
   Although we know the debilitating effects of ALS, I am moved every year when I am visited by patients and their families in my Washington office. Despite the extremely challenging medical conditions faced by these patients, they make an extraordinary effort to travel to the Capitol and share their stories in the hope that we will soon find effective treatments and a potential cure so that no one like them will have to suffer in the future. The courage shown by ALS patients, as well as their families, is inspiring to me. 
   All diseases bring hardships on those afflicted, but ALS is particularly cruel in the quickness of the onset, the severity of the symptoms and the fatal nature of the condition. The provisions in our bill creating a nationwide registry for persons afflicted with ALS are important steps forward in strengthening the efforts to understand, treat and one day eradicate this terrible disease. I urge my colleagues to support the ALS Registry Act and I am proud to have worked on this very important effort with my friend Mr. Engel. I am also grateful that our committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, took up this legislation and advanced the bill to the floor.

   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I really believe that we need to have our own American-made energy, and we have the resources here. I have been a leading advocate in Energy and Commerce on alternative energies, on wind, solar, geothermal, closed-loop biomass and cellulosic ethanol, and these tax credits, I think, are important in that process. We need to have a complete portfolio that includes alternatives, these types of alternatives. But I have to say that I am disappointed greatly in the fact that we are extending these for 1 year. 
   I have sat down with the leading folks in especially wind energy. And, by the way, let's not confuse these sources that generate electricity with putting fuel in our cars. Most of these generate electricity, like wind. We need it. But they can't take their business plan to the bank on a 1-year tax credit. They said they need at least a 5-year, and prefer a 10-year. 
   If we are very serious about making alternatives part of our energy portfolio, we need a 5- to 10-year plan to extend these tax credits. Otherwise, we are just simply perpetrating a hoax upon the American public that is looking towards Congress to find a way to alleviate the pressures of high gas costs. It is about what they are paying when they pull up to the pumps. So if we are serious about it, let's do a long-term tax credit bill that is actually going to be usable by the folks that want to invest in these alternatives. 
   Yes, we do a little bit better job on solar. I am surprised that they pulled one out and treated that so specially, when all the others are just so meritorious. And, by the way, I am not sure we have gotten to the technology yet where we can have wind panels and solar panels operating our cars for us. They can generate electricity if we want to do a plug-in, but even that we are not doing a long-term plan for.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (MOURNING THE PASSING OF PRESIDENT GERALD RUDOLPH FORD -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late President Gerald R. Ford, who was born in my hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. President Ford will forever be remembered for his great service to the people of the United States of America. He served the people at a complicated and divisive time in our history with honor and distinction. By helping our Nation heal from the political turmoil of Watergate, he helped move us forward. 
   President Ford was a man of selfless actions based in modest, Midwestern values. As a public servant, I am proud of his efforts; as a Nebraskan, I am proud of our President. 
   President Ford was a man who gave up a National Football League career in order to study law and ultimately serve the people in the highest office of public service. His love for our Nation and our American freedoms will live on through our work in Congress and his immortal words, spoken during his 1977 State of the Union Address when he said ``The Constitution is the bedrock of all our freedoms. Guard and cherish it, keep honor and order in your own house, and the republic will endure.'' 
   He was a scholar, an athlete, an honorable President, and an even more honorable American. Our nation will truly miss his leadership, honestly and integrity.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly rise in opposition to this conference report. I do so in spite of my past support for increases in Federal student loan programs and expanded access to college for all young people regardless of their economic status. 
   As a young student at the University of Nebraska and Creighton Law School, I had to rely on student loans and part-time jobs to cover my tuition, books, and living expenses. And I know that for many families that is also the only way their children can afford to meet the rising costs of a college education. That is what I have consistently voted for, increases in Pell grants and the reduction of interest rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. I am also a cosponsor of H.R. 722, a bill to increase the maximum Pell grant award to $4,810 for academic years 2008-2014. 
   There are three reasons why I have decided to vote against this bill. First, this Conference Report provides $22.3 billion in cuts to federal spending, over five years, but then at the same time spends roughly $21.57 billion in that same period time period which amounts to $752 million in deficit reduction. When H.R. 2669 passed in the House, it was estimated to cut spending by $20.38 billion, and spend $17.58 billion, leaving a remainder of $2.79 billion in deficit reduction. Unfortunately, much of the spending in the Conference Report goes towards five new entitlement programs and graduates of college rather than current students. 
   The second reason that I cannot support this legislation is that many of its provisions will drive private sector lending companies out of the market place, reducing the choices for student borrowers and eventually making the U.S. Department of Education the lending option of last resort. That is probably the intended purpose. A government agency replacing the free market. 
   In addition to reducing loan rates, it reduces the level of insurance that private lenders can use to off-set student loan defaults, and makes other cuts that will reduce incentives to remain in the student loan business. 
   It also eliminates the exceptional performer incentive program for good lenders who help students restructure their loan agreements if they are having trouble meeting their loan payments. Also, loan origination fees for lenders would be increased. All of these punitive provisions will reduce the number of private sector student loan firms thus reducing student loan choices for students. I also believe private capital working with the secondary markets creates more dollars to offer students than does the U.S. Department of Education. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, even though the conference report contains savings that pay for the many new entitlement programs created by the legislation, at the end of 5 years, the American taxpayers will be asked to pay the entire cost of these new programs. History tells us that once a Federal entitlement program is created, it will not die. We cannot afford to create another unchecked Federal entitlement spending program that will only contribute to the future inflation of college costs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this conference report.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 1086, acknowledging May 6 through May 12, 2008, as National Nurses Week. In addition to kicking off National Nurses Week today, we are also celebrating the comforts and care that nurses provide by recognizing May 6 as National Nurses Day. This tradition started in 1982 when President Ronald Reagan signed a proclamation making today National Recognition Day for Nurses. 
   This is a week to recognize nurses as being the largest single component of the health care profession with over 2.5 million registered nurses in the United States and the critical role they play in providing care to not only the citizens of America but are also serving our Nation in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition to the immediate care they provide to patients, they also have helped to educate, inform and improve education and retention of nurses. 
   I would like to thank the author of this resolution, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, for her leadership in honoring nurses that have helped promote health, prevent disease and help other Americans cope with illness. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this legislation and urge my colleagues to oppose it. 
   I am a strong supporter of economic development in rural America. That is why I have been pressing for reform of the Universal Service Fund to bring the benefits of broadband telecommunications to the rural areas of the country. I also strongly support the programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and our State Department of Agriculture that promote economic growth in Nebraska. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I cannot support this bill. The State of Nebraska already participates in the existing Northern Great Plains Commission and the North Central BioEconomic Consortium. I am told by Nebraska's Deputy Director of Agriculture that there are even more of these organizations in the Midwest dedicated to the same goals. H.R. 3246 would just add one more entity to this existing number of economic development groups now in place. 
   Even more troubling is the $1.25 billion price tag authorized by the bill and the creation of permanent regional commissions that will require millions of dollars in tax dollars for administrative expenses. We need to cut federal spending, not increase it. 
   Finally, the legislation also includes a provision requiring prevailing wages under the Davis-Bacon Act. For all of these reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2829, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I rise not only in opposition to the rule, but respectfully request that my colleagues join me in voting ``no'' on the previous question. 
   I have drafted an amendment that would freeze our salaries for this year, much like we voted to do in the last year. We are not going to have the opportunity then to have a straight-up vote on that amendment during this appropriations bill. So our one opportunity to voice our opinion on the COLA, the cost-of-living increase, which is somewhere probably around 2.5 percent, I don't know the number itself, but that happens automatically unless we have a straight-up vote to suspend it, and we are going to be denied that opportunity. So I respectfully request that all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle join me in voting against the previous question. 
   Now, let me state some of the reasons why I think it is important that we freeze our salaries again for next year. 
   First of all, I don't think we deserve it. Our approval rating with the American public is 14 percent, according to Gallup, the lowest in the history of polling. Obviously we are doing something wrong if the people have such little confidence in us. 
   I think there are a variety of reasons why the people have less confidence in us now than they even did last year, and I think one is because of maybe the viciousness and the partisanship is probably at an all-time record high. We have our political opponents that think we are down and want to put their heels on our throats and keep us that way, and I am not sure that is what the American people want. 
   But then let's look at effectiveness. In the major bills that have come through the House of Representatives, the congressional leadership, and I say that in toto, House and Senate, have gotten very few bills to the White House for signature. In fact, we have done a variety of resolutions and bills, many of them condemning what Republicans had done in the past. But out of 60 bills that have gone through the House in our first 6 months, since January 4, 2 have been signed into law, and that is it. 
   Now, if we were on a baseball team, and we hit 2 out of 60, or less than 1 percent, a .033 percentage, we would be sent down to Single A ball for such a pathetic percentage. So we are not performing well enough to deserve it. 
   Now, I do want to bring up one other aspect. Usually what happens with the cost-of-living increase is we have a token vote on the previous question, and there is an arrangement basically for the votes to be there to allow the previous question to go forward for the rule, with a gentleman's agreement that those who vote ``yes'' won't have to pay for it in the elections. But the reality of that is that is off the table. 
   This is just one of the many ads run against Republican incumbents who voted for the previous question last year. This is paid for by the Democrat Congressional Committee against Incumbents Who Vote for the Previous Question. 
   So I think it is important to warn everyone that comes here that is going to vote on the previous question, which is the vote for a congressional pay freeze for our next year's salaries, that if you are a Republican, DCCC is going to run ads against you, and since that agreement is off the table, if you are on my friend's side of the aisle over here, the Democrat side, the agreement is off also if you vote for it. Maybe the Republican National Congressional Committee will be running ads against you for voting for a pay raise, and maybe it is because we haven't made the Bush cuts permanent that will raise taxes on American families, or maybe it is just because of the lack of productivity in the House that protects our families. There are a variety of reasons. 
   But the reality is there is no such agreement left, folks. Vote against the previous question and protect yourself.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity. 
   Let's look at this in perspective. 
   We just learned from Mr. Shimkus that over the lifetime of ANWR, if we just opened up that area to produce, that we could provide revenues of up to $192 billion on the lease bids and royalties. And we always seem to be looking, at least the bills that keep coming forward from our friends from the other side of the aisle, from the majority, always seem to be trying to raise revenues. And certainly the $6 billion per year that we could get just from the ANWR royalties in bids would pay for the GI Bill that they're going to raise taxes for tomorrow. 
   Not only is this a bonus that we raise revenue. By the way, we have a deficit that we're running. So I think where we can raise revenues without raising taxes is somewhere we could look. 
   But over the weekend, I had the opportunity to sit down with a trucking company in Omaha. They were telling me that the average price of diesel across the Nation is $4.50. It's costing them almost a dollar per mile. What does that mean to the consumers? Well, it means that your family budget is going in the tank, literally. That means that when you go to the grocery store, that you're paying higher prices for food, not because some portion of corn is being used for ethanol; what it means is that the transportation costs of the food from the farm to the grocery stores is so high and is being absorbed in the prices at the grocery store. 
   So that's why your milk is going up, that's why the eggs have gone up, that's why your grain-related foods, like cereals and bread, have gone up. Yes, we need to focus on demand here. But we can also win-win by focusing on supply. 
   Let's do the right thing. And good job, Mr. Ryan.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. I appreciate you yielding me the time. 
   I rise today to pay tribute to four boys who lost their lives after a tornado destroyed their Boy Scout camp near Little Sioux, Iowa, on Wednesday, June 11. And as the gentlelady from North Carolina mentioned, it was a string of storms all the way from Iowa through Omaha, Nebraska, all the way down into Manhattan, Kansas. 
   The boys were at this camp in Little Sioux, Iowa, Boy Scout camp, learning leadership skills and were definitely on the right path to be leaders in their future endeavors. Unfortunately, their lives were cut short by a fierce and destructive storm, an F-3 tornado. 
   Interestingly, it was just the day before where the Scouts practiced how to react to a disaster like a tornado, and we can be very proud of the Scouts and how they acted after the storm. 
   This tornado killed four boys, injured almost 50 others. Killed in the storm was 13-year-old Ben Petrzilka, 13-year-old Sam Thomsen, and Josh Fennen. Those three boys were all from Omaha. Ironically, all three of them were only a few miles from where my wife and my family live. 
   Ben Petrzilka has been described as a caring and a natural leader. He was a member of Boy Scout Troop 448 and earned more than 20 merit badges, truly amazing. 
   Sam Thomsen was born more than 3 months premature, adopted by a caring and loving family. They called Sam their ``miracle boy.'' His pastor said he was ``great kid'' and always had a smile on his face. 
   Josh Fennen, a great student and hard worker as he was described by his school principal, had a knack for exploring and was a natural leader. 
   Aaron Eilerts was a member of Boy Scout Troop 108 in Humboldt, Iowa, loved music, especially Elvis. For merit badges, he created pillowcases for local hospitals and made blankets for the humane society. He truly lived the Boy Scout Oath of: ``On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help others at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.'' 
   All of these boys lived the Scout Oath, something their family, friends and fellow Scouts can be extremely proud of. I know I am. 
   I'm proud of all the Scouts and how they reacted. The stories of heroism from these four fallen boys' colleagues are truly moving. 
   So God bless them, their families and Scouts everywhere.

   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to rise in favor of House Resolution 353, which is sponsored by the gentleman from Maryland, Elijah Cummings. He has worked steadfastly on this issue that affects an approximate 2 million Americans currently diagnosed with prostate cancer, and I commend him on his work. 
   House Resolution 353 supports the development and innovative advances of using imaging technologies when detecting and treating prostate cancer. 
   Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in America and takes the lives of nearly 28,000 American men each year. Over a lifetime, that is one out of every six males will fall victim to this silent killer. 
   Early prostate cancer usually has no symptoms and is commonly detected through prostate cancer screening tests such as the PSA blood test and DRE. The chance of being diagnosed with prostate cancer increases rapidly after the age of 50. The most likely risk factors that are associated to prostate cancer are age and family history of the disease. 
   In addition to the PSA blood test and DRE, imaging is another useful tool that can help with the detection and treatment of the disease. It is important for men to take advantage of prostate screening exams which could yield early detection when the disease is still curable. 
   I urge my fellow Members to support House Resolution 353.

   Mr. TERRY. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in favor of H. Con. Res. 163, which is sponsored by the gentlewoman from New Mexico, HEATHER WILSON. She has worked diligently on this issue and has helped raise public awareness for the 10,000 to 40,000 approximate Americans currently diagnosed with Dandy-Walker syndrome. I commend her on her work with H. Con. Res. 163 and support further research and activities to increase public awareness, professional education, diagnosis, and treatment of Dandy-Walker syndrome and hydrocephalus. 
   Currently, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the NIH conducts and supports a wide range of studies that explore the complex mechanisms of normal brain development. The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding abnormal brain development and offers hope for new ways to treat and prevent developmental brain disorders such as Dandy-Walker syndrome. 
   Dandy-Walker syndrome is a congenital brain malformation that can appear dramatically or develop unnoticed. Symptoms, which often occur in early infancy, include slow motor development and progressive enlargement of the skull. In older children, symptoms of increased intracranial pressure such as irritability, vomiting, and convulsions, and signs of cerebellar dysfunction such as unsteadiness, lack of muscle coordination, or jerky movements of the eyes may occur. Other symptoms include increased head circumference, bulging at the back of the skull, problems with the nerves that control the eyes, face and neck, and abnormal breathing patterns. Dandy-Walker syndrome is frequently associated with disorders of other areas of the central nervous system, and subnormal intelligence is manifested in 41 to 71 percent of the patients. 
   Treatment for the one in every 25,000 to 35,000 individuals diagnosed with Dandy-Walker syndrome generally consists of treating the associated problems with a special tube to drain off excess fluid inside the skull. This will reduce intracranial pressure and help control the swelling. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to recognize the outstanding research that the NIH has conducted and commend them on their efforts to gain more insight into brain disorders such as Dandy-Walker syndrome and hydrocephalus. I, again, congratulate the gentlelady from New Mexico, Heather Wilson, and the gentleman from Maryland in their interests in helping these folks and bringing this resolution to the floor today. 
   I reserve the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Madam Chairman, I rise to express my opposition to H.R. 3524, the HOPE VI Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2007. 
   After speaking with the Omaha Housing Authority in my District, I have been informed that the changes in the bill are overly prescriptive and potentially burdensome for the community of Omaha. 
   In particular the one-for-one replacement of public housing units that is required under this bill is simply not feasible. This legislation requires one-for-one replacement of units that are demolished under the proposed plan on the original site or within the jurisdiction of the public housing authority. H.R. 3524 also mandates that one-third of the units that are constructed as a part of the mixed-income community revitalization plan remain public housing units. 
   One particular area where the Omaha Housing Authority would like to apply a HOPE IV grant to is the Pleasant View area. I am told that there are 190 units in Pleasant View that are in need of demolition, however, with the overly burdensome regulation of the one-to-one replacement requirement prescribed in this bill, the OHA would not be able to feasibly perform this demolition. These units are currently not occupied, so with the inclusion of Mr. Neugebauer's amendment we would at least have some relief in this area. 
   I commend my colleague, Randy Neugebauer, for his amendment that would apply the one-to-one replacement requirement for units demolished under this program only to units that are occupied prior to demolition. 
   Another very problematic change for the Housing Authority in Omaha included in this legislation would be the compliance with the Green Communities rating system. As you know, this legislation requires the proposed revitalization plan to comply with the mandatory and non-mandatory items of the National Green Community checklist for residential construction and the mandatory and non-mandatory components of version 2.2 of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building system for New Construction and Major Renovations. 
   The mandatory green building requirements for Green Communities and the U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) will drive up development costs and threaten the viability of this important housing program in Omaha reducing the actual number of units that can be built. 
   Because of the vital importance of protecting housing affordability and keeping green building flexible, functional and effective, I will be voting against this bill as is and urge a ``no'' vote to my colleagues.

   Mr. Chairman, as a representative of a farm State, one of the leading ethanol producers in the United States and proud to be part of this new movement of using renewable fuels to lessen our dependence on foreign oil, and I think it is important that we broaden our portfolio of fuels so that we can meet our ultimate goals of energy independence. 
   Now, there has always been, particularly with two States, California and New York, a traditional, and I have to admit I do not understand the depth or the reason behind those States' bias toward biofuels, but I find it odd as we stand here today trying to promote biofuels to lessen our dependence that we now have a secondary amendment that puts some restrictions on the use of biofuels that will actually slow the promotion of biofuels. I think it is odd the contradictory nature of let us have a biofuels bill, but then let us put in amendments that will eventually slow it. 
   Make no bones about this, this secondary amendment is an attempt to slow down the process of rolling out biofuels. It is a poison pill to a reasonable approach to the issue, the base bill from Burgess and Ferguson. 
   If you represent a State that is a major player or a player in biofuels production, you will want to vote against this poison pill amendment.

   The gentleman from Massachusetts is really one of my heroes on the floor, and I really appreciate and respect his sense of humor. 
   With that, the silliness in this that I see is the silliness when about a year ago, during the height of the energy crunch, a member of the Kennedy clan, who was not a Member of Congress, flew to New York on his private jet to talk about conservation of energy and global warming. It reminds me of the silliness of those who ride in limousines to and from their dinner engagements while whining about mothers using SUVs to drive. That is the type of silliness that I see in this debate. It isn't just about having a plane for security, it is the opulence of the plane that is at discussion.  
   But I have got to tell you, I see something deeper in this than the type of plane, and that is comments published in the San Francisco Chronicle, made by the subcommittee chairman of Appropriations on Defense such as: ``Don't need to put pressure on them, just tell them what they need to do.'' This gentleman is the one that has been bidding for our Speaker on what type of plane. 
   Then when this became a story, mentioned also, I guess, with some sort of pride that was also quoted in many newspapers, CNN, San Francisco Chronicle, reminding the Defense Department that it is them that will make the decisions on appropriations, leaving the insinuation that if the correct plane is not given to the Speaker, that they will cut the Defense Department. 
   Now, I see the gentleman from Pennsylvania is in our Chamber, and I would yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania to explain which part of the defense budget he intends to cut or not appropriate if she does not get this specific plane that she wants. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.

Mr. Speaker, I will help answer the gentlewoman from California; in the sense that this is a decent bill, but it could be much better if it was brought through a regular order where we were allowed to participate and offer improvements by way of amendments. But the process has been shut down to us, and that is why we are upset. We can make a decent bill better if given the chance. It was brought up on suspension with the intended purpose of forbidding us from offering any amendments to make it better. 
   And I just want to say that MARK STEVEN KIRK, JOHN SHADEGG, and myself, we have been very concerned about people who have violated the people's trust, accepted bribes, broken the law, and getting their pension. That is why all three of us joined together over a year ago and offered bills; but yet the bill that has been brought up today isn't one of the Republican bills. Is that civility? I doubt it. 
   Now, the interesting part is, after working with the Speaker a year ago, it was brought up for a vote, and almost all of the Democrat leadership and 173 other Members of the Democrat Party voted against the bill that they are now saying, well, geez, it is your bill that you brought up a long time ago. 
   But there is one area I have amendments prepared, because I thought when we were going to get here that we would go through regular order. And one of them was solicitation of a bribe, which is not part of this. 
   Mr. Speaker, can I enter into a colloquy with the author of the bill, the gentlewoman from Kansas? My inquiry to her would be, why did you not offer solicitation of the bribe when you authored this piece of legislation? Solicitation is not in there.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (PROVIDING FOR REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I hope the American public sees the irony in the votes that we are going to take this afternoon and evening. Before us now we are going to take a vote to pull out of Iraq immediately. Then, right after that, we are going to take a vote to fund the troops so they can stay a while. 
   So I guess the only difference between the House Democrats today and Senator Kerry a year ago, where he voted for Iraq before he voted against Iraq, is that our friends get to do it all in the same day. 
   Now, the other irony that I thought was interesting today is that we had a visitor, the deputy prime minister of Iraq, that was coming here with a message of what is really going on in Iraq. And he met with a group of us this morning in HC-9, separated only by a thin wall to the caucus that was occurring with our friends from the other side of the aisle where they were plotting the strategy of how to get out of Iraq. 
   I think it shows one of the differences between the two parties where we are meeting with the government officials on how to get them stood up, how do we strengthen the government there so they can take over their own operations without falling to the al Qaeda; at the same time, our friends are plotting on the other side to pull out and abandon them. 
   I think the day is just full of ironies, and I hope that the general public gets to see those today.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (HEALTH CENTERS RENEWAL ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Thank you, and I, too, rise in support of our community health centers and the reauthorization. 
   We have two in my district in Omaha. We have the One World Health Center. It used to be known as the Chicano Awareness Center, but now it has kind of created a new name and new marketing in the sense that it really helps all of our community, and then in the north Omaha community we have the Charles Drew Center. 
   I frequent these facilities, meeting with their physicians who work there and their directors, and every time I have been impressed with the high quality of the health care that they provide for our communities. They are first-rate. Both of them are in brand new buildings that can rival any physicians' offices anywhere else in the metropolitan Omaha community. 
   And I think these health centers really are key in our try to provide universal health care or at least access for everybody so those that have minimal insurance or no insurance can show up at our community health centers and receive first-class medical care. And that is one of the major reasons why I stand in support. 
   Now, just quickly here, I feel compelled from listening to some of the testimony from a previous bill, we had a speaker that stood up and talked about how it was the White House or George Bush's fault that we have to import more oil during his administration.     
   And of course that does appear to be our energy policy. But keep in mind that this House has voted, in the 10 years I've been here, at least I think eight or nine times to open up either offshore or Alaska oil, which has been shut down on every attempt. We've been able to pass it a handful of times; it has either been vetoed or blocked within the Senate. 
   So if you aren't allowed to use American supply of energy, of course the only alternative is to import more. I'm personally embarrassed that our administration is going to the Middle East and begging for them to increase production. What that shows, to me, is they're giving up on the fact that we should be using more of our own American resources. And we can do that. We should open up offshore. We should open Alaska. We should open up the oil shale in Colorado. 
   Now, what the public should know is, just in the last 6 months, back in November-December, this House voted to take the oil shale in Colorado and Wyoming off limits to oil companies to be able to extract oil from there. We made it so you cannot extract that oil.

   Mr. TERRY. Just 2 weeks ago, this House voted to ban the military from using synthetic aviation fuel made from coal, also known as coal-to-liquid. So here's another alternative energy source that we could use to provide aviation fuel not only to the military, but to the civilian side, that would be stable, reliable, no cost fluctuations like you see because of the oil markets. But yet this House voted 2 weeks ago to say no to using that source for fuel. So of course if we're going to limit every source of energy in this country, you have no other place to go. 
   Last week, I rolled out a plan at home that showed if we allowed all of our resources to be used from the conservation from new vehicles and tax credits to help consumers purchase them, we open up offshore oil shale in Alaska, as well as the alternative, we can become energy independent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank the Speaker and Mr. Green and the committee for bringing this forward in such a timely manner. 
   This is an important act. This bill reflects a bipartisan effort, strengthened by the leadership of Mr. Towns, who provides the necessary funding for the poison control centers to continue their lifesaving work. I must say that in writing this bill, I enjoyed working with Mr. Towns and his staff and appreciate all of their help and cooperation. 
   The poison control center located in Omaha is the designated poison control center for Nebraska, Wyoming, and, amazingly, American Samoa and the Federated States of Micronesia. It is one of the oldest poison control centers in the United States, established in 1957. It's one of fifty-two poison control centers in the United States certified as a regional poison control center by the American Association of Poison Control Centers and operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with full information and treatment capabilities. The majority of funding is provided by the Nebraska Med Center, Creighton University Medical Center, and the University of Nebraska. 
   In 2007, 61 poison control centers located throughout the United States played a critical role in saving lives by responding to 4 million calls. Poison control centers are staffed by medical professionals 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. These professionals are trained with the knowledge needed to assess poison risk, advise treatment and/or triage patients, recommend a treatment, or refer them to appropriate medical facilities.  
   Poisoning is the second leading form of unintentional death in the United States, and an estimated 60 percent of those exposures are experienced by children under the age of 6. Calls received by poison control centers addressed chemical, biological, and nuclear exposure, as well as adverse reactions to pesticides, cleaning products, and other hazardous products. 
   This bill provides the funding needed to authorize the poison center national toll-free number, national media campaign, and the State grant program to provide assistance for poison prevention. This legislation not only saves lives but saves millions of dollars a year in preventable medical expenses. A report by the Institute of Medicine concludes that the Nation's poison control centers yielded $7 in savings for every $1 invested. In 2005 alone, poison control centers saved Federal health programs an estimated $525 million. 
   I encourage my colleagues to examine this bill and join us in support of this bill and the lifesaving work of poison control centers across the country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. 
   As I mentioned in my first statement, my opening statement, this is a bipartisan effort. Once again, I want to thank Mr. Towns. 
   I have the floor statement of our ranking member, Joe Barton, who is also in support of this bill, and I will read in significant part his statement. 
   He states: ``As our primary defense against injury and death from poisoning, poison control centers are a vital part of our health care system in the United States. Few people realize poisoning is the second most common form of unintentional death in the United States. In 2005 there were over 26,000 deaths in the United States caused by the ingestion of poisons that resulted from approximately 5 million incidents of poison exposure. And without question, the number of deaths and debilitating injuries resulting from poisoning would be significantly higher if it weren't for the strong network of poison centers we already have, and with the passage of the legislation before us today, I am confident that we can make a great program even better.'' 
   And thanks to all of the efforts from the members of the Energy and Commerce Committee in making this a great bipartisan bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the recognition. 
   This is a rather simple and focused amendment that recognizes that our Homeland Security Department has had difficulties communicating to its partners. My Governor called me last year when the press showed up in his office and wanted an answer about a grant and no one had notified the Governor's office. We contacted the National Governor's Association, NGA, and found out that this is a very deep and epidemic problem with our Department of Homeland Security. 
   So all that we are asking in this amendment is that in regard to grants that affect the State, that the State be put into the communication loop so when reporters show up at their office asking for comment, they actually know what the reporters are talking about. 
   I think it is egregious that reporters get to be notified sooner than the grant recipient or the State that was denied the grant.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of this bill. I am committed to reducing drug prices for seniors, but this bill does not do it. I have worked as hard as anyone in this Chamber to help seniors enroll in prescription part D. 
   It has been in place for a little over a year now. I think it is time that we kind of look at how effective it is in ways that we can ensure that we are getting the lowest prices for our seniors. Now, let us look at how we do this. 
   I want to stress one difference. We have been tagged as somehow part of a big conspiracy because of barring government from price setting. 
   By the way, if you look at this week and its agenda, it is the week of wage and price controls by big government. That is what this is about. It is a philosophical battle of whether you trust the private sector to use their power of bulk purchases to receive the lowest prices, or you put government at the table to quote-unquote, negotiate. 
   Every time I say that in quotations, I really mean that in a satirical way because government doesn't really negotiate; they price set. That is the heavy hand of big government at work today. 
   Frankly, even using that heavy hand of government, the CBO reports that any negotiation, in quotations, by big government for lower drug prices would be negligible, because it would at least, in its best day, equate what the market has already done. 
   There has been no ban on negotiations; it has just simply been who does it, private sector or government? I am a private sector guy. I trust the private sector. Part of the problem here is that the government lacks the leverage in any type of negotiations. That is why they can only use the heavy hand as the leverage in negotiations, for example, ultimately price setting. That is why I voted to ban the government from setting prices, and I will not start down that slippery slope today.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4. I am committed to reducing drug prices for seniors, but this bill does not do it. 
   I have worked as hard as anyone on this floor on behalf of seniors in the implementation of Part D. Now that we have had the program in place for over 1 year, opportunity to evaluate the effect of the program on seniors' drug prices. 
   Much to the dismay of the members of the majority who have done nothing to assist seniors with this program, the program is working well. Costs are down and seniors are satisfied. Requiring the government to negotiate drug prices is not going to save the program any money, according to both CBO and CMS actuaries. CBO states that, ``H.R. 4 would have a negligible effect on federal spending.'' And the claims by the majority that savings would close the so-called donut hole are simply untrue. The size of the donut hole is estimated at almost $500 billion. Even if this provision  created major savings, it wouldn't come close to closing the donut hole. 
   Dr. Mark McClellan, the former CMS Administrator, has said that competition among private companies and their negotiations with drug companies have lowered the estimated cost of the program over the next 10 years by nearly 20 percent and may reduce it by another 10 percent next year. The average premium, originally estimated to be $37 per month, has fallen to an average of $22 per month. I am encouraged that competition in the private sector has done what the free market does best--lower costs. 
   The key here is leverage. Negotiation means nothing if you don't have something to leverage. Part D private plans already have natural leverage built in. As CBO has stated, the private plans have a huge financial stake and formulary limitations which give them the ability to negotiate drug prices. 
   The requirement for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into pricing negotiations as contained in H.R. 4 simply cannot work. The bill prohibits a single national formulary from being established. If the government is not allowed to limit or restrict the number of drugs covered, it will have absolutely no leverage to negotiate with drug manufacturers. Such a mandate, I believe, would be extremely unattractive to our Nation's seniors. They would not have the flexibility to choose a plan that best meets their drug needs, as is the case right now. 
   I do not support H.R. 4 because I oppose turning a program over to the government that is working efficiently and effectively in the private sector. Congress created the Part D program to allow market forces to drive costs down and that is exactly what is happening. It would be disastrous to our seniors to make such a draconian change when the cost savings have been so great. 
   When the private sector can perform more efficiently and achieve better results than the Federal Government, the private sector should do so. Adoption of this bill will put us on the way to socialized healthcare, a result I don't believe any American really wants. Vote ``no'' on H.R. 4.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am actually going to speak on the amendment that was offered almost 10 minutes ago. I just want to express my appreciation to you, Chairman Peterson, for agreeing to this and working with us to make a good amendment even better by including switch grass and expanding it. 
   Certainly there is no doubt that ethanol is going to be a key ingredient in our recipe for energy independence. We have to do more research and development into cellulosic ethanol, of which sweet sorghum, which is pictured here in this graph, and switch grass, are going to be a key component. We can't do it all with ethanol from corn, so we need other products to develop the cellulosic, to add on top of that to be able to become less dependent on foreign oil. So we need to do the research. 
   This offers grants to universities that will compete. They have to show that they are competitive in this type of research to earn a $1 million grant to do this. 
   Our energy needs require us to speed up this process. Ethanol made from cellulosic materials, like sweet sorghum or switch grass, has nine times the amount of energy as regular ethanol. So that is another reason why we have to add this. 
   I want to compliment the ranking member and the chairman in putting together really a pretty good bill. Forty-eight hours ago I was telling all of our farm groups that I was very proud to support this type of legislation, especially because of the bioenergy issues in here. But, unfortunately, those of us that have said we will vote against tax increases have been put in a very tough position.

<DOCNO>Mr. TERRY. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Madam Chairman, I, too, rise, sticking up for American families that are struggling with the high prices of many products right now, most of which I hear from my constituents in Nebraska is about the price of gasoline at the pump. I hear about the groceries as well. And of course then when I see a bill like this, the bill that we have up now about making sure that our beaches are clean and we have plans for that, unfortunately under the leadership of the House and Senate currently now, my first thought isn't well, that's absolutely right, we need to keep our beaches clean. My first thought is, is this another environmental tool to make sure that we can't get to drilling in places where we need to get? 
   Now, the frequently asked question about gasoline prices is, what are you going to do about it? Well, we have a couple of options that I think could alleviate some of the pressure. One is, we can take the 1970s actions done by the Nixon administration to simply set the price. We will set the price. We will freeze them; $3.30 at my home, we can freeze that. Well, what did that do? Created about a half mile line for gas. And then maybe if you pulled up to the pump, you might see that little white piece of paper that said ``out of gas.'' We can go back to that. But the gas prices would be stable. But running out of gas begs the question, the question is, what's causing this?     
   Now, obviously it's just simple high school economic supply and demand, folks. What we have is that oil that we have access to within the United States, whether it's ANWR or off the Continental Shelf or shale in Colorado or other pockets that have been made into public lands and thereby unaccessible, what we've done is adopt a policy in this country that we want to push the production or creation of fuel out of our country to foreign countries. That makes us reliant on foreign countries. In fact, about 60 some percent, about 63 percent, of our oil needs are imported. We use about 20 million barrels per day to meet our energy needs, and 14 million barrels per day are imported. So as other countries compete with us for that oil on the world market, prices increase. At the well head, just yesterday closing out the markets, sweet crude jumped $2.30, hitting a new record of $112.21, closing at the closing record of $110.87 per barrel. 
   Now, we can ask what the solution will be. Do we just simply raise taxes on oil production, or do we say that it's part of our plan to make sure that we can become energy independent and secure this Nation's future? And I think the long-term answer can be the type of issues that we're dealing with, with alternative and biofuels like cellulosic ethanol, like hydrogen, but let's admit that those are a generation away if we make the commitment today. So what we need to do in the meantime is either be honest with the American citizens and say that our policy is to limit supply in a competitive global market, therefore, get used to $4 and then $5 per gallon of gas, or we allow the drilling to take place where we can produce more of our own resources of oil. And we can do that. 
   I asked the question the other day, how much oil and natural gas do we have access to within 75 miles of our coastline? The answer is ``I don't know'' because we have been blocked from being able to explore that. We can't measure that. That's wrong.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Thank you. I appreciate this opportunity. 
   My friend from California, I'd like to clarify a little bit. The 66 million acres are land that hasn't been authorized by Congress. In fact, the efforts by my friends on that side of the aisle was to take away that 66 million acres of already leased land. So I think the public needs to be clear on that aspect. 
   Yes, some of the Bush plan on energy has been implemented. The part, conveniently, that has been left out of presenting to the President for signature is the part that increases supply. It's the lack of supply that is causing problems for American families today, with the price at the pumps. 
   I have had several meetings with constituents who have told me their stories about how the high price of gasoline is literally taking food off of their tables and making them to make decisions about what they are taking away from their family in order to be able to get to work and back. 
   Our reliance on foreign energy is destroying this country, and we have to become independent, folks. We use 20 million barrels a day. Twenty million barrels of oil per day, most of which is refined into fuel that we use in travels. Over 14 million of those 20 are imported today. 
   Let's look at what is on the foreign scene today with Iran sending missiles as a message to the United States and Israel about their might. Make no bones about it, my friends; the only reason they have missiles is because they get to sell oil. If we weren't reliant on foreign oil and we could get away from it with a comprehensive plan and, Mr. Cardoza, I'd love to work with anyone on your side of the aisle to come up with conservation alternative fuels and to be able to open up our offshore drilling in the gulf coast, Alaska, and use oil shale. If we put all of that together, we can be energy independent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of a comprehensive energy policy. And the gentleman from Massachusetts and I are friends and neighbors by offices and talk all the time. 
   And do you know what? It may be entirely true that Nebraskans think differently than suburban Boston folks. And that is why we go back and we talk to our constituents. And what I hear--and this isn't evenly divided; this is 95-5--that people are angry at the price of gas; they are angry at Congress doing nothing. And we sit here in this body and we have no real energy bills to discuss, so we have to use a flood insurance bill to be able to discuss these type of issues. 
   But my friend from Massachusetts brings up a point that I want to kind of correct and kind of agree with. We have been in Congress now five terms. I have been on the Energy Committee for 8 years; and almost every year that I have been on that committee, we have done an energy bill. Most of them haven't gotten to the President. We did get an energy bill that included drilling to the President in our first term, which was vetoed by President Clinton, that included ANWR. 
   My friend would probably remember a lot of vicious debates on this floor about opening up drilling in Alaska and ANWR and the deep waters off the coast of Florida and the gulf coast. We had incredibly intense debates on that, and we passed those. We passed the refinery bill that would expand our refining capacity and diversify where they are at in this body. So to be able to come and say on the House floor that we haven't done anything for 12 years is not accurate. 
   What is accurate is a bipartisan opposition to energy in the Senate, where we did good work, but unfortunately we had a group of 40 that was mostly Democrat but Republicans also that voted to kill refinery expansions, that voted to--well, sometimes they voted on deep-sea and ANWR, but most of the time they just ignored what we did here, in the Senate. And I am angry and upset at that. 
   But the people are demanding action now. And what I would like to see is, instead of this partisan rhetoric that we are hearing on the floor today, that my friends on the other side would say, hey, let's all get together. Because you talk about conservation. I wrote with Baron Hill the CAFE bill that ups the amount of fuel efficiency for the auto manufacturers. I am open to more of those types of discussions. 
   Let's get together and work on an energy policy, instead of this partisan bickering that we are hearing right now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in opposition to the Lowey Amendment to the State Department and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. This amendment is a poison pill that will result in a veto by the President. 
   The original Mexico City policy, which was emasculated in the Appropriations Committee, prevents U.S. population assistance funds from going to foreign organizations which ``perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning.'' This was done to ensure compliance with the long-standing law that taxpayer dollars cannot be used to finance abortion, except in the case of rape, incest, or danger to the life of the mother. The Stupak-Smith amendment restores the Mexico City policy to its original intent. 
   On the other hand Mr. Chairman, the Lowey amendment, masks the effort to fund pro-abortion organizations with U.S. tax dollars. This amendment would provide economic support in the form of valuable commodities and other items to organizations that promote and provide abortion as a method of family planning. Additionally, this amendment does not increase USAID funding for contraceptives, as the amendment's supporters have claimed. 
   In fact, it does nothing to increase contraception and simply diverts contraceptive commodities from organizations that DO NOT promote or provide abortion to organizations that DO promote or provide abortion as a method of family planning. 
   This ``stealth amendment'' further undermines the Mexico City policy that President Reagan established in 1984. Prior to the implementation of the Mexico City policy by President Reagan in 1984, organizations which support abortion such as Planned Parenthood kept two sets of books in order to qualify for U.S. funds: one tracking the use of taxpayer dollars for services such as family planning counseling and contraception distribution, and another chronicling the use of private organization funds for abortion-related expenses. Mr. Chairman, we all know that money is fungible. Such double bookkeeping ensured that taxpayer dollars for family planning inevitably subsidized abortion by freeing up more private funds for this purpose. The Mexico City policy was adopted to stop this practice. 
   Mr. Chairman, while President Clinton revoked this policy, it was reinstated by President Bush to ensure American citizens are not forced to pay for a procedure many find morally abhorrent. 
   Additionally Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out to my colleagues that the President has threatened to veto any legislation that weakens existing pro-life protections. Opposing the Lowey amendment and supporting the Stupak-Smith amendment will ensure that the hard work our colleagues have put into this appropriations bill is not for nothing. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the Lowey amendment and support the Stupak-Smith Amendment to restore the Mexico City Policy to its original intent.
