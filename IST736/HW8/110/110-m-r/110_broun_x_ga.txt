<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (HONORING THE AUGUSTA METRO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and pay tribute to a non-profit community organization in my 10th Congressional District of Georgia. 
   The Augusta Metro Chamber of Commerce is celebrating more than 100 years of dedicated service to Augusta, Georgia's economic development. Founded in 1905, the chamber has grown to include more than 1,100 members. The chamber and its members provide citizens with a strong business environment that increases employment, retail trade and commerce, and industrial growth in Augusta. 
   The Augusta Metro Chamber of Commerce has worked to promote a prosperous future for all Augustans through legislative efforts and through networking programs, such as Women in Business, Leadership Augusta, and the Chamber Business Academy. The chamber promotes healthy and productive workforces through its nationally-recognized Drugs Don't Work program. 
   The Augusta Metro Chamber of Commerce is also committed to being a good neighbor, with committees designated to serve as liaisons between businesses and local educators and military communities. Furthermore, the chamber promotes business while working carefully to protect Augusta's natural environment. The chamber works with State and Federal agencies to minimize the impact economic development has on the environment. 
   Such a diligent organization is to be commended for its efforts. The Augusta Metro Chamber of Commerce is an investment in the present and future well-being of the Augusta community. As it celebrates a centennial milestone, may this chamber of commerce continue steadfast in its work to ensure Augusta's continued competitiveness in our domestic and global economies.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I appreciate the gentleman going through that list of things. 
   I used to farm. I'm a medical doctor, as you know, and a lot of things that we deal with in health care are petroleum-based also. But as a farmer, I used not only diesel fuel in my tractor, but I also used oil-based or petroleum-based products to keep weeds out of my crops, to keep bugs out of my crops, and those sorts of things. 
   Having a shortage of oil is going to drastically affect agriculture, which means it's going to drastically affect food prices to every single consumer in America today. That's another reason why I think it's absolutely critical that we get American oil and stop being dependent upon this Middle East oil and foreign oil. 
   So I appreciate the gentleman yielding. But I wanted to add that as just another issue that's extremely critical for us to think about as we look because it's going to hurt the American consumer when they go to the grocery store that they can't buy their groceries at a reasonable price. So it not only hurts people at the pump but it hurts people in the grocery store. It hurts people at their job and in every single other way.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. You make a great point, Congressman Heller. 
   I keep hearing from the other side, from the radical environmentalists, as well as the Democratic leadership that won't let us vote on this bill, that it will take 10 years if we pass a bill--if we're to pass this bill, it will take 10 years to start producing oil. That's hogwash. 
   We don't have enough refinery capacity in America. We need to build new refineries, and they say it will take 10 years to get them permitted. And that's hogwash. If Habitat for Humanity can build a house in one week that will withstand a hurricane, as we've seen it happen, if America just has the gumption to do so, we could build a refinery in a year. We could start pumping oil very quickly. 
   But Nancy Pelosi's leadership won't allow us to vote, and it's just absolutely unconscionable to me that we can't vote to supply more oil and stop this dependence upon foreign oil. It is absolutely critical for our national security.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. These are all great things and they're included in the American energy plan, and that's the reason we need to vote on these. And I think it's absolutely critical--all of us voted to stay here to vote on this bill, and I think it's critical for us to do so. 
   But a lot of naysayers say, well, even if we voted on this bill, it would take a long time to lower the cost of gas. But I just submit what happened when the President rescinded the Presidential moratorium on offshore drilling. Oil prices immediately fell. Gas prices are coming down. If we would vote on this bill and pass it, I guarantee you almost overnight we'd see much, much lower prices of gas at the pump, and oil prices would come down. 
   We had this bill about speculation. Well, this is the way to deal with speculation. Let's pass this bill. It will stop the whole problem that we hear from the Democratic side about speculators running up the cost of oil. That's hogwash, too. We need to pass this bill, and I call on the Democratic leadership to bring it to the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (IMPROVING ENERGY, NATURAL DISASTER AND HEALTH CARE POLICIES IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   America right now is drilling for ice on Mars. Yet we cannot drill for oil in America. This is insane. If we have the technology to explore beneath the surface of Mars, then we must have the technology to explore for oil here at home in an efficient, environmentally friendly fashion. 
   Our home-grown energy businesses employ that technology off the coast of Louisiana today. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita toppled many of the oil rigs offshore, but there was no environmental catastrophe. Not one drop of oil was spilled. Not one drop washed up on the shorelines. 
   I respect Louisiana Democrats Charlie Melancon and Mary Landrieu, who support their State's exploration and development in the face of stiff opposition within the Democratic Party's ranks. 
   Why can't we learn from Louisiana's success? 
   There are some who like to say we're facing an energy crisis, and then they'll use those two words to manipulate votes this December. For there  truly to be an energy crisis, there would have to be a shortage of fuel. Fortunately, there isn't one today, but there is a shortage of courage in this body, a shortage of creativity and a shortage of will to do what needs to be done to ensure that there will never be another 1970-style fuel shortage. 
   The best way to cope with a crisis, real or not, is to avoid it in the first place. The Georgia Bulldogs are in my district, so you know I love a good football analogy. We all grew up with Charles Schultz and his Peanuts comic strip, so we are familiar with the image of Lucy's yanking the football away from Charlie Brown just as he's running to kick a field goal. 
   What image better represents the Democratic leadership's approach to energy policy--this so-called new direction for our Nation? this new direction energy policy? the Democratic leadership's energy policy? A sound, obvious proposal comes to the table, such as expanding domestic resource exploration. The Democrats quickly yank it away from under the American consumer. 
   Why? Because it's tradition for most of them to appease radical environmental groups and to oppose domestic exploration and production even in the face of rising costs and of increasing dependence upon Middle Eastern oil. 
   Some of the ideas springing forth from the New Direction Congress are policies from an old era best left forgotten. I'm speaking about this absurd notion of nationalizing, read ``socializing'' our Nation's oil and gas businesses. The most recent mention of it has been quickly forgotten by the press, but I want to point out how this allegedly fresh idea has evolved without even going into the original idea's ultimate failure in the former Soviet Bloc. 
   Nearly 80 percent of world oil reserves are controlled by nationally owned oil companies, not by American or by other private companies. Today, as a nation, we scoff at nationalized oil and gas production in Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, and Bolivia, but somehow socialization is acceptable to some Members of the ``New Direction'' House and Senate. To me, it's a new direction headed down an old path to a dead end. 
   I reject socializing oil companies because it is un-American and because I trust our market economy. As we learned when Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita caused no oil spills, offshore oil rigs are safe, and offshore oil rigs attract new marine life as we're still learning from the new artificial reefs there. 
   One Democratic aide summarized the liberal energy plan as ``drive small cars and wait for the wind.'' We developed this picture of the Democratic Party's policy for energy in America. It's absurd. Well, Madam Speaker, not everybody owns a small car, and it's not windy every day. America wants energy solutions now, and we should vote to serve their interests, not the interests of the radical environmentalists. 
   We've introduced a bill called the American Energy Plan. It encompasses all of the above, every single possible energy source that we can figure today, and we'll even stimulate the production of new sources that we may not even know about. We need to have a vote on that bill. 
   The Georgia Bulldogs' head football coach, Mark Richt, has a saying he uses to energize the Georgia Bulldogs football team: Finish the drill. As a Congressman, I've got three words to energize America: Start the drill. 
   We do that by voting for the American Energy Plan. We do that by voting to expand offshore drilling, ANWR drilling. We do that by voting to produce new nuclear energy and to permit new refineries. If Habitat for Humanity can build a house in 1 week that will withstand a hurricane, we can build a refinery to produce more gasoline for America in 1 year. We have to have a vote. The American public is absolutely dependent upon it. I want people to understand the reason that the gas prices are high at the pumps when you go pump your oil today. It is because we're not able to vote on the American Energy Plan or on some comprehensive means of establishing new oil supplies in America. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding. I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (REPUBLICAN FRESHMEN THIRD QUARTERLY REPORT TO THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I would like to thank Congressman McCarthy for yielding me time to speak on the floor this afternoon. 
   This afternoon, it was reported that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sought permission from the City of New York and the United States Secret Service to visit Ground Zero, the site of the September 11 attacks. This is an outrage, that this person would request to go to the place that he and his terrorist brethren have caused such destruction in this country. 
   President Ahmadinejad is coming to the United Nations as the representative of a country, Iran, that the State Department has declared the ``world's most active state sponsor of terrorism.'' His presence at Ground Zero would represent a slap in the face not only to those who were lost in the attacks on September 11, 2001, and to their families, but to all Americans. 
   Make no mistake about it, Iran is a rogue nation that views America and the Americans as their enemy. General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker just spent a significant amount of their time recently here on the Hill detailing the Iranian efforts to come against our troops and kill our boys and ladies in Iraq. To allow Ahmadinejad to abuse his status as a diplomat to visit this site would send a signal that we fail to take the threat that he and his country bring to this Nation and to our people in a serious manner. 
   What kind of man is Ahmadinejad? Please let me read you some of the public policy positions as compiled by the Jerusalem Post. 
   He denies the Holocaust. ``We ask the West to remove what they created 60 years ago; and if they do not listen to our recommendations, then the Palestinian nation and other nations will eventually do this for them.'' 
   ``The real Holocaust is what is happening in Palestine, where the Zionists avail themselves of the fairy tale of Holocaust as blackmail and justification for killing children and women and making innocent people homeless.'' 
   ``The West claims that more than 6 million Jews were killed in World War II, and to compensate for that they established and support Israel. If it is true that the Jews were killed in Europe, why should Israel be established in the East, in Palestine?'' 
   ``If you have burned the Jews, why don't you give a piece of Europe, the United States, Canada, or Alaska to Israel? My question is, if you have committed this huge crime, why should the innocent nation of Palestine pay for this crime?'' 
   His quotes about threats against Israel: ``Anybody who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nation's fury.'' 
   ``Remove Israel before it is too late, and save yourself from the fury of regional nations.'' 
   ``The skirmishes in the occupied land are part of a war of destiny. The outcome of hundreds of years of war will be defined in Palestinian land. As the Imam said, Israel must be wiped off the map.'' 
   ``If the West does not support Israel, this regime will be toppled. As it has lost its raison d'etre, Israel will be annihilated.'' 
   ``Israel is a tyrannical regime that will one day be destroyed.'' 
   ``Israel is a rotten, dried tree that will be annihilated in one storm.'' 
   Late this afternoon, this very afternoon, the New York Police Department indicated that they would not issue a permit to Ahmadinejad. I hope they stand firm on this decision, and I applaud that decision. However, we should go one step further. This despotic, Holocaust denying madman should not be allowed in this country. I call upon the State Department and the President to do the right thing; refuse Ahmadinejad an entry visa.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (TAXES -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, our Founding Fathers did not establish Congress to level society or to endlessly take money out of the pockets of people, and they were very clear on that point. According to Thomas Jefferson, ``Congress has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically enumerated.'' 
   James Madison went even further. He wrote, ``I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents.'' 
   Heavy taxation is bad representation. As a rule, I use a four-part test for every piece of legislation that crosses my desk. My test asks these four simple questions: Is it moral? Is it constitutional according to the original intent of the Constitution? Is it needed? And can we afford it? Most of the time, the legislation fails at least one of those tests and I stand against it. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people have stood against new taxes time and time again because the current tax system is not moral, is not constitutional, is not needed, and we cannot afford it. This government of takers has imposed an immoral death tax, an anti-growth capital gains tax, an unfair dividend tax, and job-killing business taxes, all with supposed social benefits. 
   We need to stand up for the overburdened taxpayer by taking away the financial yoke of big government. It is absolutely immoral for Congress to allow death taxes to stand. The government has no business inflicting more stress on those in our society that are already mourning the loss of their loved one. I don't believe that a person should be forced to visit the IRS and the undertaker on the same day. 
   How can the people trust a government so controlled by greed? Congress must understand that every time a new tax is passed, there will be unintended consequences and unfair results. The people do not want these taxes. Truly limited government does not need them. The people want to be treated fairly, and our Constitution requires us to comply. 
   Not only are some taxes immoral, but many are unconstitutional as well. For example, extra taxes that target successful businesses are harmful, unfair and anti-capitalistic. Harmful because the more the government taxes businesses, the less they produce and the less they compete; unfair, because consumers are denied the benefit of a wide variety of low-cost products produced by a competitive market; and anti-capitalistic because it is not the government's place to redistribute wealth. 
   As the great Winston Churchill once said, ``for a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket trying to lift himself up by the handle.'' 
   These corporate taxes will always be unwise, and in the American economy there is only one social responsibility of business, and that is to make as much money for their investors as possible, within the rules, of course. As an ardent capitalist, I believe that the marketplace, unencumbered by government regulation and taxes, is the best way to control quality, quantity and the cost of all goods and services, no matter what it might be, whether it is health care, my business, or selling anything that might be available to the public. 
   Cutting taxes and reining in the Federal Government is fundamental to returning power to the U.S. citizens and promoting economic growth. We should support our free market by eliminating unfair corporate taxes and promoting economic growth. Along with promoting economic growth, we should also promote economic consistency and stability. We can only do that by eliminating, not just reducing, but eliminating capital gains taxes. 
   Just as businesses should not be penalized for being successful, investors should not be penalized for making good decisions and for supporting good companies. If we continue to try to tax people into making a perfect world, we will create a bureaucratic monster. In fact, Congress has been doing just that. 
   Congress has always been able to raise new taxes when it can sell a new program to one group of citizens while sending the bill to another. The American people should always remember that whatever the government gives, it first must take it from somebody else. Congress should always remember that the less money it takes from people, the more freedom people have.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (MARRIAGE -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, earlier today the California Supreme Court threw aside the voice and the express will of millions of California voters by overturning California's State law that banned same-sex marriage. 
   Effectively this ruling allows same-sex couples in our Nation's most populous State the right to marry and affords them all the privileges that go along with this sacred union. And I say that rulings like this are one of the reasons why the institution of marriage is crumbling before our very eyes. And I, for one, am very sad to see this happen. 
   The main issue is whether the status of marriage will be determined by judges or by the American people. I'm extremely concerned about how activists use the courts to legislate on something that has been settled in American law for more than 200 years. Furthermore, the people of California made it abundantly clear back in 2000 that they reject same-sex marriage. 
   Then comes along four judges who apparently believe that they're wiser than over 4 1/2 million voters in their State. Proposition 22 got over 61 percent of the vote; yet it was dismissed by four lone dictators. 
   I condemn this ruling in the strongest possible way. I condemn it because the court is legislating from the bench. I condemn it because it is a reprehensible action that is not consistent with history or with common sense. 
   This lunacy is precisely the reason why a Federal constitutional amendment is needed to protect traditional marriage. This decision will undoubtedly become the platform for spreading this unfounded ruling across the Nation. 
   On the Federal stage, there's a constitutional remedy for Federal judges  that are involved in this type of activist behavior and legislating from the bench. Every single Federal judge takes an oath to uphold the Constitution. When they fail to do so and let their own whims and ideological positions interfere with applying the Constitution, not interpreting but applying, these judges have failed to fulfill their term of good behavior, and they should be fired by impeachment. 
   Likewise Californians that are outraged, like I am, should be up in arms and should take action to initiate a referendum to pass a State constitutional amendment to enforce their will and overturn these judges' despicable opinions, and these judges deserve to be censured or sent home for bad behavior.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (CONSTITUTIONAL CAUCUS ON THE BILL OF RIGHTS -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I must begin by saying that I believe in the Constitution as James Madison and company meant it. In fact, I carry a copy in my pocket at all times. It's getting a little shopworn and dog-eared. I describe myself as a Madisonian Republican. And it's interesting, most people in our country today don't realize that James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, John Quincy Adams all considered themselves to be Republicans because they believed in very limited government, and that's what I believe in also. 
   But I rise today to join in with my colleagues on this discussion of the importance of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, specifically about the second amendment. 
   I began to be politically active by coming to Washington as vice president for Safari Club International. And in my capacity of being a vice president, I would work on hunters' rights and gun owners' rights. And I must say that, as you look at this, as my colleague just mentioned, the militia in the days of the Constitution writing meant every single male 18 years of age and older. 
   In his address to the second session of the First Congress of the United States, the President, George Washington stated, ``Firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself. They are the American people's liberty teeth and keystone under independence.'' 
   He went on, ``From the hour the Pilgrims landed, to this present day, events, occurrences, and tendencies prove that to ensure peace, security and happiness, the rifle and pistol are equally indispensable. The very atmosphere of firearms anywhere restrains evil interference. They deserve a place of honor with all that's good.'' 
   When I ran for Congress, I made a commitment to the constituents in my district, the 10th Congressional District in Georgia, that if elected, I would fight to protect their constitutional rights and their pocketbooks for every American. I promised to apply a four-way test to every piece of legislation that comes before the House for a vote and everything that we do in our office. Before every vote, every vote that we take, I ask whether the legislation is moral and right, and does it fit within the constraints of what God gives us in His inherent word. 
   The second question, is it constitutional. And I'm not talking about this perverted idea of the Constitution that this Congress and the administration and particularly the judiciary are operating on today, but is it constitutional according to James Madison and the people who wrote it. They wrote voluminously about what they meant in the Constitution of the United States, and we in all three branches of government need to apply their writings to how we operate government. 
   The third question is do we really need it. And the fourth is can we afford it. I believe so firmly in those that I printed those up and it's on the desk of every single staffer in my office. Upholding and defending law-abiding citizens' rights to bear arms passes all four of those tests. 
   The second amendment of the Constitution declares that ``A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'' 
   Our Founding Fathers believed very firmly that an armed populace was the only way to prevent tyranny by their own government and I, likewise, adhere to that same philosophy. 
   I am an avid hunter and outdoorsman, and I strongly support the Constitution's second amendment right to bear arms, and will defend the right of law-abiding citizens to purchase, use and keep firearms, as well as to bear those arms and to transport those arms. I vigorously oppose all attempts to restrict the second amendment. I believe that any law, local, State, or Federal, that infringes upon a law-abiding citizen's God-given right to bear an arm, a God-given right that's supposed to be protected by the Constitution of the United States, any law, Federal, State or local that infringes upon those rights are unconstitutional, and I'll fight to try to restore those rights that have been already put in place on all levels. 
   Since 1975, the residents of Washington, DC have had their second amendment right to bear arms stolen from them by the District's government. Last year, in Heller v. DC, the DC Court of Appeals ruled that the gun ban in the District of Columbia violated an individual's right to keep and bear arms that is protected by the Constitution and the second amendment; thus, nullifying the gun ban that the District of Columbia put upon its citizens. 
   Upon appeal by the District of Columbia, the Supreme Court has decided to consider this very important second amendment constitutional case. The U.S. Supreme Court will consider the constitutionality of DC's ban on handgun ownership and self-defense by law-abiding residents in their own homes. 
   The Court will first address the question of whether the second amendment to the Constitution, as embodied in the Bill of Rights, protects an individual's right to own a firearm and to protect themselves, or whether it is a right of the government. 
   We already see that the government cannot protect citizens. In fact, the courts even ruled that the police do not have an obligation to protect a citizen anywhere. We only have that right ourselves. If the Court agrees that it is an individual right, then they will determine if the District's self-defense and handgun bans are constitutional or not.  
   The Supreme Court has a historic opportunity to return to the original intent and the meaning of the second amendment. The second amendment protects us. It's a fundamental and an individual right of law-abiding citizens to own firearms for any lawful purpose. Further, any law infringing upon this freedom, including the ban on self-defense and on handgun ownership, is unconstitutional. 
   Further, every study that's been done has shown that gun control provides absolutely no benefit in curbing crime. Rather, these types of restrictions only leave law-abiding citizens more susceptible to criminal attack. Other than law enforcement, only criminals have guns in the District of Columbia. 
   In fact, it was interesting, the community of Morton Grove, Illinois passed a ban on handguns. And then in response to that, a city in Georgia, Kennesaw, Georgia, passed an ordinance stating that every household should own a firearm. It was a very interesting social experiment. 
   And what happened? The crime rate in Morton Grove, Illinois skyrocketed. The crime rate in Kennesaw, Georgia plummeted. These bans do not protect anybody but a criminal.

   We have to develop alternative sources of fuel. We have to tap into our own energy sources. We have to make nuclear energy easier to put in place, to build reactors, and to make it less costly to do so. We need to tap into our own oil sources. If we're going to lower the cost of gasoline, we have to build more refineries. If we're going to lower the cost of diesel fuel, we're going to have to tap into ANWR and off the gulf coast. It's absolutely critical for our economy to do this.

   We have heard from Mr. Shadegg. There is nothing in there to stop the lawsuits, the endless lawsuits that are going to keep us from producing oil. We don't know what oil is in this bill, but we know in submission that are aren't in this bill. There's nothing about nuclear. 
   It won't come to a floor controlled by Nancy Pelosi that has anything dealing with nuclear energy. We won't have new refineries. It's a sham, it's a travesty. It is a charade, but is it a lie? 
   It's a lie to the American people that's being put forth by the Democratic majority, by Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer, and the American people need to know that. It's not about trying to produce energy. It's about a line to the American people, giving cover to some of their folks so that they can go home and say I voted for a drilling bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, homegrown terrorism is a very dangerous threat and must not be overlooked. The United States has an obligation and a solemn duty to guard against the violent radicalization of the American population, a radicalization that has far-reaching, devastating implications. 
   On September 11, 2001, the world saw firsthand the damage that Islamic extremists can do to the American people. As we look within our own population, there are individuals who promote ideologies under the guise of religion, political, and social benefits that are diametrically opposed to the American values and liberties that we hold so dear. Ideologies of any kind, religious or otherwise, that are based on violence, intolerance, and hatred have no place in America. 
   In the past 18 months, the United States law enforcement and intelligence agencies have stopped numerous individuals and groups that promote radical political, religious, or social beliefs from carrying out terrorist attacks on American soil. I, for one, would like to know how these individuals are operating and how they are funded. Are foreign entities providing the funding for their activities? Are these individuals who promote radical political ideologies registered as foreign agents? Perhaps we need to reexamine the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. We need to be more proactive and strike at the roots of the problem. 
   The bill that we are discussing today, H.R. 1955, is proactive instead of reactive. Britain, Spain, France, and most recently Germany and Denmark have all suffered the deadly effects of a small radicalized population that often use religion as an excuse to engage in violence and murder. The United States, thanks in large part to its alert citizenry and professional law enforcement agencies, has prevented the successful execution of several recent domestic terror threats in New York, Chicago, Florida, and elsewhere. 
   Studying the causes of radicalization and ideologically based violence will better inform all of us how we can prevent terrorists from spreading their messages of hate. 
   The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act is the work of a solid bipartisan cooperation at the subcommittee and full committee levels. Such cooperation is readily apparent as the current bill includes major aspects of H.R. 1695, Congressman Reichert's PREVENT Act, which was designed to establish a National Commission on Radicalization. The nonpartisan commission envisioned by Representatives REICHERT and HARMAN will be dedicated to comprehensively examining the phenomenon of violent radicalization so that we might better understand its root causes within the United States. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important timely, bipartisan piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (CHARLIE NORWOOD DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congressman Charlie Norwood was a man of integrity and conviction who made immeasurable contributions to this Nation. 
   I knew Charlie when he was first elected to Congress in 1994. He was a tireless advocate for veterans, for this district, and for the entire State of Georgia. Charlie and I shared the love of hunting and fishing. When I was an active member of the safari club, I used to come to Washington to lobby for hunters' rights and gun owners' rights. Charlie was always very supportive and very helpful. 
   I have enormous respect for his unwavering commitment to his principles. Throughout Charlie's illness, I prayed that God would heal him. His passing was a great loss to us all. I hope that dedicating this facility will be a comfort to the Norwood family and for all that they have been through. 
   I have tremendous appreciation for Charlie's wife, Gloria, for the unwavering support that she gave to Charlie. Without her help he could not have accomplished so many wonderful things and touched so many people's lives. 
   Charlie gave a lifetime of public service to the people of this Nation. After giving so much to his country, it is only fitting that we honor Charlie today by naming this medical center after him.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my fellow colleagues in strong support of H.R. 1808, To designate the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia, as the ``Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans'' Affairs Medical Center.'' 
   Congressman Charlie Norwood was a man of integrity and conviction, who made immeasurable contributions to this nation, and I can't think of anything more appropriate than to name the Augusta VA Medical Center after Charlie. 
   Before serving in the House of Representatives, Charlie volunteered for the Army, serving in the Army Dental Corps. In Vietnam, he served bravely as an Army captain under combat conditions, providing dental and emergency care to American soldiers, civilians, and prisoners of war. For his distinguished service, he was awarded the Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars. After returning from Vietnam, Charlie continued to serve in the Army Dental Corps at Fort Gordon in Augusta, GA. When he was discharged in 1969, he began his dental practice in Augusta. 
   I have enormous respect for Charlie Norwood. I knew Charlie when he was first elected to Congress in 1994. Throughout his 12 years in Congress, he was a tireless advocate for veterans, for the district, and for the entire State of Georgia. He championed the Patients' Bill of Rights, worked to reform health care for veterans, and fought to secure our borders. 
   Charlie and I shared the love of outdoors, of hunting, and fishing. When I was an active member of the Safari club, I used to come to Washington to lobby for hunters' rights and gun owners' rights, and Charlie was always very supportive and helpful. I've always admired his unwavering commitment to his principles. Throughout Charlie's illness, I prayed that God would heal him. However, it seems that God had a different plan. His passing was a great loss to us all. 
   I hope that dedicating this facility will be a comfort to the Norwood family for all that they have been through. I have tremendous appreciation for Charlie's wife, Gloria, for the unwavering support that she gave to Charlie. Without her help, he could not have accomplished so many wonderful things and touched so many people's lives. 
   Charlie truly cared about people. He gave a lifetime of public service to the people of this nation. After giving so much to his country, it is only fitting that we honor Charlie today by naming the VA Medical Center in Augusta after him.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (HONORING BEN CRENSHAW -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor and pay tribute to an exceptional athlete and distinguished American, Ben Crenshaw. 
   Architect, historian, gentleman, all of these words correctly portray Ben Daniel Crenshaw. But perhaps the most fitting description for this great golfer is champion. 
   The people of Augusta, Georgia, who I represent, and golf fans around the world recognize Ben Crenshaw as one of the finest, most talented golfers on the PGA circuit. 
   Crenshaw has been a phenomenon on the golf course since childhood, winning his first tournament, the Casis Elementary Open, in the fourth grade. He continued to play through middle school and high school, claiming several championship titles. It was clear then that Ben Crenshaw was on his way to greatness. 
   He made school history during the 1970-71 academic year at the University of Texas when Crenshaw became the first freshman to capture the individual title during the NCAA tournament at the Tuscan National Golf Club. His outstanding accomplishments and victories that year earned Crenshaw the privilege to be named to the 1971 All American collegiate golf team. 
   Crenshaw's early achievement set the stage for an extraordinary career. His most notable achievements include being a 19-time winner on the PGA tour, captain of the 1999 U.S. Ryder Cup team whose stunning comeback is remembered as one of the most exciting competitions in that match's history. 
   And he's also a two-time Masters champion. Many will never forget the emotional scene that played out on the 18th green when, in 1995, Crenshaw clinched his second Masters victory and earned yet another green jacket.  
   In addition to these accomplishments, he has been a tremendous ambassador for the game of golf, as well as a consummate gentleman and human being. 
   I had the privilege of being in Augusta on April 7, 2008 before the 72nd Master's Tournament as Mayor Deke Copenhaver awarded Crenshaw a crystal ``key to the city.'' It is an honor for me to pay tribute to a great American golf legend, Ben Crenshaw.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (THIRTEEN-FOLD FLAG RECITATION -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Veterans service organizations across the Nation often provide funeral honors at national cemeteries, including the folding and presentation of the flag, the recitation of the flag-folding steps, and playing of Taps. 
   As you may know, for a very brief period recently, the Veterans Affairs prohibited the flag-folding step, known as the 13-fold flag recitation, at funerals. In response to national outrage, the VA issued a letter to all cemetery directors in the National Cemetery Administration that states that 13-fold flag recitation will be allowed at veterans' funerals. 
   While I commend this decision, the policy will allow employees and volunteers to recite the ceremony only if requested by the veterans' grieving family members. Families should not have to remember to request the 13-fold flag recitation. The recitation of flag-folding steps should be proactively offered. 
   The choice to have the flag-folding ceremony read aloud should belong to the family of the deceased. That is why today I am introducing a resolution that requires the VA to offer families the choice of whether or not to have the ceremony and let the decision rest with the families and not with the bureaucrats here in Washington.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA V. HELLER -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Madam Speaker, today the Supreme Court made a strong move in support of individual gun rights in their decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. 
   Since 1975, the residents of Washington, D.C., have had their second amendment rights to bear arms stolen from them by the D.C. government. The second amendment to the U.S. Constitution declares that: ``A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'' 
   Our Founding Fathers knew that without the second amendment, an oppressive government would eventually try to tear away our rights. They could not trust the government to always protect our rights, and so they wrote the second amendment. As James Madison later wrote: ``Who are the best keepers of the people's liberties? The people themselves. The sacred trust can be nowhere so safe as in the hands most interested in preserving it.'' 
   The second amendment protects the fundamental, individual right of law-abiding citizens to own firearms for any lawful purpose. Further, any law infringing on this freedom, including a ban on self-defense and handgun ownership, is blatantly unconstitutional. Every study has shown that gun control is not effective in curbing crime. Rather, these types of restrictions only leave law-abiding citizens more susceptible to criminal attack. Other than law enforcement, only criminals have had handguns in the District of Columbia. 
   The Supreme Court took a strong step forward today to protect the individual gun rights of Americans, and I applaud them for doing so. As Justice Scalia stated, ``The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.'' 
   Though the Supreme Court's decision does champion the individual right to bear arms, it also allows restrictions based on type, manner of carrying, purpose, sensitive location, and commercial sale of handguns. 
   Most alarmingly, the Court irrationally envisioned that their holding may completely detach the second amendment right from its purpose. Regarding the purpose of the right, United States General George Washington Stated, ``A free people ought not only be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.'' 
   Recognizing an evolving standard that limits the right to weapons to only those ``in common use at the time'' and accepting prohibitions of ``dangerous and unusual'' weapons, the Court gives short shrift to the fact that modern laws, of the very sort it strikes down today, have prevented the common use of ``sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government,'' as George Washington envisioned. 
   The ruling outrageously claims that, ``the fact that modern developments have limited the degree of fit between the purpose and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right.'' The truth is that our second amendment right must fit the purpose, and this Court has separated the two. This Court wrongly leaves loopholes for prohibition of weapons that would be necessary for today's militia duty. Militia, at the time of our findings, included every male 18 years of age or older. 
   I am an avid hunter and outdoorsman and proud owner of numerous firearms. The National Rifle Association, Safari Club International, and Gun Owners of America are just some of the numerous sporting associations that I am a life Member of. A full-body-mounted African lion and Kodiak grizzly bear are just a few of my prized trophies that visitors see when they come to my D.C. office. 
   I strongly support the Constitution's second amendment right to bear arms and will defend the rights of law-abiding citizens to purchase, use, carry,  and keep firearms. I vigorously oppose all attempts to restrict the second amendment. 
   I believe that any law, whether at the local, State, or Federal level, which restricts or infringes upon law-abiding citizens' ability to own a firearm is unconstitutional and should be repealed.  
   The plain language of the Second Amendment clearly indicates that it was written to protect an individual's right to keep and bear arms. I believe, as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, John Adams, and other founding fathers believed, that the individual right to bear arms is a representation of freedom and independence and I will always defend that right from abusive regulations and licensing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank my friend for yielding. And I appreciate the comments that my colleague, Congressman Franks, made. 
   I served on a board of directors for a crisis pregnancy center in the inner city of Atlanta. We were geared towards trying to save babies of African American moms in the inner city of Atlanta. 
   I'm a medical doctor. And the whole crux of this discussion comes to the decision of when life begins. I introduced the Sanctity of Human Life Act of 2007 that defines scientifically that life begins at fertilization. And it's described when the cell of the spermatozoa enters the cell wall of the ova site and forms a one-celled human being called a zygote. And my bill gives the right of personhood to that one-celled human being, whether they're black or white or any people group. 
   And I know, as a medical doctor, that that's when life begins. And we have to save life. If a Nation will not protect the most innocent of human beings, what will it protect? And we are killing 4,000 babies every day, black and white. There are more black babies being killed than there are white babies proportionally, and that's the reason why  I was on that board of directors for many years. And thankfully, we have it open and we're serving the inner city of Atlanta right now with that crisis pregnancy center. 
   But we've got to stop the killing of these children, black and white, of all colors, because God cannot continue to bless America while we're killing 4,000 babies every day and while we're funding an organization like Planned Parenthood. We have to stop the funding of that organization. And I just encourage all my colleagues of this House to understand that life begins at fertilization, and we've got to stop the killing as a Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak against H.R. 3685, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, and the restrictive, undemocratic and authoritarian rule that the majority party has put before us today. Mr. Speaker, I realize that I am one of the newest Members of the House of Representatives, having been sworn in just 3 months ago, but I recognize a totalitarian regime when I see one. 
   In my short tenure here, the Democratic majority has made a mockery of the democratic process, and today's rule is a perfect example. For you good folks at home, this is what is happening in a nutshell. The Democrats sprung this bill on us that will grant special employment privileges and a protected minority status to anyone who defines themselves by their sexual orientation. 
   But that's not all. They gave us less than 24 hours, less than 24 hours' notice that this bill will be on the floor, because when the schedule for this week was sent last Friday, it made no mention of this discriminatory bill. And for good reason. They don't want the American people to realize they are undermining America's religious liberties in the House of Representatives. 
   But they didn't stop there. Then the Democratic majority decided to rig the process to block Republican amendments to even slightly improve this terrible and unfortunate bill. An authoritarian regime, right here in the House of Representatives, otherwise known as the Democratic majority. 
   I will vote against this rule, and I urge my colleagues to do so.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, the House of Representatives is debating H.R. 3685, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, today. 
   As well meaning as the title of this bill sounds, I want my constituents in the 10th Congressional District of Georgia and all Americans to know why this legislation is bad for Georgia and bad for America. Just like the ill-conceived hate crimes legislation that this Democratic majority passed, this bill will increase discrimination, yes, increase, and not decrease it. 
   I believe in the Constitution of the United States as our Founding Fathers intended. The first amendment to our Constitution expressly protects religious freedom. So while I am opposed to discrimination, I am also opposed to creating special rights and privileges for certain classes, and that is exactly what this bill does. This bill would elevate one person's desire for a particular job over another person's right to practice and honor their religious beliefs. 
   If H.R. 3685 is signed into law, and I pray that it will not be, it would deny the civil rights of employers, and it would abridge the freedom of association enshrined in our first amendment. 
   ENDA will force employers, including Christians, Muslims, Jews and people of other faiths to hire individuals that are diametrically opposed to their fundamental belief system. If they stand up for their religious beliefs and refuse to hire those opposed to their faith, they will be sued. In fact, one thing the bill will accomplish is to dramatically increase lawsuits against employers. 
   Further, while the Democratic majority will argue that religious organizations are exempt, the highly nuanced definition contained in this bill for religious organizations and religious educational institutions is so bad as to make this exemption essentially meaningless. The bill would grant special employment privileges and protected minority status to anyone that defines themselves by their sexual orientation. Further, an employer can be sued for not only making an employment decision based on a person's sexual orientation, but on his perception of their orientation. 
   Countless individuals and organizations, including Christian and Jewish schools, Christian bookstores and even  religious daycare providers will be forced to either hire a homosexual or transgender individual or face prosecution. 
   This legislation is unnecessary and is unconstitutional. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the right and courageous thing and to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3685.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   As a physician, I have been involved in treating mental illnesses and my family has suffered from mental illnesses, and I have a tremendous interest in this area. But this bill is going to actually drive people away from being able to have health insurance coverage. 
   There are many things about this bill that are wrong and bad. I know it is well-intended, but I highly encourage people to vote against this bill because, though the bill is well-intended, I think it is going to cause disastrous effects and I think employers are going to opt out from giving their employees mental health coverage on their insurance. So I highly encourage my colleagues to vote against this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I spoke earlier today about my grave concerns about this bill. I noted that I did my very best to offer amendments to this bill that would mitigate some of the damages that this bill will cause, which will include increased health care cost, and an actual decrease of mental health coverage for many Americans. 
   What my very sincere but misguided colleagues on the other side of the aisle repeatedly forget is that actions have consequences. When Congress chooses to impose billions of Federal Government mandates on the private sector, they somehow seem to believe that the money that it will take to pay for those mandates will just somehow drop out of the sky or grow on trees. I'm here to remind them that it doesn't. Someone must pay for it. 
   There's a great thing that we call the free market in America. I'm an ardent capitalist, and I believe that the marketplace, unencumbered by government regulation, is the best way to control quality, quantity and cost of all goods and services, including health care. 
   The reality is when government steps in and tries to improve the marketplace, they impede and harm the efficient delivery of goods and services, and this definitely includes mental health care.     
   Please understand me. I'm in complete agreement that mental health is an extremely important issue, but we have over 200 years of capitalistic experience in America that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that heavy-handed government regulations just simply do not work, no matter how well-meaning they are. 
   We in Congress will harm Americans if this bill passes. We are trampling on the private sector, punishing employers that already offer a mental health coverage to their employees. We're harming Americans that desperately need mental health coverage, and we're trampling on the Constitution which does not give us the right to impose these restrictions and mandates on the American people and American businesses. 
   It is an undeniable fact that this bill includes private sector mandates in billions of dollars. It's also a fact that one thing this bill does not mandate is that employers provide mental health coverage, but for any employer that does provide that coverage, and many do and they're commended for doing so, Congress is now going to greatly increase their costs and put regulations on them in their doing so. 
   And in turn, what will they do? Just grin and bear it? Well, some likely will, possibly cutting costs in other areas, but there will be undoubtedly many businesses that cannot afford these burdens and will simply drop mental health coverage. That will be a shame, and it will be Congress' fault. 
   The real solution to health care costs, and that's all our health care costs, and the coverage is to stop these mandates and get the regulatory burden off of the health care system, including providing mental health care.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have both professional and personal interest in this bill. I'm a medical doctor, and for years I've treated depression, anxiety, a lot of panic disorders. I'm also an addictionologist. I've treated drug and alcohol addiction and eating disorders. And so I've had many patients over the years that have had these kinds of problems. 
   My mom has been involved in dealing with her own depression all the way up until she died of metastatic breast cancer, and she worked with the mental health society in our home community. 
   I also have personal interest in this bill because my wife has suffered from depression. She has an eating disorder and has dealt with this in her history. She has suffered from depression to the point that several years ago she even tried to take her own life, and except for the grace of God she should have died. And so I do have a very personal interest in this bill. Mr. Speaker, this is why I have a vested interest in how Congress addresses health care, and especially mental health coverage. 
   CBO estimates that the cost of the mandates to the private sector in this bill would be at least $1.3 billion in 2008; and this would rise to $3 billion in 2012. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, or UMRA, establishes an annual threshold that cannot be exceeded, at least without Congress waiving this rule. For 2007, that threshold amount is $131 million, a great deal of money. This bill exceeds the $131 million threshold by over $1 billion, and it will place a crushing burden on private health insurers and millions of Americans seeking affordable health insurance. These mandates will directly harm businesses and Americans' ability to obtain affordable health insurance. 
   This legislation is very well intended. It is also rash and very poorly drafted and I assure you that if this mental health parity bill is signed into law in its current form, it will result in at least three things: 
   H.R. 1424 will increase health insurance and mental health costs; 
   H.R. 1424 will result in Americans losing their mental health coverage due to the mandates and the increased costs of those mandates; 
   H.R. 1424 will result in a myriad of lawsuits. 
   I testified before the Rules Committee last night and offered two amendments that would have drastically improved this legislation. Well, the Democratic majority, instead of choosing to allow an honest dialogue and an open debate on an extremely important issue of mental health, they chose to deny all amendments to this legislation. Not only that, the majority changed the underlying bill's language late last night and inserted the text of the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act. This legislation will further erode mental health parity and jeopardize affordable group health insurance in America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, in addition to the concerns that I raised earlier regarding the provisions of the mental health parity bill, that it will actually decrease mental health coverage and increase health insurance costs, let me share several additional concerns I have with the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act that was inserted late last night. 
   Title I of the GINA legislation imposes Federal mandates on health plans regarding insurance coverage, while title II imposes mandates on employers regarding employment and related hiring decisions. However, there is no explicit language in this legislation clarifying that group health insurance plan sponsors may not be subjected to the more expansive remedies provided by title II. 
   Why is that a problem? Because title II provides for rulemaking by the EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and remedies before the EEOC and, ultimately, Federal courts. 
   During floor debate on H.R. 493, Congressman ROB ANDREWS suggested that ``employers, including to the extent employers control or direct benefit plans, are subject to the requirements of title II of this bill,'' including the much broader definition of genetic testing and tougher penalties associated with that title. 
   I believe that this lack of clarity could and will lead to additional lawsuits through the use of broader remedies available in title II that are intended to be reserved for employers who violate their employees' civil rights, not for employees seeking to litigate group health plan disputes. 
   Further, section 502 of ERISA says that all lawsuits must go through Federal court, which is not addressed in the mental health parity legislation. Nothing in this bill states that section 502 is preserved, so lawsuits can and will be brought in State court. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to go through just a list of some things that this bill will do. 
   It's going to increase health care costs. CBO estimates that H.R. 1424 would impose mandates on private insurance companies, a total of $3 billion annually by 2012. These costs will ultimately be borne by employers offering health insurance and employees seeking to obtain coverage. 
   Number two, it will increase the cost of business due to private sector mandates. The bill contains multiple new Federal mandates on the private sector, affecting the design and structure of health insurance plans. 
   The bill also increases the threshold level at which employees suffering increased claim costs as a result of implementing the new Federal mandates can claim an exemption from the provisions of H.R. 1424. 
   Number three, I think this will decrease the mental health coverage. While the bill imposes several new Federal mandates on those employers who choose to offer mental health coverage, there is nothing in H.R. 1424 that would require plans to cover these conditions. Thus H.R. 1424 could have the perverse effect of actually decreasing mental health coverage by encouraging an employee who is frustrated with the bill's onerous burdens to drop mental health insurance altogether. 
   Four, I think it will increase the number of uninsured. It will erode the Federal preemption for employers. This codification of treatment mandate for health plans, they are going to use DSM-IV to codify that. And this book, DSM-IV, was generated for physicians to use just to be able to classify mental health. It has a whole lot of things in here that most employers would not want to cover.     
   It will increase an intergovernmental mandate. It is a violation of UMRA. It has a lack of conscience clause, and it has a lack of medical management tools.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (ENERGY PRODUCTION IN OUR COUNTRY -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Energy is the lifeblood of the American economy. Our economic prosperity is closely tied to the availability of reliable and affordable supplies of energy. Unfortunately, U.S. energy production has grown only 13 percent, while energy consumption has grown by 30 percent since 1973. 
   Instead of traveling to spend time with loved ones, record gas prices will keep many Americans home this Memorial Day. Gas prices are now over $1.46 higher nationally than when Speaker Pelosi took over, and will shortly be over $4 a gallon. These high prices are forcing many to choose between taking a vacation or paying bills. 
   It should come as no shock to anyone that AAA predicts that the percentage of Americans traveling more than 50 miles from home over this holiday weekend will fall by nearly 1 percent from last year. That one percent represents hundreds of thousands of families. 
   Skyrocketing gas prices and a risky dependence on fuel supplied by volatile foreign nations highlight our need for an American energy policy that emphasizes production and decreases our reliance upon Middle Eastern oil. 
   Many here in Congress bemoan America's addiction to foreign oil, yet they refuse to allow access to American oil and gas supplies that are necessary to cure this addiction. America has been blessed with abundant natural resources and we should not be hesitant to tap into them, especially at a time when energy prices are soaring so high and are climbing higher. 
   The Outer Continental Shelf is estimated to contain 19 billion barrels of oil and 84 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Alaska's ANWR is estimated to contain between 5.7 and 16 billion barrels of oil. What do these two areas share in common? They are both off limits to any development. At the same time, China is fixing to tap into our natural gas resources off the coast of Florida by 45 to 50 miles, and we can't do it ourselves. Not even 100 or 200 miles off shore. 
   Developing American oil and gas on these lands will help bring the price down and help break the stranglehold on energy that hostile countries in the Middle East enjoy. This can be done in an environmentally sound manner and should be implemented immediately. 
   What is the opposition's solution to this national emergency? How about raising the Federal tax on gasoline by 50 cents a gallon, on top of an already existing Federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon and increasing the tax on diesel fuel by 24.4 cents per gallon. Gasoline is not taxed too little. It is taxed too much. With economic disruptions caused by the current high price of gasoline, Congress should vigorously oppose any efforts to increase fuel taxes and instead reduce or eliminate the already existing Federal fuel taxes. 
   Environmental groups haven't allowed a new oil refinery to be built in the United States in decades. It does little good to increase our use of domestic supplies of oil if we do not have the refinery capacity to quickly convert our crude oil into a usable form. Members on both sides of the aisle need to stand up to these fringe groups and implement policies that encourage construction of new refineries in the United States. 
   Many Americans are feeling the financial hardship this Memorial weekend of record high gasoline prices and will choose not to travel. Our energy problems were not created overnight, and will not be solved overnight. Congress just act swiftly to address this growing energy crisis. America's energy policy must make us stronger and less reliant on countries hostile to freedom. 
   Passing any so-called ``energy'' bill that fails to produce even one single kilowatt of new energy, or produce a gallon of gas, is not the solution. We must pass legislation that will allow for responsible use of our known American supplies of energy that reduce excessive and burdensome environmental policies and encourage the development of alternative forms of energy, such as nuclear power, that has proven to be incredibly safe and a successful source of energy. 
   I stand ready to do so, and encourage my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (EATONTON BICENTENNIAL -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Madam Speaker, for over 200 years, Eatonton, Georgia, has served as the seat of Putnam County and has continuously reflected the American spirit and ideals. 
   Both town and county were named after American patriots. Israel Putnam was a hero of Bunker Hill, and William Eaton was a famous officer and a diplomat during the First Barbary War. 
   Eatonton is a gorgeous town with patriotic people, beautiful homes, historic churches, and a magnificent courthouse. Sitting on the famous courthouse square, there's a statue of Brer Rabbit, the central figure of the Uncle Remus stories, which pays tribute to great literary contributions and cultural preservation. 
   Just outside of Eatonton is St. Paul's Methodist Church, which is over a century old and sits near Rockville Academy, the State's first consolidated rural school. Many generations have used this historic church to worship God, and many individuals have come to know His saving grace within its walls. 
   There are many Antebellum and Victorian-era homes within Eatonton that survived the war between the States. When General Sherman conducted his destructive ``March to the Sea'' during that great war, he bypassed Eatonton and left its beautiful homes untouched. Now visitors to the town have the opportunity to see grand American architecture of long ago. 
   The sons and daughters of Eatonton have served, fought, and died for their country for over two centuries. Every single time America has called upon its citizens for help, the residents of Eatonton have answered. They have served in the armed services, and, during the Civil War, they cared for the wounded on both sides of the conflict. 
   There are many famous people from Eatonton, but some of the best known are Alice Walker, author of ``The Color of Purple''; Vincent Hancock, a recent Olympic Gold Medalist in shooting; and Truett Cathy, founder of Chick-fil-A. These great Americans are products of Eatonton's two proud centuries of history, culture, and religion. 
   As Eatonton celebrates a great milestone in historic history, I applaud its historical accomplishments. I thank God for its prosperity, and I pray that He, God, will continue to bless this great American town. 
   Madam Speaker, on another topic, today we did have a historic vote. I encourage our leaders on both sides to listen to Mr. William Isaac, the former Chairman of the FDIC. Democrats and Republicans alike have come to the floor and talked about his perspective solution to this problem we have in our credit crunch. 
   There are other solutions. Congressman Jeb Hensarling introduced a bill, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of that bill. I'm sure my colleagues on the other side have other alternatives too that they would like to introduce. 
   But I hope we will bring forward a simple bill that this House produces, as constitutionally we are supposed to, and then we won't let Mr. Paulson bully us, as he did, to demand his product that we just tweaked around the edges. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill was a bad one, and that's the reason it went down in defeat. We were offered a little marshmallow of sweetness to put in the bill, but the bill itself was a cow patty with a marshmallow in the middle. And, Madam Speaker, I'm not going to eat this cow patty even though it has a marshmallow in the middle, and many other of our colleagues also refuse to eat it. 
   We need to have a bill that's simple, that eliminates capital gains for 2 years, that cuts out the mark-to-market accounting that the SEC and Mr. Paulson demand, one that will give insurance to those banking institutions so that they can insure the securities that they have that are mortgaged based, and not have anything else. 
   And I hope our leaders will bring forth a very simple bill that our colleagues on the Democratic side and my colleagues on the Republican side can put forward and that we can pass in the next few days that will solve this crisis that we have in America and bring us to financial security in this Nation, and I call upon our leaders to do so.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This is probably the most important vote that Members of Congress are going to take this year and for many, many years. Unfortunately, this bill is not going to solve the problem. This bill is going to bail out foreign banks. It's going to bail out Wall Street. But it's not going to bail out banks, and it's going to hurt the taxpayer. 
   During the negotiations, we've had some changes to the Paulson bill, but this essentially is Mr. Paulson's bill to help his friends, and I can't buy it. 
   Frankly, Madam Speaker, I see this bill as just a stopgap that's going to push us a little further down the road. We're still going to have the economic collapse, we're still going to have the stock market crash, we're still going to have all of the problems that this is supposed to fix. We heard the same argument with the Fannie Mae bailout and Freddie Mac. We've heard it in the discussion about Bear Stearns and AIG. It's the same old story. We're just going further down the road. We're getting deeper and deeper. The cliff is getting steeper and steeper. 
   We need to slow this down. We need to stop this process. We need to vote against this bill and find something that really makes sense economically that's going to secure the bank situation. 
   We have a capital problem, not a liquidity problem in our banks, Madam  Speaker, and we've got to find a solution. And there are solutions. This is not the only one. This one is the only one to bail out Wall Street, but it's going to cost our taxpayers dearly. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a huge cow patty with a piece of marshmallow stuck in the middle of it, and I'm not going to eat that cow patty. 
   I would encourage all of the Members of my conference and your conference to vote against this bill so we can find something that makes sense.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I was sitting in my office listening to this debate, and it occurred to me there was an interesting experiment done a number of years ago. The City of Morton Grove, Illinois, which is a suburb of Chicago, put in a ban on handguns. They outlawed the ownership of guns in Morton Grove; and in response to that, the City of Kennesaw, Georgia, enacted legislation within that community that required the ownership of firearms within that community. 
   Both of these are very similar communities. Morton Grove is just outside of Chicago; Kennesaw is just outside of Atlanta. 
   It was very interesting what happened with this social experiment. The crime rate, the murder rate, the assaults, the rapes, every measure of crime in Morton Grove, Illinois, rose exponentially. In Kennesaw, Georgia, the crime rate plummeted and is still low even today. The Kennesaw ordinance allowed people who didn't want to have firearms in their homes a method of having conscientious objection to doing so. But it's a very interesting experiment. 
   I hear from the other side all of these rants and raves and anger even expressed tonight over the substitute amendment supporting the bill. Well, the fact is the underlying bill does not support the second amendment, it is anti-second amendment; and frankly, according to the Constitution, we have a pre-existing right prior to the Constitution to own firearms and to protect ourselves. And that's what this substitute would help allow to happen in Washington, D.C. 
   Washington is not a State. It's not a city, according to all of the other cities in the country. It's very unique. And this body has the prerogative, has the responsibility under the Constitution to set the laws and to monitor what is going on in Washington, D.C. 
   I hear claims on the other side that the substitute amendment would legalize AK-47s. Well, that's not factual. I hear that it will allow mentally deficient people to have firearms. That's not correct. I hear so many claims on the other side and every single person that I have heard come to this floor making these outrageous, incorrect claims are all on record of being anti-gun, anti-second amendment, and want to outlaw guns, register guns, and want to get guns out of the hands of individuals. 
   We have an individual right to protect ourselves. We have an individual right to own a firearm. And what this amendment will do is it will allow the people of Washington, D.C. the right to protect themselves. It's inane to think that somebody can't have a gun and own that gun and have it loaded. 
   It's inane to think that somebody has to have a gun unloaded or locked or taken apart because if somebody's breaking into your house, if they're robbing, raping, pillaging, you don't have time to put those firearms together, even the loaded firearm. 
   We know from the experiment in Morton Grove, as well as Kennesaw, Georgia, that owning firearms within a community actually decreases crime and makes people safer. 
   So I encourage the Members of this House to vote for the substitute amendment and vote down the underlying bill.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. An AK-47 is a fully automatic machine gun. Machine guns are very strictly controlled and have been for decades. This will not allow machine guns. 
   Now, there are many on that side that think if a gun is an autoloader, that it's a machine gun. It is not. A machine gun, you pull the trigger, it fires multiple times with one pull of the trigger. This bill does not allow that. A semi-automatic would allow one shot with one pull of the trigger. There are shotguns that do that, there are pistols that do that, there are rifles that do that.

It has been called a sham. It has been called a farce. But let me tell you, it's a bald-faced lie to the American people. This so-called energy bill is not going to produce one drop of oil, not the first one. We don't know all that is in this bill because we were just presented it last night. 
   There are some things that are not in this bill, and I can guarantee you there is no nuclear energy. We're not going to even be able to drill for oil and gas on the Outer Continental Shelf. There is no way to stop in this bill the endless lawsuits by the radical environmentalists. This is a nonenergy energy bill. It's a lie to the American public. It is a cover to try to look like the Democratic majority is trying to do something. They say they represent the poor, the elderly and the underprivileged. But that is a lie, too, because the underprivileged and the poor are being hammered by increased energy costs. And we cannot afford to continue on this process.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, we're talking about preserving America, but we need to preserve the economic viability of America, and as long as we're paying $4.10 a gallon, we're not going to be an economically viable Nation. It's going higher and higher. 
   In the last bill's debate, we talked about monkey bites, shark bites, and there was an accusation of the energy production companies are biting people. But what's biting people in their pocketbooks and their wallets is this high cost of gasoline, high cost of energy. 
   Until we start dealing with this issue, we're going to continue to have problems in this country. We're going to continue to have economic problems, and it's absolutely critical that we deal with what's on America's mind, and that is energy costs. 
   As we head into the fall and winter, not too far off, people are going to have a hard time heating their homes. Poor people and retirees are going to have a hard time buying the heating oil. 
   The problem is the shortage of energy supplies here in America, and until we start making energy supplies more available to the American public, we're going to continue to have higher and higher costs. 
   We can't just talk about conservation. We can't just talk about solar and wind. We've got to talk about those things certainly, but that's only a minute part of the answer. We've got to develop nuclear energy. 
   Just below my district, Plant Vogel in Georgia is having a hard time getting permitting for two nuclear reactors. They're being blocked by the radical environmentalists and through the inane permitting process that's going on today. We need to get those reactors online. We need to get oil, coal, gas, propane, all more available so that people can have an economic future that makes sense. 
   So, as we talk about preserving things, let's preserve our families. Let's preserve our pocketbooks. Let's have money to spend to create a stronger economy. Not focus on these other things, as important as some feel that they may be. But the most important thing to America today is energy and the high cost of energy. 
   We need to do something about that. We shouldn't go home until we solve the energy problem of America, and we're not doing the American public justice when we continue talking about all these other things except energy. We need to focus on energy. Let's drill for oil. Let's drill now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and pay tribute to a faithful and innovative public school educator in my 10th Congressional District of Georgia. Michelle Paschal is the principal of Stevens Creek Elementary School in Columbia County, Georgia. Her school boasts the county's only foreign language department for elementary schools, and that program is extraordinary. 
   On January 10, I had the opportunity to observe a first grade class under the tutelage of Senora Olga Biancheri. The entire 30-minute session was conducted in Spanish, with the teacher doing her teaching through song and storytelling. I was utterly amazed to see the children comprehending and responding to what the teacher said. 
   According to Biancheri, upon completing the fifth grade, these students are more conversational than most high school students who have studied Spanish for 2 years in any school system. Many of these children are fluent. 
   Unfortunately, this remarkable foreign language program has fallen victim to State budget cuts. The 2007-2008 school year is the first year the school received no help from the State. Ms. Paschal kept the program alive by petitioning the Columbia County Board of Education and parent-teacher organizations for funding. She also used half the salary for an enrichment position, about $40,000, to pay for the Spanish teacher. Ms. Paschal and the Stevens Creek Elementary facility are to be commended for their innovative commitment to the students of Columbia County and their academic success. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise, also, to honor and pay tribute to an exceptional public school system in my 10th Congressional District in Georgia. 
   Like so many school systems in Georgia, over the past two decades the Habersham County schools have been home to a growing number of immigrant students. The State mandates that schools serve these students through a program known as ESOL, or English to Speakers of Other Languages. 
   Since the introduction of the first Laotian family to Habersham County schools in 1985, Superintendent Dr. Judy Forbes has been there from the very start, although at that time she served as instructional supervisor over the program. 
   Today, more than 22 percent of the school system's 6,800 students are enrolled in ESOL. With just 10 teachers serving 15 schools, the Habersham County school system is doing an outstanding job. Many of the kindergarten and first grade students are speaking fluent English by Thanksgiving and by Christmas. 
   For the sixth through 12th graders, Habersham County has a language intensive Newcomers Academy. Through innovative teaching techniques, including collaborating with North Georgia Technical Institute and the Cornelia-Habersham County Library, ESOL instructors report that students are learning with enthusiasm, and graduation rates are climbing. The message that teachers send to their students is that in the United States children have opportunities, and education will give them the biggest payoff. 
   These educators' dedication to all of their students, especially those for who English is their second language, is why at the beginning of this calendar year Habersham County schools became one of four Title 1 Distinguished Districts in Georgia. 
   I applaud their achievement and commend Habersham County and its educators on a job well done.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. What is propaganda? Of course, Americans engage in propaganda. It is a vital part of the mission of the United States to promote democracy and protect our country from harm. The United States spreads propaganda every day in spreading freedom and democracy across the world. 
   The military uses propaganda to recruit soldiers. TV commercials, air shows and other military events all use what is considered to be propaganda to bring out the patriotic spirit of the American youth and people. Slogans such as ``Be all you can be in the Army'' and ``The Few, the Proud, the Marines'' are all propaganda directed at the American people, and there is no deception or malice in their intent. 
   During war, propaganda can save American lives. It already has in Afghanistan and Iraq. Wouldn't we rather shoot our enemy or talk him out of fighting? For Americans fighting overseas, it could be described as persuading our enemies to lay down their arms rather than to fight us. 
   It is better to defeat our enemies with words than with guns. However, we know that commanders have already been hesitant in many cases to use propaganda during this war because they don't want to be accused of propagandizing American contractors overseas. The misconception of what kinds of propaganda are allowed has already caused harm to our soldiers overseas. 
   This amendment raises significant concerns about our ability to defeat terrorists overseas and protect American lives. This amendment would prohibit funding for propaganda, which is defined as ``any form of communication in support of national objectives designed to influence the opinions, emotions, attitudes, or behavior of the people of the United States.'' 
   This definition raises serious questions when you apply it in this sense: 
   Could we produce the propaganda within the United States and use it overseas? Would this amendment restrict U.S. military operations, including propaganda aimed at our enemies that a U.S. contractor working overseas may see? 
   Would this restrict certain types of military recruitment within the United States? 
   What about propaganda that is aimed for overseas consumption, that because of the Internet, returns to the United States and influences U.S. citizens; would that violate the prohibition? 
   Is there any way that this could interfere with the military releasing information to the media in the United States? 
   Under this amendment, would providing facts and data on successes overseas to the American public be defined as propaganda? 
   What if the information went to Members of Congress and they were to share it; is that a violation? 
   Before we vote to tie the hands of our military, we should make absolutely sure that the Hodes-DeFazio-DeLauro amendment will not constrain recruitment or warfighting efforts by not allowing the types of propaganda that we need. 
   I would hope that as this bill moves to the conference that we can work to ensure that the language is not so broad that the military cannot do its job. 
   I recommend that people vote ``no'' on this amendment because I think it would be disastrous for our Nation because it is an overly broad amendment and would hamstring and shackle our military and our government.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (MEN OUGHT ALWAYS TO PRAY AND NOT TO FAINT -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, Luke records in his Gospel that ``men ought always to pray and not to faint.'' That's in Luke 18:1. 
   I believe in the power of prayer, and I should note that the power of prayer is beheld in the One to which we pray, God Almighty. 
   Yesterday, my Governor, Sonny Perdue of Georgia, hosted a special prayer service at the Georgia Capitol to pray that the Lord would provide rain for our drought-ravaged State. Governor Perdue wisely recognized that a request such as this must be made to a higher power, and I commend him for his humility and wisdom in calling on God to provide what man cannot provide. 
   One of my favorite verses in the Bible is Jeremiah 33:3, which states ``Call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.'' 
   The book of Hebrews, in 14:16 states, ``Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.'' 
   We are a needy people, in desperate need of God's mercy and grace. Throughout Scripture, we are commanded to pray and seek God's face, not as a last resort but as the first order of business. 
   My home State of Georgia is facing one of the most severe droughts in its history. Our rivers and reservoirs are at record lows, and many of our communities face water shortages that could challenge their ability to meet water supply needs in the near and distant future. 
   The situation has gotten so bleak that the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, EPD, has declared a Level 4 drought response across the northern third of Georgia, which prohibits most types of outdoor residential water use. In fact, many nurseries and outdoor plant suppliers are going out of business because of this. 
   Worse yet, many forecasters are calling for a dry, mild winter that could result in serious water supply problems by spring. 
   I've had the privilege and honor of working with my fellow delegation members in a truly bipartisan effort to come up with practical responses, such as conservation and water management, to Georgia's water crisis. Despite our best efforts in Washington and in Georgia, there's no legislative solution to this problem. The issue at the heart of our drought problem is a severe lack of rain, and there is nothing that government can do to change that. 
   The Apostle Paul tells us to make our requests known to God with thanksgiving, so I gratefully acknowledge what the Lord has done for us already and boldly call upon Him to show favor on us yet again by sending rain to my beloved State of Georgia. God has not failed us before, and I'm confident He will not fail us now in our time of need. 
   At a time when religion has been continually forced from the public square, I want to offer my sincere thanks to Governor Perdue for his bold and faithful trust in the Almighty. His efforts helped unite hundreds of Georgians from all walks of life, leaders and citizens from varying faiths and denominations, races and ages for this prayer service. 
   So I join the Governor and fellow Georgians in calling out to God to provide rain from heaven, and I pray that the Lord will give wisdom and discernment to the Governor and each of us in leadership positions to address the drought and its devastating effects on our State and our citizens. 
   So I pray, Lord, You are sovereign and completely in control of all things, and I acknowledge Your awesome power and authority. 
   All things are in Your control, and nothing is too small or too great to bring before You. When you walked on the Earth in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, You spoke and stilled the waves and calmed the winds. You spoke into the existence, the heavens and the Earth. You created man in your image, and I know you can alleviate the severe drought conditions we face in Georgia. 
   So Lord, I ask in the name of Jesus that you bring down rain from heaven and refresh our land, fill our reservoirs and dry lakes and streams. I pray that You will quench our parched land, and I implore You, Lord, to show mercy upon us and to see us through this difficulty and show Your awesome hand in moving nature to suit Your will and bless Your people that call upon Your name. 
   Thank You, Lord for all that You have done and will continue to do for us. And I pray this in the precious powerful name of our Lord and Savior, in the name of Jesus Christ I pray this. Amen.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. ``Whereas, whenever kings, instead of protecting the lives and property of their subjects, as is their bounden duty, do endeavor to perpetrate the destruction of either, they thereby cease to be kings, become tyrants, and dissolve all ties of allegiance between themselves and their people ..... '' This was stated by Benjamin Franklin in his preamble to a congressional resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, legislation should never attempt to seize land from the public and restrict its use. Property rights are a central institution of western civilization, and they're an essential ingredient in freedom. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 is a violation of the basic principles that our Founding Fathers set out to prevent. Congress continues to ignore, neglect, disparage, and not understand its importance. 
   The Federal Government already owns nearly 650 million acres of land, half of which experience severe maintenance problems and backlogs. This legislation threatens recreation, user access, grazing, mining, oil and gas exploration, and many other public uses. By restricting access to land for exploration, this legislation is limiting the potential of the economy and directly interfering with America's entrepreneurial drive. 
   Do we know for certain that fossil fuels are not contained in these lands? At a time when gas is nearly $4 a gallon, the very last thing we should be doing is permanently restricting access to this land. 
   Government abuse is increasing on all levels, and a vote for S. 2739 is a vote for an increase in the size and scope of government. We must protect America's right to utilize and to prosper from the land. 
   John Dickinson, a signer of the Constitution, declared: ``Let these truths be indelibly impressed on our minds: that we cannot be happy without being free; that we cannot be free without being secure in our property; that we cannot be secure in our property if, without our consent, others may as by right take it away.'' 
   God's Word, the Holy Bible, says: ``In the multitude of words, sin is not lacking.'' Mr. Speaker, there's a lot of sin in this bill. 
   Stop increasing government control and regulation of American property owners and vote ``no'' on S. 2739.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that people who commit fraud should be held responsible at the highest degree. I think the greatest form of fraud that we have in America and has been part of the problem that has created this financial crisis is an act passed by Congress called the Community Development Act. This has created a system that people are fraudulently giving mortgages, but it has also created a system where groups, community development organizations such as Acorn are holding financial institutions hostage. They use threats, extortion and bribes to try to get these financial institutions to give loans to people who can't pay, and it has created a system in America that has caused a meltdown in our whole financial system. 
   If we are going to start dealing with fraud in America, we need to start dealing with the greatest source of fraud, and the Community Development Act is one of those. We need to repeal the Community Development Act. We need to stop Acorn and other types of organizations like this from threatening our financial institutions. We need to put America back on a strong financial basis. Only by repealing the Community Development Act will we do so. We have to find solutions. We can't just play around the edges as we are doing now. 
   We will be voting on a bill very shortly to try to bail out financial institutions in America. I am very skeptical of the bill, frankly. But we do know that there are some very inherent problems in bills that were passed by this House as well as the Senate and put into law. 
   We need to repeal the Community Development Act as well as other acts such as that which have created this house of cards financially that is collapsing around our ears.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Protecting the Second Amendment and Hunting Rights on Federal Lands Act of 2008. This legislation will protect the Second Amendment rights of American citizens and promote hunting activities on Federal lands. 
   Under current Federal law, land under control of the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been subject to a blanket gun ban, regardless of State law. So I was pleased with the Bush administration's recent announcement that the prohibition of firearms on National Park Service lands, in place since 1983, will soon end. 
   Currently the laws of 47 States recognize the rights of law-abiding adults to carry firearms for personal protection. The existence of different laws regarding the transportation and possession of firearms has presented a trap for law-abiding gun owners. 
   It is my hope that these new regulations, when finalized, will provide greater uniformity across our Nation's Federal laws and put an end to the patchwork of regulations that govern the different lands managed by the different Federal agencies. Under this proposal, Federal parks and wildlife refuges will now mirror State firearms laws. 
   In addition, my legislation would also require that hunting activities be considered as a land use in all management plans for all Federal land to the extent that such use is not clearly incompatible with the purposes for which the Federal land is managed. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Protecting the Second Amendment and Hunting Rights on Federal Lands Act of 2008.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (NATIONAL GLANZMANN'S THROMBASTHENIA AWARENESS DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago a beautiful young lady by the name of Julia Smith and her family came to my office. Julia lives in Augusta, Georgia and is a constituent of mine. 
   This 9-year-old young lady, when she was first born, was covered with bruises. Her parents, of course, were, needless to say, very concerned and they asked the doctor about these bruises. The parents were told that this was just from a result of a difficult delivery. 
   A short time thereafter, Julia had a little scratch on her face that resulted in bleeding that covered her whole face and, of course, her mom was frantic. The blood tests were normal. 
   The family took Julia to the Medical College of Georgia, my alma mater. I'm a medical doctor, and so I'm proud of the Medical College of Georgia of doing the testing that was required to bring about the diagnosis of Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia in Julia. 
   Her mom, Helen, was, of course, very distraught and so she started researching, trying to find out about this very rare disease. The more she searched, the more she realized that there's very little information anywhere. And she started meeting other families all around the country, whose family members also suffered from GT. 
   With the help of a small grant from a private individual, Helen Smith founded the Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia Research Foundation. And what she's doing is trying to find, certainly, the cure of this disease, but also searching to try to find ways of informing people who have this disease about the disease and help to comfort them. And so it's a research foundation that is extremely needed to try to prevent the disease symptoms which are uncontrollable bleeding, as well as very painful bruising. It's a life-threatening disease. 
   But Ms. Smith talked to me about this disease. And as a physician, as a Member of Congress, I realized that we really need to bring this disease to the forefront so that she can have some help. She's seeking for recognition. She's seeking for private grants and private funding of her foundation which is very much needed. And hopefully, this young lady, Julia Smith, can live a long and fruitful life, and we can find a cure to this disease. In fact, the researchers say that there's a possibility of finding a cure within a matter of just the next few years. 
   But without bringing public attention to the disease, Ms. Smith's going to continue to struggle to try to get the recognition that she so richly deserves for this very rare blood disorder. 
   So that's what this bill is all about. It's to promote the awareness of Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia. March 1 has been chosen as the day to establish the National Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia Awareness Day. This day was chosen to coincide with the date of the fundraiser for the research foundation. 
   I want to thank Natalie Stroud of my office and my staff for her excellent work on this resolution. 
   And I urge my colleagues to vote with me on passage of H. Res. 994.

   The leadership in the House has not allowed the Protect America Act to come to the floor, and, thus, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has expired. 
   We cannot monitor what Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan or Pakistan are talking about or his phone calls to Iran or any other place in this world. FISA only monitors phone calls from one foreign entity to another.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, last week I was here and other Republicans were here. The week before I was here. Republicans have been coming to this floor every single day since we voted to adjourn back in July. We've been here working for the American people to try to find commonsense solutions to our energy crisis. 
   We hear from the other side that they want to support the poor and the elderly. That's hogwash. The poor and the elderly are suffering more from energy prices than anything else. People can't afford to go to the doctor or drive to take their kids to school. School buses can't take kids to school. 
   We've been coming here every single day working to try to do something for the American public, but the Democrats went on vacation. They haven't continued to work like the Republicans have. We've got to find solutions to our energy crisis that makes sense economically, makes sense environmentally, and that's exactly what the American Energy Act will do. 
   So I call upon my Democratic colleagues, let's have an up or down vote on American energy so that we can make sense for the poor, the working class, everybody in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (VETERANS GUARANTEED BONUS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support today of H.R. 3793, the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act of 2007. 
   As a former military officer and an enlisted marine, I take this matter very seriously, and I am a very strong supporter of our troops and their families. As Members of Congress, we have an obligation both to stand up for our troops that have been disabled and have to leave the military, as well as surviving families of soldiers who have  made the final sacrifice to protect our Nation and our freedom. 
   There is no greater insult to our wounded warriors and their families who have sacrificed so much than to deny or revoke their bonus because of a combat-related injury or death. This bill, the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act of 2007, would guarantee that no servicemember who dies, other than as a result of a member's misconduct, or is retired or separated for disability will be required to repay any portion of a bonus or similar benefit that they have received. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government has broken too many promises to our veterans, and I consider that verging on criminality. We have an opportunity today to support our veterans and to support our troops and to fulfill a promise that was made to these veterans. 
   I urge all of my colleagues of the House to support this measure and pass H.R. 3793, the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act of 2007.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am offering this amendment because I am concerned about the intent and the function of title X and title XI. I would like to seek some clarification from the chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, my friend from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), if he would join me in a discussion. 
   Mr. Oberstar, with respect to title X, I'm concerned that if we transfer 80 percent of the funding for the Coast Guard Administrative Law Judge functions to the National Transportation Safety Board, the Coast Guard will not be able to manage the appeals process of any of the truck, rail, and port workers who might be denied the Transportation Worker Identification Credential, or TWIC, card. My concern is that we will create a bottleneck in the appeals process, effectively slowing TWIC appeals and preventing American workers from gainful employment while appeals are adjudicated. 
   Can you assure us that when this bill emerges from conference that you will make sure that the Coast Guard retains sufficient resources to address the expected TWIC appeal workload resulting from the million workers that are applying? 
   I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota.

We, unfortunately, don't have enough bipartisanship and bipartisan effort here; so I thank the chairman for that. 
   Reclaiming my time, Madam Chairman, with respect to title XI, I'm concerned that the current language might give the appearance of elevating the Coast Guard's marine safety mission above its other critical missions, such as search and rescue, national defense, and port security. 
   Can you confirm for me, Mr. Chairman, that it is not your intent to elevate this one mission above other missions that are critical for the Coast Guard?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Madam Chairman, I submit for the Record two letters, a statement from the Commandant of the Coast Guard, as well as the letter from TSA stating their concern on these titles. 
   U.S. Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard,
   Washington, DC, April 23, 2008. Hon. James L. Oberstar, Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
   Dear Chairman Oberstar: On April 18, the Committee filed with the Rules Committee an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 2830, that would be retitled the ``Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2008.'' During numerous meetings and staff-level discussions over several months, we have described how a number of provisions that appear in this amendment would compromise organizational efficiency and operational effectiveness, diminish my command and control, and ultimately reduce the Coast Guard's effectiveness in carrying out its safety, security, and stewardship missions. We have expressed these and other concerns in Department of Homeland Security views letters concerning earlier bill language. The amendment also contains provisions neither previously shared nor discussed with the Coast Guard. 
   One provision requiring that the Coast Guard provide security around liquefied natural gas terminals and tankers is contrary to the existing assistance framework, at odds with accepted risk management practices, and would divert finite Coast Guard assets from other high-priority missions. I recommend a broader discussion of security measures for all extremely hazardous cargoes. In the Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2830, the Administration has stated that, if the bill is presented to the President with this provision, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. 
   Among the others is one that, while similar to the Administration's proposal, fails to authorize the President to appoint officers to positions of importance and responsibility to accommodate organizational change in the future (Admirals and Vice Admirals). Others, primarily involving our important marine safety mission, would statutorily fix the designation and duties of other senior Coast Guard officials and officials at all levels of command, and prescribe inflexible personnel qualification requirements. Still other provisions would diminish the Coast Guard's capacity to adjudicate merchant mariner licensing matters efficiently and effectively and support other vital security adjudications of the Department of Homeland Security (Appeals to National Transportation Safety Board). Still more provisions would prescribe contracting and acquisition practices for the Deepwater program, thereby increasing the cost of, and adding delay to, the Deepwater acquisition process, as well as circumventing the review and approval authority of Coast Guard technical authorities (Coast Guard Integrated Deepwater Program). 
   Among the new provisions is one that dramatically alters admission procedures for the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. While I have discussed Academy admissions several times with Chairman Cummings and we agree that our process should yield successful cadets and reflect our diverse society, the proposed Congressional nomination process deserves full discussion and deliberate consideration. Other new provisions that affect how we execute our missions deserve similar scrutiny. Conversely, the bill omits the Administration proposal for much needed enhanced authority to prosecute those who would smuggle undocumented aliens into the United States by sea (Maritime Alien Smuggling Law Enforcement Act) and the Administration's proposal to protect seafarers who participate in investigations and adjudication of environmental crimes or who have been abandoned in the United States (Protection of and fair treatment of seafarers). 
   Over the last year in the course of hearings, personal meetings with you, and regional forums with industry, as well as in my public statements, I have assured you and the public that we share a common objective: a robust marine safety program suited to meet the evolving demands of industry and the marine public. I am already taking aggressive steps to right the balance between our marine safety mission and our other vital responsibilities, and improve the effectiveness, consistency, and responsiveness of our marine safety program, consistent with the framework I presented to you last September. Legislation such as the provisions I describe above was unnecessary to start this process. As I have stated on several occasions, I am the Commandant and am accountable to you to produce the changes needed to improve program performance. 
   Including these provisions and others in an Authorization Act that would otherwise be welcome compels me to strongly oppose the bill. 
   Sincerely, 
   T.W. Allen, Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard Commandant.  
   U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration,
   Arlington, VA, April 22, 2008. Hon. Peter T. King, Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
   Dear Congressman King: I am writing to express the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) strong opposition to Title X--Appeals to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the manager's amendment to H.R. 2830, the ``Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007.'' Title X would transfer Coast Guard Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) authority for review of merchant mariner documentation and 80 percent of the Coast Guard ALJ budget to the NTSB. This could have an adverse impact upon the adjudication of TSA's civil enforcement cases and anticipated cases dealing with the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program. 
   TSA questions whether sufficient legal, administrative, and budget resources will continue to be provided to the Coast Guard to support its remaining ALJ functions, including adjudication of TSA security cases. 
   For more than 5 years, TSA has been extremely well served by the Coast Guard ALJs as fair, impartial, and responsive adjudicators in security cases involving individuals in the transportation sector. Under an interagency agreement, Coast Guard ALJs play a major role in TSA's enforcement and security credentialing programs. They adjudicate aviation security civil penalty cases,  Hazardous Materials Endorsement (HME) and TWIC denials of requests for waivers and appeals from individuals who have received a Final Determination of Threat Assessment; appeals by air cargo workers who have received a Final Determination of Threat Assessment; and appeals by individuals holding or applying for Federal Aviation Administration certificates, ratings, or authorizations who have received a Final Determination of Threat Assessment. 
   In the absence of sufficient ALJ legal and administrative resources at the Coast Guard, TSA does not regard NTSB ALJs as a good alternative. Coast Guard ALJs have substantial expertise in fair adjudication of security programs. NTSB ALJs do not have expertise in transportation security matters. As TSA continually expands the implementation of the TWIC program and the Coast Guard enforces it at our Nation's seaports, TSA and TWIC applicants will benefit from the substantial experience Coast Guard ALJs have in the maritime security environment. 
   In addition, Coast Guard ALJs have been sensitive to the challenges faced by individuals representing themselves in a formal administrative process and have worked with TSA to develop simplified procedures. 
   TSA and Coast Guard have worked together for years to establish caseload management procedures, agreements, and funding processes to efficiently handle TSA cases. For example, the Coast Guard serves as TSA's Docketing Center for its formal hearing process. Shifting the workload to ALJs of another agency would create a huge setback for TSA enforcement and administration. ALJ coverage, budgeting, processing time, and even geographic availability would have to be reassessed and reestablished, a process that may take several years. 
   In addition, TSA's HME and TWIC are fee-based programs. TSA developed its fee models based on Coast Guard cost estimates and processing models. If conditions necessitate TSA's seeking ALJ services outside Coast Guard, this could affect program costs, and consequently, fees for applicants. 
   I would appreciate your consideration of TSA's concerns about the potential adverse impact of Title X on the efficient adjudication of important TSA security cases. 
   Identical letters have been sent to the Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee as well as the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Please do not hesitate to contact Ms. Claire Heffernan, Acting Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs, at (571) 227-2717 if you have any questions about this matter. 
   Sincerely yours, 
   Kip Hawley, Assistant Secretary.  
   I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn. 
   There was no objection.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Madam Speaker, is America giving visas and diplomatic immunity to terrorist sponsors who wish to destroy our country? 
   The United States has designated North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Syria, and Sudan as state sponsors of terrorism. These terrorist-sponsoring states are actively engaged in espionage against America.  
   Two months ago reports surfaced that Cuba is placing top intelligence operatives known as ``ambassador spies'' in key embassies worldwide to gather information and provide intelligence to America's enemies. In July of last year, Germany expelled an Iranian diplomatic for attempting to acquire nuclear components for the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. In December of 2006, South Korea indicted five people on charges of spying for North Korea for allegedly passing on ``national secrets'' such as U.S. troop movements, among other things. 
   Let me give you another example. Three years in a row, in 2002, 2003 and 2004, personnel from the Iranian Mission to the United Nations were actually caught, they were actually caught, photographing and videotaping the New York subway and other popular landmarks in New York City. Who knows what other things they were involved in that we do not know about? 
   These are not our friends, and yet we allow them to use the United Nations as a cover for their activities. Over 6,600 visas have been issued to diplomats, representatives, and other individuals from state sponsors of terrorism for the past 5 years. Some of these individuals with diplomatic immunity have already been expelled for spying, or in diplomatic terms, ``engaging in activities inconsistent with their duties.'' Most of these individuals would not be otherwise allowed into our country. 
   U.S. Public Law 357, enacted in 1947, clarified the United Nations Headquarters Agreement of November 21, 1947. In section 6, this law states that ``nothing in the agreement shall be construed as in any way diminishing, abridging or weakening the right of the United States to safeguard its own security,'' and in particular, ``completely to control the entrance of aliens into any territory of the United States other than the U.N. headquarters district and its immediate vicinity.'' 
   The bill I am introducing with my colleagues today, the LIMITS Act, Limiting the Intrusive Miles of International Terrorist Sponsors Act of 2008, would limit the vicinity for state sponsors of terrorism to a half-mile radius of the U.N. complex. Half of a mile is more than enough space for personnel to obtain lodging, food and other necessities, even medical care, and it will be easier and more cost effective for the U.S. intelligence community and law enforcement to monitor suspected individuals when necessary. 
   Current mileage restrictions are far too lax to be effective. Some individuals from countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism are permitted to travel within a 25-mile radius of Columbus Circle in New York City. That is 50 miles from end to end which is a horrendously large area to effectively monitor hundreds of terrorist sponsors. And yet some countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism have no mileage restrictions at all. 
   This is a vulnerability that we have ignored for way too long. Foreign espionage against the United States has increased in recent years. In the case of the United Nations, there is no trade-off or reciprocity. All of the risk is borne by the United States. Why are we continuing to ignore this problem? 
   It is time to level the playing field by providing a consistent, strict standard for personnel from state sponsors of terrorism, while simultaneously easing the burden on the U.S. intelligence community and the law enforcement community responsible for ensuring our safety. 
   I urge all of my colleagues that have not done so already to cosponsor this bill, the LIMITS Act of 2008. I encourage the leadership of the House of Representatives to bring this bill to the floor for a vote as soon as possible. Our security depends upon it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Madam Speaker, as a young man, I came to believe that it was simply my duty as a citizen to serve in our Nation's Armed Forces. So, it was just a natural thing for me to volunteer for service back in the early 60s. I joined the Marines, later also served as a medical officer in the Navy, and finally took a billet in the Georgia Air National Guard. 
   My military experiences, I believe, helped make me a better man. It certainly gave me an understanding of military life, and first-hand knowledge of the needs facing military personnel, military families, and our veterans. Those insights guide me as the Congressman for Georgia's 10th Congressional District. 
   The Federal Government must fulfill its promises to our veterans. We must give them the very best quality health care that is available anywhere in this country. It's important not only to the current veterans but also to the troops that are on active duty today, as well as the volunteers that we need to recruit to serve their country in the military. 
   As a medical student in Augusta, GA, and during my residency training, I worked in a number of VA hospitals. This experience gives me a unique perspective toward the veterans' needs, which most Members of Congress are not privileged to have. Consequently I have a tremendous desire to get the Federal Government to fulfill the promises it has broken to our  national heroes, the veterans. This bill is a step in that direction. 
   It is critical that the VA facilities in our Nation are modern, best equipped, and able to give the kind of care that our veterans deserve. 
   This bill will help to do that by giving veterans in Georgia and the Southeast a modem, up-to-date facility. 
   I am very sure that keeping the United States the freest Nation in the history of the world means that we must maintain the most powerful military on Earth. 
   As a member of Congress my priorities regarding military issues are these: 
   1. Provide our troops with the best training and the best technology. 
   2. Provide adequate compensation and benefits. 
   3. Do everything I can to help promote high morale and espirit de corps. 
   4. Support the spouses and children of military personnel. 
   5. Improve medical care for our wounded warriors and our veterans. 
   6. Keep the commitments made to our veterans regarding benefits. 
   I want to take just a moment of your time to provide you with an update on what I have done since I won the Special Election and was sworn into office last July: 
   1. Co-sponsored H.R. 3793 Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act of 2007 requiring the secretary of Defense to continue to pay to a member of the armed forces who is retired or separated from the armed forces due to a combat-related injury certain bonuses that the member was entitled to before the retirement or separation and would continue to be entitled to if the member was not retired or separated. 
   2. Co-sponsored H.R. 1110 amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow federal civilian and military retirees to pay health insurance premiums on a pretax basis and to allow a deduction for TRICARE supplemental premiums. 
   3. Co-sponsored H. Res. 111 establishing a Select POW and MIA Affairs Committee. 
   4. Co-sponsored H.J. Res. 67 supporting a base defense budget that at the very minimum matches four percent of gross domestic product. 
   5. Co-sponsored H. Res. 784 recognizing and honoring, in community post offices, the service of men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces deployed overseas. 
   6. Co-sponsored H.R. 1808 designating the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Augusta, GA, as the `Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.' 
   7. Supported and spoke in favor of this bill S. 1396 to authorize a major medical facility project to modernize inpatient wards at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Atlanta, Georgia 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill as well as any future bills that will give veterans the kind of health care they deserve.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Speaker is absolutely right, but this is about their values, not America's values. We hear it's about the children. The Democrat Party's budget, the one that they have proposed, is going to bankrupt our children. They are not going to live at a standard of life as we live today because of their budget, if this is put into place. 
   The Republican budget is about the children, because it will save their future. Our budget is about the children's well-being. The Democratic Party's budget is about their values, bigger government, greater control of people's lives. They want to do that. They want to take money away from hardworking American citizens and build a bigger government, and they want to tax them to death, tax them into bankruptcy. 
   But our budget doesn't do that. It actually helps to balance the budget. It helps to have a future for our children. That's the difference. Our budget is about the children. It's about families. It's about businesses. It's about having a strong financial future for small business. That's what our budget does. Their budget guarantees a bigger future for government bureaucrats.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Latta, for yielding.  
   I appreciate this opportunity to come and speak today on this issue that is so drastically important to the American people. Everybody, rich and poor, black and white, all races, all nationalities, everybody in America is suffering from the high cost of energy. 
   When we voted on the morning of August 1 to go home for a 5-week break, that afternoon I was part of the group of Republicans here on the floor demanding, demanding that we go back in session to find some commonsense solutions to the high cost of gasoline at everybody's gas pump. Everybody in this Nation, even if you don't have a car, if you drive a bicycle or a motorcycle or a scooter, is suffering from the consequences of the high cost of energy. When you go to the grocery store and try to buy bread, milk, eggs, bacon, the cost of those goods in your grocery store are going to continue to go up because of the high cost of energy. 
   We hear from the controlling party, the Democrats, from Speaker Pelosi--now, there are some on the other side that would like to have a vote, that would like to see the energy costs come down. Many of our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle would vote for a comprehensive energy plan that would literally lower the cost of gasoline, would lower the cost of heating oil, would lower the cost of all energy sources here in America. But they can't have that opportunity to vote on a comprehensive plan. We can't have an opportunity to vote on a comprehensive plan. Why is that so? Frankly, if the American Energy Act would come to this floor for a vote, I think it would pass overwhelmingly. But Speaker Pelosi and Steny Hoyer, the majority leader, won't let that act come here, to have an up-and-down vote, to have an open discussion, a frank debate about all the issues within that act. 
   Now, what does the act do? The act taps into our own American energy sources, taps into our own energy sources. Doing so is absolutely critical. We have to stop this dependence upon Middle Eastern oil. We are funding governments who hate America, who want to destroy us, and they are in turn funding al Qaeda, the insurgency in Iraq, the insurgency in Afghanistan. They're funding people who are in our country today who want to attack the very fiber of our Nation. We have to stop that dependency upon foreign oil, whether it's Middle Eastern oil, Venezuelan oil, North African oil, or anywhere else. We have to tap into our own natural resources. America is the only nation in the world, the only nation in the world, that won't develop its own natural resources. 
   I became a political activist coming to Washington. I was practicing medicine in rural South Georgia, coming here to this Nation's capital to lobby as a volunteer about hunters' rights and gun owners' rights and conservation issues. I'm a scientist. I'm a medical doctor. And I believe that all of our policy ought to be based on science. Not on emotionalism, not on what the name of something is, but on science. And I believe very strongly that we have to be good stewards of God's creation. We're charged biblically to do so. We have to be good stewards of our environment. And I'm a conservationist, a very ardent conservationist. We can tap into our own natural resources. We can develop those God-given resources, what we call fossil fuel, air through wind as it moves around our country, through the sun, through solar resources. We can tap into those resources. But we are denied a vote on an act that would do everything. We call it the ``all-of-the-above plan.'' 
   We hear our colleagues on the Democratic side, the controlling party, say, well, let the oil companies drill. They already have leases. They can't drill. Why is that? My friends, my colleagues, American people, oil companies can't drill because of endless lawsuits by the radical environmentalists. Any bill that's presented has to include some mechanism to stop the endless lawsuits by these radical environmentalists that don't want any drilling. They don't want us to develop any of our natural resources. They don't want us to do anything. I think they want us to live in a cave or in a tree. Come to think of it, they don't want us to live in the trees because they think that destroying the forests would be adverse to their philosophy. So I think they want us to live in a cave. I guess we'd have to go and pick up sticks to make a fire and cook our food. A lot of them don't want us to even go out and harvest some of the bountiful animals that we have in those forests that I enjoy eating as a hunter and as a fisherman. But the leadership of the Democratic Party is listening to those radical environmentalists, and they closed down this Congress on August 1 at 11:23 in the morning when many of us wanted to just come to this floor, as is our right, as is our privilege, to talk about energy. 
   That afternoon I was here as part of that group, as I have already mentioned, demanding the ability to bring 
   the American Energy Act to the floor for an up-and-down vote, to have a debate, an open debate, with amendments, to allow everybody to put their two cents worth in, to talk about their philosophy, to offer their suggestions, to find some commonsense solutions to our energy dependence on foreign sources. 
   It's a national security issue for us to be dependent upon those nations who want to destroy America. It's an economic issue because our dependency upon them makes us subservient to them. 
   The high cost of energy is raising the cost of health care in my business. It's raising the cost of groceries in the grocery store. It's raising the cost of every single good and service in this Nation. 
   I as well as many others came during the August break to this floor to try to do the people's work, to demand a vote on a commonsense solution to this energy crisis we have in America. Right now today America is drilling for ice on Mars; yet we cannot drill for oil in America. It's insane. We have to change that. We have to tap into our oil and gas resources offshore and in ANWR. 
   I have already mentioned that I hunt. I have been on the North Slope of the Brooks Range. I've been out flying over the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR. I've seen the caribou herds that we keep hearing about from the Democratic majority that would be harmed. That's hogwash. They didn't want the pipeline. I have flown over the pipeline. I've camped out by the pipeline. I've seen the caribou herds in Alaska blossom and reproduce and get more numerous because of the pipeline. I've seen pictures of grizzly bear walking down the pipeline. It's actually helped the wildlife. 
   We have the technology today where we can tap into those oil resources in ANWR, offshore, all over this Nation, and can do it in an environmentally responsible way, as we must, as I want to see happen, as a lot of my Democratic colleagues would like to see happen. But we cannot get a vote. 
   I have got a picture here. One of the Democratic folks told us the Democrats' energy plan was to ``drive small cars and wait for the wind.'' I don't think most of us want to drive around in small cars waiting for the wind. We don't have to. We can lower the cost of gasoline. We have to tap into our own natural resources to be able to do so. We can stop our dependence on Middle Eastern oil by voting into law the American energy plan. We can make America secure by voting for the American energy plan. 
   Whom is Ms. Pelosi listening to? She's from San Francisco. She thinks those radical environmentalists out there are normal people. 
   But the American people know different. The American people know and want an energy plan that makes sense to lower their cost of gas at the pumps. But we need more than that. It's September. People are starting to buy their home heating oil. Poor people, retirees on fixed incomes are going to have to pay a lot more money for their home heating oil. Many are not going to be able to afford to buy their supplies for the winter. The people that we hear from the Democratic majority that they want to represent the most, the poor people and the elderly of this Nation, are going to be radically affected and harmed because Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Hoyer, the Democratic leadership, will not allow a vote on the American Energy Act. 
   I represent the 10th Congressional District in Georgia, northeast Georgia. One of the cities in my district is Athens, where the University of Georgia is. I'm a proud Bulldog. Go Dawgs. Our  head football coach, Mark Richt, has a three-word phrase he uses to energize the football team: ``Finish the drill.'' As a congressman, I have got a three-word phrase to energize America: ``Start the drill.'' We have to start the drill. We have to tap into our own natural resources and develop America's resources. We have to develop alternative sources of energy. That's absolutely critical because we have a dwindling supply of oil and eventually it's going to run out. We have to develop the wind and solar energy that my Democratic friends just keep talking about. T. Boone Pickens says that's half the answer. That's hogwash also. It's only a small part of the answer. It's less than 10 percent. But we have to develop wind and solar. The American Energy Act does that. 
   Just south of my district, just south of Augusta, Georgia, the Georgia Power Company is trying to put in two nuclear reactors, and they have been doing that for decades. But because of the radical environmentalists and governmental regulations and endless lawsuits, they can't build the two nuclear reactors to add to the two that are already there. We have the technology to make nuclear energy safe. Nuclear energy is the only thing that makes environmental sense and economic sense to develop electric energy in this Nation. We have to develop nuclear energy.     
   We have to develop hydrogen. We have to develop new batteries. We have to conserve. And I am a conservationist. Conservation has to be a part of the answer. We have to do it all. Well, guess what, American public? The Republican's American energy act does all of that. We must have a vote. 
   So, Republicans, on the afternoon that we were forced to go home on this 5-week break, Republicans have been coming here every single day since that day, since August 1, to try to get our Democratic colleagues to come back here and do America's work, the American peoples' work, to vote on a comprehensive energy act bill that would do all of the above: Would tap into America's bountiful natural resources, that would develop nuclear energy, would develop alternative sources of energy, would develop conservation issues, would stimulate the innovativeness of the American public to develop new sources of energy. There may be a source of energy we have never dreamed of. 
   We have to do all of those things. The American energy act will do just that. We can't have the Democratic energy plan of driving small cars and waiting for the wind. We have got to lower the cost of gas at the pump. We have got to lower the cost of home heating oil. 
   Republicans are here fighting for the poor people. We are here fighting for the elderly on limited incomes. The Democratic leadership are just doing what my son calls ``dissing'' them. The leader on the Democratic side, Speaker Pelosi is dissing poor people, dissing the elderly, those who are hurt most by us not having the vote. 
   So I come here tonight with my colleagues, and I applaud Mr. Latta and Mr. Burton and Mr. Barton and Judge Carter for coming here tonight to bring forth to the American people the idea that Republicans are here for the American people. We are here trying to find those solutions. We have been here through the whole August break, inviting our Democratic colleagues to come back and do the peoples' work, the poor peoples' work, the elderly's work, everybody's work, to lower the cost of energy. 
   And so I just call upon my Democratic colleagues, particularly those many over here on the Democratic side who would like to have a vote, please ask your leadership to bring the American energy act to the floor for a vote with an open rule so that we can have all the amendments that you want to put in, all the amendments that our folks want to put in, have an open debate, but let's do the American peoples' job in the peoples' House. Let's do the peoples' work to find some solutions to this energy crisis that is an economic crisis and a national security crisis for America. So I call upon my Democratic colleagues to get your leadership to allow us to have a vote on the American energy act. 
   I thank Mr. Latta for the opportunity to come here and discuss this, and I applaud your efforts, I applaud my other colleagues' efforts, and I thank you for this opportunity. Maybe the American people will listen. 
   When I was here in the dimly lit House with no microphones, no cameras--different from tonight--and we had the tourists sitting here on the floor of the House, I asked them to go home and not just enjoy being in this historic moment sitting on the floor of the House of Representatives but to go home to contact their Member of Congress and demand a vote on the American energy act. 
   Former U.S. Senator Everett Dirksen one time said, when he feels the heat, he sees the light. What he was saying is when his constituents in his State start contacting him through calls and letters, that he would start feeling the heat. We need the American public all over this country to start putting heat on their U.S. Senators and their Members of the U.S. House by calling, writing, e-mailing, visiting district offices, visiting Washington offices, and demanding a vote on a comprehensive energy package that would lower their costs of energy, whether it's gasoline, home heating oil, electricity. That is what the American energy plan is all about, is to lower our energy costs. 
   So I applaud your efforts tonight, sir, my friend, and dear colleague, and I ask the American public to get busy to apply the heat to your Member of Congress. Write them, call them, e-mail them, and demand a vote on the American energy act so we can have an up-or-down vote, open debate to lower your cost of energy, lower your cost of gasoline, lower your cost of groceries, lower your cost of health care, lower your cost of every good and service that you have to buy to make America secure. Energy secure. 
   I thank you, sir, for your leadership. I applaud you, and I thank you for this opportunity to come back today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Madam Speaker, today America is drilling for ice on Mars, yet we cannot drill for oil in America. We have billions of gallons of crude oil in America that we can't even tap into because of a failed policy by the majority. We can't drill for oil. Just yesterday, I filled up my car and paid $3.99.9 a gallon. 
   It is crazy that we can't drill for oil. We have to have responsible energy policy that gives us more supply. It is not about wind or electricity or taxing oil. The Democrats want to put a 50 cents a gallon tax on every gallon of diesel and gasoline in America. That is inane. That is not energy policy. 
   We have to drill for oil now. We have to streamline the permitting process for refineries. We have to supply more gas to people. It is a national security policy, it is an economic policy that we cannot continue that the majority has given us today. We need a responsible energy policy.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank my colleague. 
   According to AAA, the average American is paying over $4.04 per gallon of gasoline today. Meanwhile, Communist China and Fidel Castro's Communist Cuba are moving forward with drilling for oil and gas just 45 miles off of the coast of Florida and Key West. 
   We cannot even drill for oil or gas 200 miles off our own shores; yet congressional Democrats continue to refuse to allow access to American gas and oil supplies. The average price of gasoline has gone up $1.71 per gallon since Speaker Pelosi's promise, promise, to lower energy prices at the beginning of the 110th Congress, this Congress. 
   What have the Democrats done to try to help hardworking Americans? They're simply seeking political gain from America's pain. Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama said he wants to impose more taxes on U.S. oil companies. Is that really a smart solution? This will only drive up prices on Americans, not just for gasoline but for every product or service purchased. Even worse is that foreign oil companies will not be subject to this joke of a solution. 
   The liberals propose raising the Federal tax on gasoline and diesel by 50 cents per gallon. This is on top of the already existing Federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel. Under this proposal, you will be paying at today's prices $4.54 a gallon for gas. 
   Liberals also suggest mandating ethanol and renewable fuel production and selling it as the answer to America's energy needs. The 2007 lack of energy bill has already proven that the Democratic solution is wrong. Mandating the production of renewable fuels has only led to an increase in world food prices.     
   It is, at best, disingenuous, and at worst, an outright lie to say that renewable fuels can meet America's needs in the near future. As a good southerner, I love my corn bread and grits. It makes no sense to put corn in the tank of my truck. 
   The Department of the Interior estimates that there are 112 billion particles of recoverable oil beneath U.S. Federal lands and coastal waters, enough oil to fuel 60 million cars for 60 years. The United States is the only nation in the world that forbids any production on its Outer Continental Shelf. Despite a decades-long record of environmentally responsible offshore production, over 80 percent of America's oil and natural gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf are completely off limits to exploration and production. 
   The OCS, Outer Continental Shelf, is estimated to hold at least 419 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas resources and 86 billion barrels of oil. To put it in simple terms, this is enough natural gas to heat 100 million homes for 60 years, and enough oil to drive 85 million cars for 35 years, and enough oil to completely replace current Middle Eastern oil imports for 59 years. 
   We've heard time and time again about how drilling off the OCS will harm the environment. This is hogwash. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed or damaged hundreds of drilling rigs without causing a single drop to be spilled, yet congressional Democrats continue to pander to far left environmentalists instead of mending the pains of hardworking Americans. 
   Liberals also prevent any access to billions of barrels of oil located in ANWR. The entire area of ANWR is larger than the combined areas of five States--Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware--yet the proposed drilling area is equal to one-sixth the size of Dulles Airport here in Washington, D.C. 
   Energy prices are soaring. And the financial pain that families are feeling at the pump is forcing them to decide what they can and cannot spend. Congressional Democrats act as if they have been living under a rock by continuing to ignore the demands of the American people and refusing to do anything to lower these burdensome prices. 
   Skyrocketing gas prices and a risky dependence on fuel supply by volatile foreign nations highlight our need for an American energy policy that emphasizes production and decreases our reliance on Middle Eastern oil. 
   The United States is the only nation on Earth that forbids development of its own natural resources. Right now, America is drilling for ice on Mars, but we cannot drill for oil in America. This makes no sense. It's crazy. It's idiotic. We must drill on our own lands, and we must drill now. We must streamline the permitting process and the refinery processes to get new refineries online, and we must end our dependence on Middle Eastern oil. 
   Mr. Walberg, I greatly appreciate your doing this tonight; it is absolutely critical. I'm a medical doctor, as you know. I have patients who have to decide whether they can go to the doctor or not because gasoline prices are so high. I have patients who have to decide whether they can put a tank of gas in their car or they can go buy medications. This has to end. And we can do something about it. We can do something about it now if we have a responsible energy policy. 
   Our conference, as you know, has put forth a plan, a reasonable plan, an economically viable plan, an environmentally sensitive plan, a plan that will end this dependence upon Middle Eastern oil. It's a plan where we can provide the energy sources, not only our oil resources, but provide electric resources by permitting nuclear energy. 
   We have not built a new refinery in America for 30 years. We have not built a new nuclear reactor in 25 years. This is nuts, it's absolutely crazy. And we've got to end this idiocy of this current policy. 
   I applaud what you're doing here tonight. I look forward to further discussion from our other colleagues. I know that we have colleagues that want to ask questions and want to engage in a colloquy, if that's agreeable with you.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I agree with that totally. The other thing is propane is a byproduct of the refinery process of gasoline as well as natural gas. And we already know that propane is an environmentally protective agent. And we have had, in the past, fleets of cars fueled by propane. I know at my hunting camp down in rural southwest Georgia, I have fueled my house down there in my hunting camp with propane. And I know a lot of people heat their homes with it. And most propane, from what I understand, is produced here in America and sold here in America. 
   So tapping into our oil sources would give us an additional source of energy that we are not getting today if my understanding is correct, and so we can further protect the environment by having more propane utilized in our own energy, as well as stop the production of carbon in the atmosphere that the environmentalists are so bent that it is causing global warming. And I am not so certain about that. I don't really think that is so.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to present a resolution promoting awareness of Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia, a little known, yet debilitating disorder that affects numerous Americans every day. 
   Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia is a genetic blood disorder that is inherited, putting children and young adults at risk. Leading physicians report that Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia presents many symptoms that are often mistaken for other bleeding disorders. This, along with the lack of information on the disorder itself, has caused Glanzmann's to be frequently misdiagnosed. People with Glanzmann's are missing a protein on the surface of the platelet that is vital to the clotting process. People suffering from this disorder have serious problems with uncontrollable bleeding and severe, painful bruising. Their activities can be strictly limited and their lives can be at stake without any warning. Currently there is no cure for this disorder, but research is very promising. The leading researchers in this field firmly believe a cure for Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia can be found through current ongoing research. With proper funding, Glanzmann's could be controllable in the foreseeable future, and some suggest as soon as 10 years from now. 
   A young constituent of mine who lives in Augusta, Georgia, suffers from Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia. Julia Smith is only 9 years old and every day lives and deals with the realities of her disorder. When Julia was born, she was covered in bruises, but blood tests came back normal. Doctors assured her parents that the bruising was just the result of a difficult delivery. When Julia was 6 weeks old, she got a tiny scratch on her cheek; this small scratch bled enough to cover her entire face in blood and saturate her sheets. After this 
   incident, Julia's mother, Helen, took her to the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta and asked that tests be run to find out what was wrong with her daughter. After countless tests and consultations, the Medical College of Georgia's Children's Medical Center physicians diagnosed Julia with Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia. 
   Frantic for information that could save her daughter, Mrs. Smith attempted to research the disorder, and was frustrated and disheartened by the lack of available information. She began to put her name and information on internet registries for individuals suffering from other disorders, hoping that someone who had similar symptoms would make contact with her. She found numerous cases of people equally distraught, seeking information for themselves or their loved one who was dealing with the same misdiagnosed disorder. This realization, along with a small contribution from the grandmother of a Glanzmann's sufferer who wanted to donate money to help others, compelled Mrs. Smith to begin the Glanzmann's Research Foundation in 2001. This non-profit foundation is the focal point for information to others in need and the sole source for funding the ongoing research efforts that will lead to a cure. Mrs. Smith is truly a mother on a mission. 
   Augusta, Georgia, holds a special place in my heart. I graduated from the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta in 1971, and I am proud to have begun my medical career there. I am delighted to represent a city that contains, not only the Glanzmann's Research Foundation, which is quite significant in its own right, but also the preeminent public medical college in the southeast, the Medical College of Georgia. 
   To promote awareness for Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia, March 1 has been recommended as the day to establish a National Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia Awareness Day. This date was chosen to coincide with the Glanzmann's Research Foundation's annual fundraiser.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (CELEBRATING NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 21 years ago in the fall of 1986, I found myself sitting on the couch in my medical office in rural south Georgia. 
   My wife, Nickie, and I had been married a year and we were struggling. I had been through several broken marriages, several episodes of broken relationships and financial problems because I had been living for myself. I'd been living a prideful, sinful, self-centered lifestyle. 
   And as I sat there trying to figure out what life was all about, I looked at the table beside the couch upon which I sat, and there was a Gideon Bible sitting there, Mr. Speaker. And as I looked at that, I remembered a few weeks before I was watching a professional football game, and as the cameras panned the crowd, there was a banner hanging over a railing up in the stands. And the big banner was there. The gentleman had this big rainbow-type of hair wig on, and the banner said John 3:16. At that time, it piqued my interest. I asked my wife, Nickie, what John 3:16 said, and she didn't know. She wasn't raised in a religious household either. We didn't even have a Bible in our home to find out. 
   As I sat there in my office that fall trying to figure out life, I picked up the Bible that was on the table beside the couch, and I opened it up and I read John 3:16: For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever shall believe in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. 
   I remembered just a few weeks before sitting on a dock and telling my wife that I didn't believe there was any afterlife, that I did not believe that there was a God, that I did not believe that we had anything beyond this life besides just how people remembered us or through our own kids. 
   But when I read John 3:16 that day, as a scientist, as a medical doctor, my heart was pricked, and I just prayed out and openly and said, God, if you're real, I want you to come into my life; I want you to show me that you're real. And as a scientist, I had to have proof, and God really came into my life and He has changed my life. 
   He's given me a stability in life that comes from no other source than having the Lord Jesus Christ as one's own personal Lord and Savior, and I accepted Him that day in November of 1986. My wife was saved independently just a few months after that. 
   She and I have been married 22 years now. We have a relationship that can come from no other source, from being based in God's inherent word and have learned over the years that the Holy Bible is true, it's literal, and it's God's direction to us. I call it the manufacturer's handbook. It directs every aspect of life. 
   God ordained three social entities. He ordained the family, He ordained the church, and He ordained government. Romans 13:1 is very clear about that. The Bible gives us instructions on how to live our lives, every aspect of our lives. Each one of those social entities God's given its area of responsibility, its area of authority. 
   And unfortunately, in our Nation, because of this mistaken idea that we're supposed to have a separation of church and State, the family and the church have abdicated a lot of its duties over to government. But, Mr. Speaker, what we're doing in our society is not according to God's instructions. 
   In my home, I have two sets of machines, both washer and dryer. One set of machines washes and dries my clothes; the other machine washes and dries my dishes. Mr. Speaker, if we take our dishes and try to wash them in our clothes washers, we're going to have problems. 
   And that's what we're doing in our society today, Mr. Speaker, is we're trying to do things against God's inherent word. We're trying to live our lives according to what seems right in the eyes of man, but the scripture is very clear about that. 
   In Proverbs, we read that there is a way that seems right now as a man but its path is the way of death, and it's going to be the death of freedom. It's going to be the death of our society. It's going to be the death of our Republic unless we turn back to what our Founding Fathers very firmly believed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe in the Constitution as James Madison and company meant it to be. I carry a copy in my pocket. We've left this document, the great Constitution, as James Madison meant it as how we run our government, how we run our lives publicly. 
   During this time when we're celebrating National Bible Appreciation Week, I call on my colleagues to read the Bible, to read the Constitution, read what our Founding Fathers who were Bible-believing Christians believed, that every aspect of life should follow the dictates of God's inherent Word.  
   That's what I believe in. That's what we all should believe in, and I just praise the Lord Jesus Christ who came into my life that November day. And He saved my life for all of eternity, and I'm living an eternal life today, and He's given me a stability. 
   Our country is founded on those principles. Our Constitution's written on those principles that God gives us in His Word. 
   So I rise today to support Him first and foremost and support the Bible as the basis of our Nation. I look forward to serving the Lord Jesus Christ.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I thank my good friend for yielding, and I appreciate what you're doing tonight. 
   Energy is the lifeblood of the American economy. Our economic prosperity is closely tied to the availability of reliable and affordable supplies of energy. Unfortunately, U.S. energy production has grown only 13 percent while energy consumption has increased 30 percent since 1973. 
   According to AAA, the average American is paying over $4.07 per gallon for gasoline today. Instead of traveling to spend time with loved ones, record gas prices will keep many Americans home this 4th of July weekend. 
   Skyrocketing gas prices and a risky dependence upon fuel supply by volatile foreign nations highlight our need for an American energy policy that emphasizes production and decreases our reliance upon foreign oil. 
   Many here in Congress bemoan America's addiction to foreign oil, yet they refuse to allow access to American oil and gas supplies necessary to cure this addiction. America has been blessed with abundant natural resources, and we should not be hesitant to tap into them, especially at a time when energy cost is so high. 
   We've heard time and time again about how drilling off the coast in the Outer Continental Shelf will harm the environment. This is pure hogwash. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed or damaged literally hundreds of drilling rigs without causing the spill of a single drop. Yet congressional Democrats continue to pander to the far left environmental whackos instead of mending the pains of hardworking Americans. 
   We cannot even drill for oil or gas 200 miles off our own shore. Meanwhile, communist China and Fidel Castro's communist Cuba are moving forward with plans for drilling for oil and gas only 45 miles off of the shores of Key West. Liberal Democrats have also prevented any access to the billions of barrels of oil located in ANWR. 
   The entire area of ANWR is larger than the combined areas of five States--Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Delaware--yet the proposed drilling area is equal to one-sixth the size of Dulles Airport here in Washington, D.C. 
   Development of American oil and gas on these lands will help bring the price down and help break the stranglehold on energy that hostile countries in the Middle East enjoy. And this can be done in an environmentally sound manner and should be immediately implemented. 
   The environmental groups haven't allowed a new oil refinery to be built in the United States for decades, about 30 years. It does little good to increase our use of domestic supplies of oil when we do not have the refinery capacity to quickly convert it into a useable form, gasoline. Members on both sides of the aisle need to stand up to these fringe groups and implement policies that encourage the construction of new refineries in the United States. 
   Liberals also suggest mandating ethanol and renewable fuel production and selling it as the answer to America's energy needs. The 2007 ``non-energy'' energy bill, or ``lack of energy'' bill has already proven that the Democratic solution is wrong, dead wrong. Mandating the production of renewable fuels has only led to an increase in world food prices. It is, at best, disingenuous, and at worst, an outright lie to say that renewable fuels can meet America's needs in the near future.     
   As a good southerner, I love my cornbread and grits. It makes no sense to me to put corn in the tank of my pickup truck. 
   Energy prices are soaring, and the financial pain that families are feeling at the pump is forcing them to decide what they can and cannot spend. Congressional Democrats act as if they have been living under a rock by continuing to ignore the demands of the American people and refusing to do anything to lower these burdensome prices. Skyrocketing gas prices and a risky dependence on fuel supplied by volatile foreign nations highlight our need for an American energy policy that emphasizes production and decreases our reliance upon Middle Eastern oil. 
   The United States is the only nation on Earth that forbids development of its own natural resources. Listen to me. Right now America is drilling for ice on Mars; yet we cannot drill for oil in America. That makes no sense. It's idiotic. It's stupid. We must drill on our own lands and we must do it now. We must streamline our oil refinery processes, and we must end our dependence upon Middle Eastern oil. 
   Our energy prices were not created overnight and will not be solved overnight. Congress must act swiftly to address this growing energy crisis. America's energy policy must make us stronger and less reliant on countries that are hostile to freedom. Passing any so-called energy bill that fails to produce even a single kilowatt of new energy or produce a gallon of gas is not a solution. We must pass legislation that will allow for responsible use of our known American supplies of energy, that reduce excessive and burdensome environmental policies, and that encourage the development of alternative forms of energy. We need to increase nuclear power. It's the only thing that has proven to be incredibly safe. It's a successful source of energy, and it's the only thing that makes sense economically. 
   I stand ready to fight for this, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Latta, I appreciate your working tonight to bring this issue forward. It's absolutely critical for the American public that we stop this dependence upon Middle Eastern oil. These countries want to destroy us. They hate our freedom. They hate our market system. They hate everything that we stand for. They even hate women. They want to use them as tools. And yet we are funding these countries that want to destroy us. It makes no sense. We have got to develop an energy policy that makes sense economically, environmentally, and makes us not dependent upon these countries that want to destroy us. 
   I highly commend your effort tonight. I am glad to have joined you tonight, and I look forward to working with you and the rest of the Members. 
   Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, I just love you and I appreciate your passion and your fervor in fighting for change in our policy. It's absolutely critical. So I applaud your efforts. I know last week I saw you fighting down here on the floor again for the same issues, and I am at awe of your fervor towards this. But we must end our dependence on foreign oil, and I appreciate both of you as well as Congressman Whitman's participation tonight in this Special Order. Thank you so much, and I just praise God for you and your efforts tonight.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. I have got a comment and a question. Last week, we heard members of the other party come to this floor and talk over and over again about the oil companies have thousands of acres that they already have leased and that they are not drilling in them. It's my understanding that a lot of this is land that the oil companies just leased up so that they would have the prerogative to be able to do so in the future. 
   I think this is correct, is that not so?

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. That is the point that I was just wanting you to bring up, is that all this land that the oil companies have leased over the years, they have temporary leases, that when those leases expire, the land turn back. In fact, I have got a friend, the Dudleys in Athens, Georgia, who lease some land in Alabama to an oil company to drill for gas. They had that lease for a number of years. The oil company never drilled. That lease has expired. So those friends of mine, Randy and Mary Dudley, in Athens, Georgia, today, don't have the lease money coming in as they did. The oil company never drilled there. 
   That is true all over this country, from what I understand. We just hear from the Democrats over and over again that the oil companies have all this land, but it's land where there's no oil. They just lease it in case that they may be able to find oil or gas. But we know there's oil, we know there's gas on the Outer Continental Shelf. In fact, it's my understanding that only about 15 percent of the land in the Outer Continental Shelf is actually leased, that we could tap into. Is that correct?

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Well, in fact we know that there is oil and gas out there; in fact, trillions of cubic feet of gas. Gas, when we burn it, is a very clean fuel. Those who adhere to this global warming hysteria, which I think is a hysteria and not fact; in fact, I am a medical doctor and scientifically I have looked at this issue, and there are many scientists on both sides, a lot that say that global warming that we are experiencing is due to natural causes and not due to an increase in carbon output by man's use. But we have got propane that is produced from the refinery of oil. We could produce that. There are a lot of cars and buses that run on propane. 
   We have natural gas that, in my home in Watkinsville, Georgia, I have a natural gas hot water heater, natural gas stove that I cook my wild game on when I get home and have the opportunity to cook my game and fish that I love to hunt and fish. But all these are clean sources of energy, and we are just not tapping into those. 
   I thank you for bringing these things up. We have got so many sources of clean fuels, even if global warming is caused by human causes, which I am one that I don't think there's enough scientific data to prove that fact. There are a lot of scientists that do say that. But certainly tapping into our own gas and oil resources can make us less dependent upon foreign oil, make us less dependent upon those who want to destroy us as a Nation. It's a national security interest for us to tap into those resources that we have here. 
   As I said a few minutes ago, America is the only Nation in the world that won't tap into and develop its own natural resources. It makes absolutely no sense. It's stunningly stupid, stunningly stupid that we don't do that. Right now, we are drilling for ice on mars, yet we cannot drill for oil in America. I just cannot 
   understand that. It makes no sense. 
   We are being blocked over and over again by the people on the other side who are pandering to the radical environmentalists. I am a conservationist. I started my political activity coming up here as a volunteer, working on conservation issues. I think it's critical that we develop those oil sources. 
   I congratulate you on bringing this forward tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROUN of Georgia. (KELO THIRD ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. The fifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that, ``No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.'' 
   June 23, 2005, marks a very sad day in our Nation's history. Exactly 3 years ago today, five unelected members of the U.S. Supreme Court made one of the most despised rulings in our Nation's history, one of the most egregious, unconstitutional rulings in our Nation's history in its ruling of Kelo v. City of New London. 
   The courts allowed a small Connecticut town to seize a private home to make way for a riverfront development. This activist decision was an attack on middle-class citizens for the benefit of the rich. There have been no worse interpretations of the intent of the fifth amendment than when the Supreme Court seized a private home for the profit of a private company. Yes, a private company. 
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, with whom I have disagreed on many of her decisions, was spot on in her dissent when we stated, ``the specter of condemnation hangs over all property. Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, or any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.'' 
   She added that under the Court's decision in Kelo, ``any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party,'' and ``the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms. As for the victims, the government now has a license to transfer their property from those with fewer resources, to those with more.     
   The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result.'' 
   So detested was the Supreme Court's 2005 ruling that the small home that became the center of the New London land grab has been moved and restored near the center of town as a constant reminder of the town's injustice. That small, pink home once represented a private home, but now it is a symbol of the evils of an activist court that disregards our constitutional rights. 
   Our Founding Fathers knew that our liberties were only as secure as our property rights. Property rights are a central institution of Western civilization, yet too often our Nation has violated the basic principles of our Founding Fathers. Federal, State and local governments continue to ignore, neglect, disparage and even fail to understand the importance of property rights. 
   Today I am pleased to introduce a resolution defending private property rights. This resolution in a very clear manner reflects the intent of our Founding Fathers when they listed private property rights as untouchable by government power. By placing property rights in the fifth amendment to the Constitution, the Founders made the protection of private property a primary aim of the American government. There is no provision in Article I, Section 8, or anywhere else in the Constitution, that allows the unnecessary, predatory seizure of private land. 
   On this, the third anniversary of one of the Supreme Court's most infamous decisions, I am proud to join property rights advocates all over America in renewing our protest against judicial activism. I applaud the many States that have passed legislation to limit their power to eminent domain and the supreme courts of many States that have barred the practice under their State constitution. I applaud the courage of Susette Kelo and other victims of eminent domain abuse who have stood up to their government and fought for their constitutional rights. 
   As John Dickinson, signer of the Constitution stated: ``Let these truths be indelibly impressed on our minds: (1) that we cannot be happy without being free; (2) that we cannot be free without being secure in our property; and (3) that we cannot be secure in our property if, without our consent, others may as by right take it away.'' 
   Private property rights are critical for freedom, and we need to fight for private property rights.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. If I remember correctly, John F. Kennedy, when he became President, lowered the tax rate, the top tax rates, which were extremely high at the time, but he lowered those.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. That's the thing about your bill that I see. This will lower the tax rate for everybody. It's time to bail out the taxpayer. 
   It's time to bail out small business, and we are not doing that. We have been bailing out the Wall Street bankers, the big insurance companies, now the Big Three automakers, but the car dealers need a bailout. Small business needs a bailout. Working people need a bailout, and the best way to do that is pass your bill, in my opinion. 
   Actually, I think our mutual friend, John Shadegg, did introduce his bill this evening, is what I understand. He came up to me on the floor and did introduce the bill. I am honored to be a cosponsor of that bill, as well as yours. I applaud you for the idea, because you brought it up, and John Shadegg took that idea.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. And they will be able to go and help pay off their mortgages. They will be able to go and help buy a new automobile. So that will bail out the car dealers, which this bailout deal that we passed, that the House passed tonight, is not going to do. 
   In fact, there is nothing in this bill that guarantees the car dealers are going to have their warranties recognized. There is nothing in this bill tonight, from what I understand, that's going to give them their hold back that the car companies are keeping from the car dealers. 
   So, actually, the car dealers are working on a float--I mean, the car manufacturing companies are working on a float from the car dealers, which is totally unfair. It's something that your bill will actually give people dollars in their pocket. That's going to stimulate our economy, I believe, and I think you believe the same thing too. 
   It will stimulate our economy, because what we have to do to create jobs is for people to have money, to be able to invest it, whether they save it and put that money in the bank or in some financial institution, so the financial institution that then, in turn, can loan that money out to someone else, it will put money in the hands of small business, so that that will be stronger. That will create jobs, which creates a stronger economy every time we have seen a lowering of tax rates throughout this country, by Democratic as well as Republican Presidents, Democratic and Republican Congresses. 
   We have seen a growth of the economy of the United States. Everybody, everybody has benefited, from the lowest wage owners to the highest wage earners. It also creates jobs so that this brings people who are unemployed into the job market. We have seen a greater income to the Federal Government because of the increase in the economy. 
   I was asked today at your news conference, by one of the members of the press, is your bill one that's going to create a bigger deficit? Frankly, I told the young lady that asked me that that, no, I don't think it's going to create a deficit. If you scored by static scoring then maybe. But if you do dynamic scoring, which is real live scoring, then the Federal Government will get more money in because of greater economic activity in America. 
   We will see a greater growth of our economy. We will see jobs created. We will see people catching up on their mortgages. Are people going out and actually buying houses? 
   So we will see a tremendous economic growth throughout America. That's the reason I have cosponsored your bill. I applaud your efforts. I have also cosponsored John Shadegg's bill, which is actually your bill, and I congratulate you on that also. 
   We have to bail out the taxpayer. We have to bail out the working man and woman in this Nation. We have to build small businesses, because that's the engine that drives the economy of the United States. That's where most jobs are created in America. 
   It's absolutely critical for us to lower taxes, not raise taxes. It's absolutely critical for us to stop borrowing money from our grandchildren, not only our children, but our grandchildren, and that's what we are doing. We are creating greater Federal debt, greater deficits, and we are borrowing that money, actually, today, from China and foreign entities, and our grandchildren will have to pay for that. It's criminal, it's immoral, in my opinion, that we are doing that as a Congress. 
   So, Mr. Gohmert, I highly applaud what you have done in this bill. I highly applaud your very innovative thinking, your thinking outside the box, if you will, to use a trite phrase. 
   But what you have done is you have brought a piece of legislation that if the American public will just understand how important this is to them, how this will put dollars in their pocket, it will help them pay their bills. It will help them to catch up if they are behind. 
   It will help create new jobs. It will help create a stronger economy. Your bill and John Shadegg's bill is the kind of spark plug that we need to have a greater economy, and to stop these doldrums that we have today. 
   I deplore what Hank Paulson has done. I think it's just horrible that he has created this tremendous fear throughout our Nation, so people are holding on to their money, those that even have it. There are segments of our society that are doing fairly well economically. But there are many segments of our society that need some help, and your bill will help everybody at all levels, from the lowest-income people in this country to the highest. 
   It will help create a stronger economy. It will help create economic growth. It will help create new jobs. It will help do the things that we desperately need to do to put this country back on the right course from an economic standpoint. 
   So, Mr. Gohmert, I highly applaud what you have done, and I want the American taxpayers to be able to control their own money, not Mr. Paulson, or whoever the new finance czar might be. We have set up a finance czar in this country, and I think that is extremely dangerous. 
   As you said in your opening remarks, we are federalizing banks. We have created an environment where the  megabanks are buying up smaller banks, so we have less competition. The marketplace is the best way to control quality, quantity and cost of all goods and services. 
   So we need to defederalize the financial institutions, we need to put money back in the pockets of the taxpayers, the workers of America. We need to put money back in the pockets of small business owners so that they can create a stronger business and thus create more jobs, and your bill just does exactly those things. 
   So I highly applaud what you are doing with this bill, and I call upon the American taxpayers, the American public, to contact your Member of Congress and demand a vote on the Gohmert bill. 
   What is the number, Mr. Gohmert?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I'm a medical doctor. As a physician, I have been a medical director in a National Health Service Corps community health clinic. I have given away hundreds of thousands of dollars of my services to the poor over my 30-some-odd years' career of practicing medicine in rural southwest Georgia, as well as in northeast Georgia where I currently live. 
   Health care costs are issues that particularly poor people have a tremendous difficulty dealing with. And it certainly is a very important issue. We've got to solve the crisis we have in health care financing today. We don't have a health care quality problem, we have a health care financing problem. And a lot of this is due to an overregulation on the health care system, on doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and other entities. 
   But an issue that actually affects poor people more than health care today is the tremendous cost of energy. Right now today, we're drilling for ice on the ground in Mars, and we can't even drill for oil in America. It's got to stop. We've got to bring down the cost of gasoline. And we can do that. We can do that by drilling offshore. We can do that by tapping into the oil sources we have throughout the west and in Alaska. And it's absolutely critical. 
   The cost of gasoline is hurting everyone. It's driving up the cost of groceries in the supermarket. It's driving up the cost of all goods and services, including health care. So if we're going to lower the cost of the health care, if we're going to lower the cost of food in the grocery store, we've got to lower the cost of gasoline by drilling now and streamlining the permitting process to get refineries so that they're producing more gasoline and we can bring the cost down. So I encourage my colleagues to push for drilling for oil now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the American people are sick and tired of high gas prices, high taxes and unnecessary regulation on our lands. As an ardent capitalist, I believe that the marketplace, unencumbered by government regulation, by high taxes, is the best way to control quality, quantity and cost of all goods and services. 
   The price of gasoline is not immune to market forces. Cutting taxes and reining in the Federal Government is fundamental to returning power to the U.S. citizens, and to promote economic growth. We should support our free market by eliminating unnecessary regulation, unfair taxes, and promoting the economic growth that we so desperately need. I say, heavy taxation is bad representation. 
   Speaker Pelosi promised to lower energy prices at the beginning of the 110th Congress. Yet, today the average price of gasoline has gone up $1.65 per gallon, a nearly 71 percent increase. The Pelosi premium is now costing the average American $3.98 per gallon of gasoline. And in my district, the 10th Congressional District in Georgia, it's over $4 a gallon. 
   Congressional Democrats talk about our addiction to foreign oil, yet they refuse to allow access to American oil and our gas supplies that are necessary to cure this so-called addiction. This is as idiotic as asking Shaquille O'Neal to play basketball on his knees, or Alex Rodriguez hitting a baseball left-handed. 
   America has been blessed with abundant talent, a tremendous quantity of natural resources. Yet we continue to operate with our knees on the ground and hitting from the wrong side of the plate. Unfortunately, this is not a game that Americans can afford to play. 
   Developing American oil and gas will help bring prices down and help break the stranglehold on energy that hostile countries in the Middle East enjoy. Yet Congressional Democrats continue to refuse any development whatsoever. We should not be hesitant to tap into our abundant natural resources, especially at a time when energy costs are so high. 
   Alaska's ANWR is estimated to contain between 5.7 and 16 billion barrels of oil. Yet House Democrats have opposed ANWR exploration 86 percent of the time, while House Republicans have supported responsible and environmentally sound development 91 percent of the time. 
   The Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, is estimated to contain 19 billion barrels of oil and 84 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Yet House Democrats have opposed developing the OCS 83 percent of the time, while House Republicans have supported responsible and environmentally sound development 81 percent of the time. Today we are drilling for ice on Mars, but we cannot drill for oil in America. 
   America contains enough oil shale to supply all our needs for over two centuries, estimated at over 2 trillion barrels. Yet House Democrats have opposed oil shale exploration 86 percent of the time, while House Republicans have supported responsible and environmentally sound development 90 percent of the time. 
   America hasn't built a new oil refinery in decades. It would do little good to increase development of our domestic supplies of oil if we do not have the refinery capability and capacity to quickly convert this fuel into a usable form. Yet House Democrats have opposed increasing refinery capacity 96 percent of the time, while House Republicans have supported responsible and environmentally sound development 97 percent of the time. We need to streamline getting oil refineries on-line. 
   America is the Saudi Arabia of coal. We must promote this abundant resource by promoting coal-to-liquids technology. Yet House Democrats have opposed the promotion of coal-to-liquids technology 78 percent of the time, while House Republicans have supported responsible and environmentally sound development 97 percent of the time. 
   What is the opposition's solution to this national emergency? They have passed a so-called energy bill that's a non-energy bill. 
   Energy is the lifeblood of the American economy. We need to develop our own natural resources and drill for oil now.

   Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I love America, and I cherish the values and principles that America represents. Those values are increasingly threatened today by an erosion of one of the primary bonds that keeps us together, a common language. 
   Large scale legal and illegal immigration threatens our societal cohesion and America's shared values when arrivals are unwilling to learn English. The current policies of our Federal Government actually enable this erosion when it provides official documents in multiple languages. This eliminates any incentive to learn English. America's genius as a melting-pot Nation has always been promoted by assimilation to a common language, and that language is English. 
   Today, I am introducing legislation that declares English to be the official language of the United States Government. Under the English As the Official Language Act of 2008, no person has an entitlement to receive Federal documents and services in languages other than English unless required by law. If the U.S. government is generous enough to make an exception, the exception does not create a legal entitlement or precedent to additional services in any other language other than English. This essential legislation will significantly reduce costs to our Federal Government and will encourage new legal immigrants to quickly adopt America's native tongue. 
   Learning English has always been and will continue to be a key step in achieving the American Dream. I applaud my fellow colleague in the other House, Senator Jim Inhofe, for introducing identical legislation in the Senate, and for his continued leadership on this critically important issue. 
   Making English the official language of our great land is not just about preserving our culture and heritage. Learning English is an essential step for our Nation's newest potential citizens that they must take if they want to achieve the American Dream. I plead with my colleagues to strengthen America by supporting English As the Official Language Act of 2008.
