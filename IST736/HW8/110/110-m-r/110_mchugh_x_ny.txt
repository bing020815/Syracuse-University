   Mr. McHUGH. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, let me begin by admitting right up front, this is not a perfect approach, but it is by far the best approach that we have available to us. I want to echo the words of my friend who just spoke, the gentleman from New Jersey, and add my words of appreciation and deep compliments to the distinguished chairman of the full committee, Chairman Skelton, the distinguished ranking member, Chairman Hunter, the great staff on both sides, and all the members who have worked so very hard to bring this moment to reality. 
   Frankly, we are dealing with an issue that is a product of the challenge that did not begin in this House. It came through the general authorization process, a provision that started in the Senate, that, as we have heard here today, and I certainly endorse, we in concept all agree with. All of us believe that American citizens who have been aggrieved by any state sponsor of terrorism, including the previous Iraqi Government, deserve every possible means of redress available to them. 
   We believe that in the context of the challenge before us, this bill continues and preserves that right, and does it in a way that, most importantly, understands that the primary objective of this bill is bringing to those brave men and women in uniform who are serving so ably across this planet, particularly in theaters of conflict like Iraq and Afghanistan, the immediate added benefits that are derived from this piece of legislation. 
   The distinguished chairman could not be more correct in his observation that this is not just a good bill, it is bordering on a great bill. The pay increases, the increases in various benefits are something that we cannot put in jeopardy by choosing another course other than by voting for and feeling very positive about this piece of legislation. 
   Like all the speakers before, I join with them in hoping that each and every Member of this House will take advantage of this opportunity, rise to the challenge that has been presented to us, and vote ``aye,'' in the affirmative, for this legislation, and preserve the rights and lead a path toward justice that those aggrieved people of state sponsors of terrorism so richly deserve, and at the same time provide the wealth of benefits that are embodied in this great piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHUGH. (RECEPTION OF FORMER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHUGH. Thanks very much, Jay. 
   As he indicated, my role this morning is to present our report on the Congress to Campus Program which as many of you know is now run exclusively by our Association in cooperation with the Stennis Center. David Skaggs, who did such a great job for us for some years, is now the Secretary of Education in Colorado. But the transition from his organization, the Council  on Excellence in Government, has been very smooth and successful. As most of you know, the Congress to Campus Program is the Association's flagship program for our members. It sends bipartisan teams of former Members to colleges, universities and high schools across the country to educate the next generation of leaders on the importance of civic engagement. The participating students benefit from the interaction with our Association members whose knowledge and experience, as we know, are a unique resource. But at the same time our members benefit, as Jay has said, through our continued involvement in public service and the ability to engage these young people on issues of importance to them. 
   During each visit, our bipartisan team conducts classes, meets individually with students and faculty, speaks to campus media, participates in both campus and community forums, and meets with local citizens. Institutions are encouraged to market our visits to the entire campus community, not just to those students who are majoring in political science, history or government. Over the course of 2 1/2 days, hundreds of students are exposed to the former Members' message regarding the significance of public service. There is one more visit scheduled for this academic year, after which we begin recruiting schools for next year. The program has made both domestic and international visits this academic year, including a visit to campuses in the United Kingdom and Canada and, for the first time, two separate visits to campuses in Mexico. By the end of next week, the program will have made 26 campus visits in this academic year. More than 30 members of our Association have made visits this academic year, and I want to take the opportunity to thank all of you who have participated in the program and certainly encourage those of you who have not had the opportunity as yet to do so, it's a great experience for us. 
   I also want to extend our thanks to the campuses, the faculty and staff members and students who worked so diligently on each of these visits. Without their hard work, these visits would not have been possible. We rely heavily on the universities to take the lead in coordinating logistics relating to each visit and appreciate the time they devote to ensuring their students will receive the benefits of the program. 
   We have also continued, as I mentioned at the beginning, our relationship with the Stennis Center for Public Service in the administration of the program. Association and Stennis Center staff work very closely together on a day-by-day basis to make the program such a great success. We appreciate both the staff support and the steady financial contribution we get from the Stennis Center each area. We look forward to working with them in the years ahead as well. 
   I am also pleased to announce that in the next academic year for the first time we will be receiving a financial contribution and some support from the Joyce and Donald Rumsfeld Foundation. The Foundation's generous grant will enable our Association to reach out to more students and more schools, many of whom have not participated in the past. And so on behalf of our members, I want to thank Secretary Rumsfeld for recognizing the importance of our reaching out to the next generation of leaders. 
   We have also continued working with the People to People Ambassador Program that brings young people to our Nation's capital for a week of events centered on the concepts of character and leadership. These students are far younger than those who participate in the Congress to Campus activities, but they have already demonstrated a commitment to the ideals that the Congress to Campus Program seeks to promote. The Association's involvement in this program allows our members living in the Washington area to speak to these younger students on the importance of public service and to answer any questions they might have. A number of our members, as you know, are working full time still and the People to People engagements allow them to continue their public service in this particular way. The events are typically held in the early morning at suburban locations. Again, I want to thank all of our colleagues who have participated in this program. I want to mention in particular our colleague Orval Hansen of Idaho. I don't know if Orval is here this morning. If not, he deserves recognition, because he has made it to nine of these visits early in the morning to meet with these younger students, seven of those visits in the last month alone. That is enormous dedication, and we are grateful to him in particular. 
   I want to conclude by again expressing appreciation to all of those who have made the Congress to Campus Program such a great success and by encouraging all of my friends here to participate. As you know, a democracy can prosper only if its citizens are engaged, and as former legislators we have a particular responsibility, I think, to encourage others to do so, particularly our young people. 
   Thank you very much.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHUGH. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by complimenting the chairman and the ranking member. I have sat on this floor for the last several hours and listened to the very impassioned debate. I think if nothing  else it should underscore the fact that the committee and the subcommittee have faced some very difficult decisions. Unless you have had the opportunity, the honor of serving on the Appropriations Committee or perhaps being involved as a general Member of the House, it's difficult to understand how hard the choices are that they are forced to make year in and year out. I commend them for that. 
   I have come today not to criticize any of the choices they have made but, rather, to offer what I believe, Mr. Chairman, is a very straightforward and relatively simple amendment. It is simply designed to maintain, not increase, not add to but maintain what is a 10-year record of level funding, a 10-year record of level funding to restore $1 million for the CASTNET program, which stands for the Clean Air Status and Trends Network, which would restore that money to allow this program to do some very important work. 
   What is that work? It would allow the 80 monitoring stations that are maintained under CASTNET to continue operating at the level that they have, as I have said, with level funding over the past 10 years. These are monitoring stations for a very important issue associated with acid rain that operate in some 40 States, from California to Massachusetts, from Maine to Florida and many, many points in between. 
   I think we can all agree, Mr. Chairman, that for all of the debate that occurs about global warming, for all the debate that occurs about what should be done, one of the critical issues we should engage upon is that of monitoring to make sure that our baseline data, our research is sufficient to make the wise decisions.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHUGH. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHUGH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Very roughly, you owe me a few. 
   Madam Speaker, listening to this debate tonight, it becomes obvious that kind of like life itself, those of us in Congress have moments of high drama and great importance, and by any measure, the date this evening and tomorrow and the days that follow and, most importantly, the vote that will attend it, is just such a moment. 
   I would observe, Madam Speaker, in the now nearly 231 years that this great Union has endured, this House has encountered few sessions demanding greater honesty, greater selflessness, and greater wisdom than that of occasions of war. And as I said, this is such a time. 
   But this debate really does stand alone. It is unique over the more than two centuries and three decades of our history, because from my study at no time in this Nation's history has the Congress considered the matter before us this week. The question of shall we resolve, in a nonbinding resolution, that this House disagree with a mission, duly designated by the constitutional authority vested in the President, as Commander in Chief, in the conduct of the war, that this same Congress, in an earlier session has, in fact, expressly endorsed. 
   I have listened today with great interest. I have enormous respect for all Members on both sides of the aisle. But I have heard about how wherever they are, many Members tonight will go to the well when they ultimately vote and try to send the President a message, try to signify to the administration that this war has not been conducted in the appropriate way. It has not achieved the objectives that we all felt were possible, in fact, absolutely necessary at its outset.     
   I would say, Madam Speaker, I understand that perspective; not only understand it, in many ways I strongly share that perspective. But I have to argue the fact of the matter is, for all of the good intentions we have here tonight, the negative aspect of such an action is going to far outweigh, far outweigh whatever good it might attempt to achieve. 
   The reality is, if this message is heard at all at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, it is going to speak in whispers. Whispers. But in other lands, in other continents, in other cities, far, far away, when this resolution comes before us, and if it is passed, it is going to crash like thunder. In places like Ramadi and Basra, from Baghdad and beyond, friend and foe alike are going to hear something far different than what we intend. 
   They are going to hear that through this vote we have abandoned the Iraqi people. They are going to hear that America has forsaken this struggle. They will hear that we disavow our military objective in Baghdad really before it has meaningfully begun, and most importantly in the shadows where our enemies lurk, in places like Tehran and Damascus, the message will fail where its authors intend, but it will succeed very, very mightily where they wish it would not. 
   Madam Speaker, for all of the good intent embodied in this proposal, it will not bring a single soldier home sooner. This vote, no matter what the tally, no matter what this board shows as to green and red at the end of the day, will not shorten this conflict by a single month, not by a week, not by a day. It will not change the course of a single battle. It will not even alter a pebble that lies on the battlefields in which those struggles will be fought. 
   It will, however, say to the insurgents, the Saddamists, the radical Islamic militants and their patrons that time is on their side. It will say that America has no stomach for this fight. And somewhere in a cave in Afghanistan, or in a hut on the Afghan-Pakistan border, Osama bin Laden is going to smile. 
   His words of a failure of America will be that much closer to reality. As he has said: ``The epicenter of these wars is Baghdad, the seat of the caliphate rule.'' They keep reiterating that ``success in Baghdad will be success for the United States, failure in Iraq the failure of the U.S. Their defeat in Iraq will mean defeat in all their wars and a beginning to the receding of their Zionist crusader tide against us.'' 
   Those are bad messages, Madam Speaker. But I would suggest respectfully to all of my colleagues for all the wrong messages this resolution will send to our enemies, nothing it contains will be more devastating than what it says to our troops, to our military, those brave men and women in uniform who answered the call to arms, issued not by some ephemeral entity, but by us, by this Congress. 
   And how do we say through the resolution we are considering here today, we support your needs, but we reject your mission? We allow for your deployment but we shun the premise of your departure? And what do we say to the wife or husband? How do we respond to the father or the mother or the loved one of the next warrior lost in battle who asks, why did you oppose through that resolution the job they were sent to pursue but did absolutely nothing from preventing them from going from the outset? 
   That is the tyranny, and I have to say it, Madam Speaker, that is the folly of the resolution before us for all its lack of practical result, for the fact that this resolution will do absolutely nothing. Never has this Congress in its history of war considered an action of such dramatic consequence. 
   Now, it is said during the Civil War that the great Southern general, Robert E. Lee, was really tired, and I think we can all relate to this, of the criticism, the second-guessing that was directed at his leadership through the major newspapers of his time. 
   And he observed, Apparently all my best generals had become journalists. Today, tonight, I think it can be fairly said of some, apparently all of our best generals have become Congressmen. My colleagues, we are not generals. The Constitution of this great Nation does not provide for 535 Commanders in Chief, yet that is the reality lost in the proposal that we are considering this night in this week. 
   But I would suggest, instead of being diminished by that fact, instead of being lessened by what we are not, we need to be empowered by what we are. And I say to my colleagues tonight on both sides of the aisle, we indeed have a grave responsibility in this matter. But it does not lie in nonbinding resolutions that send wrong messages to our troops and absolutely wrong messages to our enemies. It rests in the authorities vested in us by the Constitution of this great land, the power to fund or not all matters of government, especially war. 
   Like all of us here tonight, I want this war to conclude. I represent the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed division in the United States Army. I was there 3 weeks ago. I know the pain. I know the suffering. And like all of you, I am frustrated by the path we have traveled to this point, and I am troubled by the course that apparently lies ahead.  
   And we can, we must have, a different approach, one that especially places responsibility for success where it rightfully lies, and I have heard my colleagues tonight speak about that, with the Iraqi people. I propose an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill that will just do that, require the Iraqis to step forward, to stand up, to stop the talking, and to begin to act. 
   It will fully fund the needs of our troops and provide for us, the Congress, the rightful role and expedite an opportunity to review the Iraqis effort and to judge the progress of this new mission in Baghdad. These things have to be done. But this resolution, in my judgment, in my judgment, is what must decidedly not. 
   This weekend I took the time to reread John F. Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning work ``Profiles in Courage.'' And in those pages our martyred President spoke: ``In no other occupation but politics is it expected that a man will sacrifice honor, prestige, and his chosen career on a single issue.'' 
   My friends, this is such a moment. I accuse nobody in this Chamber, Madam Speaker, of any kind of transgression, honorable people, good people. We will disagree, as I expect they will on this and other days, but I do plead that every Member in this House vote on this resolution, not for themselves, not for gain or posture through politics, not because of their alleged attention to public opinion, because it is right. 
   We can do better. We must. But this resolution is not the path to that objective.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHUGH. Madam Chairman, let me say at the outset I appreciate the gentleman's intent here, and I take at face value and both understand and in large measure agree with his intent to serve to clarify the base provision in which he is acting on this day. 
   Having said that, I do have some concerns. I would disagree with the gentleman's assertion, as I understood it, and I have to apologize, Madam Chairman, because the acoustics were rather difficult and I'm not sure I heard everything the gentleman said, but I do believe he was saying that there was a predicate reality in the underlying language that assumed that military reaction was a given or at least a part of it. 
   I want to make very clear for the record that on our side, Madam Chairman, we feel it is critically important, when speaking on this important issue to the Iranian people, and particularly the Iranian leadership, that they understand that in our mind this is an extraordinarily serious issue. 
   When we were marking up this provision in the full committee, I made the comment that ambiguity, lack of clarity, on world and military affairs has cost us dearly in the past. One can make the argument that at least in significant measure, for example, the Korean War began on ambiguity, a lack of clarity as to what the United States would do if the Chinese and North Koreans were to take military action, as they ultimately did. Similarly, when Iraq, under Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait, I think you can make the case that Saddam Hussein misinterpreted the American position as to what the reaction of this Nation would be upon such an invasion. 
   So we think that clarity should not be confused with militarism. Clarity should not be mistaken for belligerence; that clarity, particularly when we are talking in matters of warfare, is important. 
   Having said that, Madam Chairman, I do believe that Chairman Spratt, the distinguished member of the Armed Services Committee, has an idea that bears consideration here. 
   I do have a question. I would ask the gentleman from South Carolina, and this is not part of the prearranged script and I'm not trying to play ``gotcha,'' but I was curious if the gentleman would yield for a question that I would like to pose to him.

What I am concerned about less, the structure of the gentleman's amendment. I understand it. I think there are some concerns that I have with respect to definitional and clarity issues. But putting those aside, can the gentleman help me better understand why, under the defense bill, this amendment, and I am speaking now, if I may, as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, does not subject this bill to sequential referral?

   Mr. McHUGH. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I had said earlier, Madam Chairman, that I do have some substantive concerns or at least semantic concerns about the language of the amendment. And I think it's important, if I may, to state at least at this moment one or two of those for the record. 
   I am concerned about the vagueness of some of the language. For example, the underlying amendment, the language that this amendment seeks to change and to amend, requires the Congress to have a clear milestone. One is, quite simply, does Iran have sufficient material for a weapon. 
   I think most people understand the language behind that. This language, however, says it requires the President to notify Congress within 15 days of Iran having, ``met or surpassed any major milestone in its nuclear weapons  program.'' I don't object to that goal, but I do become concerned about defining what those milestones are. 
   Milestones in the process of development of nuclear weapons may be self-evident to the scientific community, but for purposes of law, I am not aware, and if I am wrong, then I need to be instructed today on this debate. I am not aware that they are defined in law. 
   So I think we are leaving a problem there that perhaps as we move into the conference we can----

   Mr. McHUGH. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As I said, the concerns that I have, and I think it's fair to say our side have with respect to a major part of this amendment centers on semantics. Normally, that can be considered a minutia. But when you're dealing with questions of nuclear capability, when you're dealing with questions of sending a message from country A to country B, in this case, United States to Iran, I think semantics and definitional issues are very, very important. 
   I appreciated the dialogue that the gentleman from South Carolina and the distinguished ranking member of the full committee had with respect to the question of milestones, but I also have a concern about the language with respect to the reporting requirement with the fact that should Iran speed up, slow down, or stop, and I will quote now, Madam Chairman, ``any significant element'' of these programs. 
   I certainly don't disagree with the intent of that language. But, again, we are writing law, we are not writing narrative, we are not writing a novel. The fact that any significant element is not a definitional perspective concerns me. 
   So, again, I would simply say for the record, as we go forward, while the intent of this amendment and the prospect of it is positive, there are some concerns on clarity, there are some concerns on definition. I think we need to continue to focus on in the conference and I would hope as we go forward, we can help clarify those kind of issues. 
   I don't know if the gentleman on the other side has any more speakers. Assuming that he might, I would reserve the balance of my time.

I would say as I noted, the comments that I made as to clarity have no intent to in any way besmirch the perspective, the professionalism that the gentleman always brings, and I look forward to producing a good amendment in this regard when we reach conference.

   Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to my Chair, on which I  serve as ranking on Personnel, it's really a case of ``Do as I say, not as I do.'' 
   It's very important to recognize, whatever you feel about this amendment, the facts are these: The offsets both from the Defense Health Program that the gentlewoman just spoke in great emotional terms about as well as the cuts with respect to other offsets come from unexpended balances. And I think it's important to note as well, while our friends on the other side of the aisle are saying ``absolutely not'' to this very modest offset, that when it comes to these very same unexpended accounts, they spent $250 million out of the DHP, the Defense Health Program, while at the same time they took over $1 billion of unexpended balances.

   Mr. McHUGH. So the gentleman from Missouri's efforts to cut very modest amounts would not in any way diminish the onboard dollars that are spent in support of our men and women in uniform. No one on this side of the aisle is proposing to do that. The gentleman from Missouri is not. 
   Quite frankly, the protestations that I'm hearing on the floor as I heard in the full committee markup coming from people that took over $1 1/4 billion of those same funds to spend on other accounts is rather disingenuous.

Read the budget that our Democrat friends put forward that shows how they cut from the President's request more than $580 million from personnel account recommendations.

<DOCNO>Mr. McHUGH. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McHUGH. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I've said on occasions in the past in similar situations that it's always a source of great pride for those of us who have the honor and the opportunity to serve on the Personnel Subcommittee that when many Members come to the floor in support of both this and past authorization bills,  one of the things that they cite most often are those initiatives emanating out of the Personnel Subcommittee, and I think that's for a very good reason. Because all of us, certainly in this Congress, but particularly in the House Armed Services Committee, recognize that for all of the things that make this Nation great, particularly for all of those things that make our military the greatest that has ever walked the face of the Earth, the one irreplaceable component is those who wear the uniform and those who, of course, love and support them, their spouses, their children, their families. And in that regard, I want to add my words of thanks to, of course, the distinguished chairman, the gentleman from Missouri, our ranking member, Congressman Hunter, but also to Dr. Snyder, who started the year off as the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, who went on to other challenges and, fortunately for all of us, turned the reins over to the very able hands of the gentlelady from California (Mrs. Davis). 
   As in years past, Mr. Speaker, this bill is rich in provisions that recognize the value of our military men and women in service and the need to support them, and to enrich the quality of lives of both those individuals and, of course, their families. And I suspect you have heard today, and rightfully will continue to hear, Mr. Speaker, of all of those good things; 3.5 percent pay raise, one-half percent above what the President requested, and more importantly, over the past 9 years, the continuation of our effort to reduce that gap between civilian pay and military that started at 13.5 percent. And with this 3.5 percent, it will move it down to 3.4 percent. More needs to be done, but good progress. 
   It critically increases end strength, which is such an important component in the high pace of operations and personnel tempos. It increases the Army by 13,000, the Marine Corps by 9,000; again, work that needs to be continued, but a good step on such an important problem. 
   The report also contains important provisions of the bill that Dr. Snyder and I had the honor of helping to initiate, that was later picked up by the committee and so many others to round it into a great provision to respond to the disgraceful conditions that we all learned about at Walter Reed and end the frustration that exists between the DOD and veterans retirement and disabilities systems. And it includes as well several recommendations from the President's Commission on Care of America's Returning Wounded Warriors, better known as the Dole-Shalala Commission. 
   From active to Reserve, this is a great bill and it deserves all of our support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHUGH. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chair, I rise simply to say, as we have heard from previous speakers, and perhaps to state the obvious, this piece of legislation, H.R. 1585, is a strong bill. 
   More importantly, in my judgment it is a bill that was put together in a collaborative and bipartisan manner. I want to pay my respects, my words of appreciation to the full committee Chair, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), who came through this, his first trial by fire, I think, with great efficiency; as well as, of course, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), the former chairman, now ranking member. But most importantly, I want to thank the new chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, a gentleman who I had the honor and opportunity to serve with as the ranking member when I had the opportunity to serve as Chair, Dr. Vic Snyder, who worked together again in a bipartisan manner, and in that way has produced  a product which I think overall we can all support with not just a great deal of enthusiasm but a great deal of pride. 
   All of us feel very strongly on the Personnel Subcommittee that when the Members come to the floor, it is good that they talk about the broad range of effects and benefits in this bill. But it makes us feel proud, Madam Chair, when we note that those things that the Members take most pride in and cite most often are a product of the work of the Personnel Subcommittee. The reason for that is very, very simple. 
   The success of the United States military is today, as it has always been, not in high weapons systems, as important as they are, not in sophisticated platforms, not in all of those things that give our fighting men and women an edge, but the true edge is in the fighting men and women themselves. And this bill contains many benefits, many added advantages that they so richly deserve. 
   It provides an increase in end strength, something we have taken up and we need to continue, is embodied in this bill. A basic pay raise that will continue the 8-year effort we have had to increase the pay of our men and women in uniform, drawing down that pay gap between the civilian and military forces, drawing it down currently under the ramp to 2012 when it will be as little as 1.5 percent, resisting so-called efficiency wedges and savings in the TRICARE and other military health care programs, saving money for those hardworking men and women protecting our interests wherever they may be, here at home, and their families. 
   The Wounded Warrior Assistance Program that I had the honor of working with, along with Dr. Snyder, and along with the chairman and the ranking member to address those challenges that we saw so very dishearteningly at places like Walter Reed and others. 
   All of this combined is a good bill that works on a bipartisan basis. I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHUGH. I thank the gentleman from California for his gracious comments. 
   Let me start off by returning the favor. This is a monumental bill if for no other reason than it bears the name of the gentleman from California, DUNCAN HUNTER. It also is a bill that represents the departure of two other very senior members of the Defense Committee, the great gentleman from New Jersey, JIM SAXTON, and my classmate, TERRY EVERETT, from the great State of Alabama. All three of these gentlemen have served this committee in the grade tradition in which it is steeped so deeply, and that is of bipartisanship, and of the focus that the important thing, the only thing is to field the finest military the world has ever seen. And through their collective service, they have, indeed, done that. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri, the distinguished chairman, for moving the resolution that ultimately named this bill after my dear friend, my great leader, DUNCAN HUNTER, but also, I think, forms the basis of what can only be described as a very, very good bill. 
   To Chairwoman DAVIS, the gentlelady with whom I have deeply enjoyed serving, I want to commend her for bringing to the floor tonight a Personnel piece, a mark that is predicated upon bipartisanship, predicated upon openness. And I thank her for allowing all of us, myself, of course, but equally, if not more importantly, the other members of the subcommittee and the full committee on both sides of the aisle, the opportunity to have meaningful input to its outcome. 
   You heard her talk very eloquently, very adequately, very reasonably and correctly about the very, very positive provisions of this Personnel mark. Increases end strength, something this subcommittee has been working on for a number of years to relieve the pressure on those men and women who step forward, who have paid the price of stop loss, who have paid the price of extended deployments. This will help them immeasurably. 
   The active role of the Army Guard and Reserve and their role in this, so important, the increases to that. 
   The pay increases that continue the efforts that we had begun some years ago, where the pay gap between the private and the military sectors was 13 percent and has now been taken below 3 percent, that we intend, I hope, collectively, to fully continue education and training opportunities for military spouses, recognizing they are part of this battle as well. 
   From impact aid to survivor indemnity allowances to TRICARE fees, and on and on and on, this is a bill that every Member of this House should, and I deeply hope will, support. 
   I said this is a very, very good bill. In all honesty, it could have been a great bill. It could have been a great bill except for a number of important, but I think insufficient, responses to the challenges we had. 
   A problem that I faced, when I had the honor of being the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, was predicated upon the administration's, I would maintain, ill-advised proposal to begin the necessary path toward reforming the cost of military health care on the backs of the recipients. They have proposed it again this year. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's time has expired.

   Mr. McHUGH. It was a serious challenge that was resolved in a way that I can honestly say can only be described as a budgetary gimmick. Rather than using all the tools available to it, the Democratic leadership--not the leadership on this committee, but the Democrat leadership of this House--chose, instead, to take from the retirees, those who have already served, a hit of 1 percent of one month of their retiree pay. They had other options and tools available to them, and I honestly believe they took the easy way. I hope we can, from this point forward, use the opportunity of conference and discussion with the administration and, of course, with the Senate to find a better resolution. 
   Also, I think the fact that the House Budget Resolution that was supposed to be passed today, but I assume will be passed in the very near future, offered a hope, offered the opportunity for the Budget chairman to make decisions about reallocations to address such things as the widows tax, to address other kinds of problems, were not utilized. And we lost a very important opportunity that, whatever one may think about the Democrat Budget Resolution, provided for the first time hope, provided for the first time opportunity, and that has been squandered.  Still, in the days ahead, I think we can take this very, very good bill and elevate it to a great bill. 
   For the purposes of tonight, however, for the purposes of those who worked hard on it, the gentleman from Missouri, the gentleman from California, all of our subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, this is a bill that reflects, in very fine form, the bipartisan approach of one of the grandest committees, one of the most important committees under the Constitution this House has ever created, the Armed Services Committee, and it deserves our support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHUGH. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Like my colleague from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), I rise today in disappointment, and I congratulate the ranking member and the chairman. But in his opening comments, the chairman spoke about last week's NIE on Iran as the best of times; and, clearly, we all take heart in the possibility that Iran has put aside its program to develop nuclear power for weapons systems. It's an opening we need to vigorously pursue and cautiously monitor. 
   But I would argue, Mr. Speaker, this is hardly all good news because it also, in a less noted part of the report, talked about what we missed. It confirmed that they had an active program. It confirmed that that was going forward, and it confirmed that it happened without our knowledge, and many of the shortcomings that made that reality come about are contained in this bill. 
   There were a number of reasons for that failure, but some, sadly, are reflected starkly in this bill. And, indeed, for all of its good intentions, for all of its considerable effort, this legislation is sadly an example of high rhetoric that clouds stark reality. 
   As Mr. Thornberry and as the distinguished ranking member have said, there are a number of deficiencies,  things that threaten the viability of our intelligence services. In my opinion, most importantly, the failure again to provide adequate resources for human intelligence collection, whether we're talking about Iran or any other highly denied theater, it is that ability to get on the ground, to find the intelligence that would have helped us not have incorrect NIEs in places like Iran in the past and protect each and every American there. 
   As also has been noted, this bill really does fail to provide key surveillance authorities the kind of legislation authority that is necessary to streamline surveillance of foreign terrorist targets in foreign countries, again harkening up the issue that we're clouding the reality of today's world with high rhetoric and ideals. 
   On that point, let me make another observation. Mr. Thornberry spoke of not telegraphing our interrogation techniques to our enemy. I would disagree with Mr. Thornberry a little bit there in that I think we're not just telegraphing; we are actually giving them the entire playbook. None of us, none of us in this government, none of us in this Chamber support torture. We have made that clear. But to give the clear playbook to our enemies, those that would do the greatest harm, as we saw on September 11, through our interrogation techniques, I think, is a very unwise step to make. 
   For those reasons, I would urge we take this bill, defeat it here today and rework it in a way which better serves the interests of each and every American citizen.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MCHUGH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3246, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I was disappointed when the full House failed to adopt a motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 3246 on September 17. That said, I am pleased that the House is reconsidering the bill today. 
   As I have previously stated, H.R. 3246 is important to my constituents in Northern and Central New York because it would create the Northern Border Regional Commission to help further economic development. There is no question this assistance is needed. Specifically, in 2000, each of the counties I represent--Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lewis, Madison, Oneida, Oswego, and St. Lawrence--had a median household income that was below the national median of $41,994. Moreover, seven of these counties had poverty rates in excess of the national rate of 12.4 percent, and three, Franklin, Oswego and St. Lawrence counties, had poverty rates in excess of 14 percent. Similarly, from 2004 to 2006, 8 of these counties had unemployment rates in excess of the national average. 
   I greatly appreciate the efforts of the Gentleman from Maine, Mr. MICHAUD, to move this measure one step closer to enactment. Since the 108th Congress, we have been working to enact legislation to create a Northern Border Regional Commission, and I look forward to working with him further to do so.

   Mr. MCHUGH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference report to H.R. 2419, the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008. At this time, I would like to recognize the hard work of the Gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. PETERSON, the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. GOODLATTE, and the other conferees that culminated in the conference report before the House today. I also would like to take a moment to mention several items of interest to my constituents in northern and central New York. 
   Very simply, I could not overstate the importance of dairy farming to the economy of New York's 23rd Congressional District, which I represent. In fact, its importance is readily apparent when one considers that the 2002 Census of Agriculture reported there were 1,989 dairy farms with 188,305 milk cows in the 11 counties that comprise the district. Accordingly, I am pleased that the conference report extends and expands the Milk Income Loss Contract, MILC, Program, continues the Dairy Price Support and Dairy Indemnity Programs, and reauthorizes the Dairy Export Incentive Program. 
   The conference report also includes a provision to create a Northern Border Regional Commission, which I have been working on a bipartisan basis with the gentleman from Maine, Mr. MICHAUD, and others to enact because it will help further economic development. There is no question this assistance is needed, particularly when one considers that in 2000, seven of the 11 counties I have the privilege of representing had poverty rates in excess of the national rate of 12.4 percent and three--Franklin, Oswego and St. Lawrence counties--had poverty rates in excess of 14 percent. Similarly, from 2004 to 2006, eight of my constituent counties had unemployment rates in excess of the national average. 
   I was also pleased that the conference report will provide $466 million for the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, $10 million annually for efforts to address colony collapse disorder in honey bees, grants and guaranteed loans for broadband development, tax incentives for agricultural businesses to enhance chemical security, and at least $1.19 billion for the Emergency Food Assistance Program. Finally, the conference report increases the amount available for direct loans to farmers and authorizes $120 million to fund pending rural infrastructure programs of importance to my constituents such as the Water and Waste Disposal Grants and the Rural Water and Wastewater Circuit Rider Programs.

   Mr. McHUGH. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, I hadn't intended to speak; and I didn't intend to because, right now, the hearts and minds of the 10th Mountain Division family, which includes the district that I represent, are focused on two soldiers who are classified as ``missing, captured.'' And there has been speculation in the press recently whether or not FISA had some application, and I didn't want to cloud that water. But I thought that those soldiers, whatever the circumstances may be related to their condition, would want us to do everything that we could to defend what they fought for, that is, the future, the ability of this country to prosper as the greatest democracy the world has ever known. 
   I have been listening to the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, a friend of mine, a gentleman and a leader, who said, ``This bill gives most of those things that the DNI wanted.'' I listened to my friend, Jerry Nadler, the gentleman from New York, a colleague of mine in both the State legislature and here: ``Most of.'' This is not a ``most of'' situation, Madam Speaker. This is a situation where we have to give what the war fighters need to protect them in the field.

   Mr. McHUGH. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We have heard, I would say to my colleagues repeatedly today, this is not a perfect bill. We also should hear that shouldn't be a surprise. Rarely on the House floor here have perfect bills been delivered. Rather, as I think the Founding Fathers would have intended, we see a work in progress. 
   This is a bill that started off at a certain place, that came through the committee process, and although I may be somewhat prejudiced, I firmly believe has been far improved from that starting point through that committee process. There have been some seven amendments that I think have upgraded it and have put us on the right path. 
   I want to say Mr. Chairman, I have enormous respect, enormous affection for both the distinguished chairman from the great State of Texas, my good friend, Silvestre Reyes, as well as the gentleman from Michigan, the distinguished ranking member, who have gone so far in working together to make such a difference. There are far, far fewer bills that reach this House floor that are more important in this day and age for the safety and for the security of the American people. 
   I have to tell you I share the distinguished ranking member's concerns about the failures of this administration to adequately inform, to adequately brief all the Members on both sides of the aisle, not just so-called leadership, but all the Members, as to the ongoing activities with respect to our intelligence systems throughout this world. 
   I think that the American people need to be assured that as we go forward in these very dangerous and uncertain times that there are certain individuals in this House that have, as the law intends, the opportunity to be fully informed and make sound judgments about what is appropriate and what is not. 
   Frankly, as a member of this committee, I am somewhat frustrated by the lack of total input, the lack of total briefing that has occurred from the administration side, and I look forward to a better day. 
   I think tomorrow can help us to further improve this bill. We have the opportunity now, through the conference process, to continue to improve upon it, to continue to make sure that the end product that we send to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, to the President, is a good bill, a bill that in these very challenging moments of our lives ensures the American people have the best possible, the most well-resourced, and the most responsible intelligence activities we can possibly have. 
   This is a very appropriate start. It deserves our support, and I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. McHUGH. I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding to me. 
   Madam Chair, I would say that I want to begin by expressing my deep appreciation and great respect to the bipartisan leadership of the committee. To the distinguished ranking member who has provided such a steady hand and, certainly during his time as chair, for great guidance and leadership. And a particular tip of the hat, Madam Chair, to the current chairman. Chairman Reyes I consider to be a personal friend, and he is a man of a good heart and great leadership. I would suggest respectfully through that good heart and great leadership, this bill certainly has some positive aspects. It increases needed counterintelligence assets to protect our Nation's military secrets. As well, it initiates the movement of  supplemental funding to the base budget for the better use and planning of those funds. And it establishes the requirement to develop an integrated space-based collection architect. 
   In addition, it places limitation on the termination of the U-2 program. It also gives added emphasis on language training and additional accountability on intelligence contracting. As I said, Madam Chair, these are all very positive steps in improving our intelligence capabilities, and I commend the chairman and Members on both sides of the aisle for working together to make that happen. 
   I have to say, regretfully, however, there is much that distresses me in this bill. Let me just cite a few examples. 
   I am very, very concerned that the legislation before us begins to retrace the failed policies of the 1990s that were based on underfunding and overtasking of our limited intelligence resources. It inadvertently, or not, establishes politically correct restrictions on intelligence operations. 
   Additionally, at least in my judgment, the bill does not adequately support key Intelligence Community activities that directly protect our national security. It calls for cuts to human intelligence programs which is counter to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. It fails to support the Intelligence Community and our national defense by rejecting an amendment that our side offered to include important legislation to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, even though this identical language, Madam Chair, was passed unanimously by a bipartisan vote previously last year in the House. 
   There is no question that our Nation is locked in a struggle with radical jihadists and facing continued uncertainty and threats around the globe. As well, there is no question that before us lie critical questions. And we know what is needed right now is a well-trained, well-equipped and capable Intelligence Community. Instead, this bill unnecessarily, again in my judgment, diverts the resources of the Intelligence Community, as we have heard, to produce unnecessary legislation and initiatives. 
   I would hope we could go back, reject this bill and begin anew to work together on a bipartisan basis to produce a better product.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McHUGH. I thank the gentleman both for yielding and for his very, very gracious comments, and I thank Mr. Chairman. 
   I want to begin by giving thanks where thanks are certainly due. I want to express my particular appreciation to my chairman on the Personnel Subcommittee, a fellow I had the opportunity to work with when he was ranking member for a number of years when I had the opportunity to Chair that subcommittee, Dr. SNYDER; as well as and equally so with the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Skelton; and, of course, my dear friend and such a great leader from the great State of California (Mr. Hunter), for their leadership for recognizing the need to react to this, not in a bipartisan, not in a political way, but in a way that embodies the spirit of the Armed Services Committee. 
   One reason I am so proud and have been for now going on 15 years to serve on it and that is in the interest of those incredibly brave and unselfish men and women who don the uniform of the United States of America. We owe our thanks as well, as the gentleman from Maryland suggested, to the VA Committee, Mr. Filner and Mr. Buyer, for their willingness to work together in addressing what we all recognize is a very, very serious problem. 
   This is not a perfect bill. It does not meet the entire range of challenges and problems that we know exist, the entire range and need of problems that, frankly, have been known to many of us for many, many years, particularly the disconnect between two very well-meaning systems, that of the Department of Defense, who cares for our wounded, and later, after retirement and disability ratings, the VA department, who cares for those who follow through. 
   Both of them tried to do the job, and they tried to do it in very distinct ways, and what we have understood now and what was demonstrated at least in part at Walter Reed is the challenges of helping those two well-meaning, independent agencies work better together. 
   But while it is not, Mr. Chairman, a perfect bill, it is a very, very good bill, an excellent first step, a place where we can put into effect mechanisms to better ensure the quality of service and, equally important, provide a continuum of care for the brave men and women who risk their lives in defense of our freedoms, of America's freedoms. And I think we can all agree as well we owe that to them. We owe it to their families. We owe them nothing less than the best that we can possibly provide, the absolute best; and this bill takes an important step towards effecting that kind of necessary change. 
   There will have to be things that follow. Once we hear from the recommendations of the Dole-Shalala Commission and from the DOD and Military Services' reviews and analysis, we will be in an even better position to take whatever additional actions are necessary to bring it together. 
   But you have heard my colleagues here on the floor today speak about the important components of this bill. We have looked at the problems, we have looked at the challenges that these folks have faced, and we have tried to  respond to them. Everything from hotlines to actual human hand-offs between the two systems, more case managers, more personal face-to-face responsiveness to the problems they may encounter, this bill provides it, with more to follow. 
   I also want to add, Mr. Chairman, that without the hard work of the staff on both sides of the Armed Services Committee we would not have had this legislation. Our particular thanks to Mike Higgins, Debra Wada, John Chapla, and Jeanette James, amongst others, who took our concerns, who took our feedback and made them into the bill that we receive here today; and we owe them as well. 
   Before I yield back, on a last note, Mr. Chairman, I would be remiss if I didn't once again add my words of deep appreciation to those incredible military medical professionals who through their hard work, who through their dedication are solely responsible for the best quality care. We are experiencing survival rates today coming out of Afghanistan and Iraq that we have never experienced in any theater of war in the history of this Nation, in fact, in the history of mankind, and that is because of the wonderful job that they do. 
   This challenge has never been about them, and I want them most importantly to recognize we understand the differences of the system and, in fact, two systems that need correcting and better oversight from their valiant efforts. We all owe them our deepest appreciation. 
   So I am proud to be associated with this bill, a bill that will take a quantitative and qualitative step forward in providing the best possible care to our wounded and fallen warriors.

   Mr. McHUGH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1343, the Health Centers Renewal Act of 2007. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, which would reauthorize the community health centers program through fiscal year 2012. 
   Community health centers are an integral component of our Nation's health care infrastructure. Nationwide, more than 1,500 such centers provide high-quality, cost-effective primary health care to anyone seeking care. In New York State, health centers provide services to 1.1 million people who receive care at over 425 sites. 
   Of note, community health center fees are based on income and family size and services are provided regardless of insurance status or ability to pay. Forty-three percent of New York State health center patients are Medicaid beneficiaries and 28 percent are uninsured. Moreover, over 86 percent of New York State health center patients have incomes at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, which in 2008 is $42,400 for a family of four. 
   Access to health care is truly one of the most difficult challenges for Americans living in rural areas like northern and central New York. Community health centers have been a tremendous help in our efforts to improve access to health care. I am thankful that my constituents in New York State's 23rd Congressional District are served by four community health centers: Hudson Headwaters Health Network; Northern Oswego County Health Services; The Smith House; and the United Cerebral Palsy Association of the North Country. 
   I deepy appreciate the dedication and hard work of the staff at those health centers. Indeed, I am hesitant to imagine a scenario in which my constituents did not have the benefit of their excellent services. I also appreciate the efforts of the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, and the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Pickering, to develop this measure and bring it to the House floor today; I look forward to its enactment.

   Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3246, Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007. I appreciate the work Chairman Oberstar and Representatives Graves, Hodes, and Michaud have done to develop this important legislation and bring it to the House floor. 
   The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act is designed to alleviate systemic poverty and underdevelopment in our Nation's most severely economically distressed areas. These include rural Alaska, Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta region, the northern Great Plains region, the southeast crescent region, the southwest border region, and the northern border region, which includes all 11 counties that I have the honor to represent: Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lewis, Madison, Oneida, Oswego, and St. Lawrence. 
   To provide a comprehensive, consistent and broad-based approach to economic and infrastructure development, H.R. 3246 authorizes five regional economic development commissions. These commissions, modeled after the successful Appalachian Regional Commission, would have a uniform set of procedures and a common structure for administration, decision-making, management, and planning. 
   With funding authorized and provided by Congress, each Commission would make grants to States and local governments, Indian tribes, and public or nonprofit organizations for projects to develop transportation, public, and telecommunications infrastructure. These projects would also further efforts to provide job skills training, improve basic health care and related services, promote resource conservation, and development of both renewable and alternative energy sources. 
   My constituent counties, like many others within the northern border region, lag behind the rest of the Nation in economic growth and continue to experience higher than average levels of unemployment, poverty, and outmigration. Very simply, my constituents, as well as those who live in the other affected areas, should no longer be left behind. Moreover, I am confident that with the assistance provided through H.R. 3246, the economies of all the impacted counties will improve, thus resulting in an enhanced quality of life for all.

   Mr. Speaker, this is a bittersweet moment. It is sweet, or certainly an uplifting moment because we are here on the floor with a defense authorization bill. Had you asked anybody just a few weeks ago, I think they would have suggested no, it couldn't be possible. Yet through the incredible leadership of the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) and former chairman and now able ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), we are here, and we're not just here in presence, we're here with an absolutely incredible bill. 
   I want to thank the gentlelady from California, my counterpart, the Chair of the Personnel Subcommittee, for her leadership. As you look at this bill, it meets the absolute first criteria of any effective DOD authorization bill, taking care of the troops. 
   You heard the gentlelady recount the very positive things in this bill, and I couldn't agree with her more. I'm proud to be even remotely associated with that. 
   I would also say, this is a triumphant staff. We are served incredibly well, day in and day out, by our professional staff members.     
   Never have they distinguished themselves more than they have this year. To do what it usually takes 6, 7, 8, 9 weeks and more in a matter of days is just an achievement that rings so very solidly to their credit but also is important to the goodwill of the Members. 
   But I will tell you, this is a sad moment. This bill is very appropriately named after my colleague, my leader, Duncan Hunter, but he is taking with him the kind of dedication, devotion, and leadership that are not easily replaced, and he will be sorely, sorely missed, and certainly as a friend I will miss him dearly. 
   But just to kind of add insult to injury, he's taking with him two great Members, Terry Everett and Jim Saxton, folks who have led this committee and done so much good. But we carry forward in their great tradition. This is a great bill in their memory, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which is of great importance to my constituents in Northern New York. Thus, I greatly appreciate the work the Gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, the Gentleman from California, Mr. Waxman, and the Gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Davis, have done to bring H.R. 1389 to the House floor.

From Lake Champlain in the east, my District runs along the St. Lawrence River and our nation's Northern border to Lake Ontario in the west. The District encompasses territory that played an important role in our nation's early history; much of it was literally on the front lines of the War of 1812. 
   During the War of 1812, my District was not only the site of skirmishes but also the significant Battles of Plattsburgh and Sackets Harbor. In fact, 193 years ago on September 11, 1814, Commodore Thomas McDonough repulsed a British invasion led by Sir George Provost at Plattsburgh Bay on Lake Champlain. McDonough's victory was significant because it ended a grave threat and gave impetus to then-ongoing peace negotiations. Likewise, but earlier during the war and on the other side of the District, Brigadier General Jacob Brown stopped a British invasion led by Sir George Provost and Commodore James Yeo at Sackets Harbor. Of note, Sackets Harbor was the United States' main shipbuilding naval base on Lake Ontario. 
   In addition to providing a mechanism to properly remember and honor these and other significant events in our nation's history, H.R. 1389 is also important to my constituents because of its potential to help increase tourism. Tourism is an important component of the economy in New York's 23rd District and is a cornerstone of efforts to further much-needed economic development. Accordingly, I ask my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1389 today and I look forward to working further to enact this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. MCHUGH. (HUDSON-FULTON-CHAMPLAIN QUADRICENTENNIAL COMMEMORATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MCHUGH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1520, the Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Act of 2007. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which I have been working with the Gentleman from New York, Mr. Hinchey, since 2003 to enact. In fact, the House previously passed our bill, H.R. 2528, by voice vote during the 108th Congress. 
   The bill, H.R. 1520, before the House today would authorize $500,000 annually from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2011 for the Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Commission, to plan and execute programs and activities to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Samuel de Champlain's voyage. 
   Likewise, H.R. 1520 would also authorize $500,000 annually from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2011 for a second commission, the Hudson-Fulton 400th Commemoration Commission, to plan and execute programs and activities to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson's voyage, as well as the 200th anniversary of Robert Fulton's invention of the steamboat. 
   Samuel de Champlain, the ``Father of New France,'' explored a great deal New York's 23rd Congressional District. In fact, he discovered Lake Champlain in 1609 and traveled extensively on the St. Lawrence River. Thus, my constituents in Northern New York, particularly those in Clinton County, have a keen interest in H.R. 1520, particularly its potential to enhance tourism. 
   Thus, I greatly appreciate the work the Gentleman from New York, Mr. Hinchey, the Gentleman from California, Mr. Waxman, and the Gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Davis, have done to bring H.R. 1520 to the House floor and I urge my colleagues to vote for it today.
