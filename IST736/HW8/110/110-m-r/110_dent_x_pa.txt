   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Israel for helping organize this Special Order this evening, and I do want to commend you for what you've been doing to help try to change the tone of this institution. You're absolutely right when you talk about the level of noise, the partisan vitriol. 
   I think we all realize that many of our constituents come to us from time to time, and they see partisanship for the sake of partisanship. They don't always see the philosophical differences that may underlie those partisan debates. They get annoyed with it, and they see carping and whining. They hear Republicans criticizing Democrats over their policies, Democrats criticizing Republicans. And I think at times they would just like us to turn the temperature down, improve the tone and try to find solutions to the problems that face us, especially on issues of war and peace. 
   It was after the Second World War in the late 1940s and right up until the demise of the former Soviet Union, this Nation seemed to have a bipartisan policy to carry us through the cold war. It was called the policy of containment, and that doesn't mean that everybody in Congress felt universally that containment was a great policy, and they might have disagreed with certain aspects of that policy. But nevertheless, containment was the policy and it was able to survive from one administration to the next. Whether that be a Democrat or Republican administration, the policy survived, and each administration may have had a different spin on it and tweaked that policy, but it was the policy of this country. 
   And I think that our enemies understood that. We all understood that there was a Soviet threat, and we as Americans came together during that Cold War and eventually were successful. We outlasted the Soviet Union, and here we are in Iraq. 
   I think the American people have reached a point where they'd like us to develop that same kind of bipartisan consensus as we deal with the threats that face us today, the threats from violent extremists, people who are represented by al Qaeda we know who want to do great damage to us, who have made statements to the effect that they want to kill 4 million Americans, 2 million children. 
   So the American people expect us to work together, and Iraq certainly is part of this whole debate because, of course, al Qaeda has a significant presence in that country. And I do want to thank you once again for helping to facilitate this dialogue. Because of your efforts and many others, we were able to talk about the Iraq Study Group and the recommendations presented there. 
   Also, we may hear from some of our other colleagues later tonight, people like Congressmen Tanner and Castle, Tanner a Democrat from Tennessee and Castle a Republican from Delaware, who have talked at great length about the need for a bipartisan compact on Iraq. And they really set forth several principles that they thought that we could all agree to as we move forward. 
   And one of those first principles they talked about was that we could agree in Congress that we need to end the political infighting over the conflict in Iraq and commit immediately to a truly bipartisan dialogue on these issues that we're facing, and that was I think really their first main point. And many of us have signed on to that compact, an even number of Republicans and Democrats, and I think that's very important.  
   And we came to an agreement on many of those issues, and I won't elaborate them all right now because I think some others may want to talk about them, but I think it is absolutely critical. Those points of interest of policy in this bipartisan compact on Iraq are entirely consistent, in my view, with the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, another very significant initiative headed by former Secretary of State James Baker and former distinguished Congressman Lee Hamilton that talked about a lot of things I think many of us agree on. 
   For example, we all agree that there shouldn't be permanent bases in Iraq, and you came up with the idea of a status of forces agreement in lieu of permanent bases, just a status of forces agreement just like our Nation has with other countries where we have a military presence, whether that be in Germany or Korea, like we had in the Philippines at one time, where our country enters into agreements with those governments to really state the nature of our presence and what the presence would be. And it's also certainly important to the government that we'll be dealing with, whether it be in Iraq or elsewhere, to help give them legitimacy. 
   So that was an idea that you came up with, and again, I think it's an issue that we can all agree to on a very broad bipartisan basis. 
   There are other issues, too, but I won't belabor them all tonight, but I think something you said to me a few weeks ago I think is worth repeating, and it's this: That as our constituents from time to time watch C-SPAN and they hear the noise, they hear the rancor and they sometimes get a little frustrated and throw up their hands about what's happening in Congress, and I think you said it was one of your constituents who pointed out after the last time we did one of these bipartisan Special Orders, they said that we were making C-SPAN safe for children once again, and for that, I want to give you a lot of credit, but there's a lot of truth to that. 
   Hopefully, because of these types of activities that we are conducting here tonight, more people will be likely to turn on C-SPAN and listen to I hope what will be a very thoughtful and constructive dialogue on one of the preeminent issues that's facing this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Again, I applaud you for your leadership on this issue. You are absolutely right, the Jones Commission really did give your legislation, without saying it, a very strong endorsement.  
   I think you pointed out another issue that I think we can all agree on about this issue of permanent bases. We have voted before against permanent bases, and your status of forces agreement, I think, really does provide the right answer to the question of permanent bases. 
   I would also point out too that should not be an open-ended commit in Iraq as has been reported and stated in the Iraq Study Group report. 
   Finally, I think there is another area where most of us degree in this Chamber, that what we want in this country is we want to make sure that we pursue our national interest as it relates to Iraq. 
   I think most of us realize that we cannot allow al Qaeda to have a base from which to operate in Iraq. I think that's something on which Republicans and Democrats can agree. I think we also agree that we cannot allow Iraq to become a failed state, that is, it becomes a threat to itself and to the region. 
   The third point I want to make on this, I think it's a very significant point, and perhaps we don't state it enough, and I think you will get a sense of this issue, if you have ever attended the funeral of someone who was killed in Iraq, as I know we all have, and I have families in my district, and Paris and Rush that have lost family members in recent months, and the issue really deals with honoring the service and sacrifice of our people who have invested so much or in some cases, as Abraham Lincoln said, gave that last full measure of devotion. 
   I have had numerous conversations, for example, with Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, and I know some of you have as well. We talk about these types of issues that, regardless of how one feels about the run up to this war, or how it has been executed, and the mistakes have been made along the way, critics of this administration, for example, have said they do not listen to many of the generals going into Iraq. 
   But I think it's very important that we do listen to generals as we transition down and go out of Iraq. I think that's critically important that we do this, and as we transition, that we remember the service and the sacrifice, remember our national interest, which is making sure al Qaeda has no base from which to operate and that we do not leave a failed state in our wake. 
   I just wanted to share those thoughts with you and, again, applaud you. I hope that your bill is one of those bipartisan bills that we will be able to bring to this floor for consideration, just as we did with the Tanner-Abercrombie-English bill today, which was a good start. I think we saw a broad consensus in this House that supported that legislation, and I think that's good for all of us. 
   Again, I would just applaud you for your work on the status of forces agreement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. I'd like to thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. 
   And Madam Speaker, there's one issue that I always recall very much, having visited Iraq in the summer of 2005 with at least one gentleman in this room tonight. And it dealt with the issue of reconciliation, although we really didn't talk as much as about it back then, but that's what the exercise was in. 
   You've mentioned this, as we talked about reconciliation in Iraq, you were very good enough to organize a meeting among the Center Aisle Caucus not so long ago where a prominent Iraqi in the diplomatic corps addressed us, and he talked about the need for reconciliation in our country. And we referred to the tribalism in Iraq that we saw that was frustrating to us and difficult for us to comprehend, and he sort of noticed the tribalism in our country, as he referred to it, I believe, as in Republicans and Democrats and very hard for him to understand the type of chatter that was going on here. So the point is there's reconciliation needed here in America as well as in Iraq. 
   But one issue of reconciliation that I learned about in Iraq, Madam Speaker, was in August of 2005 when I met a fellow named Albert Chowanski, Jr., who was from a town about 45 miles from my hometown of Allentown, Pennsylvania. He lives in Frackville, Pennsylvania; been in the Middle East for about 30 years. He was working for a contractor, the Siemens Corporation, and was building a power plant, helping to construct a power plant in the Taza area near Kirkuk. And he told me the challenges of building a power plant while people are shooting mortars at you, and how difficult that was. And I asked him, ``Well, how did you deal with the situation?'' He said, ``Well, the mortar attacks weren't very effective, to be perfectly candid, but nevertheless it was troublesome and made life difficult for us.'' And so he said the way he dealt with it, he went out and he met with each of the tribal leaders, and that's a multiethnic area near Kirkuk. You have ethnic Turks or Turkmen, and you have Kurds and Sunni Arabs and Shia Arabs. And so he went out and he met with all the tribal leaders, and he gave jobs to members of each tribe. And he said, ``You know, they all work together just fine, and everything went pretty quiet.'' 
   And my point is that here's a fellow who seemed to be an engineer of some sort. I think he was an electrical engineer, and he was out there trying to solve a problem from a very practical level. And we've seen a bit of that in Iraq, I think, in recent months. You've seen it in the Sunni areas that have been much talked about, the tribal leaders turning on al Qaeda, which is all very encouraging. But sometimes we talk about benchmarks and we talk about things that we expect the Iraqis to do, and we are frustrated with the pace of or lack of progress in that country from the higher levels.     
   But then we see some of these more local efforts at reconciliation that do bring a certain amount of encouragement and hope. 
   But I just wanted to share that with you tonight as something that we ought to think more about as we talk about this policy of how we deal with Iraq and as we try to deal with the issue from 60,000 feet in the air here. And as many of us have visited that country and we talk to a lot of folks who are in charge, sometimes life brings us unexpected events, and sometimes those events are positive, and I think we can learn from people who are on the ground.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, we have come to the floor many times over the past few years to discuss the advancement of various forms of stem cell research: adult, cord blood, amniotic, embryonic. We have had discussions about the science and about our moral obligations and about ethics. These discussions have been passionate and heartfelt. We have all come to the floor with the best of intentions. 
   For some of us, our feelings on these issues have been colored by personal experiences with our own families. For all of us, our stance has been informed by the conversations we have had with our constituents. 
   I have had countless discussions with my constituents about embryonic stem cell research. In particular, there are two families from my district whose personal stories have made a profound impact on my thinking about this issue, the Sheaffers from Kempton, Pennsylvania, and the Pitts from Nazareth. 
   I am very happy that the Pitts family, Melissa and Jeff and their sons, Ryan and Alex, are able to be with us today. I first met Melissa and the boys in 2005. Ryan and Alex are energetic 6-year-old twin boys. You could not tell them apart if not for the fact that Alex is in a wheelchair. Alex suffered a spinal cord injury at birth and has been paralyzed since. Melissa has told me that the promise of embryonic stem cell research gives her hope, hope that advances will allow her son, Alex, to live the same kind of independent life that Ryan will enjoy.  
   Every day that goes by while we play politics with science is a day that we could have gotten one step closer to finding therapies for kids like Alex. I urge my colleagues to support S. 5. This is an important bill which will ensure that researchers adhere to the highest possible principles of scientific inquiry and respect critical ethical boundaries while advancing some of the most important research of our time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Thank you so much, Congressman Israel and Congressman Bishop, for helping to organize this Special Order tonight. I think the American people expect this much of us, that they like to see this type of civil, controlled dialogue where we are trying to rally around, I think, some shared principles that we can pretty much agree to, that we are talking about this in a proper tone, keeping the temperature down, so to speak. And I think that that is what the public expects instead of all the sometimes hot air and noise and at times excessive partisanship that seems to be the public perception of how this institution operates far too often. 
   And I just want to take a couple of moments to commend you, Congressman Israel, on something that you have shared with many of us who participate in the Center Aisle Caucus, and that is the idea of a Status of Forces Agreement and how such an agreement might be of benefit to us in Iraq. 
   And for purposes of this discussion, that Status of Forces Agreement is an agreement that is worked out between our government and the foreign country that delineates the legal partnership between the troops who are deployed to that country and the host government. And that is a very significant issue. 
   In the civil side of the law, for example, a Status of Forces Agreement can spell out proceedings under which nationals of the host country may file claims against the United States for damage to property of these nationals that has been inadvertently caused by the United States Armed Forces. An agreement is also important because it can be used to spell out jurisdictional issues with regard to criminal offenses. For example, these agreements are often used to make sure that American servicemembers who commit offenses overseas and are tried by U.S. military courts-martial rather than local courts. They can also delineate the conditions under which U.S. servicemembers charged with crimes within the boundaries of the host country are treated. A Status of Forces Agreement can specify, for example, that a servicemember accused of a crime in violation of local laws must be detained on board a ship or some other U.S. installation rather than await trial in a local jail. 
   We have never had a Status of Forces Agreement with the Iraqi government. I know that is something that you have been strongly advocating, and I believe it is high time that we implement one for a few reasons. First, a Status of Forces Agreement is an agreement between two sovereign nations. By executing such an agreement, we would be affirming sovereignty of the Maliki government and the right, as well as the obligation, of that government to exercise control over its own territory. 
   Second, a Status of Forces Agreement would send a clear message both to the Iraqis and to other countries in the region that we do not intend to establish permanent bases in Iraq, I think something that many of us on both sides of the aisle agree. And this agreement is usually negotiated for a fixed period of time, and it can be renewed or not, as was the case with the old Subic Bay naval base in the Republic of the Philippines. 
   The Philippines example is instructive, I think, in this instance. There  the Aquino government asserted its sovereign rights over Subic Bay by refusing to renew a prior agreement and other related treaties with our government in 1992. Thus the world was made to know that even though the U.S. had a presence in Subic Bay and a neighboring city for more than 90 years prior to that time, that presence was not permanent and was subject to an agreement that had to be agreed to by both nations. 
   And third, as described a few moments ago, this agreement, if properly negotiated, can protect U.S. forces from being tried by foreign courts or prevent them from being detained in Iraqi facilities if charged with a crime under foreign law. This kind of measure is necessary to make sure that Americans operating overseas have the fullest protections afforded to them by Federal jurisprudence. 
   I also really want to thank you again for organizing this, and I think these shared principles you have outlined here are really a basis upon which we can have further dialogue. And a little later in this Special Order, I might want to talk about the Iraq Study Group recommendations, the Baker-Hamilton report, that I think many of us on both sides of the aisle have a good feeling about, and there is legislation that has been proposed and recently introduced, and I will get into that a little later. 
   At this time I would like to yield to one of our other colleagues, the distinguished gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays), who has been to Iraq 17 times now.

   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I also want to endorse the gentleman from Connecticut's idea about reconstituting the Iraq Study Group and sending them back over to Iraq at some point to help give us an update of this very useful report. I think we all can agree that many of us in this country, and I suspect in Iraq too, are frustrated by this slow pace of reconciliation that is ongoing in Iraq. 
   But, again, another point about this report, and I think this gathering tonight, I think this helps us as Americans try to reconcile our differences. We talk about Iraqi reconciliation, but I think in many respects we need a little reconciliation of our own.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Well, it is a very fair point in many respects. I just want to point out something. When I first read this report back in December when it was first released, I had some concerns too, like many people, about some of the recommendations, particularly the recommendation about directly engaging Iran, for all the reasons we have identified. Ahmadinejad is a virulent anti-Semite. He has made such inflammatory comments. I think we all agree he is a menace. 
   After listening to Jim Baker and Lee Hamilton talk about the issue, I don't think any of us expect there to be any real process in a dialogue with Iran at a sub-cabinet level, but I think we also realize that you need to have that kind of a conversation initially and let the Iranians be an obstruction themselves, so we can then isolate them internationally and also perhaps drive a wedge between the Iranian Government and the Syrian Government. 
   I think it makes absolutely no sense for the Syrians to be engaged in destructive behavior in Iraq, given the fact that they have more than 1 million refugees, primarily Sunni, who are in Syria. Of course, Syria is ruled by Allawites, who represent about 10 percent of that country. So it is clearly not in Syria's interest to have protracted instability in Iraq. 
   So, again, I just wanted to thank the gentleman from Connecticut for his thoughtful idea about getting the Iraq Study Group back over there, perhaps hearing what General Petraeus says and make some recommendations on what he has said, and maybe give us a bipartisan way for us to move forward. 
   I think Americans want a solution. They don't want an issue in Iraq, but they want a solution. I think that is one of the great things about this dialogue tonight.  
   I yield back to the gentleman from New York.

We need to see a little bit more of this type of activity in this Congress, and I hope the American people who are watching this exercise tonight maybe find this a little bit different or maybe a little bit more refreshing than what they are accustomed to during special orders. I just want to thank you for putting this together. 
   One final point. I think Mr. Gilchrest made the point about interaction with Syria on a commercial basis in this country. A constituent called just the other day who imports various food products from Syria, because I have a large Middle Eastern community in my district. And just some of the challenges, they just want to go about life as they normally would. 
   I thought it was interesting. It kind of brings back home the point that people want to coexist peacefully. That the challenges and the stakes are very high in Iraq, and I think all of us want to make sure that whatever policy is pursued, particularly after September, it is one that is responsible and one that will make us all safer and hopefully the region more stable. 
   So, again, thank you, Mr. Israel, for putting this on. It is much appreciated.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. I too want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Inglis) for working together so well to bring this important piece of legislation to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to join 415 of my colleagues in supporting this bill last Congress, and I am pleased that the H-Prize Act has been brought up again so that we can have an opportunity to enact this important legislation into law. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 632, the H-Prize Act. The Constitution of the United States provides that Congress has the power to promote the progress of science and the useful arts. We, in Congress, have an opportunity and obligation to promote scientific advancement today. For more than a century, America's industry, transportation, and households have been heavily reliant on foreign oil. We must now face newer realities. 
   Petroleum is a finite resource. No matter how much we explore and discover, we will one day run out and booming worldwide demand is burning up resources and driving up prices. We must search for alternatives to wean us off our addiction to foreign sources of oil. The drive to produce energy economically can be advanced to American innovation and competition. 
   Fossil fuel technology was the impetus for 20th century industrial development. Today, hydrogen holds a promise of being the driver for the economy of the future and ushering in a new generation of an American energy independence. 
   Hydrogen makes up 98 percent of the known universe, and it is the third most abundant element of the earth's surface. It is the lightest of all gases, the coldest of all liquids, next to helium. As a component of water, minerals and acids, it makes up a fundamental part of all hydrocarbons and organic substances. Hydrogen is renewable, abundant, efficient and clean. Unlike carbon-based fuels, it does not create fumes or other harmful emissions. 
   In fact, using hydrogen in fuel cells produces only electricity and pure water. By awarding prizes in three of the most critical areas of technological development, the H-Prize Act will incentivize the realization of scientific advancements that will break down the obstacles that stand in the way of the hydrogen economy. 
   Specifically, H-Prize will promote technological advancements in hydrogen production, storage, distribution and utilization. Prizes will be awarded for the development of hydrogen vehicle prototypes that meet ambitious performance goals. Finally, the bill will award the implementation of critical transformational technologies. 
   We are not that far away from making hydrogen a functional source of energy. H.R. 632 will speed the development of breakthrough technologies that will make hydrogen a practical alternative to oil in our transportation sector and set our Nation on a path toward energy independence. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 632.  
   Again, I do want to commend the two gentlemen, Mr. Lipinski of Illinois and Mr. Inglis of South Carolina, for their strong advocacy on this critical issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (VIOLENT RADICALIZATION AND HOMEGROWN TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, I have to add my two cents' worth, that the same folks who were training up in the Poconos near Congressman Carney's home were training about an hour from my home as well, and we all, I think, realize the nature of this homegrown threat. 
   But I want to rise today to speak in support of H.R. 1955, the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act. 
   Recently, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials have enjoyed a number of successes in the war against violent extremism. The plot to kill soldiers at Fort Dix, the attempt to disrupt the Kennedy Airport pipeline system, and last year's conspiracy to bring down the U.S./U.K. transatlantic flights, were all disrupted by good intelligence efforts and, as a result, lives were saved. 
   But we cannot rest on our laurels. After all, it is still al Qaeda's stated goal to kill 4 million Americans, to bring the United States to its knees, and to impose a system of radical violent Islamism upon the Middle East, and in fact the rest of the world. We need to protect ourselves from this threat to do everything we can in order to make sure that there are no future terrorist attacks on the homeland, and the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act would help us certainly in this effort. 
   This bill's effectiveness is enhanced by the fact that it was put together in a spirit of bipartisan, much to the credit of the Chair, Ms. Harman. Earlier this year, the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee's Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment Subcommittee, Congressman DAVE REICHERT, introduced legislation, H.R. 1695, that forms the basis for the current bill, H.R. 1955. Chairwoman Harman and Ranking Member Reichert have both actively supported the current bill, which was voted out of the Homeland Security Committee without opposition in August. 
   Also, this bill was the subject of numerous hearings, excellent hearings, much to the credit of both of them.     
   This bill can help us to stop the spread of violent radicalization that has helped terrorist groups to grow their rank-and-file membership. It creates a 10-member national commission, modeled after the 9/11 Commission, which will study radicalization and come up with recommendations for defusing its power and preventing its spread. It establishes a university-based center of excellence that will study this phenomenon in depth, and it encourages international cooperation to stop the spread of this violent extremism. It authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to work with nations such as the U.K. and Israel, countries that have had a lot of experience and success in dealing with violent extremism within their borders, to develop a ``best practices'' methodology that can be used to help prevent radicalization and to thwart ideologically based violence. 
   I hope that Members will join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation aimed at protecting us against violent extremism and at making us safer here in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (SECURE HANDLING OF AMMONIUM NITRATE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, if there is an example of how legislation should be crafted, the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2007 is it. This is a great bill that will help to improve our homeland security. And if it should succeed on the floor today, its passage will be a tribute to the spirit of bipartisanship that is alive and well in the Homeland Security Committee and that has been carefully cultivated under the leadership of that committee's chairman, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), its ranking member (Mr. King), and certainly Mr. Lungren, to my immediate left, who have all worked very hard to work in that bipartisan environment on the committee. 
   The bill started out in the 109th Congress where it was introduced by former Congressman Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, while it passed in the Homeland Security Committee, it was never addressed in the full House. Fortunately, in 2007, Chairman Thompson recognized the importance of this legislation and helped revive the bill in the new Congress. Both sides worked together to make sure that the bill accomplished its objective, to keep ammonium nitrate out of the hands of Timothy McVeighs and other would-be terrorists of the world while making sure that legitimate end users of the substance in agricultural production were not inconvenienced. An en bloc amendment offered by Chairman Thompson, for example, removed the requirement that farmers and others register with the Department of Homeland Security so long as they never come into possession of the ammonium nitrate. 
   In addition to protecting the rights of legitimate end users, the chairman also helped make sure that the final legislative product had input from both sides of the aisle. Three key Republican amendments were added to the bill during committee markup as a result. First, offered by my colleague from California (Mr. Lungren), directed applications by those seeking to distribute or utilize ammonium nitrate be checked against a terror watch list with an expedited appeals process to handle any cases of mistaken hits. Ranking Member King also offered an amendment that would protect legitimate distributors of ammonium nitrate if they act in good faith when they refuse to sell to a suspicious purchaser or if they notify the department of that would-be purchaser's suspicious behavior. Finally, Congresswoman Brown-Waite offered an amendment that would help to streamline record-keeping requirements for agricultural retail outlets. These amendments have all served to strengthen the bill. 
   The need for this legislation is clear. Ammonium nitrate has been the explosive material of choice in a number of acts and attempted acts of terrorism, including the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City which killed 168 innocent men, women and children. The 1998 attacks on the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the Toronto-based bomb plot thwarted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in June 2006, of course, most recently, the attempts by a terrorist group in London to detonate explosive charges throughout the United Kingdom. 
   I hope the House will see fit to join me in supporting this effective legislation. It is a very bipartisan piece of legislation. Again, I would like to thank my colleague from California for yielding me this time and thank him for his leadership on this issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I want to make four points about this amendment that I'm offering here today. First, the expansion of Indian or tribal gambling, particularly off-reservation casino gambling, has gone far beyond what was intended by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. 
   Twenty years ago, there were no tribal casinos. Today, there are approximately 406 Indian casinos in 29 States. 
   Revenue from Indian gambling has gone from $0 to $19 billion in 20 years. These extraordinary profits have caused casino interests to form alliances with tribes in order to establish more profitable casinos in locations far removed from existing reservations. 
   The second point I want to make, and there are very specific examples of ``reservation shopping,'' as we like to refer to this. One, the St. Regis Bank of Mohawk Indians is trying to build a casino 350 miles from its reservation. 
   The Bad River Band of Lake Superior and St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin are trying to build a casino in Michigan, over 300 miles from its existing reservation. 
   The Pueblo of Jemez of New Mexico are trying to build a casino in Anthony, New Mexico, over 290 miles from its reservation. 
   The Mohegan Tribe of Connecticut, along with the Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin, is trying to build the largest casino between New Jersey and Las Vegas in Kenosha, Wisconsin, over 1,000 miles from the Mohegan lands in Connecticut. 
   As of May 2006, there were some 40 applications to approve new casino operations pending at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, casinos that are, for the most part, destined for off-reservation sites. 
   The third point I want to make is that the expansion of tribal gambling has had a corrupting influence on the political system and has forced local municipalities and homeowners to go to court to essentially protect their properties from casino interests anxious to seize their lands. 
   Tribal casino profits are high, and regulation of tribal gaming profits is minimal. As a result, Jack Abramoff was able to take an estimated $85 million from the Mississippi Choctaw and other tribes. He was able to use some of this money to bribe entities within the political system, sometimes to further the interest of one client as against those of another. 
   Casino interests have also allied with local Indian tribes to sue municipalities and landowners. In the 15th District of Pennsylvania, which I represent, the Delaware Nation, which is actually based in Oklahoma, filed in Federal court to establish title to a 315-acre tract of land in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, near Easton, so that it could build a gambling facility. Its claim was based in part on a conveyance that ostensibly occurred in 1737, well before the establishment of our country. 
   More than 25 families live on this property, and it is also home of the Crayola Company, which makes the much beloved Crayola crayons that our children all enjoy. 
   Although the suit was ultimately resolved in favor of the homeowners and the plaintiffs lost in every courtroom, the deep-pocketed interests behind this lawsuit were able to fund this litigation all the way to the United States Supreme Court, causing no small amount of apprehension among the innocent home owners and business owners here. 
   Tribal organizations do recognize that there are problems with this expansion. Several support meaningful limitations on off-reservation tribal gambling. 
   And the fourth and final point that I would like to make about this amendment, Mr. Chairman, is that the time has come for Congress to step in. This amendment is the first step towards reforming a system that has simply spun out of control. 
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs published proposed regulations on October 5, 2006, but these regulations are weak and do not adopt meaningful criteria or standards. 
   The Congress must step in and reassert its regulatory authority over off-reservation gambling by enacting comprehensive reform of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. Until that's done, we need to have a moratorium on off-reservation gambling, which this amendment will, in effect, accomplish. 
   The amendment directs specifically that no funds shall be expended to process any applications for off-reservation casinos under section 20(b)(1) of IGRA of fiscal year 2008. 
   The amendment will have no impact, and let me repeat this: The amendment will have no impact on existing on-or off-reservation casino operations, as they have already gone through the BIA approval process. This will not impact any tribal casino that is currently operating on- or off-reservation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to point out the fact that this problem has simply spun out of control in this country. Last session, we attempted to deal with this in a bill that would restrict off-site. Off-reservation tribal gambling was defeated. I think we need to try this again. 
   The regulations that were mentioned are simply weak and not meaningful enough, in my view, and I think we need the proposed regulations.     
   I would strongly urge that Congress reassert itself and take control over  this issue. I don't believe that the authors of the Indian Gaming Act of 1988 intended that we would have a situation in this country today where 29 States would now have casinos, 406 tribal casinos in 29 States. I don't think that was the intent. I haven't met anybody who voted for that law who thought that was what they were voting for at the time, but that is what we have now. 
   In my district, there has been great hardship. I mean, a 1737 land conveyance, a 1737 land conveyance, going back to William Penn and the Walking Purchase. That is what we are talking about here, taking land of homeowners, a crayon factory, a much beloved crayon factory, and I think it is time for us to act. It is time for this Congress to act. We have had a lot of time to deal with this issue. We have not done so. 
   And with that, again, I respectfully ask all my colleagues, and I understand the process that we are engaged in here, but we need this type of a moratorium. It is absolutely essential. I think it will send a message to the authorizing committees, to the Department of Interior that we are serious about this issue, that we have had enough. Enough is enough. Too many people are being displaced or potentially displaced, clouds over the properties to their titles, again, in my case, over a 1737 land conveyance. Again, these were big developers working in concert with the tribes and spending enormous amounts of money and people having to defend themselves. And it really has gotten to the point of being outrageous, and I think we need to act once again. And I respectfully ask for the support of everyone here. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (CHARLIE ALLEBACH, JR. -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I come here today not to speak about the great weighty issues of the day, whether it be Iraq or the budget process and procedures of the House, homeland security or any number of issues. No, Mr. Speaker, I come here today to talk about the career of a wonderful individual. You know, it was Tip O'Neill who once said that all politics is local, and I rise today to honor the career of one of our Nation's great local civic leaders, civic officials, Charlie Allebach, Jr. 
   Charlie has been serving the people of the Borough of Souderton, Pennsylvania, for almost 43 years. Let me say that again. That is for 43 years, he has served the people of Souderton, Pennsylvania. He first became a borough councilman in 1964--by the way, I was 4 years old at that time--he was appointed mayor in 1970, and he has been mayor ever since. But I just want you to know, too, that he has just announced his retirement. 
   Charlie has presided over the steady growth of a wonderful community, Souderton, Pennsylvania. If you don't know anything about Souderton, it is in the Indian Valley of Pennsylvania, Montgomery County. It has got a great tradition. The Mennonites have had an enormous influence on that area over the years, have deeply influenced the culture and tradition. There is a great sense of family and faith in that area. Souderton is an extraordinary community. 
   Charlie, also, I want you to know, has performed more than 2,400 marriage ceremonies, lent his time to local service organizations and has been devoted to the borough in every way imaginable. 
   On behalf of the people of the 15th Congressional District, I wish him the best during his retirement. We would like to keep him around in public office longer, but I understand that 40 years is a long time. We wish him the best in this richly deserved retirement. 
   I also ask that a copy of my remarks today be included in the Congressional Record so that Charlie Allebach, Jr.'s career as the mayor of Souderton can be memorialized within the annals of Congress for all time and to all the people in the Indian Valley in Souderton, I know that they are perhaps watching today the proceedings of the House and I know they have such a deep affection for this man. We don't spend enough time in our lives as Members of Congress thanking and celebrating people who do things right, who enter public service because they believe in advancing the best interests of their community. They are not doing it for themselves. That is what Charlie Allebach is all about.  
   So to Charlie, we say once again, thank you for a job well done. We hope to see you around. We know we will, but just want you to know that your contributions to all of us, to our community, are deeply appreciated and will not be forgotten.  
   Mr. Speaker, Tip O'Neill once said that all politics is local, and I rise today to honor the career of one our nation's great local civic officials, Charlie Allebach, Jr. 
   Charlie has been serving the people of the Borough of Souderton, Pennsylvania, for almost 43--that's 43--years. He first became a borough councilman in 1964, and he was appointed mayor in 1970. He has been the mayor ever since, but he has just announced his retirement.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (MARTIN GUITAR COMPANY CELEBRATES ITS 175TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, while the music of Tom Petty, Sheryl Crow and Jimmy Buffett represent dramatically different styles, these three famous musicians and countless others throughout the world share one unique characteristic, they all play a Martin guitar. 
   Founded in 1833, Martin Guitar Company is celebrating its 175th anniversary in 2008. Headquartered in beautiful Nazareth, Pennsylvania, I'm very proud to have this remarkable business located in my district. 
   The fascinating origins of Martin Guitar date back to the late 18th century, when the company's founder and namesake, Christian Frederick Martin, Sr., was born in Germany. The son of a prominent local cabinet maker, Martin traveled to Vienna, Austria at the age of 15 to apprentice with Johann Stauffer, a renowned guitar maker. 
   After honing his craft in Austria, Martin returned to his native Germany to open his first shop, but became entangled in a bitter dispute between the local Cabinet Makers Guild and Violin Makers Guild. This clash ultimately drove Martin to emigrate to the United States in 1833, where he opened a shop in New York City's lower West Side. 
   Six years after arriving in New York City, Martin moved his family and business to Nazareth, Pennsylvania, where the shop flourished and evolved from a one-man operation into a company that employed over a dozen skilled craftsmen. In 1859, a plant was constructed on Maine and North Streets in the heart of Nazareth. Having undergone numerous expansions and modifications over time, this facility is still used by the company for shipping and storage. It also houses a retail supply store for instrument crafting and repair. 
   In its 175-year existence, Martin Guitar Company has used innovation and foresight to survive many tumultuous periods of American history. The company actually flourished during the Civil War due, in part, to the simple fact that many guitars were destroyed during fighting and needed to be replaced. 
   Later, in the 1890s, business boomed when Martin began producing mandolins that were widely popular among the growing number of Italian immigrants arriving in the United States from Europe. The company struck gold in the 1920s when the American public suddenly became captivated by the tiny ukulele. Spurred by the overwhelming sales of ukuleles, which at the time were being produced at nearly double the rate of traditional guitars, Martin was forced to expand the capacity of its Nazareth plant and substantially increase its workforce. 
   The advent of the Great Depression in 1929 imposed incredible hardships on American households. While every industry in the Nation was impacted by the economic downturn, Martin found it exceptionally difficult to sell guitars and musical supplies to a public desperately trying to make ends meet. 
   During the Depression, the company reluctantly abandoned aspirations for increasing sales and focused exclusively on economic survival. To avoid scaling back the already reeling workforce, Martin diversified its production and began manufacturing violin components and even wooden jewelry. Desperate for a concept to reinvigorate sales, the company explored numerous product modifications which ultimately led to two important developments, the creation of the now famous ``Dreadnought'' guitar, and the invention of the 14-Fret Guitar Neck, which today is an industry standard. 
   From 1948 to 1970, the company experienced unprecedented growth due to post-war prosperity and the rise in popularity of American folk music. In 1955, a new, larger plant was built in Nazareth to help meet increasing demand,  but by the early 1960s Martin guitars were back-ordered as much as 3 years. 
   In 1990, the company formalized its long-standing ecological policy which embraced the responsible use of natural materials and promoted the use of sustainable yield, alternative wood varieties. 
   Adopting such a progressive policy nearly 20 years ago has helped broaden the use of sustainable materials within the guitar industry over the last two decades and illustrates Martin's admirable dedication to responsible production. Martin's amazing longevity in a constantly changing industry is a true testament to the strength of the company's management and its commitment to crafting guitars of the highest quality. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Martin Guitar Company has been a source of tremendous pride in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania for generations. Today, I rise to congratulate the Martin family and their many employees on 175 years of achievement. I wish them many, many more years of incredible success. We are extraordinarily proud of them.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (VETERANS' COMPENSATION COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Thank you, Congressman Miller, for your leadership, as well as Congresswoman Berkley. I appreciate all of your leadership on this very important issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I too rise today to speak in favor of H.R. 1284, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2007. 
   I think we all are indeed grateful for the services of our Nation's veterans. They have answered this country's call time and time again. As a matter of fact, just last week I visited a VA outpatient clinic in my own district of Allentown, Pennsylvania. I continue to be amazed by the spirit of our veterans. Many of whom I met with there were in the Vietnam War, and some of whom were still struggling with the issues that affected them since their return. But I am nevertheless amazed by their spirit. 
   I also recently visited the Walter Reed Army Hospital in the wake of events. But as a Nation, we are indebted to these veterans. We are indebted to them for their contributions to our freedom. We need to take every opportunity to let those veterans know that they are appreciated and that their needs will be met by a grateful government and a grateful Nation. 
   H.R. 1284 is an opportunity for us to help meet those needs. This bill provides for an increase in the rate of compensation for disabled veterans and in the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for their families effective December 1. 
   The percentage increase in these rates would be equal to the increase for Social Security benefits, which would be calculated later this year. Veterans benefits must keep up with inflation. Veterans should not have to worry about losing their standard of living just because they may be living on a fixed income. 
   This bill will help to accomplish that particular objective. I strongly urge the Members of this House to show their support for America's veterans by voting in favor of the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living and Adjustment Act of 2007.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) and the gentlelady from New Mexico, Congresswoman Wilson, for their leadership on this critical issue. I'm also pleased to be joined by my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey).  
   But after looking at that graphic, I think all of us should take note. It was not only Attorney General Mukasey and National Intelligence Director McConnell who have talked about the degradation of our intelligence and the intelligence product. But it's also the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, a Democrat, Jay Rockefeller, who also talked about how our intelligence capacity has been degraded because of the failure to enact the Protect America Act. He said, and I quote, ``What people have to understand around here,'' and that's the Senate, ``is the quality of the intelligence we are going to be receiving is going to be degraded. It is going to be degraded. It is already going to be degraded as telecommunications companies lose interest.'' 
   He said three times, this capacity will be degraded. And I do want to applaud the gentleman from Texas for bringing up that e-mail that was cited in the 9/11 Commission report from the FBI agent who was so frustrated in August of 2001 about the failure of our law enforcement intelligence officers being able to collaborate effectively because of the wall that existed pre-PATRIOT Act. And he talked about that frustration. And he wanted to make sure those barriers were removed. And he also talked about how so many protections were being provided to Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda at the expense of the security of the American people. 
   When we came to this Congress, the 110th Congress, when it first convened, we were told by the new leadership under Speaker Pelosi that fulfilling the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission report was a top priority. Well, it's time to equate those words with action. It's absolutely essential that we do so. 
   And many of our friends on the other side of the aisle, and this shouldn't be a partisan issue because we have bipartisan support for this bill. We have more than a two-thirds majority in the Senate, and there are over 20 members of the Democratic Caucus who have said that they're going to vote for this bill. It shouldn't be a partisan issue. We all know that. 
   And they've often talked about that we should be allowing our law enforcement officials to deal with these terrorists more effectively and that we shouldn't be using our military as much. That is what they say. 
   I have a letter here from the Fraternal Order of Police asking us to pass this law. We need to give law enforcement the tools they need to do their job. We can't simply say on the one hand we shouldn't be using the military but we should be using law enforcement, and then tie the hands of those very law enforcement officials we need to help us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. That graphic you just showed from 9/11 in New York vividly reminds me of that day, and my cousin was on the 91st floor of the north tower. He was one of the lucky ones. He got out. Everybody above him was killed, and all 11 people on his floor made it out, and it was a harrowing experience which I won't go through here tonight. 
   But we should also remember an article that was written by a woman named Debra Burlingame. She wrote this editorial in The Wall Street Journal a few years ago, and she talked about the fact that there were two individuals in this country before 9/11 that FBI agent you referred to earlier was concerned about. He was concerned about those individuals, and for whatever reason, nobody in the FBI was prepared to go to the FISA Court to go on a nationwide manhunt for these two individuals. Didn't happen until the afternoon of September 11, 2001. 
   And those two individuals that Debra Burlingame wrote about, who we were so concerned about, who were operating out of San Diego, who were making phone calls to Yemen into a switchboard run by the brother-in-law of one of those two individuals, bin Laden would call into that switchboard himself. 
   The point is those two individuals were the ones who crashed the plane into the Pentagon, and the pilot of that plane was a man named Burlingame, Captain Burlingame, the brother of Debra, and it really speaks to the issue that we should be surveiling and monitoring calls of people who are not American citizens and who we suspect that are engaged in serious terrorist activities. 
   We had a sense that those two people were bad actors, but we failed to act. We can't let that happen again. Heaven forbid if there's another terror attack like that of 9/11 or something worse, and heaven forbid if, for whatever reason, we failed in our duty to provide our law enforcement officials, our counterterrorism officials the tools they needed to connect the dots. And as you so eloquently stated, we cannot connect the dots if we can't find the dots. That's precisely the point.

   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to just say that I think the American people hear our frustration here tonight. People of all ideological stripes in this body support the Protect America Act, and I think the people of the United States expect an answer as to why the leadership of this body under Speaker Pelosi will not allow this legislation to be considered. 
   And I believe very respectfully that Speaker Pelosi and the far left are driven by an extreme agenda on this critical national security issue, and it appears that there are a very small number of people in this body, in this country, who don't want to enact these important reforms. 
   It's time to stop pandering to trial lawyers or to the ACLU or moveon.org and get on with the business of this country, and it seems that in too many cases there are some people who are misguided, who seem to think that the FBI and the CIA and the NSA and other intelligence agencies that support this government are a greater threat to us than is al Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden. 
   And that is what is so frustrating to me, that our law enforcement officials, our counterterrorism officials, our intelligence officials want us to get the job done. Intelligence officials are taking out personal liability insurance to protect themselves against lawsuits or a congressional inquiry, not protect themselves against al Qaeda but to protect themselves against people in this town, Washington, DC. And again, it's really time for us to get on with the business of this Nation. 
   The bipartisan compromise that we have all talked about has been reached. Many of us try to work in a very bipartisan manner on a number of issues. This is one clear case where we've done so, and it's time for the leadership to allow us to get the job done, and we call on Speaker Pelosi to do just that.

   I think just about everything has been said. We have a job to do. The American people expect us to get it done. We've heard from the attorney generals, we've heard from the U.S. Attorney General, Michael Mukasey. We've heard from the Director of National Intelligence, Michael McConnell. We have heard from everyone. And the fact that this intelligence product is being degraded should be alarming to every single American. The fact that we're debating this this evening, knowing that we may not be getting vital intelligence or information I think should be cause for alarm. 
   There are going to be those who say that we're doing this fear-mongering. That is absolute nonsense. We're simply stating facts. And the facts are that our intelligence personnel today don't have the tools that they had just a few weeks ago to deal with the threats that we face as a Nation. 
   With that, I want to thank you again for your leadership. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, you and I are deeply engaged in these issues, along with Mrs. Wilson, who has been a great leader on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Again, we need to keep pounding this point home. I am prepared to come to the floor of the House every single night until this law is enacted. 
   With that, I yield back to the gentleman from Texas.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL TEEN DRIVER SAFETY WEEK -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, I'm pleased to rise this afternoon in support of this legislation which designates the third week of October as National Teen Driver Safety Week. 
   As has already been stated, we witness this issue on far too many occasions, but roughly 7,500 teenage drivers were involved in fatal car crashes in 2005. Today, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among American teenagers. 
   The time has come for Congress to recognize this terrible problem and consider effective interventions that will help reduce the number of accidents involving teens on American roads. 
   On Monday, January 22, 2007, following a tragic accident that claimed the lives of two young high school students in my district, The Morning Call newspaper compiled a report: Fatal crashes involving teens that had occurred in the Lehigh Valley region since 2001. This report indicated that there were a total of 13 fatalities between 2001 and 2006, with alcohol involved in two of the seven accidents reported. Other contributing factors included racing and reckless behavior. 
   Sadly, it appears that these events, which are happening in every corner of the United States, could have been prevented, enabling these young adults to reach their destinations safely. 
   To address this troubling issue, the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania, or CHOP as it's commonly referred to, is currently conducting research that will help develop the best interventions to reduce the risk of crash injury for teen drivers and travelers sharing the road with them. 
   The alliance of Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania and State Farm Insurance Company, CHOP's partner in this initiative, is nationally recognized for its research and outreach involving child passenger safety. However, this year they've expanded their agenda from the car seat to the driver's seat in an effort to address the cause of motor vehicle crashes, the leading cause of death among American teenagers. 
   Together, CHOP and State Farm have conducted research indicating that teens often drive while distracted and fatigued.     
   I believe this alliance brings together a wide range of expertise and research and outreach, translating scientific evidence into actions that will help save lives. It's important that Congress support efforts to effectively educate these teens and families about ways to address these problems. 
   This resolution will endorse the goals and ideals of a week in which intensive programming will be used to encourage these teens to drive more safely. By delaying exposure to risky driving conditions until they have had enough supervised driving experience, managing  peer-to-peer interactions while in the vehicle, and reinforcing the need to protect and react to hazards more appropriately, teens will be better prepared to drive responsibly. Throughout our great Nation, teens are dying in crashes at a rate of four times that of adult drivers. 
   Congress must work to prevent these tragedies, and I certainly encourage my colleagues to support this important resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of one of my constituents, Mr. Deven Amin of Easton, Pennsylvania. Deven, a senior at the Blair Academy in Blairstown, New Jersey, recently raised $7,500 in local contributions for the Nyumbani Village Project in Kenya. 
   Nyumbani Village, located a short distance from Kenya's capital, Nairobi, is a settlement where HIV/AIDS affected orphans are placed under the stewardship of elderly Kenyans in mutually beneficial family settings. Founded in 1992, the village today provides shelter, nutrition and education for roughly 160 orphans, over 100 of which are infected with HIV/AIDS, and 63 elderly adults. From infants to teenagers, these orphans represent nearly every tribe and ethnicity in Kenya. 
   In the past 2 years, Deven has twice traveled to Kenya to volunteer at Nyumbani, where he helped cultivate the village's farm, organize children's activities and assist families with various household duties. After witnessing firsthand the impact of this unique project on its many participants, Deven returned to Easton eager to share his experiences, enhance awareness of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and generate local support for the continued development of the Nyumbani Village. 
   This year, Deven raised an astonishing $7,500 for the project through an ambitious letter-writing campaign that targeted local businesses and health care professionals. The funds gathered by Deven will be used to help construct a critical multipurpose hall in Nyumbani. This structure will provide necessary recreation space for children during times of inclement weather and serve as a gathering place for the entire Nyumbani community. Construction of the facility has been identified as a top priority by the program's directors, who envision the settlement housing between 1,200 and 1,600 individuals in the future. 
   While raising money, Deven also educated residents of the Lehigh Valley about the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS in Africa through various speaking engagements at local organizations. Recently, Deven spoke at the Palmer Township Kiwanis Clubs, and he will address an audience at a local Rotary International chapter in the near future. He also plans to host a chapel service at his high school in late November. Deven's desire to enhance local awareness of global HIV/AIDS through firsthand accounts of his experience in Kenya is truly commendable. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues today join me in recognizing the achievements of Deven Amin, whose selfless efforts will undoubtedly improve the lives of hundreds of Kenyan orphans impacted by HIV/AIDS. We are all extraordinarily proud of Deven. On behalf of myself and the people of the 15th Congressional District, I congratulate him and thank him once again for what he has done to help make this world a better place.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (HONORING THE MEMORY OF DEREK BRIAN JOHNSON -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Derek Brian Johnson and the efforts of his father, Robert Johnson, a resident of Easton, Pennsylvania, to seek justice for his son. 
   Derek Brian Johnson was only 32 when he died. He worked as an Internet security manager. He enjoyed singing, skydiving and motorcycle racing. He was passionate in his support of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. He also loved music and bands. And it was this last love that ultimately cost him his life. 
   On February 20, 2003, nearly 5 years ago, Derek went to a club called The Station in West Warwick, Rhode Island, to hear a band called Great White. The club was jammed that night with patrons. As the show ensued, tour manager Daniel Biechele set off a pyrotechnic display that was part of the band's floor show. The display ignited the building's soundproofing foam. 
   The Station went up like kindling. People rushed for the exits, and panic ensued. Many were crushed as the crowd stampeded to get out of the burning building. In the end, 100 people died that night at The Station, including Derek Johnson. 
   Ultimately Biechele and club owners Jeffrey Derderian and Michael Derderian were charged with manslaughter as a result of the fire and ensuing deaths. And there began my constituent, Robert Johnson's, quest to find justice for his son, a search that from his point of view has not been at all fruitful. 
   First, there was the matter of the club itself. There were more people in the club than there should have been. The Station had no sprinkler system, which would have prevented, or at least minimized, the conflagration. And the soundproofing foam was not treated with flame retardant materials. 
   Second, there were the court proceedings. Biechele pled guilty to 100 counts of manslaughter. He could have gotten 10 years to serve under a plea agreement that Bob claims he did not know about. The judge gave Biechele 15 years but suspended all but 4. Michael Derderian was allowed to plead no contest to 100 counts of manslaughter pursuant to a plea agreement. He too only received 4 years to serve. 
   Finally, there were the parole hearings. Even though both of these men were responsible for the deaths of 100 people, the State parole board in Rhode Island has decided to release them. 
   I have to say that I agree with Bob Johnson when he tells me that serving less than 4 years after being found legally responsible for so much carnage hardly seems just. I commend Robert Johnson for the hard work he has put  forth to find justice for his son and for the other victims of The Station nightclub fire. I know that the memory of Derek Brian Johnson will live on in his father's heart forever, and I applaud his efforts to soldier on on behalf of a man who was taken from us all too soon.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT BIPARTISANSHIP -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, the American people believe that Washington, DC, is broken. And this process and this legislation that we are considering today is proof positive of why Washington and this Congress is broken. 
   The American people expect some bipartisanship on this energy issue. My colleague, John Peterson of Pennsylvania, just discussed a bipartisan proposal. Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii, a Democrat, and John Peterson of Pennsylvania have put together a good bipartisan compromise that we should be considering as part of this discussion today. It will advance American energy and American energy jobs. 
   The bill we're dealing with today says no nuclear, no clean coal--and I'm from Pennsylvania; we care about that. And there's really no oil and gas. That really limits our options as a nation. We want to create American energy jobs, and we want to use the revenues to transition to alternative and renewable energy as well as conserve and realize efficiencies. 
   The American people expect better. They expect bipartisanship. And what we are considering here today, unfortunately, does not meet that test.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN PETERSON -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Thank you, Congressman English, for organizing this special order tonight in recognition of our good friend, JOHN PETERSON. 
   He has been certainly an extraordinary Member of Congress, a real character, and just been a good friend to so many. 
   JOHN is one of those people who really makes this Congress a very special place. He does represent the Fifth District, as has been discussed tonight. I wanted to wish him and his wife, Sandy, well. This happens to be the anniversary of their wedding this weekend, so I wish both JOHN and Sandy Peterson all the best on this anniversary weekend for them. 
   You know, I first met JOHN PETERSON back in 1991 when I was first sworn in to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. JOHN was a State senator, and I was just a freshman in the State House; and JOHN was always very kind to me. He would take time out of his busy life to mentor me, to talk to me about issues, just to be a good friend. And I always appreciated that about John. 
   And John, too, in Washington, perhaps, is best known for his advocacy on the issue of Outer Coaster Shelf exploration for energy. What a lot of people don't know, who've probably listened to JOHN PETERSON over the years, he talked about that issue about American exploration for energy when it, perhaps, wasn't as popular. But he would come down with charts and talk about the need to produce energy in America. 
   And what a lot of people don't know about JOHN PETERSON is that he represents much of northwestern Pennsylvania, a very large, rural district. And in that district is a town called Titusville where oil was first discovered by Colonel Drake. 
   And so JOHN was passionate on this issue of oil and gas exploration. It was something that he brought to this floor. He did a lot to educate many of us, many Members, about the situation in this country with respect to natural gas, especially. JOHN would talk about it and talk about the need for us to develop more of our resources and how this is impacting America's manufacturers, particularly Pennsylvania's manufacturers. And he was just passionate about it. And of course during this Congress, that issue of American energy exploration, the Outer Coastal Shelf, is one that has really taken a very high profile. 
   And I know that John, because of his leadership in part, is why we saw the moratorium on OCS drilling lifted just recently, and I think that's a great accomplishment for John. 
   Also, too, he was one of the more tenacious Members I have ever met, and I met him in Harrisburg. He would take up an issue, and there was no one who was more fierce for his cause than JOHN PETERSON. 
   And we saw that this year with respect to the tolling, proposed tolling for Interstate 80. JOHN was, as many of us know in Pennsylvania, rather upset about the proposal. And he just really took to the public airwaves and made his case. And, of course, that proposal was not adopted by the Federal Highway Administrator. So that was an issue that was one where JOHN had taken a strong leadership position and came out successful, just as he did recently on the issue of Outer Coastal Shelf exploration. 
   So JOHN PETERSON has actually had quite a good year. Such a good year that I have teased him at times, ``Are you sure you want to retire now? You're doing so well around here. This is probably not the time for you to leave.''     
   But JOHN, as you know, is a dedicated public servant, a devoted family man, and I think he wants to spend more time with his family. 
   I know I will miss him here. As I said, he's a great friend to me. I've known him since our legislative days in Harrisburg. 
   I, again, want to thank JOHN PETERSON for his advocacy, for his friendship, for his leadership on behalf of the people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, northwestern Pennsylvania in particular, and also for his support and leadership for all the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak of a courageous young man from my district, and of his friends and family and supporters, who are trying to use his untimely demise to help make the world a better place. 
   Derek Ryan Kehoe graduated from Nazareth High School in 2005, which this high school is located in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. And he was a star player on the school's basketball team, a team he led to the District 11 Tournament in 2005. 
   He was a freshman at Albright College when, in April of 2006, he discovered a lump on his back. The lump turned out to be leiomyosarcoma, or LMS as it is better known, a rare and deadly form of cancer. LMS currently has no cure. And though Derek was a strong, healthy 19-year-old, the disease overcame him, and he passed on on October 28, 2006. 
   Throughout his illness, Derek was cheerful and encouraging, more concerned with the feelings of those who came to see him than of his own condition. On January 5, 2007, Derek's life will be commemorated at half time of the Nazareth High-Northampton High boys basketball game. A full house is expected, and 150 of Derek's classmates are returning for the event. All proceeds from the game will be earmarked to fight this dreaded disease of LMS that took Derek away from us way too soon. 
   I want to extend my condolences to Derek's parents, Maureen Kehoe and Kevin Kehoe. I also want to express my support for all the people who have put together this event, including the Kehoes, the administration of Nazareth Area High School, and the Nazareth High School Booster Club. I also want to convey a special word of thanks to Nazareth basketball coach Joe Arndt, who loved Derek as he would a son and who played a key role in making this event a reality. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will insert a copy of these words into the Congressional Record this 4th day of January, 2007, as part of the effort to commemorate for all time the life of Derek Ryan Kehoe.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak of a courageous young man from my District, and of his friends, family, and supporters who are trying to use his untimely demise to help make the world a better place.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this legislation, H.R.  2176, which consolidates two bills that promote off-reservation tribal gambling. 
   Why is a guy from Pennsylvania talking about this issue today? Well, this bill sends a signal that reservation shopping, under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, is okay. Well, it's not okay, and it is out of control. 
   The bill before us today would create Indian governmental entities, tribal casinos, on lands that are more than 300 miles from the homelands of these tribes. Creating a far-flung string of casinos on lands with no connection to the tribe's heritage was not the intent of IGRA. 
   Establishing these off-reservation casinos has absolutely nothing to do with the preservation of Indian culture. It is about money, pure and simple. Twenty years ago, before IGRA, there were no tribal casinos in this country. Now there are more than 400, and tribal gambling is currently a $19 billion a year business. 
   That is precisely the reason why I introduced H.R. 2562, the Limitation of Tribal Gambling to Existing Tribal Lands Act of 2007, which would preclude new casino development on lands that are taken into trust as part of a settlement of a land claim. That bill was inspired by efforts of a tribe, located more than 900 miles from Pennsylvania, to force homeowners and business owners in my district off their properties, just so yet another tribal casino could be built, all based on a 1737 land conveyance, all designed to displace 25 homeowners, a crayon factory--Crayola crayon, we all know the product--and many other businesses. 
   And, with respect to the Abramoff comments that I have heard, I'll be the first to acknowledge that, as to Mr. Abramoff's actions, he did take advantage of the tribes, but it was the tribal gambling issue that was the source of the corruption. 
   And I think the proper vote is a ``no'' vote on this legislation. 
   Again, for those of us who have had to deal with these off-reservation shopping issues, it's very painful for the homeowners, as much as when the Supreme Court went along. Defeat the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. 
   Although the purpose of this legislation is straightforward, the significance cannot be understated. H.R. 3 would expand the limited number of embryonic stem cell lines currently available for federally funded research. Permitting research on additional embryonic stem cell lines will advance a field that scientists agree holds the greatest potential to provide groundbreaking therapies for some of the most vexing diseases of our time. 
   I believe stem cell research, all forms of stem cell research, adult, cord blood, amniotic, embryonic, should be pursued. This discussion is not about a competition. The promise of stem cell research, to find treatments for the most devastating diseases like Parkinson's, juvenile diabetes, coronary heart diseases, cancer and spinal cord injuries, is too great not to explore every single possibility. 
   That said, embryonic stem cell research raises serious ethical questions that have been raised by some of my colleagues today. I strongly believe that H.R. 3 is the most responsible way to ensure that we are observing the highest possible standards of ethical and clinical practice by setting meaningful ethical guidelines for embryonic stem cell research that will serve as the benchmark for scientific study throughout the world. H.R. 3 provides these ethical guidelines. 
   First, in order to be considered for this research, the donated cells must come from an in vitro fertilization clinic, have been created for the purpose of fertility treatment and be in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking treatment.  
   Second, the in vitro facility has to certify that these cells would be otherwise discarded if not donated and that the cells are not destined for implantation. 
   Third, the donors of these cells have to sign a written consent form providing for such a donation and confirm that they have not received any inducements, financial or otherwise, to make the donation. 
   We took one important step last year in Congress in addressing these ethical dilemmas that are raised by this emerging field of science. We enacted a law which prohibits the practice of fetal farming where human fetal tissue would be deliberately created for the purpose of scientific research. H.R. 3 will take another step in ensuring that research is adhered to the highest possible principles of scientific inquiry and respects critical ethical boundaries while advancing some of the most critical research of our time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to offer this amendment to help the United States Secret Service meet its protection obligations. 
   This Homeland Security appropriations bill funds the Secret Service to the tune of $1.39 billion. The plain language of the bill does not specify how these moneys should be allocated as between the Secret Service's protection and investigative operations. However, the committee report provides that $849.6 million should go to protective missions, while approximately $314.5 million is allocated to investigations. 
   While I sincerely commend the Appropriations Committee for providing these funds to the Secret Service, I would respectfully submit that the committee has underestimated the demands placed upon the Service's protection mission during this Presidential election cycle. Accordingly, my amendment would add approximately $4 million to that protection function from those moneys that would otherwise go to investigations. 
   This funding upgrade is required because of the increased responsibilities  thrust upon the Secret Service's protection component within the last few years. Before 9/11, the Secret Service had 20 protectees. Since 9/11, that number has increased to 54. Just last month, the number of protectees reached 55 when a Presidential hopeful was given Secret Service protection, at an estimated cost of about $44,000 per day. This additional expenditure was never considered in the President's budget request. 
   Now is not the time to strip $4 million from the Service's protective missions, particularly when the cost to protect Senator Obama for just the first 4 months of fiscal year 2008 are estimated at $5.456 million. This amendment ensures that the Secret Service is not bound by the report language which would transfer $4 million from the Joint Operations Center relocation to the field investigations account. 
   I believe that the actions by the committee have made sure that the Secret Service will still be able to perform its investigatory functions with its usual skill and alacrity. In that regard, the committee had the foresight to provide the field investigation units of the Secret Service a plus-up of $10.4 million over and above the amount the President requested for investigations. 
   On May 29, 2007, just a few weeks ago, the Washington Post reported that the Secret Service was transferring agents from investigations to security details and borrowing law enforcement officers from other Federal agencies in order to meet its protection obligations. Faced with wartime security needs, the threat of terrorism, and a field of 20 Presidential contenders, the Washington Post continued that the Service was ``showing signs of strain'' even before the Department of Homeland Security ordered protection for Senator Obama. It is my hope that this amendment will help to ease that strain and allow this dedicated group of professionals to keep performing at the high level to which we have all become accustomed. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does any Member wish to oppose the amendment?

   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge that we defeat the previous question so we can adopt the Protect America Act. 
   People in this country think that Washington, D.C., is broken, and they are absolutely right. It is. And this issue is proof positive of why Washington, D.C., is broken. Yes, we do have an agreement. It is a bipartisan agreement, 68 votes in the Senate. There is a majority here, but the majority leadership won't allow us to consider this very important and necessary legislation. 
   Senator Rockefeller, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, has said our intelligence capacities are being degraded because we have failed to pass the Protect America Act. 
   You know, it is time that we put the national interest ahead of the special interests. Why are we protecting the most litigious among us in our society at the expense of our troops serving overseas? We know the issues. It is retroactive immunity. The telecommunications companies were attempting to help us in good faith, and no good deed goes unpunished. That is what it happening here. It is time to get the job done. 
   I'm going to refer to an article I read in the Wall Street Journal back in January, 2006, by Debra Burlingame, the sister of the pilot who crashed into the Pentagon. The title is, ``Al Qaeda, not the FBI, is the greater threat to America.'' I think we should heed her advice and recall, because of that wall that existed before 9/11 between the intelligence agency and our domestic law enforcement, it prevented us from being more effective. 
   Today, we are placing barriers between our government and those who want to help us in the telecommunications sector, but they are going to be forced to comply with this. They will not be able to do so voluntarily. We know what the issue is. The Fraternal Order of Police, many State attorneys general, the VFW, all agree we should pass the bipartisan. We have it within our means to do it. I don't understand why not. It is important for the majority leadership to explain to this House why they won't let this bipartisan agreement be adopted. 
   The American people are watching. They want us to get the job done. They have had enough. 
   Mr. Speaker, I include the Burlingame article for the Record.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (THE TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. I'd like to thank the gentlelady from North Carolina for her leadership on this very important issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I feel it's very important that as with Members of Congress we lead, and there are a lot of things that the Congress would like to do, need to do, but there's one thing that we must do, and that is fund the Federal Government. I think it is a dereliction of duty on the part of this Speaker of the House and this Congress that this Congress has failed, has failed to deal with the various spending bills, the appropriations bills to fund the government. 
   The reason why this Congress is not dealing with these appropriations bills is because there is fear, fear that some Member of the House, some impertinent Member, maybe a Republican Member, maybe a Democratic Member, will stand up on this floor and offer an amendment to provide for additional American energy production from traditional sources. 
   So we're not dealing with the most important business of Congress, which is to fund the government because there is fear to deal with the energy issue, and I think it is unrealistic and unfair that there are people in this House who, for whatever reasons, oppose traditional sources of energy. Everybody here supports alternative renewable fuels, but we also know we need to deal with the here and the now. 
   I come from a State, Pennsylvania, where we are rich in coal resources, where oil was discovered in Titusville, Pennsylvania, by Colonel Drake some time ago. We have tremendous natural gas reserves. My State has been part of the energy solution for this Nation for a very long time and will continue to be.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. I've heard the same thing, and I believe that reference is to some of the vast oil shale reserves out in the Rocky Mountain West. But I know in terms of coal, it's estimated that we have about 250 years' worth of coal supply, assuming we're consuming at the current levels. 
   What I did want to say, though, is coal is responsible for 50 percent of the electricity generated in the United States. Nuclear energy is responsible for about 20 percent. Natural gas for another 20 percent. I'm up to 90 percent. There's a little bit of other. 
   Petroleum, hydroelectric takes a fair amount. Solar and wind I think account for about 1 percent. 
   But unfortunately, while I strongly support solar, wind, geothermal and other renewables, I also know there are too many people in this Congress that, though renewables account for 1 percent of our source, it accounts for 100 percent of their talking points. 
   The truth is we know we're going to need coal. We need to clean it up. Clean coal technology, there's a lot of interesting, carbon capture, storage sequestration going on out there. We need to develop that technology. I think we all understand, too, that if we want to lower carbon emissions in America we're going to need to expand nuclear energy. 
   But again, many people in this building are opposed to coal technology. They're opposed to nuclear. They're opposed to drilling for gas and oil where those resources may actually be. So that really limits our options as a Nation. 
   We have to get to work. Everybody knows it. And this is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. This is an American issue. The American people are pragmatic. They want us to solve the problem. 
   I'll be the first to tell you, you know, our critics, the critics of the Republican Party will say that Republicans are too focused on production and supply. Critics of the Democrats will say that they're too focused on conservation and efficiency. The truth is we must do both, and I'll be the first to tell you that we can't drill our way out of this problem, but drilling is most assuredly part of the solution, just as conservation is part of the solution, and neither can you conserve your way out of the problem. 
   So we need people to be pragmatic, come down here and support something reasonable. The American Energy Act about which we've been speaking tonight is a good piece of legislation. It deals with all of the above, the alternatives, renewables, transitions to the future, as well as traditional sources of energy, conservation, efficiency. 
   There's another bill out there, the Peterson-Abercrombie bill, which is a genuine bipartisan bill that there's a lot in there I like and there's some things I'm not particularly crazy about, but I would support that bill. I'm a cosponsor of it. In the name of compromise, I'm willing to support legislation that will advance this discussion and actually, more importantly, advance America's energy security. 
   At the end of the day, the American people want us to become less dependent on unstable parts of the world for fossil fuel. I think you and I agree to that, but it's going to require leaders to say, yes, take an affirmative approach to energy. But as you know, too many people here are not willing to do that, and I have to lay the blame at the doorstep of the Speaker of the House. 
   I thank Ms. Foxx, my classmate, for allowing me to speak on this important issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, this has been a long debate. But two points must be absolutely clear at the outset. First, it is imperative that we continue to support our troops on the ground. Our servicemembers deployed to Iraq have done a magnificent job. They have performed their missions admirably, effectively, and with valor. They have done everything we have asked them to do. They have made sacrifices as have their families. They deserve our unqualified support. And as a Member of Congress, I strongly disagree with some of my colleagues who have suggested cutting off funds for our troops serving in Iraq. 
   A second point to be made here is that immediate withdrawal from Iraq, which has likewise been advocated by some members on the other side of the aisle, is also a bad idea. The Iraq Study Group has said that ``it would be wrong for the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support.'' The National Intelligence Estimate of January 2007 says that ``if Coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate, we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq.'' 
   Religious conflict aside, there is another reason for avoiding immediate withdrawal, and that is simply that al Qaeda and its affiliated groups still operate in Iraq. Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's chief deputy, considers their efforts in Iraq to be ``crucial'' towards furthering al Qaeda objectives in the region. Thus, these groups are aggressively pursuing terrorism within the borders of that country, commiting acts of violence against Shias, Kurds and anyone else who dares to disagree with them. 
   By instigating this mayhem and bloodshed in Iraq, al Qaeda hopes to realize its supreme goal, to destabilize the government, assume control over the country and its oil wealth and eventually install a Taliban-style government in Baghdad. This is not good for the United States. It is not good for Iraq. And it is not good for the region. That is why I oppose immediate withdrawal. 
   That being said, and understanding the need for Congress to debate the issue of the war, I am disappointed in the way this debate has taken shape. The majority has given much time for us to express our views, but it has limited the options that might be employed to make this legislation more effective. They allowed no amendments either from Republicans or from their own Democratic colleagues. They refused to permit any substitutes. They even denied us a motion to recommit. 
   By putting before us this highly restrictive rule, the other side has effectively foreclosed dialogue on other measures that might have added substance to the debate. While both Democrats and Republicans utilize the Iraq Study Group findings to justify their positions, the majority leadership has refused to consider my colleague from Virginia's legislation, Mr. Frank Wolf, his legislation, H. Con. Res. 45, which would implement some of the most significant recommendations of the Iraq Study Group's report. This legislation would emphasize the need for U.S. forces to accelerate the training of their Iraqi counterparts, would establish milestones for success in Iraq, and would promote diplomatic initiatives in order to advance stability in the country and in the region.     
   Yet no debate on such a bill and no opportunity to offer an amendment consistent with those objectives was tolerated by the majority. What does this say about their commitment to fulfilling the objectives recommended by the Iraq Study Group's report? You know, we are all speaking about this report, but we are simply not voting on it. That is wrong. 
   I stand before you today in my second term in Congress as someone who has tried to understand the Iraq war from many different viewpoints. I have talked with my constituents both pro and con about the war. I have listened to military and intelligence briefings. I have visited Iraq. I have studied the Iraq Study Group report. I have read journal articles, academic studies and news clips on the subject, all to increase my professional awareness of what is going on over there. 
   But I do not just see this from a professional perspective. The Iraq war has had personal consequences for me as well. One of my staffers, Jason Lane, is a Reservist who has been called to active duty and is deployed there right now. 
   I have talked with the troops who have served there. I have visited the wounded in hospitals and most painfully attended the funerals of those who gave to this country what Abraham Lincoln called the last full measure of devotion. I attended one of those funerals just last Friday. 
   From all of this, I must admit, I have my concerns about the efficacy of the President's troop surge. I believe that it is far more important that the Iraqis  show the political will to achieve reconciliation and end the sectarian violence that is slowly but surely strangling their capital and their country. 
   As their Prime Minister, Maliki said on November 27, 2006, ``The crisis is political, and ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and the bloodletting of innocents are the politicians.'' 
   Success in Iraq is essential to achieving America's foreign policy objectives, and it is in America's best interest to ensure that Iraq can sustain, govern and defend itself. But I believe in holding Prime Minister Maliki to his word. We cannot and will not abandon our troops who are currently on the ground in Iraq. 
   We must make sure that our forces effectively engage al Qaeda, as opposed to mediating a Sunni-Shia conflict that is the responsibility of the Iraqi government to resolve. We all know these are the challenges facing this Congress, and these are challenges that must be met in a bipartisan manner.

Parents have a right to send their children to safe, drug-free schools, and we took an important step last Congress when the House passed legislation, the Student and Teacher Safety Act, that would allow States and school districts to conduct reasonable searches to ensure that our schools remain free of all weapons, dangerous materials and illegal narcotics. Parents need to know that their children are safe when they are at school. 
   As a father of three young children, I am particularly concerned about the threat of online predators. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reports that over 50,000 predators are online at any given time and one in five children has received an unwanted online solicitation of a sexual nature. We need to be vigilant as parents by supervising our children while they are browsing the Web at home. We also must do all we can to protect our children when they are outside our supervision by preventing them from accessing social 
   networking Web sites and chat rooms like MySpace.com at schools and in libraries unless they are under adult supervision. The Deleting Online Predators Act will give parents peace of mind by ensuring that a responsible adult is monitoring their children's Internet use at all times. 
   Parents in my district know that a college education will double their child's earning potential, as you just mentioned, but they worry about how they will afford to send their children to a higher education institution. It is critical that we help families start saving early to send their children to college. By passing H.R. 87 and permanently extending the 401 Kids Family Savings Accounts, or college savings accounts, parents will be able to put money aside to invest in their children's future. And I want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) for her strong leadership on this issue. 
   Finally, one meaningful step we can take to ensure that individuals and families maintain access to affordable health care is to provide greater portability of health care coverage. Most Americans with private group health insurance are covered through an employer, coverage that is generally provided to active employees and their families. A change in an individual's work or family status can result in loss of coverage. Americans are changing jobs more than ever before, averaging nearly seven different careers over the course of their working lives. 
   In 1985, Congress enacted legislation we refer to as COBRA to give workers and their families who lose their health benefits the right to choose to continue coverage provided under their group health plan. Under COBRA, an employer with 20 or more employees must provide individuals and their families the option of continuing their coverage under the employer's group health insurance plan in the case of certain events such as a voluntary or involuntary job loss, reduction in the hours worked, transition between jobs, death, divorce and other life events. But in most circumstances, the coverage under COBRA is limited to 18 or 36 months. And because of this 18-month limitation, during a prolonged job search, individuals and families have to purchase expensive policies in order to maintain their quality of care or they take the risk of becoming uninsured. During times of transition, families need the certainty of knowing that they will not lose their health coverage. 
   Later this week I will be introducing a bill, the Health Insurance for Life Act, which will remove the 18- or 36-month limitation on COBRA coverage, giving employees the option to continue their health insurance coverage indefinitely. Knowing that they can rely on continued coverage will provide individuals and families with consistency and security as they face change and uncertainty in their lives. And I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to advance this important agenda that has been outlined by my friend and colleague, Representative Kirk of Illinois. 
   And, again, I do want to compliment you and applaud you on your leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Yes. The gentleman is absolutely on point. The portability aspect of this legislation is absolutely  critical. When I served in my State legislature, in both the State house and the State senate, this was a common complaint I would hear from people who suffered a job loss and were at the end of their COBRA eligibility.     
   They were very frustrated, just for the reasons you identified, that there was a member of the family who had a particular illness and that they could not get coverage elsewhere. So COBRA was absolutely critical to them being able to provide for their families. 
   Remember, too, when you pay for COBRA insurance, you are basically paying the full premium. So the portability aspect and dealing with the preexisting condition is absolutely I think one of the best selling points and the most salient points of this legislation.

   Mr. DENT. That is absolutely true. And particularly I would also urge anybody watching us this evening to not only look at their COBRA options, and certainly endorse this legislation, but also be aware of the fact that we have programs in this country called SCHIP for children who are uninsured, that if their children need health insurance, they may be eligible for that. 
   When I was in my State legislature, we passed an Adult Basic Program providing a low-cost health insurance program for adults of working age who, for whatever reasons, were out of work. 
   So, again, the gentleman is on point, that when people are unemployed, there are options for them in health care in many States, either through SCHIP or, like my State, Adult Basic; and I would certainly encourage people to contact my office or even their State legislator's office to seek some assistance.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DRIVE-IN THEATER -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 75th anniversary of the drive-in theater. 
   On June 6, 1933, Richard Hollingshead, Jr., opened the first drive-in theater in the United States in Camden, New Jersey. Hollingshead's vision of enabling Americans to view movies from the comfort of their spacious cars was mastered through trials on his own driveway where he nailed a bed sheet between two trees and placed a film projector on the hood of his car. From its simple origins, Hollingshead's concept would transform the movie industry and later become a lasting icon of Americana. 
   Today, there are close to 400 drive-in theaters operating 650 screens in 47 States across the Nation. As summer approaches and evenings become warmer, thousands of families, couples, and groups of friends will gather at drive-ins to enjoy the latest Hollywood blockbusters on the largest movie screens in the theater industry. 
   Throughout the U.S., moviegoers are rediscovering the pleasures of the all-American drive-in experience, which often includes dining on classic American foods and beverages. My district in eastern Pennsylvania is home to the famous Shankweiler's Drive-In Theater built in 1934. It is the oldest operating theater in the United States. Every summer, many of my constituents flock to local drive-ins like Shankweiler's for an evening. 
   I ask my colleagues to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the drive-in theater and I encourage all Americans to rediscover their local theaters.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1401, RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, early in this session the majority promised to implement all the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Yesterday, the Rules Committee, which is controlled by the majority, had the opportunity to deliver on that promise by making two of my amendments to this legislation in order. It failed to do so, and the security of our rail and bus passengers and, in fact, our border security in general will be all the worse as a result. 
   The 9/11 Commission advised the President to direct the Department of Homeland Security to ``design a comprehensive screening system'' that would target ``particular, identifiable suspects or indicators of risk'' and give border officials ``the resources to establish that people are who they say they are, intercept identifiable suspects, and disrupt terrorist operations.'' They concluded that targeting travel is at least as powerful a weapon against terrorists as targeting their money. That is the 9/11 Commission report, recommendation 14, page 385. And it recommended that a terrorist travel intelligence collection and analysis program, which had ``produced disproportionately useful results,'' should be expanded. 
   The first of these amendments involved the Advance Passenger Information System, or APIS as we commonly refer to it. Today, under this program, air and sea carriers collect passenger and crew biographical data and transmit this data to Customs and Border Protection while the vessel or aircraft is en route to the United States. This is an important tool in CBP's efforts to identify suspect or high-risk passengers before, that is before, they enter the country. 
   As terrorists are just as capable of taking a Greyhound bus across border as they are landing at LAX, I thought that my amendment, which would have required bus and train companies transporting passengers into this country to provide the same advanced information to CBP as do the airlines, made sense. Unfortunately, the majority members in the Rules Committee did not agree. 
   My second amendment would have authorized the deployment of the Automated Targeting System For Passengers, or ATS-P as we refer to it. ATS-P is an intranet-based enforcement and decision support tool that is the cornerstone of all of CBP's targeting efforts at the border. 
   ATS-P coordinates passenger information and forms an intelligence assessment of a traveler. ATS-P then makes a simple ``yes'' or ``no'' determination on whether that international traveler should be flagged for additional screening. Once this information is received by CBP officials, these officials retain the discretion to act, or not to act, on that information. In short, ATS-P is nothing more than a tool that can help CBP determine who might be a person worthy of a follow-up interview. 
   Again, since we are already using this technology to screen international incoming flights, why not apply it to border crossings of trains and buses, other forms of transportation through which terrorists might try to enter the country? Why not? That was the gist of my amendment. Once more, however, the majority on the Rules Committee shot us down. 
   Together, APIS and the ATS-P make up the building blocks of exactly the kind of border security program recommended by the 9/11 Commission, and yet this rule prohibits our consideration of these two programs as part of our mass transit and rail security structure. The majority can talk the talk when it comes to adopting the 9/11 Commission recommendations, but by failing to implement these two amendments, it has shown that it cannot walk the walk. 
   Accordingly, while I know that this legislation, H.R. 1401, will do many good things, and I do support the underlying bill, I ask that you vote against this rule because it fails to address the homeland security concerns detailed in my amendments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I, too, today rise in opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation. In this bill, the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner will be allowed to vote on proceedings in the Committee of the Whole; but if their vote is decisive, then there must be a revote in the full House without the participation of these Delegates. In other words, the bill says that your vote counts except when it doesn't count. And when it really, really counts, that is when it will make a difference in the outcome of the proceedings, it turns out that your vote doesn't count at all. 
   This kind of absurdity might be appropriate in the drama of Beckett or Ionesco, but it has no place in the making of American law. 
   And I do want to address the issue, too. In the last session I supported the Tom Davis-Holmes Norton bill to help deal with the issue of the District of Columbia's voting rights. I agree with that. I support that legislation, and we should take up that legislation. We shouldn't do it through this rule. 
   Also, with respect to self-determination in Puerto Rico, we have been supportive of Mr. Fortu&#241;o and his effort to allow for self-determination of the island where people have a choice to make: independence, territorial status, or statehood. Let that process take its course. This is not the way to go. I oppose the rule and the underlying legislation.

   I rise today to discuss H. Res. 171, a bill to recognize the 250th anniversary of the birth of the Marquis de Lafayette. 
   On September 6, 2007, our Nation will celebrate the 250th birthday of one of the truly outstanding and extraordinary people in our country's history, the Marquis de Lafayette. 
   Born in the Auvergne section of France, Lafayette did not become an honorary American citizen until 2002, some 168 years after his death. He was commissioned with the rank of major general in the Continental Army just shy of his 20th birthday, and he soon became one of George Washington's closest confidants. The first foreign dignitary to address the House of Representatives, Lafayette was a steadfast supporter of liberty, loyalty and democracy. 
   You have heard many of my colleagues speak to Lafayette's legacy as a military leader. I rise today to offer a different perspective as to Lafayette's influence on our Nation's history. 
   Lafayette College, located in my district in eastern Pennsylvania, was founded in 1826 by the citizens of Easton. And I am here once again to commemorate this auspicious occasion and ask that my colleagues join me in this celebration.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I also do want to thank my friend from Arizona (Mr. Flake), and he is indeed a friend, but I also want to thank him for giving me this opportunity to fully vet and disclose this particular project on the campus of Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, specifically on the Priscilla Payne Hurd campus, and we are speaking today about the Payne Gallery. I think it is very important that we have this kind of discourse in a very open and transparent manner. 
   But let's first understand and explain the purpose of the Saving America's Treasures program. The purpose is to preserve nationally significant, historic properties that are threatened or endangered. The projects must mitigate the threat, have a clear public benefit, and there has to be a non-Federal match. That is certainly the case here. 
   I should let everybody know too the historic significance of Moravian College. It is America's sixth oldest college, sixth oldest. It is located within the City of Bethlehem, which is really the site, and it is perhaps arguable, but we claim where I live in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, it is really the birthplace of the America Industrial Revolution, and the Moravians were a key driver in that industrialization process in the 18th century. 
   There is a very strong industrial and cultural heritage. The Moravians were  not only industrialists; they were people of faith. They came from Germany and other parts of Central Europe. 
   The Priscilla Payne Hurd campus is significant to the story of the City of Bethlehem and to the college. The Payne Gallery is nationally significant. It exhibits collections from the Smithsonian National Museum of American History and the Smithsonian Institute of Libraries. 
   This historic property is certainly threatened. This funding will mitigate the threat. There is a clear public benefit. This gallery will be used and enjoyed by countless visitors to Bethlehem, the Christmas City. We enjoy numerous visitors from around the world every year to be in Bethlehem during Christmas to participate in the Moravian tradition, culture and heritage of the community. 
   There is certainly a non-Federal match. It will be $205,000. The total project cost is $350,000. The amount of funding in the bill is $150,000 of Federal money. 
   Just coincidentally, there was an article today in one of the local newspapers back home: ``Moravian College gets $130,000 historic grant. The Getty Foundation cash focuses on preserving classic architecture.'' 
   I am just going to restate and read briefly a few things said in the local paper today about this campus about which I am speaking. Moravian College again is the sixth oldest college in the country. It has 11 buildings in the National Register of Historic Places, all of the them in the Priscilla Payne Hurd campus downtown. They include the Brethren House, built in 1748, which the Getty Foundation called ``one of the best examples of colonial German architecture in the country.'' 
   That is what a group of philanthropists in California said about this particular campus in the City of Bethlehem. This is historically significant, and this grant will support a comprehensive evaluation of the college's buildings and form the basis of an historic preservation plan. 
   One of the stated goals of the project is to ``develop strategies for using, preserving, and enhancing historic structures.'' 
   The president of the college just said today that he is proud of the continuous use of its oldest structures: ``Our students study music and practice Bach in the very rooms in which so many remarkable young students did nearly two centuries ago. Moravian's historic structures are alive and vital, the past in the continuous present.'' 
   That is what the president of the college said.

   I did want to say that, again, this campus, this gallery, and by the way, Priscilla Payne Hurd is alive and well, she is in her eighties, a wonderful matriarch of the community, philanthropist, has contributed so much to this community in preserving the culture and the heritage of America. This is not simply about my hometown. This is about American history and culture and, frankly, faith. Faith. The Moravians were people of great faith. 
   Again, every year people come to Bethlehem in great numbers to hear Bach. They come here to hear Bach. Moravian is such a integral part of that. You really can't separate the Moravians from the City of Bethlehem, again, the Christmas City. We are very proud of what they do there. 
   I believe this project fits precisely into the definition of the Saving America's Treasures program. You couldn't find a better fit. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 90th birthday of an American hero, my constituent, Mr. James W. Murdy. 
   James Murdy wanted to serve his country in the United States military and learn a trade. He joined the Navy in 1940 and soon thereafter served as an electrician aboard the USS Helena, a St. Louis-class light cruiser stationed at Pearl Harbor. On December 7, 1941, shortly after James began serving on the Helena, the ship was hit by a torpedo dropped by a lone Japanese torpedo plane. Thankfully, James Murdy survived the attack that killed 20 of his fellow sailors. 
   James Murdy then attended the Naval Mine Warfare School and worked as a minesweeper for the next 3 years. He was honorably discharged from the Navy in 1946 after achieving the rank of chief electrician's mate, the highest rank he could obtain as an enlisted man. 
   Shortly after being discharged from the Navy, James wed Mary Robb, with whom he had three children; James Murdy, Rosemary Murdy-Haber, and Patricia Murdy-Cressman. He still lives in Allentown, Pennsylvania and loves rebuilding or constructing items from scratch and being called upon to speak about his experiences at Pearl Harbor. He is an ardent fan of the Philadelphia Phillies and Eagles and loves spending time with his family, including his granddaughter and step-granddaughter. 
   Mr. Murdy served our county with valor and distinction, and we should honor his service, his dedication, and his allegiance to our great Nation. It is my honor to join with his many friends  and family in celebrating the 90th birthday of this wonderful man.

Senator Rockefeller, and I won't read his quote just now, but we have people who are prepared to vote for this.

   You know, sometimes I think the Speaker of the House has to take ``yes'' for an answer. It's time to get the job done. The time for debate is over. It's time to get the job done.

   Mr. DENT. Thank you. I'd like to try to answer the question you just raised. Why wouldn't we pass this bill, given the comments by Senator Rockefeller, who said on three separate occasions, as the gentleman from Georgia pointed out, that our intelligence capacities had been degraded? And the Director of Intelligence, Director McConnell, he has made similar statements. So the question is why aren't we dealing with this. 
   I think the answer is this: that there are people in this body who are prepared to put the special interests ahead of the national interests. And it's quite clear they are protecting the interests of the most litigious members of our society at the expense of the security of the American people. And that is wrong. 
   And, again, I believe many of us standing here, I know I have tried to work in a bipartisan manner on a number of issues in this Congress. I have reached out on a number of issues from SCHIP to stem cell research to others. We're doing it again today on intelligence, and we are being brushed aside, and I think it's simply disgraceful. 
   And I also want to read a comment, if I may. The Veterans of Foreign Wars has weighed in on this issue, and their commander, Commander George Lisicki said, ``Americans are protected from illegal search and seizures by the fourth amendment, but critical legislation is now being delayed because some would extend these same constitutional protections to those who want to harm America, people who kill without conscience, who represent no country, and who have no agenda other than the total destruction of our country.'' That's not me. That's from the VFW. 
   It's been pointed out that Senator Rockefeller, the Democratic Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has said that our intelligence capacities are being degraded. The Attorney General and National Intelligence Director McConnell have said, and I quote, that that is exactly what has happened since the Protect America Act expired 6 days ago without enactment of the bipartisan Senate bill. ``We have lost intelligence information this past week as a direct result of the uncertainty created by Congress's failure to act. Because of this uncertainty, some partners have reduced cooperation. In particular, they have delayed or refused compliance with our requests to initiate new surveillance of terrorists and other foreign intelligence targets under existing directives issued pursuant to the Protect America Act.'' 
   What they are saying is that those people who were partnering with us, helping us to protect America, are now afraid to do so out of fear of lawsuit. They'll have to be compelled to cooperate. And that's really the tragedy here, in addition to saving American lives.

   Mr. DENT. Along those very same lines about protecting our intelligence agents and our counterterrorism officials, it's my understanding that because of this legalistic approach to intelligence gathering, this approach to national security, that has forced intelligence officers to take out liability insurance for fear of investigations or prosecutions for taking the kinds of liberties that someone suggested they take but knowing they are committing a felony. Is that your understanding too, that these intelligence officials are actually having to take out liability insurance to protect themselves not from al Qaeda, not from the enemy, but from prosecution or congressional inquiry?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. I thank the gentlewoman from New Mexico for yielding. 
   And to follow up on your very valid point about how this law does provide protection for American citizens, in the letter that was signed by about 20 of our Democratic House colleagues in support of the Protect America Act, and the legislation that we'd all like to have considered, they have said that this legislation should include the following provisions: 
   First, require individualized warrants for surveillance of U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad. So there is protection in there for American citizens who are living or traveling abroad. 
   It clarifies that no court order is required to conduct surveillance of foreign-to-foreign communications that are routed through the United States. 
   It provides enhanced oversight by Congress of surveillance laws and procedures; compels compliance by private-sector partners; review by the FISA Court of minimization procedures  that I believe you have just alluded to; and targeted immunity for carriers that participated in antiterrorist surveillance programs. 
   So I think that there are plenty of protections in place stronger than current law. And I think there is one other issue that needs to be addressed here and now, immediately. Some have suggested, that I think they have irresponsibly suggested, that the PAA's, Protect America Act's, existing certifications will cover all potentially needed surveillance, and I think it's quite clear that in the event that it expired, which it has, it's unclear whether a court would find any directives under the PAA enforceable once the act expires. And it's my understanding too, if a previously unknown group were to attack or kidnap American soldiers after the act expires, it would not be covered under the certifications of the Protect America Act. And I think we should talk about that. 
   And there is another thing that I think we have to be concerned about too is that I guess within 48 hours after the act expired, around February 14, there were at least a few incidents that occurred around the world where we have seen threats from radical jihadists or radical extremists. In Denmark 2 days after February 14, we saw three jihadists that were arrested in a plot to murder a cartoonist for drawing an editorial cartoon years ago that they found objectionable. We've all heard about that case. In the Philippines it's my understanding that there were two jihadists associated with al Qaeda who were said to be plotting the assassination of the Filipino President and bombing western embassies. And, of course, there were repeated threats against Israel that we have all heard about, including one from Mr. Nasralla, the chief of Hezbollah, who raised a prospect of a war with Israel. He even said, ``Zionists, if you want this kind of open war, let the whole world listen. Let this war be open.'' And this was all said within 48 hours after the expiration, I believe, of the act.

   Mr. DENT. The gentleman from Texas made a very eloquent point. It is well stated. His op-ed is worth reading. I would recommend anybody to read this. It states all the points. 
   But to follow up, we did have an incident in this country where there were two suspected terrorists in the United States, and in August of 2001, I believe this was written about in the 9/11 Commission Report, there were two suspected terrorists, and I know there was an individual whose name I can't recall at the moment, but I believe he was in the counterterrorism division of the FBI who was very concerned about two individuals who he thought were in this country, and he wanted a nationwide manhunt. 
   And he had written a memo in August of 2001 saying, some day someone is going to care about this, that all the protections are being provided to al Qaeda and bin Laden at the expense of the security of the American people. Those two people he was concerned about were the two who crashed the plane into the Pentagon on September 11. I believe it was sometime in the afternoon of September 11 he received his request to go engage in that nationwide manhunt for those two individuals. So this is a very real issue. 
   And I think we should try to conclude this program in the way it began, in talking about the need for bipartisanship, particularly when it comes to national security issues. And it can't be stated enough that our friends on the other side of the aisle in the Senate and many in this House are waiting to vote for this bill. We just want to have the opportunity. As I said earlier, I think it is almost tantamount to a dereliction of duty that the Speaker has not allowed a vote on this issue. 
   Sometimes, we have to take ``yes'' for an answer. We have the solution. It is in our reach. It is time to get the job done. And maybe if we do that, the American people will look more favorably upon Congress.

   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel, like my colleague just before me. 
   The State of Israel has held out the promise of hope for many who have endured centuries of oppression. It was established by those who sought peace, but has had to endure perpetual conflict. 
   From the date of its inception, Israel's neighbors declared war upon the country and attempted to destroy it. Two major wars erupted after the initial conflict of 1948, and even today  it must suffer through terrorist attacks orchestrated by those who continue to deny its right to exist. 
   And yet Israel endures and it flourishes. It has made its part of the desert bloom. It is a model of democracy that the rest of that region would do well to emulate, and it has been a great partner to us in the war on terror, cooperating with us on homeland security matters so that we can be better prepared to counter the kinds of attacks that the Israelis have had to endure for three generations. 
   I've had the privilege of visiting Israel on two separate occasions, experiences that I will never forget. 
   And to Israel I say, ``Le Chaim.''

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (FIGHTING CRIME -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, fighting crime is an issue that is important to most Americans. That is because it is an issue that has a tremendous impact on a community's quality of life. 
   I think most Members of Congress recognize this simple fact. However, this Congress needs to take action in order to address this problem. On our side of the aisle, we've tried to do our part. Republicans have offered some 100 bills to help fight crime, but so far, only three have been considered on this floor. 
   These legislative efforts should not be piecemeal, but should instead be part of a grand strategy, to wit: we need to aggressively target those individuals who are responsible for promoting criminal activity in our society. 
   Our focus should not be on promoting efforts to decriminalize certain drugs, but instead on targeting and jailing drug dealers. 
   Our focus should not be on protecting the rights of criminals, but instead on protecting the rights of their child victims. More needs to be done, for example, to combat the scourge of predators who stalk young people over the Internet. 
   Finally, our focus should not only be on adult offenders, but on youthful ones as well. Gang members, some of whom are as young as 12 and 13, and we see intergenerational gangs as well, are extorting money, dealing drugs, and committing acts of violence. They need to be stopped, and that is where my bill, H.R. 3157, the Anti-Gang Task Force Act of 2007, comes into play. 
   H.R. 3157 will help our local law enforcement communities combat the scourge of gang violence. It authorizes $20 million for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2011 to establish new multijurisdictional anti-gang task forces, bringing together State and local prosecutors with Federal officials from the FBI, DEA, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, DHS, and others. 
   Gangs are mobile, and they often cross jurisdictional lines in order to facilitate the dealing of drugs or to avoid detection by local law enforcement authorities. Thus, a multijurisdictional approach is clearly necessary in order to stop the proliferation of gang violence and gang activity. 
   My district encompasses a good portion of what is called the Route 222 corridor.     
   This corridor bisects five cites--Easton, Bethlehem, Allentown, Reading and Lancaster--located in four southeastern Pennsylvania counties. It is uniquely situated in that it is linked directly to New York City, approximately 80 miles away via Interstate 78 and through other easily accessible roads, including Route 222 to Philadelphia, which is 60 miles to the southeast. 
   So gang violence along the Route 222 corridor, primarily involving drug trafficking and armed robberies, dates back more than a decade and has been a chronic problem affecting each of the five cities within this corridor. The roadways that have allowed commerce to thrive in the region have also strongly benefited the gangs, who can move between the cities with relative ease, thereby making their operations much more difficult to detect and to track. As a result, the 222 corridor has been plagued by gang activity. 
   Fortunately, we're not standing idly by and letting the gangs take over. The Route 222 corridor is one of six sites around the country that has received funds under the Project Safe Neighborhoods program. This Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) initiative involves a cooperative law enforcement effort between the counties and cities along the corridor, and there have been some notable successes. 
   First, there have been successful prosecutions of members of the Mafia El Don Gang, which has conspired to distribute more than 50 kilograms of cocaine in the Lehigh Valley. Meanwhile, two members of the 314 and a half Gang, allegedly responsible, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office, for approximately 15 to 20 bank robberies in the Valley, have been indicted. In addition, the initiative is committing extensive resources to outreach of both at-risk youth and their parents in order to discourage young people from joining such gangs. And we have seen intergenerational gang activity in my community. 
   The Congress would do well to emulate the efforts of the U.S. Attorney's Office and the local District Attorney's offices and law enforcement agencies that are working hard to fight the gang problem in my area. More than talk is required if we want to curb gang activity and end gang-related violence, we need action. That action should take the form of legislation, legislation that targets criminals, promotes Federal-State cooperation, and that comes from both sides of the aisle.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (FISA -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas and the gentlewoman from New Mexico for their strong leadership and advocacy on this critical national security issue. I think the colloquy engaged in really does represent the essence of the issue. 
   Former Director Bobby Inman was just quoted saying that it seems that there is greater concern around this Congress by a minority, frankly, to grant constitutional protections to foreign terrorists, really at the expense of protecting Americans. 
   I think we all know that is wrong. I think the colloquy you both just engaged in, and I heard the frustration expressed in your voice, I think that is also the frustration we are hearing from the American people. The American people do believe that Washington is broken, and I have said this many times. They are angry because Congress is not getting things done on their behalf, and this issue is just proof positive of this terrible failure. 
   It has been pointed out that we have a bipartisan agreement in the Senate, 68 votes. We have more than a majority in this House to pass this critical legislation, the Protect America Act. It will pass, if only the Speaker will allow this legislation to come up for a vote. They simply want us to put the national interests ahead of the special interests. 
   As you pointed out, the most litigious among us in this society are driving this issue and preventing the protection of the American people. I think it is just wrong, and we all know it is wrong. The bipartisan solution on FISA has been reached. There really are no more excuses. It is time for this leadership of the House to take ``yes'' for an answer. It is time to get the job done. 
   It has been 45 days, 45 days, since the Protect America Act has expired. Senator Rockefeller, the Chair of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, the Democrat from West Virginia, has made a plea, and I am going to quote him. He said, ``What people have to understand around here is that the quality of the intelligence we are going to be receiving is going to be degraded. It is going to be degraded. It is already going to be degraded as telecommunication companies lose interest.'' That was Senator Rockefeller, not me.

   Mr. DENT. I think that really says it all. Everybody agrees, both Republican and Democrat alike agree that the intelligence product is being degraded. This really isn't a partisan issue. It should not even be an ideological issue. This is simply an issue of common sense, doing what is right for the American people, putting their interests ahead of the special interests. 
   With that, I would be happy to yield back to the gentleman from Texas, because I know there are others who would like to participate in this colloquy.

   Mr. DENT. What I would respond is that the telecommunication companies at the request of their government were asked to cooperate and help us pursue terrorists. Obviously they have much of the infrastructure that we need to pursue these terrorists. 
   I would have to put this whole issue under the category of ``no good deed goes unpunished,'' where people who are acting in good faith to help their government are now being sued for their efforts, again to protect the most litigious elements of our society. 
   Because of that, because of the failure to provide a retroactive immunity as contained in the Protect America Act, when we do not provide that retroactive immunity, we know that these telecommunications can no longer be good partners. Even though they want to be helpful, they can't be. They have to protect themselves from lawsuits. They have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to protect themselves and their organizations. I think that is really what is driving us. 
   I would yield back to you, because you have been a distinguished member of the bar, you are a former U.S. Attorney, so you understand these issues probably better than just about anybody in this building.

   Mr. DENT. If the gentleman would yield briefly on that point, in fact my own Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Tom Corbett, came down to Washington to meet me and expressly asked me to support the Protect America Act. He too, like you, was a U.S. Attorney, and he was emphatic in his support for this legislation, and seemed a bit incredulous that Congress would not provide these necessary tools to our law enforcement and intelligence officials.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (FISA -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. I want to thank both of you for your eloquence on this critical issue. And with all these references to 9/11, I really believe it is important that we take seriously what this Congress did after 9/11. It created a commission, the 9/11 Commission, to make recommendations about how we can improve upon our Nation's homeland security and our national security. They made many recommendations; we are familiar with many. And, indeed, when the 110th Congress was first organized a little over 1 year ago, we were told by the new leadership under Speaker Pelosi that fulfilling those 9/11 Commission recommendations was a top priority. As it should be. And it is time that we equate those words with action. As you and I have both said, failure to do that is a dereliction of duty. 
   I believe that we have it within our means now to do what that 9/11 Commission wanted us to do, and I believe passing the Protect America Act is entirely consistent and compatible with what those folks who wrote the 9/11 Commission want us to do. And I believe that, again, failure to pass the Protect America Act really contravenes and contradicts what the 9/11 Commission stands for. 
   We also talked about this issue of liability and who is getting protected. One thing I guess I find particularly appalling is that, because of this approach to homeland security and national security to intelligence, many of our intelligence officials and officers have been forced to buy personal liability insurance to protect themselves from lawsuits from us, from Congress, from others who may choose to sue them. The phone companies are getting sued. Why not sue the intelligence officials? So what is happening is they are worried about being sued, and that is why they have had to find this type of insurance. 
   Mr. McCaul made a very interesting observation. He read an interesting quote a few minutes ago by that FBI agent, and I would like to put that quote into some context. In fact, at the time of the PATRIOT Act reauthorization a little over 2 years ago, there was an article written in the Wall Street Journal by a woman named Debra Burlingame. Who is Debra Burlingame? I guess she is best known because of her brother, Chic Burlingame, who was the pilot of one of the planes that crashed that day on 9/11, 2001 into the Pentagon. She had written this in the Wall Street Journal on January 30, 2006: Critics contend that the PATRIOT Act was rushed into law in a moment of panic. And there is relevant to our PAA here. The truth is, the policies and guidelines it corrected had a long troubled history, and everybody who had to deal with them knew it. The wall was a torturous set of rules promulgated by the Justice Department lawyers in 1995 and imagined into law by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court, or the FISA Court, conceived as an added protection for civil liberties provisions already built into the statute that was the wall and its real world ramifications that hardened the failure to share culture between agencies, allowing early information about 9/11 hijackers Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al Hashmi to fall through the cracks. More perversely, even after the significance of these terrorists and their presence in the country was known by the FBI's intelligence division, the wall prevented it from talking to its own criminal division in order to hunt them down.     
   In other words, the FBI criminal division and the FBI intelligence division couldn't communicate because of what was going on pre-9/11. 
   ``Furthermore,'' she writes, ``it was the impenetrable FISA guidelines and  fear of provoking the FISA court's wrath if they were transgressed that discouraged risk-averse FBI supervisors from applying for a FISA search warrant in the Zacarias Moussaoui case.'' And we all remember him. 
   ``The search, finally conducted on the afternoon of 9/11, produced names and phone numbers of people in the thick of the 9/11 plot, so many fertile clues that investigators believe that at least one airplane, if not all four, could have been saved.'' 
   That is what Debra Burlingame wrote. 
   Further on in that article where Mr. McCaul began, and this is the woman whose brother was the pilot who crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11, she concludes by saying: ``Three weeks before 9/11, an FBI agent with the bin Laden case squad in New York learned that al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi were in this country. He pleaded with the national security gatekeepers in Washington to launch a nationwide manhunt and was summarily told to stand down. When the FISA Court of Review tore down the wall in 2002, it included in its ruling the agent's August 29, 2001, e-mail to FBI headquarters,'' and I am going to restate what you just stated a few moments ago. The quote was from this FBI agent: ``Whatever has happened to this--someday someone will die--and wall or not--the public will not understand why we were not more effective in throwing every resource we had at certain problems. Let's hope that the National Security Law Unit will stand behind their decisions then, especially since the biggest threat to us now, bin Laden, is getting the most protection.'' 
   Not my words, and how can anybody not be moved by this? How can anybody somehow think that our own FBI is a greater threat to the American people than is al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden? 
   Mr. McCaul, you are an attorney. You understand this issue well. We want to protect everyone's civil liberties, and at the same time we have legitimate security threats we must deal with.

   Mr. DENT. Again, a powerful quote, the degradation and degrading of our intelligence capacities, stated by a Republican Attorney General and a Republican Director of National Intelligence, but also stated by the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, that the intelligence product will be degraded as a result of our failure to enact the Protect America Act. 
   I can't help but note, the gentleman from Texas having served in law enforcement, many of the arguments I just heard you talking about in your colloquy with Mrs. Wilson were also some of the arguments that I heard at the time of the PATRIOT Act reauthorization. 
   Remember it was being said that somehow our library records were going to be looked into. Several of the 9/11 terrorists made their airplane reservations on public library computers, and they confirmed those reservations on public library computers. 
   I am not aware that anybody has ever sought a library record under the law. But I also remember, too, after meeting with some folks from the Attorney General's Office, and this is not a classified issue, I remember them telling me that a terrorist, when interrogated, they asked: Why were you constantly on the New York Public Library computers? His response was they clean their hard drives at the end of the day. Interesting point. 
   Another issue we heard at the time of the PATRIOT Act had to do with roving wiretaps, a tool I believe you, as a prosecutor, used over the years, and that we use in drug cases against organized criminals. We use that type of method. When we talk about using it for counterterrorism purposes, it seems as if we were creating some new structure. Do you want to address that.

   Mr. DENT. Quickly, the bottom line is we should be listening to this foreign-to-foreign communication of people who are not American citizens who are suspected terrorists because you want to prevent what happened on 9/11 of 2001. For some of us, it was quite personal. 
   You mentioned what happened in 1993. My cousin spent the whole day on the top of that building, the South Tower, spent the entire day on the roof after what exploded in the basement, the garage of that building.     
   You know, he was there, also, on September 11, 2001. I remember that, too. He was on the 91st floor of the north tower when the plane entered the 93rd floor. Everybody above him was killed. 
   And for many of us it's personal. But if we have information, actionable intelligence, I would certainly hope that our counter terrorism officials, that our intelligence officials would do everything in their power to prevent such terrible events like 9/11 from ever occurring. 
   And again, I just want to state one more time that enacting the Protect America Act will help improve our intelligence capabilities, will protect Americans, and it's time that we get the job done. We have a bipartisan consensus to do it. Let's do it. The time for games is over. It's time to get the job done. 
   I yield back to my friend.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to welcome Pope Benedict to the United States for his first visit since becoming Pope in 2005. At this moment, the Pope is at the White House. This historic visit is a significant moment in history for our country, and an important opportunity for the 65 million American Catholics across the country to build a stronger rapport with their spiritual leader. 
   For one of my constituents, my friend and neighbor, Dr. Brennan Pursell, the Pontiff's visit is particularly special. Although Dr. Pursell has never met the Pope, he shares an intimate connection with him. 
   Dr. Pursell, a professor of history at DeSales University in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, has spent the past 3 years researching and writing about the upbringing, development, and motivations of Joseph Ratzinger, the man we know today as Pope Benedict. 
   Dr. Pursell's book, ``Benedict of Bavaria, An Intimate Portrait of the Pope and his Homeland,'' tells the story of a gifted intellectual and spiritual man who has been shaped by the rich traditions of Bavarian culture and deep devotion to the Catholic faith. 
   The portrait that Dr. Pursell paints in his book will help us all understand more about who the Pope is and what informs his perspectives. 
   I commend my constituents, Dr. Pursell; his wife, Irmgard, who is a German national; their son, Benedict; and daughter, Elena, for their dedication and for Brennan's significant contribution to history and the Catholic faith in capturing the story of Benedict of Bavaria. 
   I join with my constituents in warmly welcoming the Pope to our great country. I encourage everybody to take a look at this wonderful work ``Benedict of Bavaria'' by Dr. Brennan Pursell, my good friend and neighbor.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (HONORING SARKIS ACOPIAN -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of a national treasure, Sarkis Acopian. Mr. Acopian died on January 18, 2007, at his home in Palmer Township, Pennsylvania, which is located in my Congressional district near the City of Easton. He was 80 years old. 
   To say that Mr. Acopian lived a full life does not do justice to the legacy of this extraordinary man. His is, in part, the classic immigrant success story. He was born on December 8, 1926, in Tabriz, Iran, to Armenian parents. He came to this country in 1945 to study engineering at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. While here, Mr. Acopian was drafted into the United States Army. After completing his military service, Mr. Acopian returned to Lafayette, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree in mechanical engineering in 1951. 
   Mr. Acopian used his prodigious intellectual gifts and business acumen to design and build things that helped to make people's lives better. While working for the Weller Electric Corporation, he designed a power sander which became one of the company's main products. After forming the Acopian Technical Company in 1957, he designed and manufactured the first ever solar radio. Mr. Acopian subsequently led his company into the power supply business, and the company, which is still operating today, became and remains quite successful in that enterprise. 
   But Sarkis Acopian was much, much more than just an outstanding entrepreneur. In that regard, he loved outdoor venture and throughout his life he  was an avid pilot, scuba diver and skydiving enthusiast who made more than 200 jumps during the 1960s. But where he really made his presence known was in his philanthropic work. 
   Mr. Acopian was a self-effacing man who believed passionately in supporting the community quietly but with unmatched generosity. He was passionate about education. He made significant donations to Columbia University, to the Acopian Engineering Center at Lafayette College and to the Acopian Center for Ornithology at Muhlenberg College located in Allentown, Pennsylvania. 
   He was passionate about his faith, building the Saint Sarkis Armenian Apostolic Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, and giving generously to the Diocese of the Armenian Church of America and the Armenian Apostolic Church of America, as well as to local churches in Armenia. 
   He was passionate about nature, creating the Acopian Center for Conservation Learning at Hawk Mountain Sanctuary and the Acopian Bog Turtle Preserve, as well as endowing the environmental education program at the American University of Armenia and the Florida Institute of Technology. 
   He was passionate about the locality in which he lived, Easton, Easton, Pennsylvania. He gave generously to the Children's Home of Easton, a sanctuary for underprivileged youth. The State Theater of Easton and the Easton National Canal Museum. His contributions made children's lives better, raised appreciation for the arts in his community, and helped to preserve important local history. 
   As an immigrant to this country, Mr. Acopian was eternally grateful for the opportunities that had been afforded to him here. He showed that gratitude, in part, by providing $1 million towards the construction of the World War II Memorial in Washington D.C., that is right, $1 million to the World War II Memorial in Washington D.C. His generous donation was the single largest contribution to that fundraising effort. 
   I must tell a story, former Senator Bob Dole came to the Easton area several years ago and said that one day in front of a few hundred people he received a check for $1 million for the World War II Memorial. He picked up the phone and called this man, Mr. Acopian. He said, Mr. Acopian, this is very generous. Is there anything you would like because of this very generous gift? Mr. Acopian wanted anonymity. He said no, there is really nothing I want, Senator. After a few moments, he thought about it and said, Senator, there is actually one thing, Senator, I do want. He said, I would like to have a seat at the dedication. Bob Dole said, well, heck, yes, he can have mine. That is the way Sarkis Acopian was. He sought anonymity, but Bob Dole blew his cover. 
   His greatest passion, however, was for his lovely wife of 59 years, Mrs. Bobbye Seitze Mixon Acopian. Together the couple had two sons, Gregory, who is married to Karen; and Jeffrey, who is married to Helen, both of whom still reside in Easton. He is survived also by six grandchildren and two great grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I do rise today to support H.R. 1333, the Civil Air Patrol Homeland Security Act of 2007. And this legislation, which I introduced on March 6, 2007, has the bipartisan support of 56 Members of Congress. 
   I would first like to thank our good friend and colleague, Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON of Mississippi, as well as Ranking Member PETE KING of the Homeland Security Committee, as well as Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their cooperation and support in bringing this legislation to the floor today. 
   I also want to especially thank the subcommittee chairman, HENRY CUELLAR, who chairs the Subcommittee on Emergency Communications, Preparedness and Response on which I serve as the ranking member for his support of this legislation throughout this process and throughout this 110th Congress. I want to thank Chairman Cuellar especially. 
   H.R. 1333, as amended, would require the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, to conduct an expansive review to determine how the Civil Air Patrol may be used to support the homeland security missions of State, local and tribal governments, and the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Specifically, the GAO will review how the Civil Air Patrol may provide aerial reconnaissance or communications capabilities for border security; assist in damage assessments and situational awareness; search and rescue operations, evacuations and the transport of time-sensitive medical or other materials; or perform any other activities as determined by the GAO. 
   This review will provide greater information regarding the cost-effectiveness of using Civil Air Patrol assets for homeland security purposes at all levels of government. It will also help us understand whether the current process for States and the Federal Government to request Civil Air Patrol assistance is overly bureaucratic, limiting the effectiveness of this important resource in times of crisis. 
   Aviation assets have traditionally played an important role in border security, the interdiction of contraband, search and rescue operations, evacuations, and after-action analyses that must be performed in the wake of a catastrophic event.

   Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. 
   I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Chairman Thompson and Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Cuellar, for their bipartisan support and leadership on this important issue in helping us move this legislation forward. 
   I also want to point out that I had a few interesting experiences on the border with Chairman Cuellar. I visited Laredo, Texas, on two separate occasions with him, and I looked at what our Border Patrol was up to. I noticed there was a lack of aviation assets. In fact, Chairman Cuellar and I had a rather exciting visit on a helicopter in Laredo, Texas, and we got a good look at the border areas, and witnessed the lack of aviation assets on that border.     
   And so that certainly helped inspire this legislation. 
   Also, I'd like to point out too that there are a lot of good ideas that come from places other than Washington, D.C. When I was back in my district some time ago I remember a constituent of mine named David Miller, who is an octogenarian; he served during the Second World War, a pilot. He said to me, he talked about the use of the Civil Air Patrol during the Second World War and suggested, why don't you get them more engaged for various homeland security initiatives, particularly border security? I thought it sounded like a reasonable idea, and I looked into it and, of course, that's why we're here today dealing with legislation to further examine this very important issue. I thank David Miller for his foresight, just being a good citizen and making recommendations to his elected representative. 
   Also I would like to point out another former member, Lester Wolf of New York, had also been a strong advocate of greater utilization of the Civil Air Patrol. He served in, I think, the Long Island area of New York and was quite strong on this need for this type of legislation. 
   As well as a man named Bob Minert who is the executive director of the Pennsylvania wing of the Civil Air Patrol. Again, I want to thank all of them for their interest and leadership and helping get us to where we are today. 
   I would just like to say that the GAO study that this legislation requires will help Congress assess the current capabilities of the Civil Air Patrol to assist the Federal Government and our State and local partners in conducting homeland security missions. The review will help us determine whether the current mechanisms to utilize the Civil Air Patrol as a force multiplier in various missions, including search and rescue and border security, are sufficient to meet today's needs. 
   As we saw after September 11 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, in a catastrophic event, this country must be able to dramatically increase the number of response assets, while ensuring that Federal, State and local resources are well coordinated. By examining how various resources like the Civil Air Patrol may contribute to a mission prior to an event, we will help strengthen our Nation's security and resiliency. 
   I would like to thank everybody involved with this legislation, all my colleagues, and the 56 co-sponsors of this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and help to strengthen the performance of Homeland Security missions in the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Madam Speaker, at this time I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (ADVANCED FUELS INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 547, the Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act, is an important bill that seeks to facilitate the development of markets for biofuels and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. I am pleased that it is being considered on the floor today. 
   I supported this language last year when it passed as part of the Alternative Energy Research and Development Act. I am a strong supporter of diversifying our Nation's fuel supply. Our dependence on foreign sources of petroleum is a threat to our economy, threat to our national security, and a threat to our environment. 
   Promoting the development and implementation of clean domestic sources of transportation fuels will advance our energy independence and reduce the detrimental environmental effects of harmful air emissions. Bio-based fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, are an important component of a national energy strategy, which maximizes our domestic resources.  
   I also believe that hydrogen must play a prominent role in an energy policy that relieves our dependence on foreign sources of oil and minimizes the environmental footprint by improving air quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
   This bill will direct the development of additives, blendstocks, technologies and methods which mitigate the negative effect of biofuels on infrastructure and make them more compatible with existing infrastructure used to store and deliver petroleum-based fuels to the point of final sale. 
   My amendment seeks to acknowledge and address the infrastructure challenges that will be presented by the advancement of hydrogen fuel, which can be made from a variety of feedstocks, including biomass. Specifically, my amendment will, one, direct the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, to consider the challenges for design, reforming storage, handling and dispensing hydrogen fuel from various feedstocks, including biomass. 
   I believe that key to our energy security is a strategy which incorporates the various technologies and alternative fuels that will coexist in the marketplace. 
   As we address the important infrastructure challenges raised by the promotion of biofuels and ultra-low sulfur diesel, I also believe it is incumbent upon us to start paving the way for the hydrogen economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I do have a great deal of respect for the chairman, but I do respectfully disagree with his contention that this amendment is outside the scope of this legislation. 
   Clearly the Chair and the Parliamentarian have ruled this amendment germane. And it is germane for a number of reasons. Specifically, biomass is a feedstock, as we know. It can be used in the production of hydrogen. So I am trying to emphasize once again that these are very consistent technologies. 
   There is $10 million authorized in this legislation. We just seek to take some of that funding for this amendment. We are not asking for additional funding. Again, as you develop an infrastructure for biomass and biodiesel, developing one for hydrogen is just as essential. 
   I think that this is entirely consistent, well within the scope of the legislation before us and should be supported by all of the Members of this Chamber. I do have a great deal of respect for the gentleman from Tennessee. I know he is dedicated to alternative fuel development. 
   But I think we cannot move forward on some aspects of alternative fuels while ignoring hydrogen in a hydrogen-based economy, which is where many of us would like to move at some point in the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (COMMEMORATING THE 100TH BACH CHOIR FESTIVAL -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the distinguished Bach choir of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, our Nation's oldest choir dedicated to the performance and celebration of musical masterpieces composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. Founded in 1898 under the direction of J. Fred Wolle, the organist of the Bethlehem Moravian Church, the choir is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the annual Bach Festival this month. 
   In 1900, the Bach choir presented their first performance of ``The Mass in B Minor'' in the Moravian Church in Bethlehem during the Bach Festival. Although the next Bach Festival was not held again until 1912, the Festival has blossomed into a long-standing cultural tradition in Bethlehem, attracting visitors from all around the Nation and the world each year. During the festival, the choir will once again breathe life into Bach's Mass in B Minor. 
   Since its inception, the choir has been a shining star in the city of Bethlehem. Today, the choir is comprised of 95 volunteer members and performs under the leadership and direction of Greg Funfgeld. This unique ensemble has gained international acclaim for their artistry. The choir has been welcomed to perform on some of the most renowned stages in the world, including the Kennedy Center, Carnegie Hall, Munich's Royal Residence, as well as London's Royal Albert Hall as part of a concert tour in the United Kingdom. 
   Furthermore, countless listeners have tuned in across the globe to listen to the choir on National Public Radio and the BBC World Service. The discipline and talent that ushers this choir around the world is also shared with children and the young musicians in Lehigh Valley through music education programs.  
   I would just like to commend all the good people at the Bach choir and congratulate them on this 100th anniversary of the Bach Festival.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (REVISIONS TO ALLOCATION FOR HOUSE COMMITTEES -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I first want to applaud you for your leadership on this issue. As an OB/GYN physician, you know this issue probably better than anyone in this institution. 
   But I just wanted to share with you a perspective from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, where we were a crisis State. And you're right on on some of these issues you just discussed, but the bad policy on medical liability reform was far too common in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for a very long time. 
   Our crisis actually originated back in the 1970s when no one would write medical liability insurance. So we created a State fund, and it was supposed to be a stopgap measure. We addressed that stopgap measure almost 30 years later in 2002, 2003. 
   But the point of the whole issue is you had to buy insurance from the State fund, we call it the MCAT fund, and it's been renamed the MCARE fund, and then you would buy additional insurance from the private sector. 
   The problem with the program was, though, you would buy your insurance basically today, if you're a young doctor you buy into the MCARE fund, and you're really paying for past claims, unlike a traditional insurance product where you pay your premium today to pay against a future claim, and so this has created an enormous retention problem for us because over the years there are so many unsettled cases in this MCAT fund that what would happen is these claims all collected and we started settling these cases rather aggressively in the late 1990s and 2001 and 2002. And so today's physicians were being assessed with an emergency surcharge to pay for previous medical liability incidents. A major, major problem. 
   And also, in a city like Philadelphia, where the average jury verdict was more than double that of anywhere else in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, where jury verdicts were in excess of $1 million on average, as reported by a jury verdict research, and the rest of the Commonwealth, the verdicts were less than half that. 
   But my point again is this: we created this State fund, an unfunded liability accumulates, today's doctors are paying for the liability situation of their predecessors, creates an enormous physician recruitment problem. Of course, there's always a retention problem, but the recruitment problem was enormously pronounced because of that policy change. 
   And so what ultimately happened, because the premiums became so high through this State fund, the people who ultimately had to solve this problem for the physicians were the taxpayers. And so cigarette taxes were used to pay for physicians' premiums, particularly in the high-risk areas, the OBs, the neurosurgeons and many other trauma surgeons and orthopods. 
   That's what happened in Pennsylvania, and I think many of the remedies you've discussed here, such as caps on noneconomic damages or collateral sources, structured payments, some of the things that you've done in Texas, I'm not as familiar with all those changes, but it certainly had an impact. 
   I just wanted to applaud you for this. You know, of course, that there's legislation pending in this Congress from some of the legislation last session, and I just want to thank you for yielding, but I just again want to applaud you for your leadership on this issue. I'm glad you're bringing this issue, once again, to the attention of the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak on the Homeland Security authorization bill, H.R. 1684. 
   The stated purpose of H.R. 1684 is to enhance homeland security. Unfortunately, the restricted rule enacted at the behest of the majority excludes certain measures that would have increased our domestic security. One such provision is my amendment on the Automated Targeting System for Passengers, or ATS-P. ATS-P coordinates information already available from sources and allows Customs and Border Protection to perform risk assessments of people entering the United States. In this way CBP can identify a person of interest and question that individual before, let me repeat, before that person gains formal admission into this country. 
   This amendment would have been a positive step towards improving border security. 
   ATS-P is a system that is already deployed and that has already had some notable successes. It would have fulfilled a 9/11 Commission recommendation. And yet the majority remains opposed to it and made sure that it was not made in order. The motive behind that exclusion remains a mystery. 
   The mystery deepens when one considers what was made in order today, specifically one portion of the manager's amendment. During committee proceedings at my request, we inserted language authorizing funding for the United States Secret Service. The Secret Service, once an entity of the Treasury Department, now falls within the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security. The Secret Service plays an important function in safeguarding the citizens of this country. The amendment I offered would have fully funded the President's request for the Secret Service's protection missions. It also would have provided over $322 million for Investigations and Field Operations, the unit within the Secret Service that investigates and prosecutes counterfeiting, fraud and identity theft. 
   Mr. Chairman, I will insert a copy of a letter into the Record from the National Fraternal Order of Police endorsing the inclusion of Secret Service funding within the Homeland Security authorization bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, if this Congress is serious, truly serious about implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, Members should vote in favor of this motion to recommit. 
   The 9/11 Commission told us that we needed to develop a better border security system. And, let me repeat. This amendment implements a key 9/11 Commission recommendation. 
   Specifically, the 9/11 Commission advised the President to direct the Department of Homeland Security to design a comprehensive screening system that would target particular identifiable suspects or indicators of risk and give border officials the resources to establish that people are who they say they are, intercept identifiable suspects and disrupt terrorist operations. They went on to say and conclude that targeting travel is at least as powerful a weapon against terrorists as targeting their money, and that is the 9/11 Commission Report, recommendation 14, page 385, and recommended that a terrorist travel intelligence collection and analysis program which had produced disproportionately useful results should be expanded. 
   The Automated Targeting System for Passengers is such a system, and this motion would reinforce our intention to see ATS-P utilized at all of our Nation's international border crossing points.  
   ATS-P is nothing new. It is already being utilized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP. It has been authorized in several appropriations bills, and the Department of Homeland Security has testified before Congress about the program several times. 
   ATS-P does not violate anyone's constitutional rights. It is deployed only at the border. And Federal courts have said time and time again that screening people who are trying to enter our country at a port of entry is perfectly permissible under the fourth amendment. 
   All ATS-P does is collect information from available sources, the Treasury Enforcement Communications System, or TECS, and the Passenger Name Record databases, so that CBP can perform risk assessments of people trying to enter the United States. 
   ATS-P addresses a major software issue that had previously hampered border control efforts. TECS has existed since the 1970s but was written in a cumbersome programming language that was difficult for Border Patrol agents to access. ATS-P just makes it easier for CBP to make inquiries into this database. 
   The bottom line here is that ATS-P, after factoring in the available information, indicates to the Customs and Border Protection officer whether an international traveler should be flagged for additional screening or questioning. That CBP officer retains the discretion to do with that information as he or she pleases. But by giving advance notice of an investigatory lead, ATS-P allows the officer and the agency to operate more effectively, to engage in screening that is risk-based. It is not surprising, then, that CBP considers ATS-P to be the cornerstone of its targeting efforts at the border. 
   ATS-P has had notable successes. It has been credited with identifying persons of interest to border security officials in Atlanta, Minneapolis and Boston. 
   For all of us here in the Congress who are serious about border security, this motion, which supports the already existing ATS-P program, is an absolute no-brainer: It follows the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. It provides needed information to CBP officers. It does not violate anyone's civil or constitutional rights. And, most importantly, it works. For all the reasons I have just stated, I ask respectfully that you vote in favor of the motion to recommit. 
   At this time, I yield to the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, Mr. King of New York.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (DUST AND TOXINS FROM 9/11 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. I would like to thank the gentlelady from New York (Mrs. Maloney) for arranging this opportunity to come to the floor to raise awareness of the ongoing effects of 9/11. 
   I am proud to say that so many from Pennsylvania answered the first call very, very quickly, among some of the first there after the New Yorkers, who helped deal with the aftermath of those horrible attacks. 
   As we all know, September 11, 2001, was one of the darkest days in American history. Nearly 3,000 innocent people were killed in separate incidents in  New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. These attacks were intended to instill fear in our hearts and minds and to shake our American spirit. 
   They did not have that desired effect. Instead, they unified a Nation and strengthened the resolve of the American people. I neglected to mention that one of my own relatives was in the North Tower and, thankfully, made it out. He was on the 91st floor, made it out. All of his colleagues did, too, but nobody above them did. So this issue has touched us all in many ways. 
   September 11, and the long days that followed, bore witness to inspiring acts of heroism and self-sacrifice. As rescue and recovery efforts unfolded, we saw Americans reaching out to one another, united in a determination to make the country whole again. 
   Whether it was neighbor helping neighbor or stranger helping stranger, Americans from across the country simply gave of themselves, and operating at the front lines of this effort were local first responders. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about one of those first responders, a selfless and heroic individual by the name of Ryan McCormick. 
   Ryan, a native of Bethlehem Township in my district, has led a life of service that we should all try to emulate. An Eagle Scout of the Minsi Trails Council, Ryan committed himself to public service at a very young age. Whether he was volunteering at the Bethlehem Township Volunteer Fire Company, performing search and rescue operations with the Civil Air Patrol, or defending our Nation as an 8-year veteran of the United States Army Reserve, Ryan has always been concerned about the well-being of others. 
   Taking the Boy Scout motto of ``Be Prepared'' to heart, Ryan was, indeed, prepared and acted without hesitation on that fateful Tuesday, Tuesday morning of September 11. Ryan was working as a paramedic in Newark, New Jersey, when his unit was dispatched to the terrorist attacks. Relying on his years of preparation and experience and firmly committed to helping others, Ryan worked tirelessly from September 11 to September 13. The work was hard, dirty and dangerous and heartbreaking. But Ryan persisted. For him, duty came first.     
   But Ryan McCormick paid a terrible price for his determination and resolve. In late 2002, Ryan started to become sick. In the spring of 2003, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, a cancer of the lymphatic system. He has undergone consistent treatment for over 4 years, including a stem cell transplant. He is still fighting valiantly against his cancer and soon hopes to be well enough for another stem cell transplant. 
   But Ryan is not alone. Many of the first responders who worked to ease the suffering of the innocent are now suffering life-threatening illnesses. Fortunately, Ryan, like the rest of his first responder colleagues, is a fighter. And I am proud to let you know that Ryan has joined us tonight and is seated in the Gallery. 
   Ryan continues to battle this cancer while continuing his service to others. Ryan is the director of emergency management for New Jersey's largest health care system, serves as the Essex County emergency management deputy EMS coordinator and is a lieutenant for the Verona, New Jersey, rescue squad. 
   In addition, Ryan has started a nonprofit corporation that raises money to buy iPods for cancer patients undergoing cancer treatment. This organization is named Project Turtle Pods, and more information about this endeavor can be found at www.projectturtlepods.com. 
   Ryan, the House of Representatives welcomes you and thanks you for your courageous service on September 11th. You exemplify all that is great about the American spirit. 
   As ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee on Emergency Communications, Preparedness and Response, I am very well aware of the sacrifices our country's first responders make to ensure the safety of others. In turn, we in Congress must take on the responsibility of protecting those who sacrifice to protect us. That is why I have agreed to cosponsor Representative Maloney's bill, House Resolution 128, which urges the Department of Health and Human Services to prepare a long-term, comprehensive plan to medically monitor all individuals who were exposed to the toxins of Ground Zero. 
   Of all the lessons we learned from the terrorist attacks of 9/11, there is one first and foremost that stands out: We must not forget those individuals who continue to suffer in the aftermath of these events. The spirit found in Ryan McCormick is fundamentally American. It is this can-do attitude that assures us that we as a Nation can rise to meet any challenge that we encounter. Let us follow the example that Ryan has set for us and help those who are suffering from afflictions precipitated by their involvement in the 9/11 rescue, recovery and cleanup efforts. The people who gave so much to us at that site deserve nothing less. 
   Again, I want to thank the gentlelady from New York (Mrs. Maloney) for tonight's opportunity to speak on this important issue and her commitment to our Nation's first responders. I want to thank her for her friendship and her leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding the excessively partisan comments from the gentleman from Florida that did not serve this bipartisan, bicameral product well, I do want to thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King of the Homeland Security Committee for their hard work to bring this very fine bill together. As a member of the conference committee, I had an opportunity to see firsthand the extraordinary leadership these two gentlemen provided. I thank them for that. 
   This leadership really came together and really came to the forefront during the debate on the so-called ``John Doe'' provision. I vigorously applaud their efforts to make this immunity grant part of the bill. These provisions were made necessary because of an outrageous lawsuit that attempts to punish airline passengers and crew for  being vigilant. Contrary to what some might think, vigilance on the part of our traveling public is important, especially during a time when terrorists want to attack us both at home and abroad. 
   Above and beyond the ``John Doe'' language, this bill has noteworthy accomplishments. It allows a greater percentage of homeland security funds to be distributed based upon risk, and it authorizes funds for transportation security. 
   Further, as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Emergency Communications, Preparedness and Response, I was especially pleased that this report establishes a new grant program within the Department of Homeland Security that will promote the development of interoperable communications. 
   But while this bill has some good provisions, it does leave some 9/11 Commission recommendations and some 9/11 Commission business undone, especially in two important areas. First, it does not address the issue of congressional jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security, and it does nothing to promote the development of a comprehensive screening system for international travelers arriving at our borders. 
   Had the majority chosen to incorporate my Fast and Secure Travel Initiative into this legislation, we would have dovetailed very nicely with the transportation security provisions contained within the act. Frankly, that second recommendation would have satisfied completely. 
   Passage of this conference report, though, is another part of our continuing efforts to keep our homeland secure. It is a laudable step. But as you can see, there is still much more to do.

   Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, I just want to follow up on what my friend Mr. Bishop of New York has just said. 
   We all learned about Lieutenant Michael Murphy's bravery. And, of course, last week, as was just stated, he received the Congressional Medal of Honor from President Bush on October 22. 
   I also want to share with you an experience over the weekend prior to the  Penn State/Ohio State game on Saturday evening. We had a ceremony on the field of Beaver Stadium, 110,000 people. Of course Lieutenant Murphy is a Penn State alumnus and graduated from the university in political science, as I did about 17 years earlier. And we had a ceremony. It was touching to be with his parents, Dan and Maureen, to recognize his gallantry, his bravery. As Abraham Lincoln said, he had given that ``last full measure of devotion.'' 
   But we joined his parents on the field, myself along with our colleagues, Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania and Todd Platts of Pennsylvania. We escorted them on the field, along with the president of the university, Graham Spanier. And just prior to the playing of the national anthem, which was dedicated in memory of Lieutenant Murphy, the university presented a certificate that read: ``Pennsylvania State University recognizes Lieutenant Michael Murphy as the recipient of the Medal of Honor, for his gallantry and bravery, serving as a United States Navy SEAL while under enemy attack in Afghanistan. Lieutenant Murphy represents the highest ideal of the university as an alumnus and patriot.'' 
   And, again, I would just like to share with my colleagues from New York, and certainly all Americans, the sense of deep loss we feel for the Murphy family and so many others who have paid the ultimate price in this war, in both Afghanistan and Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. DENT. (CONGRATULATIONS TO MORRIS BLACK AND SONS -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DENT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary of the Morris Black and Sons, a renowned interior design business located within my district. 
   Founded in 1908 by company namesake Morris Black, the business began as a horse and wagon team supplying contractors with construction needs including pipe, bricks, sand, cement and other masonry products. The company quickly grew as the Lehigh Valley became an industrial center, and by 1928, operated warehouses in Allentown and Bethlehem. 
   In the 1930s, Morris was joined by his sons, Benjamin and Samuel in running the family business. Under this leadership, Morris Black continued to develop, and in 1943, became one of the first companies in the Nation to incorporate an insulation subcontracting business. 
   A third generation of the Black family became associated with the company in the 1970s when Morris Black and Sons entered a period of rapid change. In the mid 1970s the company saw a growing interest in do-it-yourself remodeling and design. With the do-it-yourself trend on the horizon, Morris Black and Sons opened one of the first home design centers that marketed building products directly to active homeowners in 1976. 
   Over time, the company has continued to expand, opening its first satellite location in 1999 and the second in 2000, and has developed a strong reputation for quality throughout eastern Pennsylvania. 
   This Saturday the family marks its 100th anniversary. I wish the entire Morris Black family and company a healthy congratulations.
