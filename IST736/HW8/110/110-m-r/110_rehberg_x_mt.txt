<DOCNO>Mr. REHBERG. (RECOGNIZING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF BILLINGS, MONTANA -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REHBERG. Mr. Speaker, today I'm introducing legislation to recognize the 125th anniversary of the City of Billings, Montana. First discovered by Lewis and Clark on the famous expedition, Billings is now the most populous city in the Northern Rocky Mountain Region of the United States. 
   I know for many U.S. cities, 125 years isn't very long. However, for Billings, these years have created a rich history that stretches beyond its age. 
   Historically, Billings has been the gateway to the Pacific northwest. Even its name, which originated with the former president of the Northern Pacific Railroad, Frederic Billings, is a description of the city's historical role as an important railway link to the northwest. 
   Billings has also been home to many notable people. For instance, in 1907, famous cowboy, author and illustrator, Will James came to Billings, where he lived and worked for years. Finally, the city is home to the oldest higher education institution in the State of Montana, Rocky Mountain College. 
   Today the city serves as an example of an all-American city through both its flourishing economy and its continued growth. I congratulate the city of Billings, Montana, and its years of rich history.

<DOCNO>Mr. REHBERG. (DEMOCRATS ARE TIRED OF THINKING -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REHBERG. Mr. Speaker, finally a Democrat bill. 
   Will Rogers once said a conclusion is a place where you finally got tired of thinking. It looks like the Democrat leadership has gotten tired of thinking. 
   They just got back from a 5-week vacation, while gas prices prevented many of their constituents from taking a vacation. I joined my Republican colleagues here in Washington, D.C. We were here every day of the week during those days with no lights, no cameras, no microphone, and no Democrats. 
   Last week, the first week we were back, we worked just 3 days, just 3 days, and they did not give us an energy bill. 
   I come from the energy State of Montana. We have oil, gas, coal, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and ethanol. We are part of the solution. But the Democrats are standing in our way. 
   Allow us an opportunity to drill for oil and dig our coal. It is time we pass a bill. After 5 weeks of vacation, another week of no energy votes, they finally come up with a 290-page energy bill that doesn't create any energy. We can only conclude the Democrats are tired of thinking.

<DOCNO>Mr. REHBERG. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REHBERG. Thank you, and I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas for all his hard work in drafting this important piece of legislation. 
   Beginning in 1962, the Department of Defense commenced a number of chemical and biological tests involving nearly 6,000 American military personnel. These tests, known as Project 112 and Project SHAD, exposed servicemembers to toxic agents such as Vx nerve gas, sarin nerve gas and E. Coli.  
   Not surprising, many of the veterans unknowingly exposed to deadly agents are suffering from serious medical conditions. Yet for over 40 years the Department of Defense denied the existence of these tests. All the while, these veterans continued to suffer. Finally, in 2001, DOD admitted to conducting Project 112 and Project SHAD, but they still refused to take responsibility for their care. 
   Enough is enough. As we approach the end of this Congress, we can do our part to care for these veterans by extending an expiring provision which allows for Project 112 and Project SHAD veterans to receive care at VA facilities without proving service connection. 
   My constituent, John Olson, a veteran of Project SHAD, spent all day Tuesday undergoing tests for a possible aneurysm. This is the latest in a long line of medical problems since leaving the service. Yet, as my friend from California will state, the VA is approving claims at an embarrassingly low rate. We can and should do everything we can to care for these veterans. 
   I want to thank Mr. Thompson of California for keeping this issue in front of the press, keeping this issue in front of the Congress, and keeping this issue in front of the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. REHBERG. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REHBERG. Madam Speaker, as an elected representative of our brave men and women serving in harm's way, every vote regarding war is a solemn matter. 
   Debate about the war in Iraq is necessary, required, and many important points were brought up over the more than forty hours of discussion. 
   No doubt about it, there have been setbacks in Iraq. And mistakes have been made on the ground and here in Washington. It's safe to say that all of us--the President, the Congress, and the American people wish we could have achieved stability in the region sooner. 
   However, I believe it's necessary to separate the resolution being debated in the House from the real issue. The real issue is that a failed state in Iraq would present a serious threat to the United States' national security interests, could allow terrorists to further establish safe-havens in Iraq, and could create regional and global unrest for many years to come. This is a threat we must not pass on to our children and grandchildren. September 11th showed us that terrorists can reach our soil and kill innocent Americans. We must fight this war on our terms, but on their turf. 
   This non-binding resolution, H. Con. Res. 63, is nothing more than an opinion about a strategy. 
   While opinions are interesting, solutions are necessary. 
   So I say to those who want to support this non-binding resolution: If you disagree with the strategy--put forward a plan; if you disagree with the tactics--put forward an alternative; if you disagree with the mission--put forward a solution.'' 
   A non-binding resolution means non-leadership; a non-binding resolution means non-accountability. A non-binding resolution is not a plan for victory. 
   This week, Congress has spent a lot of time debating one of the most important issues facing this body. Unfortunately, this legislation limited a true debate on the alternatives and direction we can take. 
   A real resolution on Iraq needs to include real benchmarks and real guidelines, not simply a vote of no confidence. 
   There are those of us who are willing to disagree with the President at the strategic, tactical or project level, and a true solution would be for Congress to debate the McCain-lieberman proposal. This bipartisan alternative not only reaffirms Congressional support for our troops, but provides military, political, and social benchmarks for the Iraqi government. This approach lays the groundwork for not only victory, but also brings our troops home as soon as possible. 
   We owe it to our troops and their families to provide the necessary oversight to ensure any new strategy is successful, while at the same time giving our troops confidence that Congress will not cut off their funding to settle policy disputes while they are separated from their families by distance and danger. I continue to stand, ready, willing and able to contribute to that oversight.

<DOCNO>Mr. REHBERG. (HONORING FORMER LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR KARL OHS -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REHBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor one of Montana's most dedicated public servants, former Lieutenant Governor Karl Ohs. Last month Karl passed away in his Helena home due to complications caused by brain cancer. 
   Born in Malta, Montana, in 1946, Karl was the portrait of a Montana farmer and rancher. Whether it was studying agricultural economics at Montana State University, meeting with fellow ag producers to discuss economic opportunities in the State, or working  the ranch, Karl was a vital supporter of our leading industry. 
   His work on behalf of rural priorities didn't stop there. During his three terms in the House of Representatives and his 4 years as Lieutenant Governor, Karl was a proven leader. As a member of the Governor's advisory task force on drought and chairman of the National Lieutenant Governors Association, Karl represented Montana's needs not only on the State but on the national level. Additionally, his prominent role as mediator between the antigovernment Freeman and the FBI during a 1996 standoff, for which he was awarded the FBI's highest civil service award, solidified Karl's status as a hardworking, straight-shooting cowboy. 
   Finally, in 2006, as chairman of the Montana Republican Party, Karl helped Republicans regain control of the State House, the only State in the Nation to see a legislative body change from Democrat to Republican control. 
   Most importantly, Karl was a dedicated father, a loving husband, and a good friend, who left a permanent impression on those who knew him. 
   God rest his soul.

<DOCNO>Mr. REHBERG. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REHBERG. Mr. Chairman, in light of the distressing statistics regarding the Office of National Drug Control Policy's National Youth Media Campaign, and its subsequent reduction within our committee, I rise today to let my colleagues know that it is possible to design, implement and evaluate youth anti-drug marketing. 
   Methamphetamine is a real problem across this great Nation, and no State is immune to its horrible effects. Montana ranks among the top 10 States nationally in per capita treatment admissions for methamphetamine use. 
   The statistics in Montana are truly staggering. Fifty-two percent of the children who are placed in out-of-home care are there because of meth. 
   Fifty percent of adults incarcerated at State prisons are there due to meth. 
   Twenty percent of Montanans in addiction treatment are there because of meth. 
   While many people would simply nod their heads and agree this is a terrible problem, some good people in Montana have taken it upon themselves to do something about it. 
   Tom Siebel, who lives in Wolf Creek, is an outstanding Montanan who did something that many of us could not do. He decided to use his own money to fund a prevention campaign to help raise awareness about the dangers of first time methamphetamine use. Tom Siebel founded the Montana Meth Project in 2005, which has been conducting research and running a statewide multi-media public awareness campaign aimed at significantly reducing first-time methamphetamine use through public service messaging, public policy, and community outreach. 
   Results from the Montana Meth Use & Attitudes Survey conducted earlier this year show the dramatic and successful impact that the Montana Meth Project's public education campaign has had on its intended audience. 
   Over the past 2 years, there has also been a dramatic shift in the perception of methamphetamine use, more frequent parent-child communications about the dangers of methamphetamine, and greater societal disapproval. For the first time, meth use and associated crime in Montana has declined. 
   The States of Arizona and Idaho are using Montana's hard-hitting ads and successful approach, launching similar youth media campaigns. Clearly, the efforts of the Montana Meth Project are working.

<DOCNO>Mr. REHBERG. (RURAL VETERANS ACCESS TO CARE ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REHBERG. Thank you, Mr. Moran, for your leadership. I want to add my kudos. Whenever we talk about rural issues, it's the same people that usually stand up: Somebody from Colorado, South Dakota, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Kansas, and Nebraska. We have certain issues confronting us that other places do not. 
   Let me real briefly describe my district to you. My district spans the distance of 147,000 square miles. The distance of my district is Washington, D.C. to Chicago, and I have 104,000 veterans living in that area. It's very difficult for them to access and, kid no one, we ration health care in the veterans' system. This is a perfect bill for showing what can be done if we would  just use a little initiative within the United States Congress. 
   Mr. Filner, thank you for bringing this forward. Everyone knows that nothing moves without the chairman's blessing, and we thank you for bringing this forward so we would have the opportunity to explain it a little bit. 
   Montana is surrounded by some wonderful States, like Idaho and Wyoming and South Dakota, but when we have major medical, there are no facilities within those States, so we have to travel to Denver, Salt Lake City, Minneapolis, and Seattle. The distances are great, and usually the illnesses are so great, it's very difficult for our veterans to travel that distance. 
   I want to take issue with one of the comments from CBO. They suggest that local health care providers would hesitate to invest in expanded facilities to accommodate veterans. Clearly, the CBO does not understand the plight of rural health care because my rural health care providers are doing everything they can to keep their doors open in the first place because of a diminishing population; not a population of seniors or veterans, but a population of youth. And so the veterans and the seniors are staying in the community and it's going to be harder for my facilities to stay open. 
   If these veterans are having to ride on buses for many, many miles to get to Fort Harrison, and I want to say I am not suggesting that we don't have tremendous veterans' health care in Montana. We do. We have Fort Harrison in Helena. But it's not adequate when it comes to the distances they are having to travel. 
   Please support this bill. Thank you, Mr. Moran.

<DOCNO>Mr. REHBERG. (AGRICULTURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE AND WESTERN STATES EMERGENCY UNFINISHED BUSINESS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REHBERG. Mr. Speaker, I would like to associate myself with Mr. Walden and Mr. Simpson when I say the President is dead wrong. In fact, he is almost to the level of being cruel, when an administration doesn't clearly understand a sense of urgency, when you only have 3 minutes to talk about something as serious as the lives of family members within places like Montana. 
   Rural schools, it hits 33 of my counties of the 56. The disaster with the farmers and ranchers hits the rest of the State. Virtually our entire State has been under a disaster since 2005. 
   It is always interesting to me when we debate on the floor the seriousness of Hurricane Katrina, or we talk about the hurricanes and we talk about floods. Drought sneaks up on you. It occurs during a period of years. 
   I can tell you in Montana we have seriously had to consider setting up crisis counseling for farmers and ranchers because of the emotionalism of not being able to pay for your children's food, their clothing, their shoes, their college education or even your own retirement, because it continually eats away at you. 
   It doesn't happen overnight like a flood or a tornado. It creeps up on you like a cancer. And to have an administration that doesn't have any more sense of urgency to understand that 2005 still has not been addressed, 2006 has not been addressed, and now we are in 2007 and we are arguing about the fact we want to veto this bill? That's cruel. 
   Clearly the administration needs to understand that there are emergencies beyond. Now, it's not without some criticism I level on the majority party when they tied it to the timelines in the Iraq supplemental. That's cruel as well, because essentially it held them hostage. And not one farmer or ranch group in Montana came up and said I want you to vote for the timelines in the Iraq supplemental because we need our money.  
   They were smarter than that. They can't be bribed. They don't want to be held hostage. They did not apply pressure. I thought it was unfair to tie it together in the first place. 
   So we finally come to where we need to be, and I want to thank the majority party for recognizing that. I hope they won't tie it again, because ultimately this is too important. We are in fact talking about lives and families and futures. The future of the State of Montana, it is an agricultural State. We need the opportunity to become whole by being able to go to the bank and to borrow the money to stay in business. 
   Please support this bill.
