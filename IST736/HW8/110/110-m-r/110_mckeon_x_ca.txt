<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to H.R. 6, the Democrat no energy plan. As senior Republican on the Education and Labor Committee, I oppose not only the bill's remarkable lack of any new energy, but also its inclusion of bureaucratic mandates that will kill American jobs and complicate job-training. 
   Just yesterday, a letter was sent to the National Economic Council Director Allan Hubbard claiming that the bill, and I quote, ``Will not significantly expand the application of Davis-  Bacon prevailing wage requirements.'' Now, I don't know how the majority defines the words ``significantly expand,'' but by my count, this bill contains at least seven separate instances in which the Davis-Bacon wage mandates are imposed. 
   Simply put, this bill furthers the majority's aggressive application of Davis-Bacon wage mandates. Davis-Bacon wages can inflate project costs by as much as 15 percent, costs that get passed on to taxpayers. They also force private companies to do hundreds of millions of dollars of excessive administrative work each year, squandering resources that would be better spent creating jobs and spurring innovation. 
   As if the job killing Davis-Bacon requirements weren't bad enough, this bill also complicates our job training system by creating a redundant and unnecessary program to expand the energy efficient and renewable energy workforce. If this no energy package becomes law, it will mean more red tape, more bureaucracy and more hurdles for job seekers. We are talking about energy efficiency. Why not talk about job training efficiency as well? 
   For these and other reasons, Mr. Speaker, I cannot support the Democrat no energy bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no.''

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill and to this rule. The bill we are scheduled to debate today, the so-called Employee Free Choice Act, represents what I believe is the worst piece of legislation I have come across in 20-plus years of public service. 
   What is wrong with it, let me count the ways. 
   Number one, it undermines the secret ballot process in the workplace, a process all of us in this House rely upon, treasure, and would fight to defend when it comes to our own political careers, but apparently for some, not when it comes to the rights of workers. 
   Number two, it leaves workers wide open to coercion and intimidation from those seeking to organize in the workplace. In an Education and Labor Subcommittee hearing last month, a former union organizer described such coercion through a practice organizers call a ``blitz.'' In a blitz, organizers go directly to the homes of workers to get them to sign an authorization card. And how do they find out where these workers live? From license plates and other sources that were used to create a master list. 
   According to this witness: ``Workers usually have no idea that there is a union campaign under way. Organizers are taught to play upon this element of surprise to get `into the door.' '' 
   Number three, it strips workers of their right to privacy in organizing elections and makes their votes completely and utterly public so their co-workers, their employers, and union officials know exactly how they voted. 
   Number four, not only does it strip workers of their right to vote in organizing elections, but it also strips away their right to vote on contracts as well. Instead, that right is given to a third-party mediator. 
   Number five, it levies civil penalties upon employers if they coerce an employee during a card check campaign. However, the bill remains silent on coercion from unions, looking the other way and providing tacit approval for such intimidation. 
   Frankly, Madam Speaker, I can go on and on. In short, this bill is not only undemocratic; it is dangerous. And I will be proud to manage time in opposition to it in just a short while. 
   When I think about how important secret ballot is, I remember when I first learned about it in grammar school. When we would elect our class officers, we put our heads down on our desk and raised our hand for the person we were supporting because it was important then, just as it is important now, that when we vote, no one knows how we vote. 
   From those days in elementary school until now, having been elected many times to office, I prize the importance of that secret ballot. And I prize that secret ballot for the workers that are facing intimidation, the possible intimidation from either side, from labor or from management. They should be free of that, and the only way they can be free of that is secret ballot and that is what we are trying to preserve for them at this time. 
   Yesterday, I appeared before the Rules Committee in support of several amendments that would have made this debate as fair, open, and robust as possible. While I am pleased that they made in order my substitute amendment, this rule before us still is harsh and one that will stifle debate. 
   Madam Speaker, we had an opportunity to strengthen this debate and address head-on the many flaws of the underlying legislation, but we were denied that opportunity; and as such, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this rule.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Any time democracy itself is placed at risk, it is the responsibility of each Member of this body to rise in strong opposition. I do so today, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise. 
   Just under 4 months ago, in 435 separate elections, the men and women we represent in this Congress took part in a democratic process not unlike others that have come before it. Whether on paper ballots or by electronic voting, through absentee ballots, or at the polls on election day itself, they cast their votes and registered their voices. No one was looking over their shoulders when they did it. And unless they chose to discuss it on their own, no one needed to know for whom they cast their ballots ever. 
   The privacy and sanctity of the secret ballot is the beauty and the backbone of this democratic process. And it is a right, not a privilege, that has become so customary that we probably have grown to take it for granted. 
   The results of the election led to a change in the majority of this Chamber and on the other side of the building as well. And we have accepted it because we know when the ballots were cast, they were done so in a way we can all trust, privately and secretly, free from coercion. The people spoke, and as we move through this debate today, let none of us forget this: We are standing on this floor, considering this bill, and ultimately casting our votes at the end of the debate because of the power of the secret ballot. 
   Not one voter signed a card to send us here. None of us sent our campaign workers out to voters' houses armed with candidate information, a stack of authorization cards, a pen and a great, or possibly threatening, sales pitch. No. We trusted democracy. We trusted the voters to cast their ballots like adults, freely, openly, without intimidation, and we live with the results. 
   So here we are, amazingly, but given the agenda the new majority and the special interests that helped it get here, not surprisingly, poised to advance legislation to kill a secret ballot process enjoyed by many of the same men and women who sent us here last November. 
   Let's be clear right at the outset. Every American has the right to organize. No one is debating that. Even if some on the other side of the aisle would like this debate to be mischaracterized as just that. This is a right we believe in so strongly we have codified it and made it possible for workers to do in the exact same way they elect their President, their Representatives of Congress, their Governors, their State legislatures, their local government, that is, through a secret ballot. 
   Think about that. So fundamental and so sacred is the right to organize that we have guaranteed and protected in through the same process we elect our Commander in Chief and the 535 men and women who hold the power of the purse. 
   Through the last 7-plus decades, that right has remained firmly intact. And in spite of occasional and admitted difficulties for which the law has built-in safeguards, workers have relied upon it. 
   In the 1950s, about 35 percent of all workers chose to unionize. In the early eighties, that number slipped to about 20 percent. And last year it dipped to 12 percent; and a meager 7 percent in the private sector alone. However, regardless of the percentage of workers choosing to unionize, regardless of upward or downward trends for organized labor, there has been one constant, the right to a private ballot. 
   That is really what today's debate is all about. That right is squarely in the cross hairs, and this Chamber is about to pull the trigger. Some of us will be tempted to make this a business-versus-labor debate. Others may equate joining the union through a card check to joining the Republican or Democratic Party as if a person doesn't join one of those parties with the intention to vote in secret ballot elections that really count. And still, others may incorrectly claim that the bill before us still provides the right to a secret ballot, a myth put to rest by a Clinton-appointed National Labor Relations Board official in an Education and Labor Subcommittee hearing last month. 
   Those are all distractions to what is really happening today. Brimming with hypocrisy and bluster, falsely defending free choice and workers rights, an untold number of duly-elected Members of the United States Congress will pull out their voting cards today, cards they are entitled to only because of a secret ballot election held less than 4 months ago and cast an historic vote against workplace democracy and against the secret ballot. 
   Last month, I took an oath in which I solemnly swore that I would bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States. Madam Chairwoman, because of that, I will not be one casting a vote in favor of this bill today. I urge my colleagues also to vote against it. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Minnesota, and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control the time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This debate has been exactly as we expected it would be, provocative, passionate, and, yes, quite predictable. After all, the script that was written many, many years ago by special interests chomping at the bit to see this bill come to the floor, and as we near its conclusion they won't be disappointed. They have gotten the payback they have long sought. 
   When you strip away all the statistics, all the rhetoric, all the letters to foreign governments, and all the talking points, this debate comes down to a basic struggle between those defending democracy and those defending hypocrisy. Those opposing this bill do so because it offends the very concept of democracy itself. It undermines it in the workplace, and it turns its back on those who count on it when they expect to have their privacy protected when it matters most. 
   On the other hand, those supporting this measure find themselves defending the staggering record of hypocrisy that card check proponents have amassed through the years. They have struggled to explain how a card check is inherently prone to intimidation some of the time, just not all of the time. They have attempted to square their self-proclaimed title of ``protectors of the working class'' with their support of a bill that strips the working class of one of its most fundamental rights of all, the right to vote. And they have grappled with their staunch support of a bill purported to safeguard free choice when it actually eviscerates it. 
   The last point is perhaps the most important of all, and on this question, card check supporters never have had a consistent or rational answer: How exactly does this bill protect free choice? When you sign a card, everyone knows how you voted, and right away. Your co-workers, your boss, the union organizers, and the union bosses. Anyone associated with that unionization drive knows exactly how you came down on the issue. And once that vote is exposed for all the world to see, there is no turning back. And that is not free choice, not in this country, anyway. 
   You know, we have agreed that there could be intimidation from both sides. The secret ballot is the only way to free people from any intimidation. 
   I would like to conclude by inserting in the Record an editorial that was in The Los Angeles Times, not noted for being a conservative newspaper today. They ran an editorial titled, ``Keep Union Ballots Secret.'' Doing away with voting secrecy would give unions too much power over workers. Unions once supported the secret ballot for organization elections. They were right then and are wrong now. Unions have every right to a fair hearing, and the National Labor Relations Board should be more vigilant about attempts by employers to game the system. In the end, however, whether to unionize is up to the workers. A secret ballot ensures that their choice will be a free one. 
   Vote against this bill today to take away that right of the workers of America.

   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of her amendment. I thank her for her effort in bringing this amendment to the floor. 
   This amendment was crafted with a simple principle in mind. If a worker wants to be free of union solicitation, he or she should have the free choice to ask not to be contacted. During our committee debate, it was said by several Members on the other side of the aisle that the men and women making union decisions are adults and should be left to make up their own minds without outside interference. 
   I totally agree, and that is why this amendment is so important. It provides the opportunity, real free choice, the choice of whether to listen to and engage in union organizers or to tell them to leave you alone. Much like the highly popular Do Not Call list, which places the power in the consumers' hands, this amendment places the power in the workers' hands, where it should be; and I urge its adoption.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   While serving in the House, our former colleague, Congressman Charlie Norwood, was a tireless advocate for the right to vote through a private ballot, and he introduced this legislative language last month as the Secret Ballot Protection Act. I offer this amendment with Charlie in mind. 
   The Secret Ballot Protection Act would insure that an employee has the right to a private ballot, free from intimidation and coercion. By contrast, the so-called ``Employee Free Choice Act'' would take away that right and make every employee's vote completely and utterly public to everyone. 
   A private ballot insures that no one knows who you voted, not your colleagues, not your employer, and not the union organizer. This is a fundamental democratic right our constituents enjoyed last November, and it is a fundamental democratic right that Americans have come to expect. That right should never be taken away from them, whether at a polling place, in a congressional election, or in the workplace. 
   Polls of union members confirm that they agree that the fairest way to decide to unionize is through a secret ballot election. For example, according to a poll conducted a few years ago, 71 percent of union members agreed that the current secret ballot process is fair. And 78 percent of union members said that Congress should keep the existing secret ballot election process in place and not replace it with another process. 
   And earlier this year, another poll was released demonstrating the same type of strong support for secret ballot elections among all Americans. 87 percent of those polled agree that ``every worker should continue to have the right to a federally supervised secret ballot election when deciding whether to organize a union.'' And as a result, 79 percent oppose the so-called ``Employee Free Choice Act.'' 
   The Supreme Court also agrees that a secret ballot is the best way to determine support for a union in the workplace. The 1969 Gissel Packing decision states a secret ballot election is the ``most satisfactory, indeed, preferred method of ascertaining whether a union has majority support.'' 
   Unions agree too. In fact, they have passionately insisted on a secret ballot election in decertification elections. In those instances, they called the secret ballot a ``solemn'' occasion, imperative to preserving ``privacy and independence.'' 
   And yes, even some sponsors of the underlying bill agree, according to their now infamous 2001 letter to Mexican labor officials. In that letter, they stated very plainly that the ``secret ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure workers are not intimidated.'' And I couldn't agree more. 
   Madam Chairwoman, this amendment is offered in exactly that spirit, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Chairman, I appreciate the debate that we have had here today. I think everybody at this point understands, as Mr. Gohmert just reminded us, I remember learning as a young student in school, when they had us put our heads down on the desk and vote for class president, it was secret ballot. 
   As Mr. Blunt reminded us, we used to have open ballots, and about 100 years ago it was changed to secret ballot. Now the Democratic Party is trying to reverse that and take away from workers rights their opportunity for a secret ballot. 
   We need to vote against this bill. Vote for this amendment and against the underlying bill.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, it defies logic that anyone who lives in this Nation illegally and works here illegally is able to decide whether legal workers must join a union. 
   But under current law, unions can obtain signatures during card check campaigns without differentiating between whether they were signed by legal or illegal workers. This motion to recommit simply requires that the union conducting a card check demonstrates that any card presented for recognition be signed by a U.S. citizen or legal alien. 
   This is especially important because under the so-called Employee Free Choice Act, the card check would become the law of the land, and literally it would allow union bosses to pick and choose which workers they believe can be most easily pressured into joining the union. 
   The bottom line, Madam Speaker, is those illegally working in this country should not be pressured into making major decisions such as those involving unionization that will only serve to further erode the free choice of workers who are lawfully here. 
   I commend the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) for offering this amendment before the Rules Committee yesterday.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I rise in strong support of this bill to support our brave student soldiers. 
   The men and women of the Armed Forces give selflessly to defend our freedom overseas and respond to emergencies here at home. Some of them are also students pursuing the dream of a college education, just like millions of other Americans. These military personnel volunteer to put their educational pursuits on hold so they can serve the Nation. We owe them a debt of gratitude, and the least we can do is make their transition to and from education as seamless as possible. 
   I would like to recognize the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline) for his long-standing commitment to the legislation before us. He had an outstanding career with the U.S. Marine Corps before coming to Congress, and I want to thank him also for his service there. He has championed passage of this bill on a temporary basis since 2003, and he is here today supporting a permanent extension of this measure to ensure members of the military will always be afforded the flexibility and support they need. 
   This bill has always received support from our friends on the other side of the aisle, and I am pleased to have key members of the Education and Labor Committee joining us in introducing legislation to extend the flexibility and waiver authority in this bill. I want to thank Chairmen MILLER and HINOJOSA, along with Mr. Sestak, who also had a very distinguished career in the Navy, and it is good to see Navy and Marines still working together, for introducing legislation that as we propose makes this legislation permanent. 
   The men and women of our Armed Forces have made considerable sacrifices for our Nation, and for that we are grateful. As members of the Education Committee, we also recognize the importance of a higher education system that is accessible. What this bill does is allow the Secretary of Education to accommodate the unique needs of our student soldiers so that higher education remains flexible and accessible while they serve our country. 
   Once again, I would like to thank Representative Kline for his leadership and recognize our friends on the other side of the aisle for their continued support of this legislation. I strongly support the permanent extension of the HEROES Act to support the many heroes protecting our freedom, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes.''

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2768, SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Since the 110th Congress was gaveled into session, not a single bill within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Education and Labor has been considered under an open rule. Sadly, today's bill is no exception. Nonetheless, I do want to thank the majority for making the Republican substitute in order. I believe the S-MINER Act is fundamentally flawed and cannot be fixed with discrete amendments. As such, anything short of the Republican substitute will only result in cosmetic changes to a bill whose flaws run much deeper. 
   Each of us recognizes the importance of mine safety. The individuals who work in mines supply the energy that powers this Nation. Their job is dangerous, yet vital, and keeping them safe is critical. 
   Our commitment to mine safety is nothing new. In fact, it was nearly 2 years ago that we first took up the MINER Act in an effort to implement the most comprehensive reforms to mine safety in a generation. That bill enjoyed broad bipartisan support as well as the backing of both labor and industry. 
   The MINER Act was signed into law just a year and a half ago, and already it is producing major changes in the operation of our Nation's mines. The law included an aggressive implementation timetable, and the mining community has acted quickly to embrace the law and make its required changes. Our committee has monitored implementation of the MINER Act in order to ensure it is quickly and effectively put into place. There should be no question about our commitment to mine safety. Yet, here we are today to consider a bill that in many ways ignores the progress that has been made. 
   At best, the S-MINER Act is premature. The 2006 MINER Act has not yet been given the chance to take root, with many of its reforms still being developed by MSHA and those in the field. At worst, the S-MINER Act could actually derail ongoing progress by sending regulators and the mining community back to square one on many critical safety issues. 
   I would like to quote from an article published by the Lexington, Kentucky Herald-Leader by Rick Honaker, Mining Foundation distinguished professor and chairman of the University of Kentucky department of mining engineering: 
   ``But now it seems very strange, almost incomprehensible, that a move is afoot in Congress to impose an entirely new set of requirements on coal mine operators and mine inspectors even before there has been an opportunity to comply with the far-reaching provisions of the MINER Act. It threatens to disrupt the all-important emergency rescue provisions of the law. Simply put, additional legislation now serves no useful purpose.'' 
   Madam Speaker, Republicans have developed an alternative to the S-MINER Act that we believe strikes the appropriate balance between strengthening mine safety and maintaining the  widely supported reforms enacted less than 2 years ago. First and foremost, our substitute underscores the importance of the MINER Act reforms and restates our commitment to seeing them implemented fully and forcefully. In addition to supporting these strong reforms, our substitute goes further to protect miners by allowing them to be full participants in the safety process. 
   During the Education and Labor Committee's consideration of this bill, Representative Kline offered an amendment that would have taken meaningful steps to enhance mine safety, without jeopardizing work already under way. That amendment, like our substitute, would empower miners by directly engaging them in the development of safety policies and procedures through the formation of safety teams. Currently, nonunionized miners may be prohibited from working with management to promote safety through teams. 
   To further protect miners, our substitute would enhance the MINER Act reforms by fostering communication between MSHA and the Bureau of Land Management; studying the conditions the next generation of miners will face with deep mine conditions, as well as fostering a better understanding of retreat mining using pillar removal; and clarifying information dissemination in the event of a tragedy. 
   Lastly, we would implement a testing program for illegal substances. This would not only protect those in the mines, but also identify miners who are struggling with addiction and in need of help. The States of Virginia and Kentucky have already implemented this safety measure, and miners have been protected because of it. 
   Madam Speaker, I cannot help but notice that the amendment offered by the distinguished chairman of the committee also includes a provision to address the issue of drug abuse among miners. I also cannot help but notice that this provision was inserted at the very last possible minute, several hours after the deadline for amendments to the Rules Committee. I hope this 11th-hour acknowledgement of the crippling problem of drug abuse among miners is a signal of genuine interest in addressing the issue. Unfortunately, by providing only a study rather than a strong testing program like that called for by Republicans, this gesture rings hollow. 
   Madam Speaker, although the rule makes in order a strong Republican alternative, it remains flawed because it allows consideration of a bill that should not pass.     
   The S-MINER Act abandons bipartisan mine safety reforms and replaces stakeholder expertise with bureaucratic Washington mandates that threaten mine workers' jobs. I urge a ``no'' vote.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of mine safety and in opposition to this bill, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The men and women who work in and around our Nation's mines are often unrecognized for the integral role they play in powering our country. These individuals work hard, in difficult and often dangerous conditions, to unearth the raw materials that each of us relies upon in our day-to-day lives. 
   While mining is inherently dangerous, there are steps we can take to mitigate that risk. For that reason, mine safety has been an ongoing priority both legislatively and within the context of oversight. 
   Although our commitment to mine safety is constant, we also recognize that new mandates from Washington translate into major changes within the operation of our Nation's mines. For that reason, we do not and we must not take a piecemeal approach to mine reform. Rather, we should develop thoughtful, comprehensive consensus reforms, and then give those reforms a chance to work. I am pleased to say that we did just that less than 2 years ago. In 2006, Congress passed the MINER Act which required MSHA to revise its penalties, increase penalties for major violations, undertake several studies regarding mining practices, and work to improve the technology for communications underground. The MINER Act received strong bipartisan, bicameral support. It was backed by both industry and labor, and its reforms were understood to be the most significant in a generation. 
   With the MINER Act, we called on the mining industry to overhaul itself, to develop and implement new technologies, and to comply with strong new protections that were to be developed by the experts. This type of transformation cannot take place overnight; but let there be no doubt, change is well under way. 
   Mr. Chairman, I fear that with this bill before us, we run a very real risk of derailing that progress and returning to square one on many critical mine safety issues. H.R. 2768 ignores the safety guidelines being developed through expert research and review, and replaces them with arbitrary new mandates established by Congress. This bill makes an end run around the regulatory process, shutting stakeholders out. 
   Simply put, the S-MINER Act abandons the mine safety momentum of the MINER Act and sends us back to the drawing board. 
   I appreciate Chairman Miller's concern about the dangers faced by our Nation's miners, and I share his desire to see strong reforms in place that will promote safety. That is why Republicans will offer a substitute amendment that would accomplish exactly that. 
   The Wilson/Kline amendment will balance successful implementation of the 2006 MINER Act with a number of mine safety enhancements. I look forward to supporting that amendment when it is offered, because it provides a real opportunity to promote mine safety without backing away from the progress that has been made. 
   In addition to the Republican substitute, we will consider a number of other amendments today, including one to be offered by Chairman Miller. I would be remiss, however, if I did not point out the rather transparent political expediency of one portion of that amendment. 
   Included in the Republican substitute is a proposal to implement mandatory drug testing within the mining industry. A similar proposal was offered by the late Charlie Norwood, our colleague from Georgia, who was a stalwart on this issue. The ravaging impact of drug abuse among miners came into sharp focus this past weekend, when the front page of the Washington Post carried a story of miners who struggle with addiction to pain killers. We believe that mandatory drug testing is the most effective and, indeed, the only way to immediately address the prevalence of drug abuse that is putting miners' lives at risk. 
   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, however, appear to have discovered the devastation of drug abuse among miners only late yesterday afternoon. At that time, several hours after the deadline for submitting amendments, the chairman was permitted to resubmit a revised version of his manager's package that included a hastily drafted study of drug abuse among miners. While this amendment may offer a fig leaf now that the issue of drug abuse can no longer be ignored, it should not be mistaken for a legitimate attempt to deter drug abuse in the way that testing would. 
   Mr. Chairman, the S-MINER Act is fundamentally flawed. It brings the progress of the 2006 MINER Act to a jarring halt, creating instead a package of new prescriptive mandates from Washington. The bill imposes $1 billion in unfunded mandates on the mining community, placing the jobs of miners in jeopardy. This bill is the wrong answer at the wrong time for our Nation's miners. There is a better way. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Today we've heard a great deal about how to keep miners safe. It should go without saying that mine safety is the proposition to which we're all committed. However, we're not here today debating whether to protect miners. Instead, we're here considering a bill that would actually derail the most comprehensive mine safety overhaul in decades. 
   All of us are for mine safety. You know, during this campaign, I have been listening to some of the candidates running, and I think the feeling amongst many people is that Washington is broken and that we don't seem to attack things that are really important. 
   Well, in 2006, we passed a miner safety bill, the first one in 30 years. That was passed with the support of 381 Members to 37 Members here in the House and unanimously in the Senate. 
   Now here we are less than 2 years later talking about another bill that's going to, after a 30-year hiatus, we pass a bill, we're doing what we can to implement that bill. By the time regulations are written, by the time people are trained on enforcing those regulations, by the time the mine owners put those regulations into effect, it takes some time, and then here we're stepping on that bill with a new approach to change some things. 
   And we heard from Mr. Wilson the President's response and why he says we should give the time to fully implement the bill that was just passed less than 2 years ago. It makes sense. We live in a large country, and to try to disseminate this information and get it all into effect takes some time, and we're just saying that's why people think Washington's broke. We're stepping on something that we haven't even implemented yet. 
   And I don't question any motives because I think the motives are good. We should be out to protect miners. It's just which way will protect them best: implementing the bill that was already passed overwhelmingly or trying to pass a bill that will step on some of those concerns. 
   This law was only given 1 1/2 years to take hold, as mentioned. It's already having an impact on our Nation's mines. Stringent safety standards are being put in place and they're being enforced. A recent article in a mining industry publication explored the impact on the mines as seen from the eyes of a miner. 
   He says, ``As you can imagine, the regulatory environment for safety has  evolved a lot in the last few months, and we're seeing as much as a 50 percent increase in underground mine inspections on an annualized basis.'' That's the words of a miner to an analyst.     
   With all the progress that has been made, it seems to me that the last thing we should be considering is the disruption of that momentum, yet that's exactly what will happen if the S-MINER Act becomes law. This bill discards the expert studies already under way, replacing the wisdom and recommendations of professionals with arbitrary mandates from Washington. 
   Although the bill purports to protect miners, in reality it threatens the jobs we rely on. That's another thing that I'm learning, that people are very interested in the economy and jobs, and here we have an effort that probably will cut jobs. With $1 billion in unfunded mandates in the underlying bill, the majority's attempt to mask these burdensome costs by extending the implementation timeline is a weak attempt to divert attention from the toll that will be taken on the mining community. 
   Mr. Chairman, as a strong supporter of mine safety, I want to be clear that there is a better way to protect the interests of the Nation's miners. We can stand for strong safety protections without diverting attention and resources from the work already under way. Later today, Representatives Wilson and Kline will offer an amendment to do exactly that. The Wilson/Kline amendment incorporates a strong drug testing requirement that will protect miners from the dangers of illegal substance abuse in the already dangerous mining environment. 
   I am pleased to see our colleagues on the other side of the aisle joining us in our concern about the danger and devastation of drug use among miners. I am saddened, however, by the appearance of cynicism in the last-minute addition of this issue to the manager's package. I hope they will join us in supporting a real solution in the form of drug testing, something that our colleague, Charlie Norwood, who passed away last year, had been working on for years before, rather than a mere study that provides more political cover than genuine safety protections. 
   Despite the best intentions of its sponsors, this bill will do much more harm than good. It will layer new rules and requirements on top of the critical mine safety reforms already in place. With this bill, we are abandoning the bipartisan reforms of the 2006 MINER Act and abandoning all the progress that has been made. 
   Members on both sides of the aisle have expressed concern that this legislation is premature. A group of seven respected Democrats representing districts with a history of underground and surface mining wrote to the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee to urge us to proceed with caution. From them I quote: ``We believe that before moving forward on new mine safety legislation, it would be prudent for the committee to wait for the conclusion of the studies called for in the MINER Act and the implementation of all the major requirements of the MINER Act.'' They were right. The academic experts are right. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission is right. The National Mining Association is right. Each of these stakeholders understands that the S-MINER Act is the wrong bill at the wrong time. 
   As a strong supporter of mine safety, I have no choice but to oppose this bill. I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, the S-MINER Act was first introduced nearly 7 months ago. It was voted on in the Education Committee more than 2 months ago. Yet in all this time this bill has been under consideration, the critical issue of drug testing was not inserted until the second try on the manager's amendment, submitted after yesterday's deadline. Forgive me if I am skeptical that we would have been given the same opportunity to revise our amendment at the last minute if we had sought to do so. Nevertheless, the amendment now before us replaces the previous version of the legislation, and it deserves our thorough review. 
   I want to thank Chairman Miller for recognizing some of the flaws in the S-MINER Act and attempting to address them. The amendment includes some modest improvements, including an extension in the timeline for installation of the new generation of fire-resistant conveyor belts. At the same time, I am troubled by the proposal to limit the ability of mine operators to comply with breathable air requirements. With the ongoing backlog of the SCSRs, the breathing device required in mines, today we demand mine operators to, at a minimum, offer a purchase order to demonstrate their effort to comply with the requirement. 
   By preventing mine operators from producing proof of SCSR purchases as evidence of compliance, this amendment could push mines across the country out of compliance, despite their proven effort to comply with the requirement in the only way possible. What would the penalty be for the Nation's mines being deemed noncompliant? Would these mines be shut down, leaving miners without work? What possible rationale could there be for threatening mine workers' jobs as they struggle with today's economic pressures just because there aren't companies that have the ability to produce these required instruments? 
   Similarly, but perhaps even more troubling, the amendment imposes the same backwards logic on the new requirement for possible refuge chambers. On the one hand, it mandates that mines have these refuge chambers in order to operate. On the other hand, it makes clear that mines which purchase the chambers but through no fault of their own must wait for them to be manufactured, will be unable to operate without this very specific and widely unavailable product. 
   The majority knows that portable refuge chambers will have a production backlog of years. They also know that  in being so specific as to mandate portable refuge chambers with no alternative, this provision guarantees that mines will be shut down while waiting for the product to be manufactured. I don't know if that is the goal, to shut down mines, but that will be the net result. 
   On the issue of drug testing, while I question the last-minute addition of this proposal, I appreciate the belated acknowledgment that drug abuse in the mining community is a significant problem that demands action. Unfortunately, this amendment offers little in the way of action. Instead of immediately implementing a drug testing program, this amendment calls for a study. We don't need a study to tell us whether drug abuse is a problem in the mines. All you need to do is pick up the front page of The Washington Post Sunday edition and read about it. 
   At this time I would like to submit this article, written by Nick Miroff, into the Record. You will see the pervasiveness of this problem.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I really want to thank Congressman Boucher for his effort to address this problem of drug use among miners. I think it's very, very important. I would even go so far as to say if this bill doesn't show much progress, if you brought this up as a separate bill, I'd be happy to work with you on it. 
   This amendment takes an important first step by acknowledging the problem and establishing opportunities for treatment. This amendment is a positive first step, but it does not go far enough. 
   To complement the Boucher amendment, Republicans are proposing a strong framework for mandatory drug testing. We want to ensure that miners are tested and those who are under the influence are prevented from entering the mines and putting their own lives and the lives of their coworkers at risk. 
   Drug abuse among miners is a serious problem, and according to recent media accounts, it is also a widespread problem. Already States are taking the lead on stringent testing initiatives to protect miners from the hazards that come from combining substance abuse and the dangerous work environment. The Federal Government needs to catch up on what is being done in the States. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Republican proposal to implement drug testing. At this time I also urge passage of the Boucher amendment as an acknowledgment of the problem and an important first step toward resolving it.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, the Ellsworth amendment, as it has been explained, would modify the collection of fines to provide relief to those mine operators who pay their fines in a timely fashion. At the same time, it establishes a trust fund so that fines collected will be used for inspections and investigations. The amendment also creates a list of those mine operators who do not pay their fines, shining a spotlight to help promote payment in a timely fashion. 
   Unlike the underlying bill, this amendment would not do anything to inhibit implementation of the bipartisan MINER Act of 2006. Because this amendment offers positive reforms without dismantling the mine safety improvements under way, I am pleased to support its passage.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in strong support of the Wilson/Kline amendment to preserve bipartisan mine safety reforms. 
   The S-MINER Act is based on a flawed premise. It begins by abandoning the widely supported mine safety reforms enacted in 2006. Rather than building on the progress that has been made, the S-MINER Act brings those bipartisan reforms to a screeching halt. 
   Republicans have a better way. The Wilson/Kline amendment strikes the appropriate balance between strengthening mine safety and maintaining the widely supported reforms enacted less than 2 years ago. 
   First and foremost, the substitute underscores the importance of the MINER Act reforms and restates our commitment to seeing them implemented fully and forcefully. Our substitute builds on those reforms rather than tearing them down. 
   Among the most important steps taken in the Republican substitute is the effort to fully, more fully engage the miners in mine safety. During the Education and Labor Committee's consideration of this bill, Representative Kline offered an amendment that, like our substitute, would empower miners by directly involving them in the development of safety policies and procedures through the formation of safety teams. Currently, nonunionized miners may be prohibited from working with management to promote safety through teams. 
   Mine safety is too important an issue to fall victim to the politics of unionization. Every miner should have the opportunity to work cooperatively with the mine operator to promote their own safety and the safety of those with them in the mines. 
   To further protect miners, the Republican substitute calls for a strong program of drug testing. In fact, the Republican plan is the only proposal that offers drug testing. Representative Boucher is proposing drug rehabilitation, an important first step, but one that will be incomplete without testing. Indeed, Representative Boucher's own State of Virginia has taken a leadership role on requiring drug testing in the mines, something the Federal Government should require as well. 
   Sadly, the proposal offered in the manager's package would do even less, calling for just a study of drug abuse among miners. No one here seems to object to drug testing for professional baseball players. An entire hearing was devoted to the topic of drug use in Major League Baseball just yesterday, yet not a single hearing has been held to explore the problem of drug abuse among miners. And when our friend, the late Representative Charlie Norwood, had the courage to call for drug testing in miners in years past, he was rebuked for daring to draw attention to this pervasive problem. 
   I am pleased we are finally acknowledging this problem among miners, but I want to be clear; anything short of the Republican plan for drug testing fails to fully protect miners. 
   Finally, our substitute recognizes some of the very specific issues brought to light with the tragic collapse of the Crandall Canyon Mine in August of 2007. To address those issues, it would improve communication between MSHA and the Bureau of Land Management, study the conditions the next generation of miners will face with deep mine conditions and retreat mining using pillar removal, and clarify how information is to be disseminated in the event of a tragedy. 
   I urge my colleagues to preserve bipartisan mine safety reforms by supporting the Wilson/Kline amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today we are continuing the debate on H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008. This bill is a first step to prevent a crisis before it happens in the student loan program, and its consideration has come not a minute too soon. Peak lending season begins in July, and we cannot, we must not, wait until a student is denied a loan to put mechanisms in place to deal with the turmoil in the student loan market. 
   To date, 60 lenders have suspended their participation in all or part of the FFEL program. This includes 10 nonprofit State loan agencies affecting students in Pennsylvania, Texas, Colorado, Iowa, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire and Minnesota. These are not minor players exiting the program. Nine out of the top 10 consolidation lenders have stopped offering these loans, while 20 out of the top 100 originators have stopped making Stafford and PLUS loans. These 60 lenders account for 13 percent of the total Stafford and PLUS loan volume and 76 percent of total consolidation loan volume. 
   In fiscal year 2006, these lenders originated more than $6.5 billion in Stafford and PLUS loans to more than 800,000 students and parents, and more than $55 billion in consolidation loans to more than 1.8 million borrowers. 
   The bill before us includes necessary reforms to ensure the Department of Education can respond if students have access problems as lending season gets underway. First, it will allow students to receive additional financing that will help them stay in school if they are denied private, nonfederal loans. Second, the bill clarifies aspects of the Lender of Last Resort program, easing participation for students and schools and ensuring funds will be available should they become necessary. Third, the bill ensures that lenders have the authority to provide PLUS loans to struggling parents who are facing difficulties with their home mortgage. And, fourth, the bill grants new flexibility for parents with a new optional grace period that permits parents to defer PLUS loan payments until after the children graduate. 
   Finally, the bill authorizes the Department of Education to invest in or agree to the future purchase of outstanding loans which could free up capital and allow lenders to make new loans in the upcoming school year. 
   I want to thank the chairman for moving very rapidly on this situation. That's not our modus operandi around here; generally we wait until we're in the middle of a crisis to fix this. I hope that I'm wrong in thinking that there may be a crisis coming, but I think it is very appropriate to take these positive steps to ease or prevent a problem that could arise very shortly. 
   I again thank the chairman for his efforts. He has not been well this week, but you wouldn't notice it. He shows up at every meeting, and he has worked very hard. I hope he takes some time over the weekend to get some rest and gets feeling better for next week. 
   I strongly support this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to vote for it. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Our economy is struggling, families are dealing with a higher cost of living, rising fuel costs, a struggling mortgage market, and the threat of higher taxes. The cost of a college education continues to rise, only now students and families are wondering whether they'll be able to get the loans they need to pay their tuition bills. 
   Like most challenges to our economy, there's no easy answer to the difficulties in our student loan programs. We will need a combination of actions, maybe some legislatively, others through regulation, that will increase liquidity and restore confidence among investors and consumers. 
   This bill is a first step and one that deserves bipartisan support. It signals our commitment to a strong Federal family education loan program and should help ease the minds of students and families, and it does these things without a single cost to the taxpayer. 
   I want to again thank Chairman Miller for his leadership and bipartisan cooperation on this legislation. I would also like to recognize Representatives RUB&#201;N HINOJOSA and RIC KELLER, the chairman and senior Republican on the Higher Education Subcommittee, for their role in making this legislation a reality. 
   The staff deserves special recognition for their efforts to bring this bill to the floor so quickly. On my staff I would like to thank Amy Jones along with Susan Ross and Sally Stroup; on Chairman Miller's staff, Gaby Gomez, Julie Radocchia, and Jeff Appel. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill is a positive first step. It's good for students and families, it's good for taxpayers, and it's good for our economy. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank Chairman Miller for his work on this amendment. Like the underlying bill, this amendment was developed on a bipartisan basis to respond to some of the very specific challenges facing our student loan program. Although many of the challenges in this amendment are technical in nature, they will help to perfect the bill and ensure it has the impact we intend. 
   For instance, the purpose of this bill has never been to force a shift from the FFEL program to the Direct Loan program. That's why the amendment clarifies that if the Secretary of Education does purchase outstanding  loans, she can keep those loans with their existing servicing arrangements. This will ensure a seamless transition for students while having the intended effect of freeing up capital to make new loans. 
   The amendment also ensures the bill will have no cost to taxpayers. From the outset Chairman Miller and I agreed that it was important to move a bill that made meaningful reforms without driving up spending. H.R. 5715 does exactly that. 
   With regard to the Lender of Last Resort program, the amendment clarifies some of the steps that must be taken in order to designate school-wide participation in this program. These reforms will be enhanced even further by the amendment that will be offered shortly by Representative Petri. 
   I appreciate Chairman Miller's willingness to include language proposed by Representative Platts that adds greater clarity and flexibility within the Secretary's ability to purchase loans. Although it was always our intent that this new, temporary authority would include the concept of a ``forward purchase agreement,'' this amendment makes it explicit that the Secretary can enter into agreements to purchase loans in the future. The amendment also clarifies that lenders must reinvest the proceeds from the sale of loans to the Secretary back into making new loans to students. 
   Once again, I want to thank Chairman Miller for his work on this amendment and on the bill as a whole. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this commonsense amendment. 
   The Lender of Last Resort program was never intended to serve as a bailout for our student loan system as a whole. Rather, it was developed as a backstop for individual students on a case-by-case basis to be able to access a student loan if they encountered some rare circumstance in which they could not borrow through the standard channels.  
   I, for one, hope that the broad-based Lender of Last Resort authority in this bill will never be used. After all, the goal of this legislation is to prevent such a crisis within the loan program before it occurs. But I appreciate the steps being taken to ensure that if the Lender of Last Resort program ever needs to be deployed on a larger scale, we will have the infrastructure and processes in place to allow it. 
   However, because the program was simply never intended to be used on a school-wide basis, we should ensure that in implementing this authority, we are not unintentionally subverting current regulations. We also want to ensure that a guaranty agency is not unnecessarily punished for stepping in as a lender if needed. That is why this amendment requests that the Secretary review the regulations with the Lender of Last Resort program in mind. This program should be implemented in a manner that will be effective, efficient, and in the best interest of students. 
   I want to thank Representative Petri for offering this amendment, which requires the Secretary to ensure that regulations are updated to reflect the new responsibilities that would be given to guaranty agencies operating as a lender of last resort for entire schools rather than individual students.     
   This amendment is consistent with our longstanding support for greater sunshine, transparency and consumer protections. 
   I support this amendment, and I urge its passage.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his longstanding commitment to addressing the rising costs of college. 
   This amendment gets to the heart of the concern that many of us have harbored for a long time. It takes a hard look at whether or not an increase in Federal aid will lead to an increase in college tuition. Everyone recognizes that Federal student aid is a good investment. Pell Grants, together with campus-based aid programs, Federal student loans and other higher education benefits help make a college education accessible to every American student. 
   With enactment of the Higher Education Act in 1965, these financial aid programs truly did make college more affordable. But beginning in the eighties and in the decades since, college tuition has skyrocketed. Despite our best efforts to keep pace by investing in student aid, college is becoming less affordable for many families. Tuition goes up, so we increase financial aid. But when we increase financial aid, tuition goes up. It's a vicious cycle. And we are losing ground. 
   Unfortunately, this pattern has even led some of us to question whether an investment in financial aid is a wise one. After all, if we're driving tuition increases by, for instance, increasing loan limits, we may be doing more harm than good. 
   I think there's agreement that this bill will help borrowers by increasing unsubsidized borrowing limits. Particularly for borrowers who are unable to access higher-cost credit-based private loans, this additional Federal loan availability may be the difference between enrolling or not. But as we increase that type of financial aid, we need to very seriously review the consequences of that action. That's why this amendment calls on the Government Accountability Office to determine how the increase in borrowing limits impacts tuition. 
   I thank Representative Castle along with Representative Welch for their leadership on this issue. It's a good amendment. It improves the bill. I urge a ``yes'' vote.

   Mr. McKEON. I rise in support of the gentlelady's amendment, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The purpose of this bill is to address the unique challenges facing students and families in this time of economic  uncertainty. That is why the bill takes steps to ensure parents are not automatically denied a PLUS loan simply because they're struggling with the same mortgage troubles facing so many other families in the country. 
   This amendment is consistent with the spirit of our bill because it recognizes that families also may be grappling with medical bills. And as the chairman explained, sometimes you are hit with a bill, and that shows up as a liability which would put you out of reach of getting another loan, and, in fact, you may not have that liability. And until that is clarified, you are held in abeyance. And students can't wait. 
   So this is a very important amendment that the gentlelady has presented. I thank Representative Castor for her amendment. It makes the bill better. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill because of an abundantly flawed provision it contains. As the ranking member on the committee with jurisdiction over the Davis-Bacon Act, I am particularly concerned about the Davis-Bacon mandate in the bill before us today. I have these two basic concerns for two basic reasons: they represent both bad policy and bad process. 
   First on process: the Education and Labor Committee, again, the committee with jurisdiction over Davis-Bacon, never formally considered the bill's Davis-Bacon provision, not in a hearing, not in a markup, not in any procedure whatsoever. Rather, a simple exchange of letters with the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee rendered our committee colleagues powerless to weigh the impact of these provisions on the projects themselves, on local economies, and, indeed, on the American taxpayers. 
   The fact that Davis-Bacon wages rates have not applied to projects funded through the Clean Water Revolving Fund since 1995, a decision made by the  Clinton administration I might add, demonstrates that the change before us is not a small one and it is certainly not one that should be made without appropriate consideration by the committee of jurisdiction. 
   The second reason for my opposition to the provisions is much more basic. It is just bad policy. By inflating labor rates, Davis-Bacon typically increases the costs of Federal projects by anywhere from 5 to 38 percent. And who ends up paying for all this? That is right, the American taxpayers. 
   Furthermore, the costs of Davis-Bacon are particularly burdensome for small businesses. Literally, this mandate can saddle private companies with millions of dollars of excess administrative work every year, and because of economies of scale, small, locally owned businesses rarely if ever have the resources to comply with this Federal mandate. As a result, large companies are more often awarded government contracts, even for small projects. 
   Federal law should not have a built-in bias against small businesses, and I believe this assertion is reflected by President Bush's veto threat. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure because it is bad policy and bad process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   One week before the 110th Congress is scheduled to adjourn, we are devoting precious legislative hours to debating a noncontroversial bill to extend a minuscule environmental education program for 1 year. I think we all agree that environmental education is important now and for future generations, and I want to commend the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) for the work that he's done on this bill. I think, as he has eloquently stated, environmental education is very important. But how we spend our time in this Chamber is a reflection of our priorities, and today, our priorities are all wrong. 
   Chairman Miller and I work well together on the Education and Labor Committee, and we often reach agreements before bills are brought to the floor. On this bill, we worked together to resolve our differences, and we agreed that while important, this bill was straightforward and noncontroversial--most of our Members will vote for it--enough that it should be considered on the suspension calendar. I believe that two-thirds of this body would easily have supported the legislation, making these hours of debate unnecessary. 
   For whatever reason, whether to mask their continued failure to offer comprehensive energy solutions or simply to avoid a debate on the issue altogether, the majority has opted to bring this bill to the floor today under a rule. So let me just take a moment to reflect on H.R. 3036. 
   The Federal Government has a role to play in education. That role is to provide support and assistance to ensure that all children are provided a quality education. It is to support the academic achievement of disadvantaged children, children with disabilities, and other at-risk students who might otherwise be left behind. In pursuing these goals, we must be careful  not to create too much bureaucracy nor too many Federal programs that could undermine local control. 
   That's why I appreciate the efforts that were made to limit the scope of this bill, extending an existing program at the EPA and supplementing it with similar activities through the Department of Education rather than establishing a massive new environmental education bureaucracy as some had originally proposed.     
   This is a reasonable bill, and at the end of the day, I will support it. But, Mr. Chairman, if I had my choice, we would not be here debating this legislation today. Although environmental education is important, this Congress has a limited amount of time to challenge our mammoth problems facing this Nation. 
   As of a few minutes ago, when we found we won't be in session tomorrow, if we work all of next week, we will have 5 days left to finish the work of this Congress. Instead of tinkering around the edges of an existing environmental education program, we ought to be debating comprehensive, all-of-the-above approaches to reform our Nation's energy policy and put America on the path to energy independence. 
   Here we are, going into the last week of this Congress. We've been here 2 years, we only have now 13 days of work scheduled for the last 5 months of this year--and that, after our Democrat leadership, during the last election, said that we would be a harder working Congress, we would be a more open Congress, we would be one that would follow regular order, we would be open to the way this House was meant to function. 
   At this point, we have not passed one spending bill. The spending bills that were passed last year run out on September 30, the new year starts October 1, and not one spending bill to continue to fund the Government through the next year has yet been passed. We did pass one on this floor, but not one has been passed through the whole process--the House, the Senate, and been sent to the President's desk, not one spending bill. 
   I guess the people throughout the country will be watching and seeing what happens on October 1. Will the Government be shut down? I don't know. I don't know how they plan to solve this problem. I just know that at this point they have not brought one spending bill to completion for the President to sign. 
   We have not finished our work on this committee on No Child Left Behind. That was a very, very important piece of legislation. We worked on it last year. We haven't talked about it for over a year now. And I guess that's just going to be let go into next year, when a new Congress will be here. 
   I am greatly disappointed, Mr. Chairman, with the work product of this Congress. We had the ability. We had new leadership that came in with lots of promises, lots of enthusiasm, lots of things that were going to be done to make things better for the American public. The most important issue facing us today is the energy issue. Every one of us in America sees that every day when we fill our tanks or at least drive by the gas stations and see how the price has gone up--or maybe down a couple cents, depending, but it's a couple dollars more than it was when the Republicans were in charge here a couple years ago. 
   We had the opportunity this year, even this week, to address an all-of-the-above energy solution: More conservation, more alternative fuels, more biomass, more wind, more solar--yes, and more oil, more coal, more shale.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank Chairman Miller for offering this amendment, and Mr. Sarbanes for filling in. 
   This amendment clarifies that the Federal Government will not impose an environmental justice curriculum on our Nation's schools. This issue was debated during the committee consideration of the bill and it was an issue on which there was disagreement between the majority and the minority. I believe that the bill approved by our committee went too far in this regard because it could have required State and local officials to develop specific environmental justice curricula. 
   We have long believed that specific curricula--which is taught in individual classrooms--is best determined at the local level. And while this bill contains a broad prohibition on Federal curriculum development, I believe it was necessary to clarify the environmental justice language as well so that there would be no confusion as to what the Federal Government is or is not demanding of our schools. Chairman Miller worked closely with me to refine this language, and I want to thank him for his willingness to do so. 
   This amendment also contains some interesting language that was added earlier this week, presumably in response to efforts on our side of the aisle to ensure this bill does not ignore critical energy issues. 
   Republicans proposed amendments to advance the understanding of the environmental and economic benefits of clean coal and oil shale production, energy production in the ANWR, and energy production on the Outer Continental Shelf. We proposed amendments to advance the understanding of the environmental and economic benefits of nuclear power, and of American-made energy, and of the all-of-the-above energy strategy, which would increase production, promote conservation, and expand innovation. We think that each of these issues deserves a full and open debate because an all-of-the-above energy strategy does not ignore any aspect of energy reform.     
   Although our amendments were not made in order, I was pleased to see that the Miller amendment now includes language to ensure that environmental education programs include a discussion of the costs and benefits of oil and gas drilling, of nuclear power, of new coal technologies, and of renewable energy sources. While this language is not as strong and comprehensive as what the Republicans had offered, I appreciate its inclusion nonetheless. 
   The truth is we need to be talking about energy more, not less. We passed an energy bill earlier this week that won't increase energy production. We passed an energy bill that puts American resources under lock and key instead of opening them up to environmentally safe production that will create jobs and that will bring down energy prices. This sham of a bill that we passed raises taxes and stands to drive consumer prices up, not down. 
   So I'm glad we're going to be talking to our children about the benefits of American energy production. It's a conversation we should be having here in Congress as well. 
   Once again, I want to thank Chairman Miller for working with me to clarify the environmental justice aspect of this legislation, and I look forward to supporting this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The bill before us is about environmental education. Specifically, it is about teaching elementary and secondary students about the world in which they live, about the natural resources of our great Nation and about the stewardship of our environment and of our resources for the future. 
   This legislation provides grants to State and local education agencies, to institutions of higher education or to nonprofit organizations. The resources are targeted to ensure they will directly benefit students. This amendment, as I understand it, would make ``municipalities eligible for these grants as well.'' Unfortunately, that term is not defined, leaving open to interpretation just exactly how far we would be expanding this program. 
   Without a clear and narrow definition, this amendment could open up the funding to any number of entities, including cities, townships, districts or county governments, to name just a few. In other words, this amendment opens the limited resources under the bill to organizations that may or may not provide the direct services to students that we're seeking. 
   I support local control and local partnerships. That's why I support the Courtney amendment, which allows partnerships with State and local park departments. Through that model, we provide grants directly to educational organizations, which can then partner with the local organizations we're talking about now that can enrich the environmental education experience. 
   I understand what the gentleman is trying to accomplish with this amendment, and I'd like to work with him to see if we can get there, but at this time, I'm opposed to this amendment because it's not clear enough about prioritizing funds for educational entities that provide direct services to students. I know that the majority is working with us to clarify the definition of ``municipality.'' 
   As this bill moves forward, I look forward to working with them to ensure we do not dilute the limited resources of this program away from the students they're intended for. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. I appreciate the gentleman. As I said, I appreciate his amendment, and I appreciate his effort in this regard. 
   This points out, once again, to me that we have a large country with 435 congressional districts. Just within my congressional district, we have cities; we have counties; we have towns; we have towns that really don't have a government responsibility, but they're kind of granted that, and that's just in my district. I haven't had the opportunity to visit your district. I'm sure that in each of the 435 districts we would find different ways that this would be treated, and that is my concern is how we define that. 
   I think the gentleman's bill is directed towards students to help students get the education of environmental studies that he would like to see and that I support. The concern that I have again is that, if we direct it as your amendment would, it may be directed away from students. I think that this could be worked out. As we know, we are not going to finish this up in this Congress anyway, so it will be something that will carry over next year. Should we all happen by some circumstance to win our elections, we'll be back here in a few months, working on this again, but at this point, I would still have to oppose the amendment, hoping that we could work this out in the future.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, as I stated earlier, I support the gentleman's amendment and commend him on it.  
   Madam Chairman, over the last several years, the National Park Service has increasingly relied on partnerships with outside entities to fulfill its mission and foster a shared sense of stewardship for our environment and natural resources. In fact, a number of National Park Service programs operate almost exclusively through partnerships. 
   One way the National Park Service is supporting environmental education is through professional development opportunities for teachers. These include helping teachers utilize park resources in the classroom or preparing classes for a park visit. Most of these workshops are accredited and can be taken for college credit, and are structured to meet the needs of today's teacher--teaching to academic content standards while making the material engaging and relevant. 
   Because of the existing commitment on the part of the National Park Service to provide educational enrichment, the bill allows grantees to enter into National Park Service partnerships as a means to increase the knowledge and understanding of environmental education. 
   The Courtney amendment goes beyond this focus on the National Park Service, by allowing grant applicants to discuss through the grant application process how they have partnered, or intend to partner, with a state and local park and recreation department. 
   I support this amendment because it maintains the current funding structure--in which we provide grants to educational organizations--while making clear that students can benefit from the creativity, experience, and resources of local programs. These types of partnerships could benefit students by enriching their environmental education experience, and I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment to clarify that these partnerships are permissible, and welcome, under the legislation. 
   This amendment builds on the existing emphasis we have placed on partnerships with the National Park Service, and I am happy to support it.  
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Since 1990, the Federal Government's environmental education programs have been coordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency and have been well supported, receiving approximately $9 million in 2008. 
   The bill before us aims to strengthen that investment. It would incorporate scientifically-based and technology-driven teaching methods into environmental education, align programs with challenging State and local content standards, and support integrated and interdisciplinary studies. It would also create opportunities for professional development and encourage participation among underrepresented populations. These are all positive steps that I support. 
   This bill also creates a new National Capacity Environmental Education Program, under the Department of Education, to develop elementary and secondary environmental education programs. Unfortunately, this program is duplicative of the existing environmental education program already being run by the EPA, which has provided more than 3,200 grants to States, local schools and nonprofit organizations to increase environmental education. By creating a new program administered by the Secretary of Education, I'm concerned that the bill could create a more fragmented system of promoting environmental education on the Federal level. 
   Still, on the whole, I think this is a modest bill with good intentions, and I do not intend to oppose its passage. I appreciate Chairman Miller's willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion, and plan to vote ``yes'' because of that cooperation. 
   But let me say one thing to the education reform opponents who blame No Child Left Behind for all the world's ills. Our schools are free to teach environmental education or music or history or the Constitution or any number of other important subjects today under the No Child Left Behind act. We don't need a new bill with a clever name to make that happen. 
   So while I will be voting ``yes'' on this bill, I must confess that I'm not entirely sure why we're here today devoting several hours to debating it under a rule. 
   Only a handful of bills are brought up under the rules process each week. Generally, those are the bills that are of greatest concern to the American people. This week, for example, this rather minor environmental education bill is one of just four bills that will be brought up under a rule. Dozens of other minor bills are easily considered under a suspension of the rule each week, giving us more time for those issues that are complex or consequential. 
   The only reason I can think of to bring a bill like this to the floor under a rule is because the majority is trying to fill the time and avoid a debate on other issues. 
   On the schedule that we've been given by this Democratic leadership that pledged to work harder in this new Congress, in the last 5 months of this year, 15 days were scheduled to work. Last week one of those days was eliminated, bringing it down to 14. We just heard that another day has been eliminated tomorrow, bringing it down to 13; 13 working days in the last 5 months of the year. 
   One of the issues that we could be debating, or should be debating, I think it is very important to the American people given the price of gasoline at the pump and the tremendous problems that we have facing us, this issue is energy, and it's an issue that we won't allow the majority to ignore. In fact, I believe this bill to improve environmental education is the perfect place to talk about energy. 
   That's why we've proposed amendments to advance the understanding of the environmental and economic benefits of clean coal and oil shale production, energy production in ANWR, and energy production on the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   We've proposed amendments to advance the understanding of the environmental and economic benefits of nuclear power, and of American-made energy, and of an all-of-the-above strategy, an energy production strategy that would increase production, promote conservation and expand innovation. 
   Feeling the pressure to acknowledge these important issues, the majority hastily revised their manager's amendment on Tuesday for this bill, more than a week after the amendment deadline for the bill. And they added a half-hearted mention of issues of American energy production. 
   While it's a small step in the right direction, I can't help but wonder if this last-minute change was made not because they agree that we need to explore these issues, but because they simply didn't want to vote on our other stronger amendments. Time and again, this majority has skirted the issue and avoided a real debate about real energy problems. 
   The bill we passed on Tuesday was a sham. It was about offering political cover, not about making America energy independent. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would urge the American people to watch the progress of this bill. I've heard many speeches during the last couple of days about how we've expanded areas where we can explore and we can bring more production on-line and we can move towards energy independence, and this is what we have done to help the American people. 
   I would encourage the American people, Mr. Chairman, to watch the  progress of this bill to see how it moves forward the rest of this afternoon; tomorrow we won't be in session so they won't be able to work on it, and then all of next week. We'll be here, maybe all week, and then this Congress will end. And let's see if the American people see that the things that were promised in these speeches the last couple of days come to bear, or if it was just more political rhetoric to try to win the upcoming election. 
   I'm not surprised that they incorporated a fig leaf reference to energy production in this bill at all. It becomes par for the course. But I'm here to tell you that we're not buying it and the American people aren't buying it, either. 
   Our schools are suffering because of high energy prices, and any time we debate a bill to help our schools, we ought to be talking about how to ease their pain at the pump as well. 
   Earlier today I joined Republican Leader Boehner to release the results of our Back to School Energy Survey. The results were eye opening. We heard from nearly 1,000 Americans, principals, teachers, school board members from across country, and they overwhelmingly agreed that Congress needs to be doing more to bring down energy prices. 
   Ninety percent of those surveyed said high energy costs were impacting their schools. Nearly half reported that high fuel costs have forced schools in their community to cut field trips and after-school activities. One-third told us that high costs forced schools to limit bus routes. And nearly a quarter reported that rising energy costs have led to higher school lunch prices. 
   Mr. Chairman, the American people deserve better and our schools deserve better. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (EDUCATION: THE QUALITY OF OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to have this opportunity to discuss an issue that's important to every single American family: the quality of our Nation's schools. 
   Twenty-five years ago this week, the National Commission on Excellence in Education issued its landmark report entitled ``A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform.'' I would like to read an excerpt from the opening of that report: 
   ``Our Nation is at risk. Our once unchallenged preeminence in commerce, industry, science, and technological innovation is being overtaken by competitors throughout the world . . . While we can take justifiable pride in what our schools and colleges have historically accomplished, the educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a nation and as a people. What was unimaginable a generation ago has begun to occur. Others are matching and surpassing our educational attainments.'' 
   Again, this report was written 25 years ago. And some of the things we're going to talk about tonight are about what little improvement we have made in that 25 years. 
   When this report was released, it sent shock waves through our educational system. For the first time, we recognized the threat of educational failure as a threat to our national security. And to be frank, I don't think that was overstating the case. I have personally traveled to China with other Members of Congress and seen the progress they are making scientifically, technologically, and, yes, educationally. And China is not alone. All around the world, nations are realizing that educational excellence today will mean competitive dominance tomorrow. 
   ``A Nation at Risk'' was issued nearly two decades after enactment of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The ESEA, which was the precursor of No Child Left Behind, dramatically increased Federal funding for education. Unfortunately, it didn't link that funding to a demand for results. From 1965 until enactment of No Child Left Behind in 2002, the Federal Government spent more than $227 billion on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Yet despite that considerable investment, academic achievement flatlined during that time period. 
   As you can see here, the graph shows the amount of money appropriated year by year, and the blue flat line is the test results during that period. 
   This is unacceptable. It's unacceptable to the taxpayers, being asked to fork over their hard-earned dollars to a bloated Federal bureaucracy that fails to produce results. It is unacceptable to parents, who should be empowered to seek out a quality educational experience for their children. And it is unacceptable to our citizenry as a whole, who deserve an educational system that strengthens our prospects for the future. 
   ``A Nation at Risk'' outlined dire consequences if we, as a nation, failed  to improve our schools. In the quarter century since that report was issued, we have seen a number of positive education reform movements, each of which, if allowed to succeed, could make a real difference to students.     
   I would like to discuss just a few of those reform movements now. First, A Nation at Risk energized those who support educational freedom. There are many that believe a lack of competition in our public schools is a major force behind their stubborn lack of improvement. Rather than permitting the educational establishment to maintain its stranglehold on educational options, we need to give parents the right to decide how their children will best be educated. 
   Another key education reform principle that emerged in the wake of A Nation at Risk was the drive to improve teacher quality. In fact, an entire section of the report was dedicated to improving teacher quality. In 1983, the report highlighted a shortage in highly qualified teachers of key subjects like math, science, and key foreign languages. It also called for innovative strategies like performance-based pay to recruit and retain effective teachers. Twenty-five years later, we are still facing a shortage of teachers in these critical subjects, and we are still fighting to be able to treat teachers as the professionals that they are by rewarding them for their performance. 
   Perhaps the most fundamental education reform movement that has come about in the years since A Nation at Risk is the No Child Left Behind Act. That is because NCLB sought to change the expectations at the very core of our education system. Instead of accepting mediocrity, NCLB demands that every child in America be given the opportunity to succeed. 
   You know, it's a real indictment of the educational system of the past that it was considered radical to expect every child to merely be able to read and do basic math. But that is the mentality that NCLB is trying to change. Unfortunately, despite these and many other efforts to improve our Nation's schools, we are still a long way from educational excellence. And so I would submit that our Nation is still at risk. 
   We have an education establishment that puts preservation of the system above elevation of the student. We have children trapped in chronically under-performing schools and parents with little or no ability to send them elsewhere. We have teachers leaving the profession because they are frustrated with a system that fails to recognize and reward success. And we have a majority in Congress that has refused to take the next step toward education reform by making much needed reforms to No Child Left Behind. 
   Tonight, some of my friends and I on the Education Committee are going to take a look at A Nation at Risk: 25 Years Later. From where I sit, the education landscape in this country is often disappointing, yet hopeful as well. Reformers from all ideological perspectives continue to push for better schools, greater education reform, and a commitment to competitiveness that will allow us to thrive in the 21st century and beyond. Education reform is a daunting challenge, but one that cannot be ignored. 
   I would like to give the time now to a good friend from Delaware, the ranking member over the Subcommittee on Elementary and Secondary Education, Mr. Castle.

   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman. And as Mr. Davis said earlier, in the meetings that he held with his people  in his district he heard some of these same problems, some of the same complaints. And that is why we really need to reauthorize the bill to fix those problems. 
   I have been here now almost 16 years, and I have yet to see a perfect bill. And when a bill is passed, by the time it goes through the process here and finally is passed and signed into law, and then the regulators get 
   their shot at it, write the regulations, and then by the time it is implemented throughout 50 States across this great country, it doesn't necessarily finish up the way you started out or even to achieve the goals that you had. 
   And so we have a process where every 5 years on our committee we look at the bill again and we go through a reauthorization process, and say, what did we do wrong? What can we do to fix this? What can we do to make it better? 
   And you brought up the point, special needs students. Definitely something needs to be done there. I remember visiting a school in my district and going into a special needs class and seeing a student there that was carried in on a gurney. And the teachers, the caregivers there that day spent their time just making sure that the child is given the things that are needed for life; they fed him through a tube. There wasn't much education going on there. I think that was a very important program, but maybe it should be considered a help program to give the parents a little relief at that time. But, to say that that child is going to learn to read, common sense would dictate that is not the fact. So, we have a 3 percent waiver for some of those students. Maybe that should have been larger. But that is what we addressed through the reauthorization, and that is why it is very important we get that done. 
   I would like to yield now to the gentlelady, Mrs. Foxx, who has been a teacher, been a college administrator, and done a lot of things in education.

   Mr. McKEON. Let me just say No Child Left Behind I think has made a good improvement for the purpose that it was originally passed for. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed in 1965 to help, as was stated earlier, the have-nots, to help them get up to where the haves are. 
   The test scores show that since No Child Left Behind has been put in, we have the highest testing for African American and Hispanic children in the history of the testing. A lot of things have been misunderstood about NCLB. What it was was a law that said we want kids to learn basic math and we want them to learn to read, and the States set the standards and implement the bills. Some States went much further, and the Federal Government got blamed for what we actually did. The important thing is that we get it reauthorized, that we fix the problems that have been mentioned many times here tonight. 
   I thank the Speaker for his patience, and those who have been listening, I thank them and I think we will follow up with another one of these because there is much more to be said about education and the reauthorization of the ESEA, better known recently as No Child Left Behind.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in opposition to H.R. 3685, a proposal fraught with burdensome mandates, litigation traps, and constitutional concerns.  
   This bill purports to prohibit discrimination in the workplace, a goal to which we are all committed. However, the reality of this bill's consequences does not match the rhetoric of its supporters. 
   This bill departs from the longstanding framework and structure of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by establishing stand-alone protections exclusively on the basis of sexual orientation. This new protected class would be afforded protections on the basis of vague and highly subjective measures that will cause confusion in the workplace and will result in costly litigation. 
   For example, the bill extends protections on the basis of ``perceived'' sexual orientation, a characteristic that is subjective by its very definition. How would an employer credibly refute such an accusation? This proposal could result in the exact opposite effect its supporters intend by creating new pressures on employers to consider and even document their employees' sexual orientation, actual or how it is perceived, in order to guard against litigation. This is a highly inappropriate infringement on employee privacy and would actually increase the consideration of such characteristics in the workplace. Also, any argument that the term ``perceived'' is already included in existing civil rights statutes is simply not true. This is a new term, applied to a new situation, which will increase uncertainty and litigation. 
   Even more broadly, this bill encroaches on two fundamental principles we hold dear: the free exercise of religion and preservation of the institution of marriage. H.R. 3685 is inconsistent with the longstanding religious exemption contained in title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The bill adds additional layers of complexity in determining whether a religious organization is covered, setting up highly intrusive Federal interference with the free expression of religion. 
   We understand an amendment is to be offered later today that attempts to move closer to existing title VII provisions. However, it remains unclear whether this amendment, which has been rewritten repeatedly, does enough to protect faith-based institutions. 
   On the issue of marriage, the majority adds a provision that prevents employers from considering marital status as a job qualification, even though they have not provided any evidence that such a limitation is necessary. We are left to speculate that the real reason for this provision could be an attempt to undermine the fundamental right of States to define, protect, and preserve the institution of marriage. The bill establishes new limitations on hiring practices only in those States that have prohibited same-sex marriage. 
   By limiting these new restrictions to States that have defined marriage as an institution between one man and one woman, the bill has essentially identified traditional marriage as a form of discrimination. This bill, then, could become the first step in a radical effort to undermine State marriage laws. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill has been introduced in various forms and fashions for some three decades. It has been introduced in the House three separate times this year alone. This is evidence of the inherent complexity that comes with such a far-reaching proposal. 
   Later today, we will consider an amendment that seeks to broaden these new protections even further, to purportedly cover discrimination based on gender identity, despite the fact that this provision was stripped from the bill before it was taken up in committee. There are serious practical and legal concerns with this amendment, and many questions remain unresolved. This is an effort to make an end-run around the legislative process, considering the full scope of this proposal only when it is convenient for supporters. 
   The bill before us is a sweeping departure from longstanding civil rights law, and its consequences will be far-reaching. A number of valid questions have been raised about how this bill will align with existing State and Federal anti-discrimination policies and those policies that have been voluntarily adopted by employers. These questions remain unanswered. 
   Because of that, I must oppose this bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   With this amendment, the majority tries to correct fundamental flaws related to hiring protections for faith-based institutions and the preservation of marriage. I will reluctantly support this relatively futile attempt, but let me be clear, on the issues of faith-based protections and the institution of marriage, this amendment fails to solve the problems. As such, even with adoption of this amendment, the underlying bill should be defeated. 
   For months, my colleagues and I have raised substantive legal and policy concerns related to this legislation. After a series of legislative false starts, the bill brought to the floor continues to pose a number of challenges. The amendment offered by Chairman Miller is an obvious attempt to address a few, but certainly not all, of the issues we have identified. 
   We expressed concern that the bill created a new anti-discrimination framework outside the existing scope of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Among other things, this allowed for a new set of provisions to dictate the hiring rights of religious organizations, thereby stripping faith-based institutions of their long-standing title VII protections. 
   I appreciate that the majority has recognized and agreed with our concerns about how this bill would intrude on religious freedom. In response to those concerns, the amendment moves closer to title VII. Inexplicably, however, it still leaves out an important piece of current law. 
   Chairman Miller says his amendment fully restores protections to faith-based institutions. It does not. We expressed concern that the bill could undermine the rights of States to define, protect and preserve the institution of marriage. The Miller amendment deletes troublesome provisions related to employee benefits for same-sex couples and references the Federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Unfortunately, despite these steps, or perhaps even because of them, the bill taken as a whole continues to create potential conflicts between State and Federal marriage laws. 
   Chairman Miller says his amendment protects the rights of States to define and preserve traditional marriage. It does not.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. This is an emotional issue, it's a serious issue, and I think it's hard for some of us, I know on this, to control our passions. It's disturbing that some are offended, have been offended during the debate today, and I feel badly about that. 
   My concerns are more with the flaws that I see in the bill. I am concerned that we are all trying to end discrimination. I don't think you do that by passing laws. I think we have to engage people in their hearts, in their minds and try to work with that approach. 
   While this amendment does not correct or even address all of the challenges created by the underlying legislation, I recognize the incremental steps it takes. I appreciate the chairman for making this effort at trying to resolve these issues. I will support its passage. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to rise in opposition to this amendment. As Mr. Hastings said earlier, there is in current law the Office of Economic Development, which has the responsibility of working with public and private sectors, as well as not-for-profit organizations, to provide financial and technical assistance to local communities to develop and implement their own economic development in their community. That's current law. 
   If we want to change that, I agree with much of what the gentleman has to say, I just think this is not the right time and place to be covering it in this manner. But it gives me a little bit of a chance to talk about my district, and all 435 of us, I think, love to have the opportunity to talk about our districts. 
   I have a map here which shows my district. It is the second largest district in California, a little over 21,000 square miles. I live down here. This is Nevada. This is central to northern California. It is about 450 miles this way, a couple hundred miles this way. A little perspective: eight States would fit within this county, one of the largest counties. 
   In this county, the town of Bishop, some of the community people have every year for the last 40 years celebrated what they call Mule Days, and about 50,000 people come to this community of 3,500 people. In this whole county that I said eight States would fit in, about 17,000 people live, and about 3,500 people live in the town of Bishop. They are great people. 
   Here are the eastern Sierras, Death Valley. We have the lowest spot in the 48 States and the highest spot. Death Valley is 280 feet below sea level, and we have Mount Whitney that is about 15,000 feet above sea level. It is a great district, just as each of your districts are. 
   Several years ago, and actually they have been working on this for a few years, Bob Tanner and some of the people in Bishop thought that they should have a museum to celebrate the mules. Ninety-five percent of this county is owned by Federal and local governments. They don't have any room. There are only a few acres in this town that could even be developed. They don't have the land to develop for economic development. They rely totally on tourism, restaurants, motels, packers that take people up into the mountains. Mules have been an important part of this, and they want to establish a museum. They are asking for $50,000. L.A. City is going to donate $2 million worth of land, 8 acres. The county and the city are putting up a little over a million and a half dollars, and the people that live there are going to raise another hundred, $250,000. 
   One thing that I think we forget is that the people in Bishop pay taxes. They pay Federal taxes, and I guarantee you that during the time that Jerry represented them and the time I have had the opportunity to represent them, they have gotten very little back from the Federal Government for the taxes that they have sent here to Washington.

   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman. 
   Let me tell you a little bit about mules because this is one of the things that they are going to honor in this museum. George Washington introduced mules into our country. He received a jack donkey in 1786 from the King of Spain, and he started breeding and using mules. Within a few years, he had 58 mules working on his plantation a few miles south in Mount Vernon. 
   Since then, mules have been used to develop the West. All across the Nation, they helped the pioneers move. They could go 30 miles a day where wagon trains could only go about 5. They were an integral part of the development of this country. Even today, we have 600 mules on special assignment serving in Afghanistan helping the Army do the things that they helped the Army do 100 years ago. 
   I think $50,000, you know, is a good contribution to give to these people, the money that they have sent back here.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to thank the gentleman from Arizona for the opportunity to come to the floor to discuss the American Mule and Packer Museum and the economic development impact it will have on my district. 
   Let me first start by saying that this $50,000 is not included in this bill to laud the humble and noble mule. These funds will be used to boost tourism dollars in the small city of Bishop, CA by helping to build a local heritage museum. 
   The city of Bishop is located in Inyo County--which is geographically one of the largest counties in the country and is 95 percent owned by the federal government. Bishop is a classic western frontier city and has been squeezed out of all other industries by the encroachment of federal land, which literally surrounds it and limits the community to survival on tourism dollars. Those vitally important dollars come from visitors eager to see the great Wild West, ride out like our forefathers into the Eastern Sierra, enjoy the natural beauty on a hike, or hire a mule packer to explore the federal forests in the area. 
   The $50,000 dollar grant contained in this bill for the American Mule Museum is a modest federal investment in a worthy economic development project and a good example of how federal seed money is leveraged to develop local projects. 
   Every year, at the fairgrounds on Main Street, the small city of Bishop hosts a famous and popular heritage festival known as ``Mule Days.'' Some communities have an Apple Harvest festival, some have Frontier Days. In Bishop, we celebrate ``Mule Days.'' My friend from Arizona may not be familiar with the essential role Packers and their trusted mules had to the settlement of the west, but California's home state President did. Next to me is a picture of then-Governor Ronald Reagan acting as the Grand Marshall to the Bishop Mule Days parade in 1974. 
   Mule Days is the single largest draw to that community, bringing fifty thousand Californians and tourists interested in frontier life into downtown Bishop, where they shop, dine and stay during the festival. In addition to honoring their history, this museum would help expand that tourism by drawing folks in year-round, rather than just during the long Memorial Day weekend Mule Days celebration. The City of Los Angeles, a longtime landholder in our northern county, is going to donate an estimated 8 acres, valued at $2,000,000 for the project. Inyo County will spend an additional $1.5 million with the hook-ups, parking lots and access roads. Finally, this federal grant, directed to National Forest and Recreation Association, in Woodlake, CA (the non-profit overseeing the project) and private fundraising will be used towards the excavation and reconstruction of the famed Livermore Packing Station, and the surrounding corrals in Bishop. 
   There is a federal interest in preserving the history of how the West was settled. There are many residents in the city and surrounding areas who are direct descendants of those pioneers who headed west. A museum dedicated to local heritage and mule packers that were so important to the founding of the area will be a proper place to preserve their artifacts and documents into the future. 
   The residents of the City of Bishop, my constituents and federal tax payers are dependent on tourism dollars for their city funds. There are 480 separate EDI projects listed in the THUD bill ranging from $50,000 up to $500,000 with the majority of projects falling in the $100 K to $200 K range. The projects, with a few exceptions, are for the planning, land purchase, construction or renovation of facilities deemed to be important to economic development in both rural and urban areas. The construction of a museum celebrating local history is a common theme throughout many of the projects. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and help preserve a piece of American history in a place that is deserving of federal assistance.

   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman very much. As you can see, when I start talking about my district, I get pretty excited. I have a lot of good things to say about it. 
   Bishop is a classic western frontier city. It has been squeezed out of all other big industries by all of the other public lands that are owned around them, and they have to survive on tourism. So if they can add this museum, it will help their tourism and it will help bring people there year-round, which will benefit their economy. 
   In closing, let me say that this is a partnership. It is not just Federal dollars, even though there is no such thing as ``Federal dollars.'' It all comes out of our pockets, and the people in Bishop pay those Federal dollars back here. 
   But as I mentioned earlier, the City of Los Angeles is going to participate by donating the land which is worth $2 million. Inyo County will spend an additional $1.5 million to work on the project, and local people will raise the difference. 
   The final thing I wanted to say is that there are 480 separate economic development projects in this bill. According to current law, that is what the law required. The chairman and the ranking member have gone through, their staffs, they have evaluated all of the projects requested. Bob Tanner and his friends in Bishop that requested this project wrote up their project. They sent it to me and Senator Feinstein. We included it in the request. They were one of the ones chosen, one of the 480. These projects range from $50,000, this is the smallest, to $500,000, with the majority falling between $100,000 and $200,000. 
   The projects, with few exceptions, are for planning, land purchase, construction or renovation of facilities deemed to be important to economic development in both rural and urban areas. This is a very rural area. The construction of a museum celebrating local history is a common theme throughout many of these projects. We followed the law. We did the things that are asked of us. I think this is a worthy project. 
   I thank the chairman and ranking member for including it in this bill. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1424. Today we are attempting to enact legislation that achieves ``parity'' in the treatment of employer-sponsored coverage for mental and behavioral illnesses. However, although the House bill is well-intentioned, it does not accomplish the goal of providing parity. Instead, it creates new mandates so onerous that they could do far more harm than good, potentially squeezing employers out of the voluntary health care system altogether or eliminating the very mental health benefits we are trying to provide. 
   First, this bill would give preferential treatment in our health care system to mental health benefits, affording mental illness a special status that is not given to other similarly severe medical illnesses. 
   For example, under the House bill we are considering today, virtually every mental illness defined by the mental health profession would be required to be covered by private plans. This, despite the fact that most States currently do not mandate this type of coverage. Also, H.R. 1424 does not place a similar requirement on private health plans to cover other types of medical benefits, including hospital services, physician services, drug benefits, or any other category of benefits. What this bill really accomplishes is not ``parity'' between mental health coverage and the medical and surgical benefits that are offered by plans; it is quite simply preferential treatment for mental health benefits over and above all other categories of medical benefits. The changes that have been made to the floor version of H.R. 1424 fail to address these serious concerns. 
   Second, we have heard the bill's supporters say that this is a balanced bill. Respectfully, it is not. The bill fails to adequately and explicitly protect the ability of private plans to apply commonsense medical management practices currently being used to help ensure the delivery of high-quality medical care and ensure that coverage for working men and women remains affordable.     
   Under this bill, plans would likely have to pay a mental health provider's bill without question, which would make it very difficult to control costs. 
   Third, this bill unnecessarily weakens the preemption requirements in the ERISA law. As a result, States would be free to enact standards greater than the Federal standard. Although the majority may argue that ERISA preemption is maintained, their language,  at a minimum, raises serious questions about the ability of States to enact laws and remedies that preempt ERISA and impact group health plans that currently operate under Federal law. 
   Litigation to determine the meaning of this provision will result and group health plans could be subjected to possibly 50 different State laws on mental health benefits, making it harder to provide one set of rules that apply to all plans. This violates a fundamental rule of ERISA, which creates efficiencies by preventing plans from having to comply with 50 or more different sets of laws. One set of rules, applied equally to all ERISA plans, makes high-quality coverage affordable and available to millions of Americans. If the majority were truly interested in preserving ERISA, they would have adopted the noncontroversial language contained in the competing Senate mental health parity bill. 
   Fourth, the bill mandates out-of-network coverage if any other benefit is operated on an out-of-network basis. This mandate will prevent plans from coordinating medical care, which will reduce quality and increase the cost of coverage. 
   Lastly, this bill will increase litigation against ERISA plans by permitting application of State remedies to federally mandated benefits. There will be absolutely no consistency in State court rulings, and litigation costs could skyrocket. 
   Mr. Speaker, while the broad issue of mental health parity enjoys widespread support, this bill does not. It is not a negotiated compromise between all parties that have a stake in this debate and, therefore, it is not in the best interest of the country as a whole. 
   However, a viable alternative to the House bill with broad mainstream support already exists and has passed the Senate. The Senate's bipartisan bill has extensive support from mental health advocates, health care providers and business groups representing virtually all sides of this debate. The Senate bill is the product of years of bipartisan negotiations which accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do, provide parity for mental health benefits. It clearly reflects a more balanced and viable solution, and has a much better chance of becoming law if it were considered and passed by the House. Sadly, the majority has refused to consider that legislation, and instead offers the bill we are debating today, which gives preferential treatment to one particular class of medical benefits and has little or no chance of becoming law. Unfortunately, passage of the House bill will likely make it much more difficult to pass meaningful parity legislation this year. 
   For the reasons stated, I must oppose this bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I agree with much of what has been said here, because achieving parity between mental health and medical/surgical benefits is a goal that enjoys widespread support, and I support that. Had this bill been negotiated in an inclusive, cooperative fashion, I believe a parity law could quickly be enacted this year, ensuring access to coverage for those who need it. 
   There was a road map that would have allowed us to forge a consensus bill. On the other side of the Capitol, stakeholders were brought together and given the opportunity to find agreement on these difficult issues. There was give and take by everyone involved, which is how the Senate was able to produce a bill that achieves parity without undue burden on our employer-based health care system. Unfortunately, we're not following that road map. Instead, we're considering a bill that overreaches and in the process puts at risk many fundamental elements of private health insurance plans. 
   The majority argues that the latest variation of their proposal addresses key concerns. I wish that were true. Unfortunately, the bill we're considering today contains only modest changes that fail to fully resolve concerns about ERISA preemption, costly litigation, coverage mandates, and a host of other concerns. 
   By giving preferential treatment to mental health benefits over other types of medical coverage, the bill creates a lopsided system that may actually be biased against mental health coverage because some employers may choose to drop their mental health coverage or, worse, all health coverage rather than comply with more burdensome mandates. 
   Moreover, the list of conditions that would receive mandatory coverage under this bill would be laughable were it not posing such a serious risk to health care coverage for hardworking families. At a time when health care costs are rising, this bill threatens key management tools that have helped keep costs down. And by weakening ERISA preemption, the bill opens the door to increased litigation and a patchwork of confusing requirements and inefficiencies. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a better way to provide parity for mental health benefits. The bill that passed the Senate provides a thoughtful, reasonable and a balanced approach that reflects the deliberations of all relevant stakeholders. Representatives Heather Wilson, John Kline and Dave Camp sought to offer that proposal today in the hopes that we would move quickly on a consensus proposal that could be signed into law. Their amendment also used a noncontroversial payment offset, unlike H.R. 1424. Unfortunately, as has become the hallmark of the 110th Congress, we were shut out of meaningful debate, and that amendment, along with a number of other improvements to the bill, will not be considered. 
   I support a balanced approach to mental health parity and, therefore, I cannot support this bill in its current form. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill so that we can take up the consensus legislation that enjoys community and other key stakeholders' support, those who share our commitment to provide equitable benefits that support mental health without jeopardizing our health care system as a whole. I urge a ``no'' vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the motion to instruct conferees. I am disappointed to be standing here under these circumstances. 
   A full month into the new fiscal year, the Democrats have failed to send a single spending bill to the President for his signature or veto. The President laid out his positions early this year, asking the Congress to adhere to fiscally responsible spending caps. 
   Democrats have been unwilling or unable to control their spending, passing bills that topped these spending targets by billions of dollars. Now, rather than moving separate bills to support our troops and veterans, Democrats are holding these bills hostage to the swollen Labor, Health and Human Services and Education spending bill. 
   As the former chairman of the Education Committee, I know firsthand the arguments the other side will make on funding in that bill. So let's focus on the facts. Republicans are strong supporters of programs that support education, health care and workers. Our fiscally responsible spending targets allow significant resources for these programs. Republicans have a strong record when it comes to funding education. 
   At the same time, we know that the achievement gap in our schools is not caused by a lack of funding, but by a lack of accountability. Throwing money at the problem is not the answer. Our committee is a case study in how the priorities of Democrats diverged from those of the American people. 
   Democrats have failed to act on the No Child Left Behind, the higher education, and job training bills this year. Yet, they have passed bills to strip workers of the right to a secret ballot election, overturned six decades of civil rights law, and created new entitlement spending at the expense of low- and middle-income college students. The worst may be yet to come. 
   When Democrats finally take up higher education reform, we may see prisoners getting Pell Grants and drug dealers getting Federal aid. The Democrats have, quite simply, got their priorities in the wrong place. It's time to get back to work and fund these three bills separately for our troops, our veterans, and our students.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume in opposition to this bill. 
   The legislation before us is supposed to be about reforming the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. As flawed as the underlying TAA provisions are, their weaknesses are amplified by the inclusion of separate, largely unrelated legislation that moved through the Education and Labor Committee. 
   That bill, which has been folded into the larger TAA package, modifies the WARN Act and COBRA, two statutes that were not even designed to help workers impacted by globalization get the tools and training they needed to get back to work. 
   We've heard time and again that in order to effectively respond to competitive challenges we need to bolster our education and training systems to better prepare current and future workers for success. 
   Unfortunately, the provisions inserted into the broader TAA bill take a different approach. Instead of offering proactive solutions that will allow American workers to compete and thrive, these policies do nothing more than layer on additional Federal red tape for employers while offering only incremental provisions for workers that would do nothing to help them adjust to the changing workplace. 
   The proposal for a massive expansion of the WARN Act would be incredibly burdensome for employers struggling to keep pace with a changing economy. The limitations of this proposal do not match the real-world scenarios in which employers may be shifting their workforce to meet changing needs. 
   The bill mandates a full 90 days' notice before a plant closure or other mass layoff, requiring employers to remain stagnant for a full fiscal quarter before adjusting their workforce. This, despite the fact that in order to keep and create jobs here at home, employers need a workforce that is flexible and adaptable. Layered on top of that unworkable time frame is a requirement that double damages be paid by any employer unable to comply. This would create a system that is more focused on punishing employers than truly helping workers who lose their jobs. 
   Similarly, the selective expansion of COBRA availability seems to focus more on compliance and red tape than on offering genuine solutions to workers who need assistance and retraining as a result of globalization. It creates an unfair system in which not all workers who lose their jobs would have access to the same health care options. The bill uses TAA eligibility as a trigger for expanded COBRA coverage but extends the coverage almost indefinitely. This is inconsistent with existing COBRA eligibility and inconsistent with other TAA benefits. 
   The Education and Labor Committee convened a hearing in March to examine the impact of international trade on American workers. The challenges we considered during that hearing are the same challenges we appear to be attempting to address today. Yet during that hearing, not a single witness suggested or endorsed these bloated, bureaucratic WARN Act and COBRA proposals. 
   We all know that American companies must be flexible and dynamic in order to keep pace with their competition overseas. These proposals would put American companies at a distinct disadvantage, preventing them from maintaining an agile workforce and undermining efforts to preserve American jobs or create new ones because of the burden and cost of compliance with these new mandates. 
   If we're serious about assisting dislocated workers and keeping America competitive, the Education and Labor Committee has a crucial role to play. We should be renewing our one-stop job training system authorized under the Workforce Investment Act. Unfortunately, Democrats have stalled our efforts to strengthen and improve job training, failing to even introduce a bill to extend and enhance WIA. 
   Republicans are committed to keeping America competitive in the global economy. Later today, I will join with Representative McCrery, the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, to offer a comprehensive approach to assist Americans adversely affected by trade. 
   The increased employer burdens proposed through an expansion of the WARN Act and COBRA are nothing more than a distraction from the real debate we ought to be having. I oppose these costly, arduous provisions because they move in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of fostering competitiveness and job creation, they will breed litigation and stagnation.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, we know that there have been job losses due to trade, there have been job losses due to technology improvements. There are other different reasons why jobs are lost, and we all feel the pain of those who have lost their jobs. 
   Having said that, the answer is not increased bureaucracy and increased problems that employers have to deal with in providing jobs and in coming up with new technology to create new jobs. The answer would be to streamline, to cut back the bureaucracy, yes, to give temporary help to workers that have been displaced, to give them the opportunity to get additional job training so that they can prepare for other occupations, and then to try to spread that pain across the country instead of just having it targeted on those specific plans. 
   We will offer later an amendment to this bill, a substitute, that will do just that. In the meantime, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote against additional bureaucracy and to vote against expanded government intrusion into the marketplace that causes these disruptions.

   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   You know, it has been 9 years since Congress last reauthorized the Workforce Investment Act, known as WIA. We made dramatic improvements through the last reauthorization, strengthening the nationwide system of one-stop training centers where workers can access a variety of training services. 
   I remember not too long after we did that, two of the displaced workers in my district, we've lost many jobs for aerospace workers, two of them came up to me and thanked me for having done this because they had been able to go back and get vouchers, receive additional training. One of them was becoming a teacher and one was going to be a computer operator. And we've seen many people benefit from that program. But as yet, it has not been reauthorized this year. 
   The system has served job seekers well. WIA now integrates employment and training services at the local level in a more unified workforce development system, which it did not do prior to the 1998 reforms. Yet, without renewal today, it cannot possibly keep pace with the rapidly changing needs of workers in a dynamic economy. 
   Earlier this month, Republicans unveiled a comprehensive road map for reforming both job training and higher education. The Higher Education Act and WIA each play a critical role in keeping Americans competitive by developing the skills and knowledge necessary in a changing economy. Unfortunately, Democrats have not offered proposals to strengthen either of these critical programs. 
   I am pleased to be joining Representative McCrery today in offering a proposal that links our job training reforms with the renewal of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. These proposals work hand in hand to provide dislocated workers the type of responsive, flexible training and assistance they need to get back to work. 
   Our proposal will strengthen WIA's infrastructure, eliminate duplication and waste, increase accountability, enhance the role of employers, and increase the State and local flexibility. Together, these reforms will ensure the Nation's workforce development system can respond quickly and effectively to the changing needs of job seekers and those in need of training. 
   The time for job training is long overdue. The Department of Labor has made efforts to allow flexibility and creativity within the existing system, and numerous stakeholders have proposed innovative new strategies. However, this type of reform has been hampered because Congress has failed to act. 
   One of the most important steps we can take to strengthen our job training system is to increase program efficiency and focus on results. We must eliminate duplication and redundancy and create a more seamless system that can be flexible based on changing needs. 
   Our amendment will eliminate current barriers to effective programs and services. We will enhance the services offered to job seekers, providing greater flexibility and eliminating arbitrary requirements that prevent some workers from getting the services they need. 
   We also plan to restore long-standing hiring protections to faith-based organizations in order to ensure that they are able to participate fully in the job training system. 
   To foster regional economic development, the Republican plan would allow regional areas to integrate workforce development programs, one-stop services, and community and economic development funds into a comprehensive workforce development system. 
   Finally, our plan would strengthen programs targeted towards specific populations, improving adult education, vocational rehabilitation, and youth programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support trade adjustment assistance, and I support its extension and renewal. 
   I want to recognize Representative McCrery for his leadership on this important issue. Our amendment will better integrate TAA with other Federal programs to more effectively equip workers affected by trade, globalization and other causes of job loss with skills they need to adapt to the changing global economy. It will join these TAA improvements to long-overdue job training reforms. We need to update these programs to be competitive worldwide. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on the Republican substitute, which will provide a comprehensive approach to helping keep America competitive.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Democrat budget resolution. A majority of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have rightly spoken against this budget because it includes the largest tax increase in American history. And let there be no doubt: This tax increase would destroy jobs, take more money from working families, and bring our economic growth to a screeching halt. 
   However, I'd like to speak for a moment about a little-discussed provision in this resolution that could have significant negative consequences of its own. This resolution includes a reconciliation instruction for the Education and Labor Committee to find $75 million in savings from our mandatory programs. On its face, that seems harmless, although I think we can all agree that $75 million is hardly a serious effort at deficit reduction. After all, our committee is no stranger to this effort, having saved taxpayers some $12 billion through reconciliation in the last Congress while significantly improving the student aid programs for all our students. 
   However, make no mistake, this instruction is not as innocent as it looks. In fact, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee recently called it a ``stalking horse for a significant expansion of spending.'' And he's absolutely correct. This small reconciliation instruction may serve to have the largest impact on the Federal student loan program in history. 
   Simply put, the majority is trying to take advantage of the reconciliation process to jam through an expansion of the federally-run Direct Loan program--knowing that strong opposition to the expansion of this program would prohibit it from being successfully added to the Higher Education Act if its reauthorization was proceeding through regular order. The laundry list of reasons why giving the Direct Loan program a leg-up on the traditional, private-run student loan program would harm students and taxpayers alike is another discussion for another day. But let there be no mistake: This budget would allow for just that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'd like to amend the Senate Budget Committee chairman's words slightly and call this reconciliation instruction a ``Trojan horse''--because if this largely unnoticed instruction remained in place, the negative consequences on our student lending system would be almost unimaginable. The Federal Government is not meant to be a clearinghouse for college loans, and the Department of Education's ability to manage the scant 20 percent of all loans currently administered through the Direct Loan program is shaky, at best. 
   Just think of what adding even more bureaucracy would do for the students counting on good customer service and taxpayers counting on a well-managed program. Once again, it's almost unimaginable. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Democrat budget resolution and support the Republican substitute.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   We have had a good debate last night and this morning, and the other side has tried to make this an emotional debate about discrimination, but that is not debate. We all, both Democrat and Republican, oppose discrimination. 
   Madam Speaker, in Congress bad process usually makes for bad product. Let there be no mistake, the process that brought H.R. 2831 to the floor today was incredibly sloppy. Likewise, the product itself could not be sloppier. The title of this bill should be, ``The End of the Statute of Limitations.'' 
   This bill was hastily patched together by the Education and Labor Committee Democrats at the behest of the House majority leadership with the hope of grabbing a few headlines just a month after the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the 1964 Civil Rights Act statute of limitations. 
   Neither House Republicans nor many key outside stakeholders were consulted as the bill was drafted, and the bill was not considered at a single legislative hearing. Then, again, at the behest of the House Democrat leadership, the Rules Committee granted a completely closed rule, locking out nearly 400 Members from amending or even considering amendments for this legislation. 
   Had this bill truly been a narrow fix, as its supporters would have the American people believe, this sloppy process may not have been such a problem. However, this is a major fundamental change to civil rights law and no less than four separate statutes. 
   The last change to civil rights law of this magnitude, the 1991 Civil Rights Act, took 2 years of negotiation, debate, and bipartisan accord to accomplish. By comparison, this bill took just 2 months. It cheapens our legislative process and, indeed, it cheapens the work that has gone into decades of serious considerate civil rights lawmaking. The legislative product itself, as my Republican colleagues and I have discussed, is no less flawed. It guts the statute of limitations contained in current law and, in so doing, would allow an employee to bring a claim against an employer decades after the alleged initial act of discrimination occurred. And trial lawyers, you can be sure, are salivating at this prospect. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a bad bill that is the result of an equally bad process. The President has threatened to veto it should it arrive at his desk, and rightfully so. But we should never let it get to that point. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, my amendment would restore much-needed funding to the highly successful Reading First program. 
   In 2001, Members of both parties committed to implementing scientifically based reading instruction, through Reading First, as the foundation of an effort to provide a high-quality education in every school. Six years later, it is clear that the program is working, but not without some internal challenges. 
   Indeed, Reading First has received a great deal of attention over the last several months, and for good reason. An investigation into the program by the Department of Education's Inspector General uncovered real problems in the agency's implementation and management of the program. And the Education and Labor Committee has followed with appropriate, thorough, and bipartisan oversight to ensure that those problems are addressed. 
   In spite of this, we have heard from the majority that it intends to cut some $600 million from this program, roughly 60 percent of its overall annual budget, until problems identified by the Inspector General have been addressed. That's particularly interesting since these problems have been and are being addressed both by the Department of Education itself and through proposed legislation. 
   Since last September, the Department has responded to the investigation of its Inspector General and to our committee's oversight of Reading First by making a number of significant changes to improve the administration of the program. In fact, at the committee's oversight hearing of this program, the Inspector General acknowledged that the Department has accepted his recommendations and begun implementing them to reform the program. 
   Among the steps taken by the Department in the wake of this investigation include: Replacing the internal Reading First program management; reconstituting a key peer review panel used in the program to ensure fairness and more openness in its review processes; and providing additional guidance to contractors and subcontractors to enhance the objectivity and effectiveness of their services. 
   In order to codify many of these recommendations made by the Inspector General and reform steps taken by the Department earlier this year, I joined my committee colleague, Mr. Castle, in introducing the Reading First Improvement Act. Instead of slashing funding for this highly successful program, I call on my friends on the other side of the aisle to enact this legislation to ensure permanent and long-standing reform to Reading First. 
   To date, the bill has seen no action, not in subcommittee, not in full committee, and not on the floor. To think that we are cutting this program's budget by more than 60 percent when a measure to reform it is sitting right before us demonstrates how truly politically driven the majority's actions are on Reading First and continue to be. 
   Nonetheless, it is clear to any fair-minded person that the management problems of Reading First are in the past. What is equally clear is that Reading First, despite past problems, has been an unqualified success for the students it is intended to serve. Indeed, my friend, the distinguish chairman of our committee said during our oversight hearing of Reading First earlier this year, ``The purpose of this hearing is not to evaluate the effectiveness or strengths or weaknesses of the Reading First program. I support the Reading First program, as do many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.'' 
   Statistics bear out the chairman's and my own continued support for Reading First. For example, data released earlier this year shows that in Reading First schools, the percentage of first graders meeting or exceeding proficiency on fluency outcome measures increased by 14 percentage points, from 43 to 57 percent, from 2004 to 2006, with the percentage of third graders increasing by 7 percent during the same period of time. 
   And a 2006 Center on Education Policy survey found that 97 percent of school districts which reported increases in student achievement indicated that Reading First was a key reason for this progress. 
   Madam Chairman, rather than taking into consideration this data and the improvements that the Department has made in its implementation of Reading First, the majority has decided it is better to make a political statement against the administration than to provide the critical resources needed to continue to address the needs of our most disadvantaged young students. 
   By finding some $75 million in savings through reducing administrative costs at the Department of Health and Human Services and implementing programs for prisoners that the President did not request funding for, while keeping intact his faith-based prisoner reentry initiative, my amendment restores some of these resources. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I would like to engage the chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies in a colloquy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate all your efforts in bringing this bill forward and thank you for your continued support of the Nation's chartered schools, which increase the academic achievement of our Nation's most low-income students. I wanted to clarify the committee's intent to fund the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities program, which received $36.6 million last year. This year, the committee chose to increase funding to the Charter School Grant program and folded the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities program into this larger program. 
   Charter schools are public schools created by teachers, parents and other community stakeholders to educate students of all backgrounds and educational abilities. In exchange for greater accountability for student achievement, these schools are free from many local and State regulations. This flexibility and accountability has allowed individuals with nontraditional backgrounds to create cultures that have made charter schools top academic performers, often in some of the Nation's largest urban centers. Because of this unique approach to education, demand for these schools has been remarkable over the last decade. 
   Unlike other local school districts, however, public charter schools cannot levy property or other taxes for building and infrastructure. Thus, public charter schools must pay for their facilities from their operating budgets, which are smaller than those received by their conventional K-12 peers. In fact, locating suitability facilities remains the greatest challenge faced by charter schools. 
   The Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities program provides vital assistance to help charter schools meet their local facility needs. Under this program, funds are provided on a competitive basis to public and nonprofit entities, and consortia of those entities, to leverage other funds and help charter schools obtain school facilities through such means as purchase, lease and donation. Grantees may also use grants to leverage funds to help charter schools construct and renovate school facilities. 
   Was it the intent of the chairman to continue funding for the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities program, as part of the Charter School programs and at their fiscal year 2007 levels?

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of Mr. Kline's amendment to restore funding for the Labor Department's Office of Labor Management Standards to its fiscal year 2007 level. 
   A column published in Wall Street Journal's Opinion Journal noted today that Congress has added $935 million to President Bush's fiscal year 2008 budget request for the Department of Labor. Within that budget increase are individual funding increases for every single enforcement agency within the agency; that is, except for one. 
   The appropriations measure before us cuts the Office of Labor Management Standards' budget $2 million below its fiscal 2007 funding level and more than $10 million below the President's budget request for the office this year. 
   Identifying OLMS as the only enforcement office at the Department of Labor to have its budget cut is significant. In fact, it was clearly singled out by design. 
   Why? Perhaps it's because the office has had such great success in protecting rank-and-file union members. Consider this, since 2001, OLMS has helped obtain over 750 convictions and restitution of over $70 million in criminal cases of embezzlement, election irregularities and violations of union members' rights. 
   Last week, for example, a union financial secretary in Michigan pleaded guilty to falsifying union reports. Earlier this year, a former union president in Texas was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison for embezzling dues paid by hard-working union members. These are the types of results Congress expected when it passed the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. 
   This law makes clear that a union member must have access to union financial records and has the right to recover misappropriated union assets on  behalf of the union when the union fails to do so itself. 
   Nearly 50 years later, and with more than 15 million American workers contributing a portion of every paycheck they earn to labor organizations, we should demand nothing less than what we demanded in 1959. Indeed, Congress expects the Securities and Exchange Commission to protect the interests of shareholders, and so too must we expect the OLMS to protect the interests of rank-and-file union members. 
   The amendment before us would restore $2 million to the OLMS budget, bringing it back to the fiscal year 2007 level and ensuring it has the resources its needs to safeguard union transparency and accountability. Indeed, if my colleagues believe, as I do, that transparency is the key protection against financial misconduct, then we should take OLMS off the political chopping block by restoring its funds. 
   I thank my Education and Labor Committee colleague, Mr. Kline, for offering the amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in opposition to the bill at this time and in this form. 
   Consideration of this bill is a somber occurrence. It reminds us that less than 3 months ago, workers at the Imperial Sugar refinery in Port Wentworth, Georgia, lost their lives to a tragic workplace accident. Even today many others remain injured. 
   As with any workplace accident of this magnitude, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, was dispatched to the scene to investigate what went wrong. Preliminary reports indicate that the explosion was linked to combustible dust, a known hazard for which at least 17 OSHA standards currently apply. 
   OSHA has 6 months to complete its investigation, a time frame that I think is appropriate for any injury of this seriousness. I expect that investigation to provide us a thorough, candid examination of exactly what went wrong so that steps can be taken to prevent such an accident in the future. 
   Among the first questions OSHA needs to answer is whether existing safety guidelines were followed at the Imperial refinery. This question is fundamental. It will tell us whether the cause of this accident was a lack of sufficient safety standards or a failure to follow the standards that exist. 
   The bill before us today presumes that current safety standards were insufficient. But the truth is we don't yet know whether that is the case. Less than 3 months after the accident, OSHA has not even had an opportunity to complete its investigation. We cannot possibly provide effective new safety standards when we don't know which standards, if any, we're lacking.  
   I understand why we're here today. Like Chairman Miller; Representatives BARROW and KINGSTON, who represent the refinery and surrounding areas; and all Members of this body, I grieve for the workers who lost their lives. But making an end run around a proven process for establishing workplace safety guidelines is the wrong answer at the wrong time. 
   The bill before us proposes a highly proscriptive regulatory mandate in an excruciatingly compressed time frame. More concerning still, OSHA, the agency that would be responsible for implementing these new requirements, does not believe this bill will produce the most effective safety measures.     
   Of course, this is not to say that we should do nothing in the face of such an accident. To the contrary. I believe OSHA has a responsibility to complete a thorough, aggressive investigation of the accident at the Imperial Sugar refinery to determine its causes and consider whether additional regulatory guidance is needed. If it becomes clear that existing standards are ineffective, OSHA should move forward with a robust regulatory process that provides clearer, more effective guidance on combustible dust. 
   I want to be clear on this point. This bill at this time, and in this form, is not the only opportunity to strengthen safety standards for combustible dust. OSHA itself has not ruled out additional regulations if it becomes clear that the 17 existing standards that apply to workplaces with combustible dust hazards are not effective or clear enough to protect workers. 
   The danger of combustible dust in the workplace is a serious concern, and I am committed to appropriate and effective safety measures. That is why we plan to offer an alternative proposal today that calls for a more comprehensive approach that would include stakeholder input and expertise in any regulatory action that may be needed. 
   We had hoped to see another amendment made in order, as proposed by Representative Kingston. Because of the compressed timetable in the bill, OSHA will not have to take into account economic feasibility of the standard. Mr. Kingston's amendment would have simply asked that a study on the job losses resulting from the standard be reported to Congress. Surely it would not have been too much to ask whether Congress was exacerbating job losses in an already weakening economy. But, unfortunately, that amendment was not made in order. 
   Still, I continue to believe we can work together in good faith to protect worker safety without undermining the proven road to developing effective, enforceable safety protections. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, although the changes in this amendment are modest, they are a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, they simply do not go far enough. 
   Specifically, this amendment includes a cosmetic change to the requirement that OSHA include National Fire Protection Association standards among its new mandates. As Chairman Miller knows, the NFPA standards are voluntary guidelines that offer a far more complex, stringent protocol that may be adopted in whole or in part by industry participants. These guidelines play an important role as voluntary practices that can enhance safety efforts, but they are entirely inappropriate as a replacement for effective OSHA rulemaking. 
   So while I appreciate that this amendment removes a direct mandate for a specific NFPA standard, I remain deeply concerned that the amendment retains the requirement that OSHA include relevant and appropriate NFPA standards in the final rule. I fear that this may be a distinction without a difference. 
   The amendment includes other modest improvements, including a more reasonable time frame for implementation of the engineering controls in the interim standard. It also clarifies that the final rule would be developed under more normal and inclusive procedures. Both of these steps improve the underlying bill, but because they fail to fully address concerns about the bill's abbreviated timeline, they are half measures at best. 
   However, I do appreciate the gentleman's efforts, and I will support the amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   As Representative Wilson has made clear, this amendment will ensure OSHA takes the necessary steps to protect workers against the hazards of combustible dust. It demands an aggressive investigation into the Imperial Sugar refinery, it requires that OSHA utilize the findings of its National Emphasis Program on dust hazards, and it calls for a comprehensive, inclusive and effective standard to be established if it becomes clear that existing safeguards are not protecting workers. 
   The amendment fulfills our shared commitment to workplace safety, and it does so without undermining the credibility of the rulemaking process. I urge its adoption.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2669, the cleverly titled College Cost Reduction Act. And what I would like to encourage my colleagues to do, in listening to this debate, is try to find what in this bill actually will cut or lower the cost of a college education.     
   There will be a lot of talk about cutting subsidies to lenders. There will be a lot of talk about lowering student interest rates, which actually then is paid to graduates of college, but what are we doing to hold down the cost of a college education? The cost of higher education has been going up more than four times the rate of inflation for the last 20 years, and we have not done anything to lower those costs. 
   This bill allegedly has been crafted to balance fiscal responsibility with significant new aid for college students and their families. In fact, the majority touts the bill as the most substantial package of new benefits since the GI bill. But under the microscope, it is clear that these claims fall completely flat. 
   In reality, this legislation is nothing more than a Trojan Horse for new entitlement spending at the long-term expense for American taxpayers. Even though we are considering this bill under the expedited procedure of budget reconciliation, which, as my colleagues know, is intended for real deficit reduction, this bill simply and shamelessly exploits the process. It cuts roughly $18.58 billion over 5 years in payments to student loan providers but simultaneously spends more than $17 billion during that same period on multiple programs, including nine new entitlement programs. So while they are talking about cutting mandatory spending, they are actually creating nine new entitlement programs, an apparent net savings of less than 9 percent. 
   These new entitlements include grants to Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian and other minority-serving institutions, grants to institutions with low tuition, grants to institutions to create new teacher preparation programs, grants to philanthropic organizations, a new mandatory Perkins loan program, cooperative education grants, and on and on and on. These sound like wonderful things, and I think what we are really seeing is that Democrats are Democrats. Give them an opportunity to spend money, they can't help themselves. 
   History has proven that once Washington, DC creates a new entitlement program, it never ever dies. In other words, taxpayers will foot the bill for this onslaught of new entitlement spending for years to come. These same students that will be given some savings through some of these special entitlement programs eventually are going to have to pay for them in higher taxes that they will provide later. During that time, it will certainly dwarf the token ``savings'' found in H.R. 2669. 
   It should be noted, too that much of this new entitlement spending is aimed at colleges, universities and philanthropic organizations, which we have never done before. The Federal Government has been sending Federal money to the students directly. Now they are sending it to organizations rather than to the students. This represents a historic departure from the intent of Federal student aid programs. As long as the Higher Education Act has existed, student aid entitlement dollars have been targeted towards students themselves. It is lost on me how sending these funds to institutions rather than to the students attending them helps more Americans pay for college. I doubt that we will see any reduction in tuition rates when they get this new money. But that is just what H.R. 2669 aims to do. 
   What is more, Mr. Speaker, other proposals included in this bill, such as the interest rate cut for certain college graduates included in the ill-fated Six for '06 legislation passed earlier this year, will have even more explosive long-term costs that could amount to tens of billions more in Federal Government spending. Who will be paying for it? You guessed it. The American taxpayers. And don't forget the cut to interest rates would not aid a single college student. Only graduates. Rather, the benefit would be aimed squarely at those who by definition no longer attend college. While the intent of this new spending is admirable, it is equally misdirected. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Bush has threatened a veto of this disingenuous legislation and for good reason. With billions in new programs, most of which are directed toward institutions and graduates rather than students, those who really need the help to get into college and stay in college to get on the ladder to achieve the American Dream, this bill marks the first step towards an explosion in new, unchecked entitlement spending and another unfortunate step toward further hyperinflation in college costs. 
   Indeed, the measure before us overreaches by creating new entitlement spending for every conceivable constituency in higher education. It overreaches by failing to focus on the historical Federal roll in higher education supported by Democrats and Republicans alike: helping low-income students. And it overreaches by extracting too much out of the Federal Financial Aid Program, which has been a success by all measures. 
   I cannot support it, and I ask my colleagues to join me in opposition. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I think this has been a very interesting debate. 
   At the beginning of the debate, I asked our colleagues to please listen carefully for anything they might hear that would lower tuition rates, that would lower the cost of a college education. I have listened very carefully, and I haven't heard anything. 
   I have heard a lot of talk about investment, I have heard a lot of talk about new spending, and a lot of these things sound wonderful. It reminds me kind of when I would take my children to sit on Santa Claus's knee. He would ask them what they want. They would tell him all the wonderful things, and many times I wished I could have been Santa Claus and just give them all that they wanted. Sometimes it comes back to reality and the parents have to make some tough decisions based on our budget. 
   I think people that are listening to this debate realize that there is no free lunch. With all of the new programs, nine new entitlement programs, somebody is going to have to pay for those. 
   I just entreat those who are watching to not create nine new entitlements, to place the interests of colleges, universities, graduates, philanthropic organizations above the needs of low-income students. Let's not put this price on our children and our grandchildren. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, if bridging the gap between low-income students and their dream of a college education is a primary goal of this House, then this substitute should be adapted with ease. That's because this amendment nearly doubles the Pell Grant increase provided by the underlying bill. 
   It makes Pell funding available year around for students seeking to finish their degrees more quickly by taking summer courses, which also makes a savings for them, and it eliminates a role that needlessly punishes students attending low-cost schools by limiting the amount of Pell Grant funds they can receive each year. 
   First some background. Less than a third of savings in the underlying bill, roughly $6 billion, is directed to the most successful student aid program on the books today, the Pell Grant program. 
   In fact, more funds under the base bill are directed toward those who are, by definition, no longer even students. This is done by temporarily phasing down interest rates on certain loans being repaid by college graduates. 
   The remaining third of the bill triggers billions of dollars in new entitlement spending, including nine new areas of entitlement spending all together. In fact, some of this new spending is not even directed towards students, but rather to institutions, like colleges, universities, and philanthropic organizations. 
   This Pell Grant substitute will tip the balance back toward low-income students struggling to pay for their college education by increasing the maximum Pell Grant far more than the underlying bill. Specifically, it would provide for $9 billion in additional funding for Pell Grants over the next 5 years. Again, that's nearly double what the underlying bill would do. 
   Here's how we do it. This Pell Grant proposal adopts the same cut to lender insurance rates from 97 to 95 percent as the underlying bill, while having the same goal of reducing administrative fees paid to guaranteed agencies as well. 
   In addition, this substitute would save the Federal Government about $11 billion through lower special allowance payments. 
   I believe this structural savings is far more responsible than the underlying bill which, much like the President's fiscal year 2008 budget, fails to take into account the fact that Congress cut some $18 billion from the student loan programs just last year. 
   With these savings, more than $15 billion in total, this amendment corrects current law to equalize the Pell and direct loan rates for PLUS loans at 7.9 percent. It retains bipartisan language from the underlying bill to permit members of the Armed Forces the ability to defer their loans for up to 13 months upon returning from service.  
   Most importantly, it invests more than $9 billion in the Pell Grant program. This investment would allow us to increase the maximum Pell Grant by $350 in 2008, compared to the smaller increase in the underlying bill, and by $100 for each year thereafter. 
   On top of that, this measure would pay down the deficit by $5.74 billion. That's more than three times what the underlying bill would dedicate toward deficit reduction.     
   Also included in this substitute are key college cost reforms, including the College Affordability and Transparency Act legislation that I introduced earlier this year to arm parents and students with more information about college costs than ever before. The measure also would take important steps to insist that colleges and universities be held more accountable for their role in the college cost crisis. 
   Mr. Speaker, through my substitute amendment, we would increase Pell, decrease the deficit, more directly address college costs and put in place a handful of other student benefits without creating a single new entitlement program. We would accomplish all of this without creating a new maze of rules and regulations for students, parents and institutions to navigate. And, we would accomplish all of this without shortchanging the low-income students who need the most help to get on the ladder to achieve the American dream. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me say how relieved I am that the measure we are considering today does not incorporate the highly controversial STAR Act, which would turn over the entire Federal student loan program to Washington bureaucrats. I appreciate the chairman for not including that. 
   I continue to strongly support healthy competition between the government-run Direct Loan program and the market-based Pell program, and doing anything to upset that competition would be terrible for students, parents and taxpayers alike. Nonetheless, I would be remiss if I did not express some concerns about the extent of the Pell cuts in H.R. 2669. 
   After cutting some $18 billion from our student loan program during a budget reconciliation process in the last Congress, an additional cut of more than $18.75 billion this year strikes me as overreaching. Though this figure is close to the President's cut in his latest budget proposal, I believe the administration itself went too far and gave very little consideration to the impact of the cuts we made in the last Congress. 
   I also believe supporters of H.R. 2669 did not take into account the impact the bill's cuts may have on student loan default rates. When I became chairman, 12 years ago, of this subcommittee over higher education, the default rates were running about 25 percent. And through competition and the things that we have worked on during that time, we have cut that rate to where now the default rate is running at about 5 percent. If it gets back up to those higher ranges again, that is going to cost the American taxpayer another $11 billion a year. 
   House Republicans are already on record as having supported savings from some of the lender subsidies, and there may well be room to go even further. Later today, in my substitute, I offer cutting $15 billion, which is a little less than the underlying bill but may still be too high. Only time will tell. But we must be cautious to not overreach. 
   The majority often takes aim at student lenders and seeks continual and excessive cuts as a way to punish them for daring to make a profit. You know, businesses have to make a profit or they don't remain in business. And if they don't remain in business and making loans to students, running about $70 billion a year now, if they don't continue to make those loans, some would say, well, then the direct lending program can take it over, which means the Department of Education, which there have been some criticisms of, would become the largest bank in the world, doing all of the student loan system. Early in my tenure here, they had to shut down their program because they couldn't keep up, and it was a much smaller program at the time. I have very great concerns of turning the whole student loan program over to the Department of Education. 
   The real victims in all of this debate are the smaller lenders. The large lenders, which is kind of a paradox because they are the ones that we seem to be going after, they will survive, and they will even get better. The small lenders that help those that need the small loans, it takes about $7,000 for a lender to make a profit on these loans. In my community, kids going to the community colleges need a much smaller loan. The tuition, the fees and everything run less than $1,000 a year. And if they take out a loan to cover that, the lenders that are making that loan really aren't making any money; they are doing it as a service. They are not going to do that for long. When they keep getting hit with these kind of cuts, they will just get out of the program, and then, eventually, it will be turned over to the government-run program. 
   Let me just give a couple of examples here of the things I am concerned about. The Navy Federal Credit Union right here in Virginia that holds $280 million in Federal loans; or San Miguel Federal Credit Union that holds $140 million; or Simmons First National Bank in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, that holds $86 billion; or Sovereign Bank in Reading, Pennsylvania, that holds $79 million; Commerce Bank and Trust in Topeka, Kansas, that holds $60 million; or Zion's First National Bank in Salt Lake with $67 million; will these lenders still be in a program offering loans to their local citizens, or will they be driven out of the program by large lenders such as Sallie Mae? That is something that time will tell as we keep cutting the subsidy that the Federal Government gives now to help these small businesses remain to give the help to those students that need the loans the very most. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I again think that this has been an interesting debate today. I thank the chairman for giving us the opportunity to offer our substitute. I know he didn't have to do that, and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss some of the differences and to present an alternative. 
   For years I served as subcommittee chairman on the Higher Education Subcommittee. And during that time, I talked about accessibility, accountability and affordability for higher education. The only opportunity that people have to better their lot in life here in this country is through education. And I have seen studies that show that 40 percent of our young people from lower-income families are not able to go to college. And that is just not acceptable. And I think that with our substitute, where we put an additional almost $10 billion into Pell Grants, I think that is a tremendous opportunity to help the affordability aspect of college. 
   Again, through this bill, there is nothing done to lower the cost of tuition, to make the higher education experience more affordable. As I said, the cost of a higher education during the last 20 years has gone up four times faster than the rate of inflation. Mrs. McMorris Rogers mentioned earlier, in her State, the cost of tuition has gone up in the last few years 80 percent while the cost of inflation has gone up 20 percent. Again, that is still four times faster. It has gone up faster than the cost of health care. And I think that that is a crisis that in some way we need to come together on. State governments, the Federal Government, students, parents, we all need to come together, come to grips with this issue because to prepare a workforce that is going to carry us through this 21st Century and be competitive throughout the world, we are going to have to do something to make it possible for our young people to get a higher education. 
   I don't think adding new entitlements is the way to do it. I think increasing Pell Grants is very important. And for that reason, I encourage our colleagues to support the amendment, the substitute amendment. If that passes, then support the bill. If it doesn't pass, I encourage them to vote against the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. This rule would provide for consideration of fiscally irresponsible legislation that will create nine new entitlement programs and misdirect billions of dollars in aid towards colleges, universities, college graduates and even philanthropic organizations, rather than low-income students and parents and those who need it the most. 
   My colleagues who were around in the last Congress may remember that when we passed a real budget reconciliation bill, the Education and Workforce Committee found some $18 billion-plus in savings, two-thirds of which we directed towards deficit reduction and one-third of which we directed towards increased student benefits, for real students, such as higher loan limits, more grant aid for low-income, high-achieving students and loan forgiveness for high-demand teachers. Unfortunately, H.R. 2669 takes us in a drastically different direction.  
   The rule before us provides for continued abuse of the budget reconciliation process as a backdoor way to implement significant changes to programs best addressed through regular order. Not a single committee hearing has been held on this bill. The potential impact of many of its student loan cuts has never been weighed and no one has provided adequate reasons regarding why or how many of the nine new entitlement programs created under the bill are necessary or fiscally responsible. 
   So, by creating a bundle of new entitlement programs, complete with new bureaucracy, rules, regulations, this bill places billions of dollars in new Federal spending on autopilot with no accountability to taxpayers whatsoever. Instead, this measure could be improved by infusing more savings into the Pell Grant program. Pell is a proven success that has helped millions of young people attend college, and I am grateful that this rule will give the House an opportunity to move billions out of new, misdirected entitlement spending and into Pell later today. 
   Even so, the rule allows for the continuation of a budget reconciliation process that has been flawed, abused and used as a springboard for billions in new entitlement spending. As a result, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the rule and the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this debate represents a series of colossal missed opportunities. The new Democratic leadership of the House promised us and the voters a fair, open, honest, and, yes, democratic process in considering major pieces of legislation. Instead, today we are stuck with unfair, closed and heavy-handed terms for our debate, terms that were tucked into an unrelated rules package less than a week ago. 
   Not only was that move unprecedented, but it also means that during today's debate on a minimum wage increase, what you see is what you get. No comprehensive alternative has been allowed. No amendments will be considered. In fact, I didn't even get a chance for those types of considerations before the Rules Committee because, well, the Rules Committee didn't meet on this issue. There was no hearing. 
   That is unfortunate because, frankly, there are Members on both sides of the aisle who support a balanced minimum wage increase, and this bill, this early in the Congress, represented an opportunity to work together toward a true, bipartisan, bicameral consensus. But we won't, and that is a colossal missed opportunity. 
   My colleagues will remember that last summer the Republican majority brought forward and passed legislation to increase the Federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour with important considerations for small businesses and their workers. Many Democrats joined us in advancing the measure. In fact, had a few more on the other side of the Capitol supported this measure, today's debate would be unnecessary because the minimum wage increase would already have taken place. 
   Nonetheless, I was hopeful that when we considered minimum wage legislation under the new Democratic majority we would again do so with our Nation's small businesses and their workers in mind, particularly since both the President and the Senate majority leader have indicated their willingness to forge such a consensus. But it is apparent that we are not here on this side of the Capitol, and that is a colossal missed opportunity. So later in this debate I will offer a motion to recommit that would provide them the very protections that the Democratic leadership's bill does not. 
   Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, my friend, the ranking Republican member on the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. McCrery from Louisiana, and I introduced minimum wage legislation that,  quite frankly, puts the bill before us today to shame. It is a three-pronged measure that includes the same, the same, minimum wage provisions that are in the Democratic leadership's bill. 
   As you can see on the chart, here is the unbalanced Democratic plan. It does raise the minimum wage. Then the comprehensive Republican plan. It also raises the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 per hour over the 2 years, in precisely the same increments as the Democrat leadership's bill. 
   Also identical to the Democrat leadership bill, the Working Families Wage and Access to Health Care Act that we offered yesterday would extend the Federal minimum wage to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. We don't stop there, however. But the Democrat leadership does, another colossal missed opportunity. 
   As you can see, the Working Families Wage and Access to Health Care Act not only increases the minimum wage in the same exact manner as H.R. 2, but it also would expand access to affordable health care for working families, including many families that may benefit from the wage increase. The Democratic leadership's scaled-down proposal does not include this. 
   For the last several Congresses, Republicans and Democrats alike have joined together behind legislation that would significantly expand access to health coverage for uninsured families across the country by creating Small Business Health Plans. 
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Americans who have no health insurance is about 46.5 million. Estimates indicate 60 percent or more of the working uninsured work for or depend upon small employers who lack the ability to provide health benefits for their workers. To ease the burden on small businesses and provide meaningful benefits to those who work for them, the Working Families Wage and Access to Health Care Act would allow small businesses to join together and purchase quality health care for workers and their families at a lower cost. 
   Now, during today's debate, we are likely to hear from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle about how a certain percentage of the American people support a minimum wage increase. By the same token, my colleagues also should be aware that a whopping 93 percent of Americans support creating small business health plans; and 36 members of their own Democratic caucus supported them in the 109th Congress. Doing so again during this debate would not only be logical but it would be welcome news for scores of uninsured working families. But the Democratic leadership's bill won't allow for it, and our bill simply isn't allowed at all. A colossal missed opportunity. 
   Finally, as you can see, only the Working Families Wage and Access to Health Care Act includes a number of other important considerations for small businesses and their workers. Small businesses create two-thirds of the Nation's new jobs, and 98 percent of the new businesses in the U.S. are small businesses. Increasing the minimum wage increases costs for small employers, and often they may be forced to respond by reducing their number of workers, scaling back benefits or hiring fewer new employees. 
   Given that small employers are responsible for most of the new jobs in our Nation, and practically every new business, why would we do anything to endanger their momentum? Well, you would have to ask the Democratic leadership, because that is exactly what their proposal would do. By offering small businesses and their workers important protections, the Working Families Wage and Access to Health Care Act would protect American jobs. The House Democratic leadership's scaled-down minimum wage proposal will not. A colossal missed opportunity. 
   Mr. Speaker, only the Republican-led Working Families Wage and Access to Health Care Act will both raise the minimum wage and protect small businesses and their workers. And only the Republican-led Working Families Wage and Access to Health Care Act will both raise the minimum wage and expand access to affordable health care for working families. 
   Unfortunately, due to unfair, closed, and heavy-handed tactics, only the scaled-down Democrat leadership plan is before us today. A colossal missed opportunity, not just for the House but for working families and small businesses as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I am happy now to yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Fortu&#241;o), a member of the committee. 
   Mr. FORTU&#209;O. I thank the gentleman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in strong support of a Federal minimum wage increase that is applicable under the same terms and conditions to all 50 States and Puerto Rico. I support a Federal minimum wage increase because it would strengthen the economy as well as provide long overdue benefits to our working, middle-class families who are the backbone of our Nation's economy. 
   However, I am concerned that the bill under consideration, while seeking a long-awaited increase in the Federal minimum wage, does nothing to offset the impact on small businesses and their workers. This is particularly important for Hispanics in the United States who, according to a recent report released by the U.S. Census Bureau, are opening businesses at a rate that is three times as fast as the national average. 
   Only one bill, the Working Families Wage and Access to Health Care Act, offers a balanced approach that would provide for a minimum wage increase without threatening the backbone of our economy or penalizing small businesses. Our bill increases the minimum wage in exactly the same increments as the bill before us today but also expands affordable health care to many of the working families benefiting from the increase and includes some important tax protection alternatives for small businesses and their workers. The Working Families and Access to Health Care Act should be carefully considered and, at the very least, deserves to be discussed.

   Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, ``If it takes adding small business tax cuts to get a minimum wage increase, we are going to do it.'' 
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said, ``This Congress promised to raise the minimum wage, and we will. We also need to pass meaningful small business incentives along with the minimum wage increase. We can do both, and we will.'' 
   I commend them. I applaud them, and I am hopeful that when we leave this body, we will join together in a bipartisan, bicameral way.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The gentleman said that this Congress will remember the little guy. The small businessmen that we are trying to help, for the most part, are little guys. 
   I remember when I first started in business. It was a small family business. We had two stores. My dad ran one, and I ran one. I couldn't afford any employees. I had to wait until a friend came in and I could ask him to watch the store for a minute so I could use the restroom or maybe grab a sandwich, or I would just eat standing behind the counter if I didn't have any customers in. So I understand the problems that we are facing. 
   And if we could all focus back on the debate today, the substitute bill that the Republicans wanted to put into play that Mr. McCrery and introduced yesterday does exactly the same thing as the Democratic bill on increasing the minimum wage. But it also goes further, to help small businesses to provide health care to the workers, which I think is very important. And  we are missing a wonderful opportunity to join together in a bipartisan way to work to help more people.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of time. I appreciate the debate. I appreciate the job that you have done as Speaker. 
   This debate, Mr. Speaker, has been a good one, one marked by thoughtful dialogue on both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately, that thoughtful dialogue is limited to the last 3 hours, and only the last 3 hours. We didn't have any dialogue in the Committee on Education and Labor, we didn't have any dialogue at the Rules Committee, and because of the unprecedented terms for today's debate, the dialogue that did take place here on the floor certainly won't lead to any improvements in this legislation, at least here in the House. However, I do hold out hope that in the weeks to come, as those on the other side of the Capitol take up this issue, we can build upon this unbalanced legislation and extend proper protections to small businesses and their workers. 
   Nevertheless, the measure we are poised to vote on in a few minutes is marked more by what is not in the bill than what is in it. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. They create two-thirds of our Nation's new jobs, and they represent 98 percent of the new businesses in the United States. What protection does this bill provide them? None whatsoever. 
   The same small employers are looking for a more cost-effective way to offer health care benefits to their employees, just as large corporations and labor unions across our Nation can do because of economies of scale. What protections does this bill offer these same small employers? None whatsoever. They are the ones that are going to be providing these jobs that are going to be paying the higher wages, and they are getting no relief, no help. As a consequence, people, many people, one study says 1.6 million people, will end up losing their jobs as a result of this. 
   Working families, many of whom would benefit from a minimum wage increase and many of whom depend upon small businesses, are looking to Congress for innovative solutions that would improve their access to affordable health care. What protections does this bill provide them? None whatsoever. 
   My colleagues, we can do better. In the interest of sending the President a final measure that provides consideration for small businesses and their workers, the very men and women who are responsible for our economy's recent growth and strength, we must do better. And I believe, once Congress completes its work, we will do better. In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to oppose this unbalanced legislation. 
   As this debate continues in the weeks to come, I am hopeful that all of us will be mindful of the concerns and the sacrifices of small businesses in each and every one of our districts. If we do that and if we provide them the protections they need and deserve, I am confident that the final product we send to the President's desk will be far superior to the unbalanced and scaled-down measure that we are about to vote on. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Yes, Mr. Speaker, I wish to respond. 
   Mr. Speaker, my motion should be ruled germane. The bill before us, brought to the floor under unprecedented circumstances, circumstances that have not been ``fair, open, and honest'' by any means, would raise the minimum wage mandate by 41 percent, with small businesses and their workers left unprotected. 
   Considering that more than 7 million new jobs have been created in the last 3 1/2 years, and that two-thirds of all new jobs are provided by small businesses, I ask my colleagues, why in the world would we leave them unprotected and endanger this incredible momentum? 
   My motion provides a fair alternative that increases the minimum wage in exactly the same manner as the Democratic leadership's bill; expands access to affordable health care by establishing small business health plans; and extends important protections for small businesses and their workers. 
   My motion should be considered not only germane but a proposal far superior to the Democratic leadership's unbalanced minimum wage proposal.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, this motion is straightforward in purpose, but for millions of uninsured Americans, it would be incredibly meaningful in practice. During today's debate, many of us, particularly those on this side of the aisle, have talked about the need to expand access to affordable health care. As I noted earlier, when discussing my comprehensive minimum wage package, I believe this debate presents us a tremendous opportunity, not only to impact wages, but to improve working families' quality of life as well. 
   Therefore, I offer this motion in the same spirit as that comprehensive measure. It would ensure that if an employer offers health coverage to his or her workers, an incredibly costly yet incredibly important employee benefit, then this employer should not be further burdened with a 41 percent minimum wage mandate imposed by H.R. 2, a mandate thrust upon these employers without any protections at all for small business and their workers. 
   Mr. Speaker, to speak about the benefits of this proposal, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. WILSON), who has been working this very issue for many years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and, more to the point, I rise in strong opposition to the decidedly unfair closed and heavy handed process that preceded our time on the floor today. 
   Over the past several years, few would argue with the assertion that the Education and the Workforce Committee was among the fairest committees when it came to member input from both the Republicans and Democrats alike. Likewise, it was home to some of the most robust debate in the House. From No Child Left Behind and the pension reform to the reauthorizations of the Older Americans Act and the Higher Education Act, our panel held extensive hearings and markups prior to the floor consideration of all major pieces of legislation within our jurisdiction. For that, our committee and the House were better off. 
   I have little doubt that this will, in large part, I hope, continue over the next 2 years. But in the early days of this Congress, I can't help but be concerned about the way the new majority has turned its back on regular order. As we consider legislation with such far reaching consequences, for example, the bill before us today impacts education and labor's largest entitlement program, but not a single hearing or markup was held on it prior to its arrival here on the floor. We didn't actually see this bill until last Friday afternoon. And not a single bipartisan  conversation took place as the legislation was written and rewritten time after time by the majority leadership. 
   The last time we were on the floor considering a major higher education bill, the process we followed to get here was decidedly different. Before we sent the College Access and Opportunity Act to the floor last spring, countless hearings and markups were held in the Education and Workforce Committee where Members debated, amended and voted on the legislation. In fact, through subcommittee and full committee processes we addressed over 100 amendments from both sides of the aisle. We even considered a 40-page manager's amendment that we worked for weeks on with both sides of the aisle. But today we have nothing of the sort, and for that and for the closed rule thrust upon us today, I am deeply disappointed. 
   Now the other side has said, well, it was understood during the campaign that we would bring up six items, we would eliminate the democratic process, we would just bring them to the floor, shove them through, and everybody understood that process. 
   In fact, if I were watching this debate, I would think that right now, I would, when I get my paycheck this week, I would have a higher paycheck if I were working under the minimum wage. That has already been taken care of. And I think that probably some students are thinking that next week their loan payment is going to go down. This process is maybe being rushed on this side, but before a bill becomes law it has to go through the other body and it has to be worked out, the differences, and then it has to go to the President, and the President does not support this bill that is on the floor here today. 
   Mr. Speaker, to understand the importance of a robust committee process, we need to look no further than another piece of Education and Labor Committee legislation considered by the House just last week. In it, the Federal minimum wage was increased for all 50 United States and all of our territories, all except one, that is. 
   We are now told that, as a matter of fact, our committee soon will consider legislation to correct this apparent oversight that happened last week. Still, I can't help but think that this extra step may not have been necessary had regular order been followed in the first place. Suffice to say I hope we don't find ourselves in the same situation after we act today. However, I can't help but be concerned by the fact that the underlying legislation would provide convicted felons unfettered access to the same or, in some cases, lower student loan interest rates as their law abiding counterparts, something we didn't get a chance to look at. 
   The heavy handed process carried out prior to today also has taken away our ability to improve this legislation, improvements that I believe could have been bipartisan in nature. 
   H.R. 5 is a well-intentioned bill, but I also believe it to be badly misdirected and ripe for improvement. Sadly, those many improvements, including an affordability amendment that I offered at the Rules Committee yesterday, even after I had been told that we had no chance to offer amendments and that it would be a closed rule, will never see the light of day.     
   We are stuck with a flawed bill, one that we could have made much better with little effort at all. 
   As we continue our debate today, and, more importantly, as we consider more comprehensive higher education measures in the months to come, I look forward to having a seat at the table, the same seat I provided my friends on the other side of the aisle a year ago when I was chairman. 
   In the meantime, I reiterate my opposition to this rule and urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a well-intentioned bill that I wish we had the chance to make better. Nonetheless, without the opportunity for amendments, I hope we can use these next 3 hours to analyze what H.R. 5 does and what it doesn't do. 
   Normally this is a task best reserved for regular order when you go through the committee process and have a chance to have hearings and have a chance to hear experts on the subject. We are forgoing that today because we are in this 100 hours of nondemocratic rule, and that is a result of the election. You won the majority, you use that majority the way you see fit; but I think that is unfortunate for America today. 
   Since we have bypassed that process, I would like to spend some time doing so right here today. First, let me underscore once again the fact that this bill has never been considered in committee. It includes some changes impacting the student loan industry that have never been tried before and, worse yet, they have never even been discussed in any meaningful way. Is that bad policy? Well, maybe so. But is it irresponsible policy-making? Most definitely it is. 
   Next, I caution my colleagues not to characterize what is before us today as a student aid bill. Ironically, the College Student Relief Act wouldn't impact a single college student. The way the loan program works, a student that wishes to borrow, and it is unfortunate, I think, that we are even having to have that kind of discussion today; I wish we were focusing on trying to keep the cost of education down so students didn't need to borrow a penny, but that is not going to be the debate. 
   The way it works, a student borrows the first year, the second year, the third and fourth years if they so desire; and then after they graduate from school and have a 6-month respite period, they begin to repay that loan. So this bill today addresses an interest rate that a college graduate will pay back in the repayment period 6 months after they graduate from school when they are definitely no longer students. 
   I also caution my colleagues not to buy into the talking point that H.R. 5 would save a typical borrower about $4,400 over the life of their loan because it just simply isn't true. 
   Now what the Democrats talked about during the campaign of reducing all student debt by half may have met these requirements, but not what is actually on the floor here today. The fact is that a borrower cannot save nearly this much because under H.R. 5, the bill we are discussing here today, the interest rate phases down from the current 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over a series of 5 years. The borrower, for them to receive the complete $4,400 in savings, the 3.4 percent interest rate must remain in effect the whole time and it only is actually in effect the last 6 months, and they must consolidate their debt at that time and stretch the repayment out over the whole 15 years. 
   However, Democratic leaders have crafted the legislation to ensure that the 3.4 percent rate stays in effect only from July 1, 2011, through January 1, 2012, 6 months. On January 2, 2012, the interest rate returns back to the current 6.8 percent making the $4,400 in savings impossible to achieve. 
   In reality, a college freshman in the fall of 2011, when the rate is at 3.4 percent, would end up saving $6.42 a month. That's right, $6.42 once he or she begins repaying their student loan. 
   More broadly, H.R. 5 falls woefully short in dealing with what I consider the twin priorities for addressing the college cost crisis. That is, expanding access, which should be the Federal role in higher education, and enhancing affordability. Those are two very important items. 
   First, on access, as I said, by definition this legislation cannot expand college access because at its core it is not a student aid bill. Would it reduce payments for a limited number of college graduates who would see their interest rate gradually drop over the next 5 years? Yes. 
   Would it bring a low- or middle-income student any closer to the dream of attending college? Unfortunately not. 
   Compare this to the record $90 billion we are investing this year, $90 billion Federal investment this year, in student aid programs. That is an amount that has tripled over the last decade. 
   We have heard today in part of the rule debate about how over the last 12 years we have done nothing. We have tripled the amount of funding available for those who are going to higher education, under the Republican majority in Congress, I might add, and it is difficult to understand why our friends on the other side of the aisle act as if they have a monopoly on the college access debate.     
   On impacting college affordability, Madam Speaker, once again, this legislation falls short, and I truly did not believe this would have to be the case. 
   Consider this: On a 4-year public college education the tuition has risen 35 percent over the past 5 years. However, during the past decade, Federal aid for students has increased 300 percent.  Now, I ask my colleagues, if funding alone was the solution to the college cost crisis, wouldn't we have realized it by now? Of course we would have. And that is why institutional accountability is so important. It is at the very heart of the college cost crisis. 
   Yesterday, I introduced legislation, the College Affordability and Transparency Act, to help parents and students hold institutions more accountable for their role in the college cost crisis. I also submitted it, or tried to submit it, as an amendment to the Rules Committee, because I believed it was a vehicle through which we could have drastically improved the underlying legislation. Unfortunately, however, the closed process has placed the issue of affordability on the back burner, and these proactive commonsense reforms will have to wait for another day. 
   That is right, giving parents and students more information, in an easy-to-use format, about college costs and outcomes? That will have to wait for another day. 
   Establishing a system of simply and unmistakably comparing the cost increases of one institution against another? That will have to wait for another day. 
   And asking colleges that increase their costs the most and most often to identify ways to bring tuition under control on behalf of parents and students? Well, that too will have to wait for another day. 
   What is most disappointing is that many of these same reforms were passed by the House last year and Members on both sides of the aisle have backed exactly this type of approach. But to see them move forward from here, we will just have to wait for another day. 
   In countless ways, Madam Speaker, we can do better than H.R. 5. I just wish we had that opportunity. Because although the bill before us, as well-intentioned as it is, is just not what it seems. It is not a student aid bill, it doesn't expand student access, and it doesn't enhance affordability of a college education. 
   In the weeks and months to come, I hope we can work in a bipartisan way toward all of these things, and I look forward to working with Chairman MILLER, Chairman KILDEE, and Members on the other side of the aisle to ensure that this happens. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume just to correct the record a little bit. 
   Last year, when we did the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, we dealt with over 100 amendments, both Democrat and Republican, through the committee process that we have forgone today. And when we did take that money last year in the Deficit Reduction Act, we put over $9 billion back into students. 
   What we did with that money for students, and these are students in school, we took the 4 percent loan fees that were being charged to many students and cut all loan fees to 1 percent. For the average borrower, that is, for students in school, it gave them a savings of $525. 
   One of the problems we find is that students in their first and second years tend to drop out of school because they do not have enough money. So we gave them more of a chance to have their loans up front, and we increased those loan limits by $1,000 per year, from $3,500 to $4,500 for first- and second-year students. 
   And we did some other things: High-achieving, low-income students in the first and second years are able to obtain additional grant aid. High-achieving, low-income students that major in math, science or certain foreign languages are eligible to obtain an additional $4,000 in grant aid for their third and fourth years of college, and on and on. We put $9 billion of that back directly into student and student aid. 
   Madam Speaker, I now yield to another ranking member of the committee, the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle), such time as he may consume.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate my good friend from New Jersey talking about promises. My opponent during the campaign, and I don't know if this was the full Democratic Party, but what he said was they were going to cut student loan rates immediately in half. I know as we got here in Washington and they assumed the majority, we were told that that would cost about $60 billion. So they had to cut back that promise to what they have done now is a phased in approach that cuts the student loan interest rate ultimately at the end of 5 years to 3.4 percent for subsidized loans, which is considerably smaller than their original promise. I just wanted to correct the record with that. 
   I am happy now to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Platts), a member of the committee.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   What I would ask of people that are following this debate, if they would take the numbers and then realize that what the bill does, it takes the loan rate, which is 6.8 percent, and reduces it to 6.1 the first year, and then incrementally drops it, and then the last 6 months, this is a 5-year bill, the last 6 months it goes to 3.4 percent. 
   If you will take those numbers and figure out how much to borrow each year to get to the 14,000 and then pay it off over the 15 years, if they consolidate the loan, pay it off over the whole 15 years, there is no $4,400 of savings. It is more in the neighborhood of a little over $2,000.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I really want those who are watching this debate to understand how much I  understand the importance of a higher education, how important it is and how necessary for someone to really achieve the American Dream; they need to get as much education as they can. 
   What we are looking at with this bill, though, really what it does is, if you look at it from July 1, 2007, to July 1, 2008, it cuts the fixed rate of student interest loans from to 6.8 to 6.1. A year later, it cuts it to 5.44; a year later to 4.76; a year later to 4.08. And then ultimately, 5 years from now, January 1, 2011, it cuts for 6 months the rate to 3.4, which is what they are saying is, it cuts the interest rate in half. Well, it does for 6 months of the 5 years that this bill covers. 
   I think what we need to really look at is the College Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance has done a study, and they show that 48 percent of low-income students cannot even get into college, into a 4-year institution. Twenty-two percent cannot even get into a community college because they cannot afford the upfront money. 
   What I am saying is what we should be looking at, even though we are putting in $90 billion this year, three times more than just 10 years ago, it is still not enough to provide all of the things we would like to do for all of the students that need the opportunity to go to college. 
   So, if you have to look at just what resources you do have, what we are saying is, why do we not put those resources to those students that are trying to get into college, rather than give a bonus to those that are graduating and are now going to repay a loan; and that is what this bill does. 
   Those who have been fortunate enough to graduate are going to receive about $1 million more income in their lifetime than those who do not get to go to college. We are saying in the time of limited resources, why do we not try to help those who are trying to get on that economic ladder to realize the American Dream rather than give a bonus to those who have graduated. 
   Even if you listen to the full debate, we are not even telling them the full facts. We are saying we are cutting your interest in half. For 6 months, we are cutting it in half. The other time, it is a phased-in cut over 5 years, and then it goes back up to the rate of 6.8 percent. 
   When I was chairman of the subcommittee when we did the last reauthorization in 1998, we came up with an interest rate that was the lowest in the history of the student loan business, and we did that in a bipartisan way, and it was good for students. 
   Now interest rates have changed, and in a bipartisan way last year, we set the rate at 6.8 percent, which is what it is now, which is a pretty good interest rate. Would I like it to be lower? You bet. 
   But I really think that we need to focus on helping those students, especially the lower- and middle-class that are just trying to get into school, that it will be 5 years. First they have to get into school, have enough money to pay their tuition and fees and make it through the 5 years to graduate, and then they start reaping some of the benefits of this as they repay their student loans.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to respond to some of the comments of my good friend, Chairman Miller. 
   He mentioned that Republicans keep coming to the floor and saying this won't help students. Let me get away from Republicans and just read a few comments of people from the press. 
   The first is in the Chronicle of Higher Education. The quote is: ``The question is, What are you achieving by cutting the interest rate? asked Jamie P. Merisotis, President of the Institute for Higher Education Policy, a Washington-based research group.'' Not Republican. He stated, ``You are not encouraging any more students to go to college because you are cutting the interest rate on loans that students have already taken out.'' 
   Another one, Sandy Baum, a senior policy analyst at the College Board and an economics professor at Skidmore College, said the interest-rate proposals ``costs a ton of money and is not a well-targeted policy.'' That was in Chronicle of Higher Education. 
   In Congress Daily: ``The much-touted Democratic measure to slash in half student loan interest rates over 5 years has been drafted to offer only temporary relief with the lowest rate of 3.4 percent effective for only the last 6 months of 2011.'' 
   Now since we didn't have the opportunity to debate this bill in committee or explore it to any great extent, I can only guess that the bill was crafted so that the 3.4 percent interest rate is only in effect for half of that last academic year because the Democrats know the interest rate cut is unsustainable in that it would cost $22 billion if it ran for 10 years. 
   Another thing that was mentioned is that this will cut all student loans by half. I am hopeful that those students that are now in college that will benefit from this at some point out in the future when they become graduates will check to see if they are in a subsidized loan because they are the ones that will be covered. They should also check when they graduate to see what interest rate they will pay because again this just takes effect year by year. It doesn't reach the ultimate half until 5 1/2 years from now. And also, those who are not on subsidized loans, don't get too excited about this because your loan interest will not be cut. 
   Another thing that the chairman mentioned was that there was an article, a Wall Street analyst referring to this felt that it was okay, that this wouldn't hurt and you could still buy mutual funds and everybody would get along just fine. I read the same article, and I think he was referring to Sallie Mae, the giant, the largest lender, and he said he felt they would be okay, especially based on the promise that the hit was going to be for $60 billion, and when the bill was finally written last Friday it was $6 billion. He was comparing what they will have to live with versus what the original promise was of the $60 billion cut which would have cut all student loans in half instead of reducing year by year a little amount until we get to only the subsidized loans and only for 6 months that they enjoy that cut before it goes back up to the 6.8 percent.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, since the Republican majority's record on student aid has been one of the things we have focused on today, as well as the Democratic leadership's rhetoric over the past few years, I believe it might be useful to take a few minutes to be perfectly clear about where Members on this side of the aisle stand when it comes to expanding college access. 
   Now, I was really interested in the gentlewoman from Nevada's discussion about her family, because that is the beautiful thing about this country, that you do have the opportunity to go to college. My dad, during the Depression, didn't have the opportunity and my mother didn't have the opportunity. I was the only one of five sons that was able to graduate from college. It took me 30 years. I graduated with my oldest daughter. 
   We have six children. Four of them have graduated from college and two are still working on it. We have 28 grandchildren. So I have a big interest in the opportunities of education, and I am hopeful that all of my grandchildren will be able to get an education. 
   Before Republicans gained control of the House in 1995, there had been no serious congressional effort to address the issue of rising college costs or even discuss it. We have seen the charts. We have seen how from the time Pell Grants were instituted, all the time that the Democrats were in charge, they got the Pell Grants up to $2,000. In the 12 years that we had the majority, we more than doubled that and put much more money into Pell Grant relief and to other student aid projects. 
   Similarly, there has been very little discussion on whether our colleges or universities were producing graduates who were ready for the job market. In fact, the entire American competitiveness discussion we are having these days was not on the minds of those inside the Beltway at that time. But over the course of the past decade, we have made it a priority, often working in a bipartisan fashion. We gathered facts, talked within the higher education community, and worked to craft legislation that represented a fresh approach to policy. 
   In fact, as I said earlier, we have been talking about student loan interests. And when we did the reauthorization in 1998, in a bipartisan way, we came up with the lowest interest rate in history, which has afforded many, many more students the opportunity to go to school. But what we came up with was something that was not necessarily revolutionary, but at the same time, it was vitally important. 
   It was a two-pronged approach. First, we made an unprecedented commitment to student aid, and today our efforts are paying off. Some $90 billion in Federal resources currently fund student aid programs, from loans and grants to work-study programs and education tax benefits. That is nearly triple what it was just a decade ago. And within that $90 billion is a record $13 billion for Pell Grants, a two-thirds increase over the past decade. That is a record we should be proud of. 
   On top of that, we have also eliminated a troubling shortfall in the Pell  program, placing it on a sound financial foundation for years to come. Beyond that, just last year alone we enacted legislation to increase loan limits to give students access to more financial aid; reduce loan fees so students can keep more of what they borrow, and this is students I am talking about, money they can put in their pockets; established $4.5 billion in new grant aid for low-income students studying math, science, and critical foreign languages, as well as high-achieving Pell eligible high school students; and we permanently expanded loan relief for highly qualified math, science, and special education teachers who commit to teaching in high-need K-12 schools for 5 years. These are things that really help us in K-12 and in higher education. 
   To pay for these new student loan benefits, which again included $4.5 billion in new grant aid for our Pell students, we reduced the subsidies paid to student loan lenders by more than $20 billion, as the chairman previously stated. We need to be thoughtful about increased cuts to the private sector so that we don't leave students with the poorly run direct loan program as their only option. 
   In short, Madam Speaker, our commitment to student aid has never been stronger. Anyone who says otherwise simply is not being candid. 
   The second and equally important part of our two-pronged approach to expand college access gets to the heart of the college cost crisis itself, the actual cost of a college education. This is what we really should be talking a lot more about instead of trying to get a little, small reduction in the interest rate. We should be trying to cut the total cost. 
   In short, we are aiming to bring greater accountability to an unchecked system so that consumers of a higher education have more information than ever before about the cost of a college education. As a result, we have dramatically shifted the college cost debate. A decade ago, the interest of students and colleges were seen as identical, and the conventional wisdom was that colleges knew what was best for students. A decade ago, the higher education establishment made clear that simply adding more Federal student aid was the solution to the problem of rising costs and that there was no point in questioning why costs rose. 
   Today, while we maintain an unprecedented commitment to student aid, we have also identified students, parents, taxpayers, community organizations, and employers as legitimate stakeholders in the outcomes produced by our higher education system. We are asking hard questions of colleges, such as why costs are so high, how successful the college is in helping students graduate on time, which helps keep costs down, and whether the college will give them the skills needed to compete successfully in the workplace. 
   Admittedly, we have gotten some blow-back. Some of these colleges don't want to answer these questions. They want us to just leave them alone, send more money. But you know what? We were and are right to demand such accountability, and we will continue to do so. 
   I wish we were able, as part of this debate, but the closed process under which we are operating won't allow that possibility. Still, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we do so in the weeks and months to come. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I agree with much of what the majority leader just said. I think we do have to expand access. We have to give opportunities to students. 
   My real concern is at the end of this debate, I am hoping that students understand that the 6.8 percent interest right now, tomorrow, doesn't go to 3.4; even if the Senate were to act on this and pass this bill exactly, that it would be almost 5 years, and then it only is cut in half for a 6-month period. So that if you look at how much they really would save over the period of a repayment, the way it works is when they graduate, 6 months later, they have to, or they have the opportunity to consolidate their loans and they can take all the loans because they get one their first year, one the second year, third year, and if they go through in 4 years they probably up end up with four loans. They consolidate those loans and they will take the interest rates, well, anyway, they are 6.8 now, and then they go to 6.1 and then they work their way down to 3.4. They will take how much they borrowed each year. They consolidate those loans. They average those out, and they will probably get a reduction of about like 4 1/2 percent. And if they borrow the maximum during that period of time, they will end up with a savings of a little over $2,000, not $4,400, as some are saying. 
   I think it is really important to really have the true facts out there so that we don't give people this idea that tomorrow my interest rate is cut in half. 
   And also, that only pertains to the 50 percent of students that are borrowing on the subsidized basis. I know the promise during the campaign was, we are going to cut student loans across the board in half for all students. But when you tested that out you found out it cost about $60 billion, and to comply with the PAYGO they had to come back with this reduced offer. 
   Again, it will help people that have graduated from college, but those people are already well on their way to realizing the American Dream. If we could just take this same amount of money, the savings and try to help those who are trying to get into college, that is probably the major difference in our debate, is how we help people get an opportunity, not those who are now graduating and are benefiting from the college graduation and also benefiting from this reduced student loan rate.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to respond to my good friend from Texas, whom I have worked with in the 1998 reauthorization when we helped the Hispanics, adding the title that helped the Hispanic community. He was one of the strong leaders that really helped his people and community. We worked together then. We worked together last year in bringing the bill to the floor that unfortunately died in the Senate, but it would have reauthorized the Higher Education Act. 
   I want to congratulate him. I understand he is going to be the chairman of the subcommittee in this Congress, and I am looking forward to working with him. 
   But I just want to say one thing to straighten the record out, we took $20 billion in the Deficit Reduction Act last year from the student lenders. We put $9 billion of it back into student services to help them; the balance we used in the deficit reduction which resulted in the $71 billion decrease, the deficit right now, versus last year.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume just to respond to the words that we just heard. 
   If a student in 5 years takes out a loan, they will not save $4,000, because this ends at the end of 5 years and the 3.4 percent is only good for that 6 months, the last 6 months of the bill. Then the loan goes back up to 6.8 percent. So at the end of 5 years, the student will be paying the same as they are now. 
   We just have to keep the facts correct. The rhetoric is good, but we should try to keep the facts correct. 
   Madam Speaker, I would be happy to yield 6 minutes to my friend the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston).

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Let me remark again, as I said earlier, the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance issued a report saying that 48 percent of our low-income high school students are not able to enter a 4-year university, and 22 percent of them cannot even get into a community college. I think we are in total agreement that we want to do what we can to help them get into school, and the numbers are not much different for the middle-income students. 
   The one thing that we are not really talking about too much is the cost of the education. I am concerned that the young people are graduating from college with a mortgage and no home. This debate we are hearing is all about the interest rate on that mortgage, on that loan, but what we should really be addressing is the cost of higher education. 
   I would like to just mention a few things that are driving that cost of education, some examples of some extravagant spending on college campuses, that if we had held hearings, we could have talked about a little bit. We have done this over the past when I was a chairman. We did have some hearings about this, but let me get some of these in the RECORD. 
   Cornell is investing $259 million in what it calls student life and residential facilities alone. 
   Ohio State University is spending $140 million to build what its peers enviously refer to as the Taj Mahal, a 657,000-square foot complex featuring kayaks and canoes, indoor batting cages and ropes courses, massages and a climbing wall big enough for 50 students to scale simultaneously. 
   The University of Cincinnati is spending $250 million on a Main Street of sorts, with everything from outdoor cafes to what is called a mall-style student center. 
   The University of Houston spent $53 million on a wellness center, including hot tubs, waterfalls and pool slides. The school has a 5-story climbing wall, while boulders and palm trees frame the leisure pools outside. 
   The University of Vermont plans to spend $70 million on a new student center, a colossal complex with a pub, a ballroom, theater, an artificial pond for wintertime skating and views of the mountains and Lake Champlain. 
   Now, we are not going to be able probably to talk about extravagant spending by the schools because we are not talking about the cost of college. We are talking about the cost of student loans that, because of this extravagant spending, students are having to take out to go to college. 
   Makes me want to go back to school. Some of these things sound pretty enticing. Some are pretty nice.     
   But what about the kids that are trying to get an education? They don't really, some of them, have time to use these hot tubs, anyway. They are working to put their way through school. Why don't we focus some of that stuff on the cost of an education rather than on just trying to save a few students who have already graduated, who are already on the ladder to receiving the American Dream.

   Mr. McKEON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, once again, we just heard that 5 years from now somebody that takes out a loan will save $4,400. Five years from now, there will be no savings based on current interest rates which are 6.8 percent because that is what the rate will go back to. There will be a 6-month window; if somebody takes a loan out at that point, that particular loan they will repay at 3.4 percent. The rest of the time it goes back. 
   Madam Speaker, let me be clear. Had this debate been held in the Education and Labor Committee, I believe the bill we are slated to vote on in a few minutes would have been substantially better. 
   What could we have done in committee to improve upon this badly flawed legislation? 
   For starters, we would have been able to change the fact that college students won't even feel the slightest impact from this plan until they begin repaying their loans when they aren't even students anymore. In other words, we would have made clear that this proposal does nothing to expand college access. And, as a result, we could have done better. 
   Had we done our work through regular order, rather than providing 5 years of gradually increasing benefits to college graduates, we could have crafted a reform measure that continues our commitment to real student aid, a reform measure, while ensuring a sharper focus on institutional accountability. And, as a result, we could have done better. 
   And, had this bill gone through committee we also would have been able to work to ensure this proposal included language that improves college affordability. We would have discussed the fact that we are spending some $90 billion this year on Federal student aid, triple what it was just a decade ago, and we also would have reminded one another that even in spite of this dramatic increase in aid, tuition continues to skyrocket. And, as a result, we could have done better. 
   In committee, Madam Speaker, we also would have more quickly exposed those who were playing fast and loose with the facts. For example, when some on the other side of the aisle say that a typical borrower would save about $4,400 over the life of his or her loan because of H.R. 5, we would have made clear that this simply is not possible. We would have explained to our committee colleagues that for a borrower to receive the complete $4,400 in savings, the 3.4 percent rate must stay in effect for years at a time rather than the 6-month window, and they must consolidate their loans and stretch out repayment over 15 years. 
   In reality, Madam Speaker, for a college freshman who receives a loan at 3.4 percent in the fall of 2011, the only semester during which such loan rate will be available, he or she would save a whopping $6.42 a month in repayment. That is right, $6.42, thanks to the bait and switch tactic disguised as a sunset in this flawed legislation. 
   Consider this: If we were to put the same savings into Pell Grants, for example, that H.R. 5 earmarks for these gradually reduced interest rates for college graduates, we could increase Pell by about $500. 
   I only wish we were afforded that opportunity. However, we weren't, and the legislation before us is little more than a reflection of the broken process by which it was cobbled together.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, as I have said repeatedly today, the process followed to get this bill to the floor was badly flawed, and the legislation in question is a reflection of that. Our inability to amend the bill means that the bill we have before us today is exactly the same well-intentioned, yet completely misdirected proposal the majority leader thrust upon us just days ago. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle have been touting H.R. 5 as a student aid bill during this debate. However, as we have pointed out time after time, not a single college student or potential college student will benefit from this legislation. It impacts only those who graduate when, by definition, they are no longer students. 
   However, Madam Speaker, this motion would transform H.R. 5 from a critically flawed gimmick into a proactive measure that indeed could benefit borrowers, students, and taxpayers alike. 
   To begin, this motion would not block the new majority's promise to reduce college loan interest rates. In fact, it would allow reductions to take place as scheduled for many of the very same graduates who would benefit from them in the first place. However, to ensure that those graduates who could pay their loans under a higher interest rate will do so, this motion establishes an income cap of $65,000, the income level at which the existing student loan tax deduction is phased out, at which the interest rate for a loan will revert back to the current level of 6.8 percent. 
   That is almost twice the average family income of a student eligible to receive a subsidized student loan. However, graduates who may not have as high an income, those men and women who need a little extra help after graduation, will see their interest rate stay at the same exact level as directed by this legislation, as will active duty Armed Forces personnel. 
   This means for many first responders, nurses, teachers and other graduates who choose public careers, their interest rates will remain as scheduled, under H.R. 5. In other words, this motion will maintain most of the same borrower benefits embraced by the Democratic leadership. However, unlike H.R. 5, this motion reduces college loan interest rates and then some. By making the interest cap adjustment I just described, this motion will generate additional savings within the legislation, savings that can be directed toward deficit reduction or an increase in need-based aid such as Pell Grants. 
   I have argued throughout today's debate, and for years, frankly, that our first priority in higher education must be to expand access for low- and middle-income students. This motion embodies that very philosophy. 
   With the savings we will generate as part of this motion, we could provide more aid to a student struggling just to find the means to pay for college. Sadly, more than 400,000 students are fully prepared to attend 4-year college, but will be unable to do so due to record high financial barriers, according to the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance. For these students, the promise of a college education is an empty one, and for our Nation, the loss of human capital is a serious economic and social tragedy. 
   Under H.R. 5, highly paid college graduates would reap the benefits, but those struggling to find a way into school, they are forgotten altogether. It is ironic that the very same Members who supported the minimum wage increase a week ago for ``fairness'' reasons are today champions of a bill that would undermine that same principle. 
   Madam Speaker, a ``yes'' vote on this motion is a vote for lower college loan interest rates, more needs-based aid, and additional funds to pay down the Federal deficit. A ``no'' vote is a vote for providing benefits to well-paid graduates, not low-income students. 
   Let's give borrowers, students, and taxpayers a better deal. Let's improve this flawed legislation. Let's vote ``yes'' on this motion to recommit. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I am pleased to rise in support of the rule on the conference report for the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act. This rule will allow the House to give final endorsement to a bill that will strengthen and improve the Head Start early childhood education program. 
   I would like to begin by recognizing members of the Education and Labor Committee for their efforts to produce this bipartisan conference report. Representatives CASTLE and KILDEE, along with Chairman Miller and our staffs, have done great work to strengthen and improve this critical program. 
   In more than 50,000 Head Start classrooms around the Nation, nearly 1 million disadvantaged children are being given the tools and resources to help put them on a path to success which is a win-win for the country. 
   We have spent a great deal of time this year working to strengthen the No Child Left Behind Act. That law is, at its most basic level, about closing the achievement gap in our Nation's schools. However, the gaps between disadvantaged students and their peers do not begin in elementary school. That's why we have Head Start. This program is designed to help close the readiness gap in children before they ever enroll in school. The health, developmental and educational services offered through this program truly do give a head start to those children than they otherwise enter school already lagging behind.     
   Some studies have shown that children enrolled in Head Start do make progress, but there's significant work yet to be done in closing that readiness gap. I also believe it's critical to strengthen the financial controls in Head Start so that we can prevent the types of waste, fraud and abuse that have been uncovered over the past 5 years. Republicans acted aggressively to root out cases of financial abuse and mismanagement. We sought the expertise of the Government Accountability Office to identify weaknesses in the financial control network of the program. Through this bill, we will institute structural changes to prevent future breaches in the program's trust. 
   Our committee has been working to strengthen and reform this program going on 5 years, and I believe that dedication has paid off. Certainly this  bill is not perfect, but on issues where there were disagreements, I am pleased that we have forged compromises. Head Start is a good program, capable of achieving even greater results. With this bill, I believe we can make that happen. 
   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on behalf of this rule, and I look forward to House passage of this conference report so it can go to the President for his signature.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Since 1965, the Head Start program has been instrumental in our efforts to close the gap between disadvantaged children and their peers. This program provides health, developmental and educational services to low-income and at-risk children before they enroll in school in order to help close the readiness gap. Head Start helps establish a foundation for these children's future success. 
   This conference report is the product of a bipartisan collaboration and compromise. I'd like to thank Chairman Miller, along with Mr. Castle and Mr. Kildee. And I appreciate Mr. Kildee's words, and I appreciate the opportunity I've had to get to know him and work with him closely over the years. I thank them for their work to strengthen and improve Head Start. 
   I'd also like to acknowledge the staff on both sides for their instrumental role in developing this legislation. Their work was critical to producing such a strong, widely supported measure. On my staff, I'd like to recognize Kirsten Duncan, along with Susan Ross and James Bergeron, for their tireless efforts on this legislation. 
   Studies have shown that children enrolled in Head Start do make some progress. We also know that even greater results are possible. 
   With this in mind, the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act will strengthen Head Start's academic standards by emphasizing cognitive development and the results of scientifically valid research in topics critical to children's school readiness. The conference report will improve teacher quality by ensuring a greater number of Head Start teachers have degrees and are adequately trained in early childhood development, particularly in teaching the fundamentals. 
   Despite the many successes of the Head Start program, it's reputation has, unfortunately, been marred in recent years by instances of financial abuse and mismanagement. In communities across the country, we've heard reports of taxpayer dollars being squandered. A March 2005 report from the Government Accountability Office warned the financial control system in the Head Start program is flawed and failing to prevent multimillion dollar financial abuses that cheat poor children, taxpayers and law-abiding Head Start operators. 
   This conference report builds on efforts of Republicans in the 109th Congress to address weaknesses in the Head Start financial control system in order to better protect taxpayers and ensure funds are being used to help prepare disadvantaged children for school. 
   I'm particularly pleased that the conference report includes strong protections to ensure Head Start dollars are not used to pay excessive salaries to program executives. The House voted unanimously last week to instruct conferees to include clear, unambiguous protections in this area. Thanks to that vote, we were able to visit the negotiations and agree to even stronger language.     
   Mr. Speaker, the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act is a solid reauthorization bill built on bipartisan collaboration. Head Start is a good program capable of achieving even greater results, and the bill before us will help achieve that goal. 
   I support passage of this conference report so we can send the bill to the President. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. 
   I am pleased to be here in support of a conference report that will make Head Start even stronger. This program serves nearly 1 million underprivileged children and eases the divide between the haves and the have-nots when it comes to preparing them for kindergarten. The bipartisan support we've seen today should lend all of us confidence that the program will remain on a solid foundation for generations to come. 
   By reauthorizing Head Start, we're going to strengthen academic standards by emphasizing cognitive development using scientifically valid research, improve teacher quality by ensuring more Head Start teachers have degrees and are adequately trained in early childhood development, increase financial disclosure requirements by Head Start operators as custodians of Federal Head Start grants, and require local governance boards to actively oversee grantees. These are commonsense reforms that I wholeheartedly support. 
   I would like to join the Republican leader and my other colleagues who have spoken here today in commenting on the bipartisanship with which this bill was brought to this point. It's one that the President will sign. It's one that will bring good reforms to a good program. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this conference report. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (POPCORN WORKERS LUNG DISEASE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, earlier this year, the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections held a hearing that explored, among other things, the question of whether and how the flavoring compound diacetyl should be regulated by OSHA. We heard from an individual suffering from lung impairment that could well have been developed as a result of his manufacturing popcorn, during which he was exposed to high concentrations of diacetyl and numerous other chemicals. 
   There are many questions about this particular chemical. In fact, a number of large popcorn manufacturers recently announced voluntary steps to curb the use of diacetyl while its effects on worker health are studied. 
   The bill before us calls for a much more drastic response to the concerns about this chemical. It would require OSHA to set an interim final standard relating to diacetyl exposure within 90 days of passage, to be followed by a final rule within 2 years. This directive is, without a doubt, a well-intended effort to prevent illness that may be caused by this particular substance. Unfortunately, despite its good intentions, this bill has the potential to cause great harm. 
   I recognize that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle wish to do something to respond to the questions about this chemical. I also understand their frustration about a lack of action by the administration. Candidly, I share some of that frustration. It is my understanding that just this week the administration announced plans to implement rule-making for diacetyl exposure; this, despite the fact that Congress has been looking into these concerns for months and until this week had not received clear, unambiguous direction from the administration other than a letter written by the OSHA administrator expressing serious concerns about the implications of the bill. 
   From the outset of this process, I have been concerned about the lack of scientific data available to guide our actions. Without the necessary scientific understanding of this chemical, we cannot possibly develop the appropriate guidelines to protect workers. At this point, we still do not even know whether diacetyl alone, or in conjunction with other chemicals, is responsible for the condition known as popcorn lung. 
   Because of my concerns about a lack of scientific data, and because I'm uneasy about short-circuiting the proven regulatory process, I raised concerns about this bill when it was considered in committee. It's my position that the administration should be allowed adequate time to complete necessary scientific investigation before developing new standards. 
   I was, at the outset, and I remain, concerned that such a rushed response to questions about this substance make for better politics than policy. That is why I was so surprised, and frankly, disappointed, to learn that only now has the administration suddenly chosen to take action. They announced on Monday their intent to initiate rule-making, issue a Safety and Health Information Bulletin, and provide Hazard Communication Guidance. 
   The administration's actions in this case, and their lack of communication with Congress, have done nothing to shed light on this issue of concern to us all. Instead, it has resulted in confusion about what is being done to address this issue and when they and we can expect to have answers. In fact, if the administration had simply been forthright with Congress about its plans, we might not be here considering this questionable legislation at all. 
   During committee consideration, Republicans offered an alternative. Our plan, which we will offer as an amendment today, strikes a balance between acting quickly to protect workers while relying upon sound science to establish a comprehensive regulation. 
   The Republican plan would maintain the 90-day deadline for establishing an interim final rule. Under this rule, guidance would be provided so that manufacturers could take immediate steps to limit exposure through the use of engineering improvements, ventilation and other strategies to protect workers. Our plan would also maintain the requirement that a final rule be developed, including a permissible exposure limit. 
   Under our alternative, this would be required within 2 years after the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health concludes that the  standard can be supported by solid scientific evidence. 
   In short, the amendment maintains the same time frame for immediate protection, while eliminating the arbitrary nature of the final rule in favor of a timeline based on the availability of scientific evidence. 
   I want to reiterate my deep concern for the workers who have become ill. It is my goal, and surely the goal of everyone here, to determine as soon as possible what caused their illness and what can be done to prevent future occurrences. 
   Mr. Chairman, I opposed this bill in committee because I felt it did not allow for adequate scientific study. I also believed it undermined the long-standing regulatory process. However, I strongly support the effort to protect workers, and I can understand why Members on both sides of the aisle would wish to vote in favor of this measure. 
   As for me, until we can clear up the confusion surrounding this bill, I will reluctantly oppose it. I continue to believe this legislation undermines sound scientific and regulatory processes, but I will keep an open mind as this bill progresses through the legislative process. If further scientific evidence is uncovered as this bill moves to the Senate and to the President, my position could change. I only wish the administration had acted sooner and we could have been spared this debate entirely. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time and I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from South Carolina, the ranking member on the subcommittee, and ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control that time (Mr. Wilson).

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his work on this amendment. 
   We're kind of facing a dilemma. I think both of us, both sides, want to protect workers. However, we want to make sure that they're protected by sound science. 
   This amendment immediately starts the 90-day rule which would protect people from diacetyl, those working on popcorn or other products, and then it requires that within the 2 years they have the final rule based on sound science. I think that this amendment would solve the dilemma to make sure that if diacetyl isn't the only cause, we have the time to find the science to make sure that the workers really are protected. We may find that diacetyl and diacetyl alone is the cause, but if not and we have moved forward just on diacetyl, these workers will think they're protected, and in the long run they will not be. And this is why we're really concerned. We move quickly to provide the 90-day rule, but then allow the time within the 2 years to base the final ruling on sound science. 
   For that reason, I ask that we support the gentleman's amendment that would fix this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (PENSION PROTECTION TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3361, the Pension Protection Technical Corrections Act of 2008, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 2006, the Republican-led Congress passed, and President Bush signed into law, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which represented the most comprehensive reform of our Nation's private pension system in a generation. After years of thorough examination, thoughtful legislative development, and careful coalition-building, we finally restored common sense to our Nation's pension system through enactment of this landmark law. Thanks to those reforms, today's retirement security laws match the new realities of the 21st century economy, meaning that more U.S. workers will be able to count on their retirement savings being there for them when they need it. 
   The Pension Protection Act included tough new funding requirements to ensure employers adequately and consistently fund their  pension plans, provided workers with meaningful disclosure about the financial status of their benefits, and protected taxpayers from a possible multi-billion dollar bailout of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). 
   The Pension Protection Act's reforms were built on six fundamental principles that helped ensure a stronger, more secure retirement for millions of American workers. Those principles were: certainty, with a permanent and more accurate calculation of employers' pension liabilities; common sense, which enabled employers to build up a cushion in their pension plans during good economic times; stability, achieved by closing funding loopholes and ensuring employers make adequate and consistent cash payments to their plans; transparency through timely and straightforward information given to employees about the health of their retirement plans; honesty from employers and union leaders, who are no longer permitted to make hollow promises of extra benefits that will never materialize because a plan is severely underfunded; and portability, established by ensuring that hybrid plans, such as cash balance pensions--which offer portable, more generous worker benefits--remain a viable part of the defined benefit system. Having served as the Chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce during this process, I am pleased to have been part of this effort. 
   Of course, it is to be expected that in legislation of that magnitude, we did not get every word perfect, or every provision as clear as it could be. That is the point of the bill before us today--H.R. 3361 is a narrow, technical bill that corrects inadvertent errors in drafting contained in the original law, and provides necessary clarification and focus, to ensure that the law is administered as Congress intended. For that reason, I support the bill before us today, and hope that it will quickly be enacted into law. 
   I must note for the record, however, that more remains to be done. The bill before us is very narrow in scope, and addresses only those issues that are considered purely technical on a consensus basis. There are other issues that remain to be addressed. 
   For example, late last year, the Senate passed by unanimous consent its own version of a technical corrections bill, which included critical clarifications with respect to the issue of asset smoothing. I would hope that this issue is addressed in any final technical correction package that we consider. 
   Also, there are numerous provisions which Members and staff have discussed since enactment of the 2006 law, which enjoy broad, bipartisan support, but which did not fall within the scope of this narrow package of technical corrections. Going forward, it will be necessary for us to address these items, and I stand ready to work with my Chairman, Mr. MILLER, and the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Ways and Means Committee in doing so. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I reiterate my support for this narrow legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3221, the Democrat Energy Scarcity Bill. Congress must act decisively to pass a balanced, comprehensive energy policy that creates more American-made energy, spurs good jobs, corrects our supply-and-demand imbalance, lowers prices for consumers, and strengthens America's ability to compete. But the bill before us today would do none of that. Instead of creating new energy supplies for consumers, they trap America's vast energy resources under ever-more bureaucratic red tape and punitive taxes that discourage domestic energy investments. 
   As senior Republican on the Education and Labor Committee, I rise in opposition not only against H.R. 3221's remarkable lack of any new energy, but also against the sliver of the bill marked up out of the blue by our committee in June, the so-called ``green jobs'' provision in the bill. 
   I was chairman of our Postsecondary Subcommittee in 1998 when Members of both parties enacted the Workforce Investment Act, or WIA, to establish the system of one-stop career centers aimed at providing one convenient, central location to offer job training and related employment services. While these reforms have been successful, the WIA system is still hampered by often unnecessary bureaucracy that prevents it from being as effective as it could be for workers and their families. 
   In response to this, in the last Congress, the Republican-led House voted to further streamline and consolidate these programs. Today, rather than following suit, H.R. 3221 will add to the duplicative nature of these job training programs, all under the guise of ``green jobs.'' Make no mistake: this marks a significant step backwards in our effort to streamline the delivery of job training services. 
   Through the green jobs provision in this bill, though they have garnered a great deal of attention from the media and Members, it was significant enough to garner the attention of the Department of Labor. In an analysis of the language we marked up in committee earlier this year, the agency noted that the new program created under this bill would duplicate assistance that is available already to help train workers under the Workforce Investment Act. As a result, should H.R. 3221 become law, it would mean more red tape, more bureaucracy, and more hurdles for job seekers. 
   At a time when Congress purports to be so interested in enhancing American competitiveness, making it more difficult for job providers and job seekers to become more competitive themselves, surely this is not a wise course of action. 
   This reverse in course at the heart of H.R. 3221 should not be taken lightly. But given the process that has brought us here, I fear it has been. The Education and Labor Committee never held a single hearing on it, outside stakeholders had little or no time to review it, and the bill had been purposely crafted outside the WIA reauthorization process. 
   However, to meet an artificial deadline for introduction of the Democrat Energy Scarcity Bill, our committee was forced to act hastily. This ill-considered process is especially discouraging because this fall our committee is expected to begin the process of reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act. Indeed, that process is the appropriate venue for consideration of the green jobs language considered in the bill before us today. 
   If we did follow this more responsible process on the green jobs language, there are a number of questions Members could and should ask about it.  
   For one, Members should know the rationale for giving nonviolent criminals priority for training under the green jobs bill. Members also should know why the majority choose to circumvent the successful one stop program and instead insist the training for green jobs be provided through an entirely new and separate line of programs. Finally, Members should know why labor unions are given special treatment under this bill, when the local workforce investment boards and the business community, those that actually provide jobs, are left out in the cold. 
   Unfortunately, we will never get an answer to these or any other questions about green jobs on the minds of Members, because this language has been rushed to the floor. As a result, it will make our job training system more cumbersome and less efficient for both green jobs training and any other training delivered through the workforce investment system. 
   Mr. Chairman, before I conclude, I also must note my continued strong opposition to the majority's insistence on including controversial Davis-Bacon wage mandates in both this and other bills forced through the House this year. 
   Davis-Bacon wages violate capitalist values of free markets and competition, and they can inflate costs of projects by as much as 15 percent, costs that get passed on to taxpayers. Moreover, they force private companies to do millions of dollars more in excess administrative work each year. 
   At a time when we should be encouraging more investment in our energy infrastructure, as this bill purports to do, expanding this mandate is an unwise course, and one, I might add, that was never considered before the committee of jurisdiction, the Education and Labor Committee. 
   For these and other reasons, Mr. Chairman, I cannot support H.R. 3221, the Democrat Energy Scarcity Bill; and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), subcommittee ranking member on the Committee on Education and Labor.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, since 1965, the Head Start program has provided comprehensive health, developmental and educational services to disadvantaged, 4- and 5-year-olds. Head Start involves parents and communities in helping to prepare needy children to succeed in school and beyond. 
   Because this program served such an important purpose, the notion that it could be abused to enrich the lifestyles of individuals rather than the lives of children is particularly shocking to the conscience. It's hard to imagine that any individual would seek to divert precious resources away from disadvantaged children in order to finance lavish cars, homes and travel; yet that's exactly what has happened. 
   I would like to share two examples of these reported abuses which began coming to light almost 5 years ago. The head of a large organization of child care centers that operates Head Start programs in Ohio received pay that amounted to about a quarter of the public money that the centers receive each year. She owned a house in Aurora and another in Arizona. A Mercedes Benz and a Hummer were registered in the name of her centers. A portion of her salary came from Federal Head Start funds. 
   The executive in charge of the Kansas City Head Start operation was revealed to have been earning a salary in excess of $300,000 annually and driving  a Mercedes luxury sport utility vehicle leased, in part, with Federal Head Start funds meant for disadvantaged children. 
   The executive resigned after questions were raised about his salary, which totaled more than $814,000 in fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002. The Improving Head Start Act takes steps to clamp down on financial abuses. Included in the bill is a reform Republicans have championed since these financial abuses were revealed; establishment of a cap on the amount Head Start executives can earn. 
   We believe the compensation paid to a Head Start program director should be no higher than that paid to an assistant secretary at a Federal agency. Put another way, we do not believe local Head Start executives should be paid more than the Federal official confirmed by the Senate to oversee the entire program. The average Head Start teacher earns approximately $25,000 annually. 
   The Head Start program can serve a disadvantaged child for just a few thousand dollars per year. Allowing these programs to divert resources from children and teachers in order to inflate the salaries of top executives is unconscionable. 
   Head Start is a program intended to help disadvantaged children prepare for school. The House has already voted to protect Head Start children and teachers by explicitly prohibiting salaries in excess of that earned by Federal agencies' assistant secretaries. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on this motion to instruct conferees to maintain this commonsense proposal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him and his family and son, especially, who joined the Marines the day after9/11 and is now serving his third deployment. 
   I rise today in opposition to the cleverly dubbed troop readiness bill being considered. While none of us here want to be at war, the fact remains that we are. And we owe it to the honorable men and women in uniform to provide the proper tools, resources and atmosphere for victory. 
   So it is beyond my comprehension that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle must insist on limiting the authority of our military leaders and General Petraeus. 
   From the outset, this poorly crafted dwell time bill may have the faint appearance of trying to improve the readiness of units and quality of life of members in the Armed Forces, but it is just another example of the disingenuous goal masked by a clever name. In truth, the bill is a backhanded attempt to force an American withdrawal from Iraq. 
   In doing so, the bill limits the flexibility of the U.S. military commanders to conduct operations in the field and only prohibits troops deployed in Iraq. This is a point that should not be overlooked. The true intent of this legislation is obvious. There are mandates that only apply to the U.S. forces committed to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Afghanistan, another active theater in this war against terror, is not even mentioned. If this were a sincere effort on the part of my Democrat counterparts, it would apply to all deployments. 
   Mr. Speaker, the harsh realities in this bill would have lasting negative effects on our military and would inappropriately infringe upon the constitutional duties of the President of the United States as Commander in Chief. If this bill were to become law, it would paralyze our military. It would increase stress on our Armed Forces by reducing the pool of forces available and would intensify the risk of our soldiers remaining in Iraq. Moreover, it could theoretically extend the amount of time forces remain on the ground in Iraq, which would negatively impact the morale of our soldiers and their families at home. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3159 is bad policy, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Churchill once said in the midst of another war, ``Give us the tools and we will finish the job.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, it is the duty of this House and of this Congress and of this Nation to give our men and women the resources they need to see this conflict through to the end. While our troops are fighting in Iraq, Democrat leadership is crafting thinly veiled legislation to weaken their ability to succeed, and I think we must ask ourselves why. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to associate myself with the remarks that Chairman Miller just made of thanking Leader Hoyer and Mr. Sensenbrenner for the work that they began in the last Congress and persevered to bring us to this point today. 
   The Americans with Disabilities Act was enacted in 1990 with broad bipartisan support. Among the bill's most important purposes was the protecting of individuals with disabilities from discrimination in the workplace. 
   By many measures, the law has been a success. I firmly believe that the employer community has taken the ADA to heart with businesses adopting policies specifically aimed at providing meaningful opportunities to individuals with disabilities. 
   However, despite the law's many success stories, it is clear today that, for some, the ADA is failing to live up to its promise. For example, the Education and Labor Committee heard testimony earlier this year from individuals who, I would stipulate, were intended to be covered under the original ADA. But in a perverse fashion, someone who was able to treat the effects of his or her disability through medication or technology was left without protection because they weren't ``disabled'' enough. 
   I don't think that is what the authors of the original ADA intended. I don't believe it is what we intend today, and I am glad that the bill before us addresses and corrects this issue. 
   Madam Speaker, we are here today because some individuals have been left outside the scope of the act's protections by court cases and by narrow interpretations of the law. Still, others have sought to massively expand the law's protections, an equally dangerous proposition. 
   Our task with this legislation is to focus relief where it is needed, while still maintaining the delicate balance embodied in the original ADA. 
   In the months since this bill was first introduced, I am pleased to say we were able to do so. Because the ADA extends its protections to so many facets of American life, there were four separate committees with the responsibility for moving the process forward. Equally important, this compromise was forged with representatives of many of the stakeholders who will be  affected by this bill. It was truly a process of give-and-take. 
   For instance, even as we work to ensure the law's protections are extended to some who are currently excluded, such as those I mentioned earlier who were wrongly considered to be not ``disabled enough,'' we define that expansion cautiously. Through the carefully crafted language of the bill, we will ensure, for example, that someone is not ``disabled'' under the ADA simply because he or she wears eyeglasses or contact lenses. That's an important limitation, and it is necessary to maintaining the intent and integrity of the ADA. 
   Also importantly, this version of the legislation maintains a requirement of the ADA, which is that, to be considered a disability, a physical or a mental impairment must ``substantially limit'' an individual. 
   As introduced, H.R. 3195 threatened to gut any meaningful limitation on the ADA by simply calling any impairment, no matter how trivial or minor, a disability. That was not the intent of Congress in 1990, nor should it be today. 
   Madam Speaker, I support this bill, not because I think it is perfect but because I think it represents our best efforts to ensure that meaningful relief will be extended to those most in need, while the ADA's careful balance is maintained as fully as possible. 
   In recognition of that achievement, let me simply thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for honoring our shared commitment to work together on this issue that has the potential to touch the lives of millions of Americans. And I also want to thank all of the people who worked so hard--the members of the community most affected by this--and thank them for their efforts and patience in working with us. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   There are so many individuals who deserve credit for bringing us to this point today. I want to recognize Chairman Miller, the leaders of the Judiciary, Transportation and Infrastructure, Energy and Commerce Committees, and all of our staffs on all of those committees on both sides of the aisle and the membership of the leadership on both sides of the aisle, and again especially Leader Hoyer and Mr. Sensenbrenner for this open, inclusive process.     
   The bill is better for it. 
   I also want to recognize the stakeholders who came to the negotiating table and helped us to reach consensus. It's often said that true compromise leaves no one with exactly what they wanted. I expect that is the case today. There are those who fear we have expanded the reach of the ADA too far, and there are others who would have preferred us to go further. But on the whole, we have found common ground that will allow us to extend strong, meaningful protection to individuals with disabilities without dramatically expanding the law, increasing its burdens, or diluting its effectiveness.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (EXTENSION OF PROGRAMS UNDER THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 1965 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of S. 3180, a bill to temporarily extend the Higher Education Act of 1965. This bill will provide a clean extension of the Higher Education Act for 1 more month as we continue to work with our Senate colleagues to hammer out a conference agreement. 
   The underlying reauthorization of the Higher Education Act is long overdue. Since 2003 Congress has passed twelve extensions, two reconciliation bills, an emergency student loan bill, and the House has passed two reauthorization bills. In the reauthorization bill passed by this Congress, we strengthened Pell Grants, improved the Perkins Loan program, and expanded access to college for millions of American students. The reauthorization bills also included important reforms that will provide more transparency to American families on the cost of college. A recent report found that since 1983, the cost of keeping colleges running has outpaced the consumer price index by 48 percent. The average total for tuition fees, room and board, for an in-State student at a public 4-year college is $13,589. It jumps to $32,307 for a student attending a private 4-year college. Tuition and fees have increased by an average of 4.4 percent per year over the past decade, and that's after adjusting for inflation. Students and families need to be able to plan for these increases, and that's exactly what we are proposing, through greater sunshine and transparency. We need to complete the reauthorization process to make those proposals a reality. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a clean extension bill that will allow the current programs of the Higher Education Act to continue past their current June 30, 2008, expiration date until July 31, 2008. Programs like Pell Grants and Perkins Loans are the passports out of poverty for millions of American students. We must complete our work on the conference agreement prior to the August recess. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on S. 3180. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the headline atop the front page of yesterday's edition of the Virginia Tech student newspaper captured what all of us are feeling right now: ``Heartache.'' On behalf of my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee, my staff, my family, and my constituents, I extend my deepest sympathy and offer my prayers to Virginia Tech students, staff, administration and families. 
   Our institutions of higher education are places where students begin to embrace adulthood, where they begin to relish a new found freedom and indeed where they begin to realize their dreams. For that to be cut short for these young men and women by such a senseless act is beyond anyone's comprehension. So all we can do is mourn, comfort one another and pray that the Virginia Tech community and our Nation may begin to heal in the aftermath of this unspeakable tragedy. 
   The collective feeling inside of this building over the last few days is much like the feeling we experienced on September 11 and the days that followed when we cast aside our differences and united to stand with the victims, their families and their communities. Today, just as back then, it is a time not for politics or a time to take advantage of such a horrific turn of events to push a partisan agenda. And similarly today, just as back then, it is not a time to misdirect any blame toward anyone other than the perpetrator of this massacre. In this case, as we currently understand it, this blame belongs squarely to a single gunman who acted selfishly, brutally and without regard for human life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also believe that we owe sincere and heartfelt gratitude to Virginia Tech's administration, law enforcement officers, faculty and students for the way they have handled these last 3 days. Simply put, no one  could have imagined this series of crimes that has risen to the level of the deadliest in U.S. history. These men and women have done their very best to respond to it. And as we witnessed at the convocation a day ago in Blacksburg, they are doing so with a deep respect and love for the campus they call home. 
   May that spirit carry them through the difficult weeks, months and years ahead. And may we learn from their example as we tackle the challenges that we face as a Nation in the aftermath of this great tragedy.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution to honor the women's basketball team at Rutgers University for their incredible accomplishments on the court, as well as their courage and integrity off the court. 
   Led by head coach Vivian Stringer, the Scarlet Knights won their first ever Big East conference tournament championship this year and advanced to the national championship in Cleveland just 2 weeks ago. Though they lost that game to the University of Tennessee, these young women made the 2006-2007 season one to remember for Rutgers students, alumni and fans. 
   Unfortunately, just hours after the national championship game, they were confronted with some disheartening comments by a radio personality. Throughout all the media coverage that followed these comments, these young women handled themselves with an impressive amount of integrity, with grace and with strong character. As a result, it is their accomplishments on the court, not the comments off the court, for which they should and will be remembered. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Rutgers University women's basketball team is comprised of student athletes in the truest sense. They have an impressive collective grade point average, a solid selection of majors and a record in the classroom that matches their great work on the hardwood. On the court, these young women have dedicated themselves to improving and honing their skills through many hours of practice both during the school year and during academic recesses. 
   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Scarlet Knights on these accomplishments and wish them the best of luck in all they will take on in the future, and again, I am pleased to honor these young women through this resolution. I believe they have set an example from which many other collegiate athletes can learn.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 21, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank him for his work on this budget. 
   I rise in opposition to the second largest tax hike in American history. This agreement before us includes a tax hike of at least $217 billion by fiscal year 2012. Worse yet, the budget includes a troubling tax hike trigger that would automatically raise taxes even higher if surpluses do not materialize due to unrestrained Federal spending, a habit I don't expect Congressional Democrats will break any time soon. 
   This agreement also includes a reconciliation instruction for the Education and Labor Committee. I have supported reconciliation as a means to reduce the deficit in the past, in just the last Congress in fact. But clearly deficit reduction is not a priority in this budget. The fact that our committee is the only panel with this instruction reflects this. Instead, I am afraid this instruction might leave the door open for the majority to abuse the process in order to give Washington bureaucrats a greater stranglehold on student loans than ever before through a greater emphasis on the government-run direct loan program. 
   Let me be clear: I stand ready to strengthen Federal student aid programs by promoting competition among and within the loan programs while providing additional funds for low income students to attend college. This is just what we did through reconciliation in the last Congress. 
   However, Mr. Speaker, I won't stand idly by while the majority attempts to drive a stake through the heart of the market-based loan program. This would be terrible news for students and taxpayers alike, and I will do all I can to fight against it.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me start by commending my friends, Chairman Miller, Chairman Kildee and Mr. Castle, for their hard work on this good bill, which I am so pleased we were able to pass with an overwhelming bipartisan majority in committee 2 months ago. 
   While the resources to fund Head Start are significant, more work is needed to achieve the ultimate program goal on closing the readiness gap between Head Start children and their more advantaged peers as they enter kindergarten. 
   Some studies indicate that children enrolled in Head Start do make some progress, but at the same time we need to understand that we still have some work ahead of us in closing the readiness gap. With this in mind, the bill before us today will strengthen Head Start's academic standards by emphasizing cognitive development and the results of scientifically based research in topics critical to children's school readiness. 
   The measure also aims to improve teacher quality by ensuring a greater number of Head Start teachers have degrees and are adequately trained in early childhood development, particularly in teaching the fundamentals. That's great news for those children who will be participating in the Head Start program years down the road. 
   I have also been disappointed that in recent years we have heard many stories that have marred Head Start's good name. In various communities we found that financial abuse within Head Start centers is far too commonplace. In fact, a March 2005 report from the Government Accountability Office warned that the financial control system in the Head Start program is flawed in failing to prevent multi-million-dollar financial abuses that cheat poor children, taxpayers and law-abiding Head Start operators. 
   In the 109th Congress, Republicans led the House in passing a Head Start reauthorization bill that addressed these weaknesses in the Head Start financial control system. I believe the bill before us moves in that direction as well. It will require Head Start operators to meet a range of financial disclosure requirements as a condition of receiving and keeping their Federal Head Start grants. Furthermore, under this bill, grantees would have to be overseen by a local governance board that provides direction and actively oversees program activities. These are positive steps to ensure abuses are minimized, and that taxpayers' funds and the children those funds are meant to serve are protected. 
   Mr. Chairman, while this bill does represent overall progress for Head Start, I would be remiss if I did not note that there are some significant flaws in it, flaws that I hope we can correct before this measure is sent to the President. For example, under this measure the majority has decided to expand Head Start eligibility to those who the program was not designed to serve. Ultimately I believe this policy change may have the impact of leaving many children who live in poverty underserved by Head Start programs. This runs contrary to what we all believe to be the mission of this program and will do nothing to strengthen Head Start services; if anything, it will weaken them. 
   I am also disappointed that the House will not have an opportunity  today to vote on an amendment offered yesterday at the Rules Committee by Mr. Fortu&#241;o, to protect the civil liberties of faith-based providers by clarifying that these institutions are not required to relinquish their Civil Rights Act hiring protections when they participate in the Federal Head Start program. These protections are already the law of the land with regard to various Federal programs, including those impacting welfare reform and Community Service Block Grants. In fact, President Clinton himself signed such language into the law. 
   The Fortu&#241;o amendment also would have ensured religious organizations would not be forced to remove art, icons, Scripture or other symbols in order to receive Federal Head Start grants. Barring these providers from fully participating in Head Start is not only a disservice to the faith-based providers, but also to the children who depend on the Head Start program and the taxpayers who should know that Federal dollars are granted to the best available service providers, faith-based or otherwise. Instead, the majority thrust upon us an amendment that praises the work of faith-based organizations, but does not protect their civil rights. It's literally all talk and no action. Indeed, the only people protected by this amendment are certain members of the majority party seeking political cover. Faith-based providers are left to fend for themselves. 
   Mr. Chairman, in spite of these flaws, which I hope we can correct in time, the Improving Head Start Act remains a solid reauthorization measure. Head Start is a good program that is capable of achieving even greater results, and the bill before us will help us get there. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleagues for a productive debate on the Improving Head Start Act. As many of us have noted throughout the day, Head Start is a good program that can be made even better, and that is why we are here. I hope everybody listened carefully to Mr. Castle as he talked about the importance of the upcoming amendments we are going to discuss because they can make the bill better. 
   This program serves nearly 1 million underprivileged children and eases the divide between the haves and the have-nots when it comes to preparing them for kindergarten, which will give them a good start for their life. The bipartisan support we have seen for the bill today should lend all of us confidence that the program will remain on a solid foundation for generations to come. 
   By reauthorizing Head Start, we are voting to build upon improvements that were made by the House Republicans in past Congresses by strengthening academic standards by emphasizing cognitive development using scientifically-based research; improving teacher quality by ensuring more Head Start teachers have bachelor degrees and are adequately trained in early childhood development; increasing financial disclosure requirements by Head Start operators as custodians of Federal Head Start grants; and requiring local governance boards to actively oversee grantees. 
   These are common-sense reforms that I wholeheartedly support. That said, this bill remains flawed, and soon, we will turn to a number of amendments that highlight those flaws. One such amendment that we will not be able to discuss unfortunately is one offered to the Rules Committee by Mr. Fortu&#241;o yesterday. The Fortu&#241;o amendment is a principled one. It clearly protects the hiring privileges of faith-based providers and protects their civil rights to display religious symbols, rights that are sheltered under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Yet, we will not be able to debate and vote on it today, a major statement about the real priorities of this purportedly fair, open and honest Congress. 
   Nonetheless, Mr. Chairman, I still believe the Improving Head Start Act is a worthy piece of legislation, deserving  of the same bipartisan support it received from the Education and Labor Committee just 2 months ago. 
   Before I conclude, I would like to thank a number of current and former members of my staff who have made this bill possible. First, to Kate Houston, who no longer works on Capitol Hill, let alone on our committee staff. Years ago, Kate helped craft legislation that closely tracks the bill we are poised to pass today. 
   Stephanie Milburn, who left our staff earlier this year to join Mr. Boehner's team, played an integral role in bringing this bill to where it is today, and I thank her as well. 
   Finally, I thank Susan Ross and James Bergeron for their work in helping to bring this bill across the finish line. 
   I have already mentioned thanks to Mr. Miller, Mr. Kildee, Mr. Castle, and I would like to thank their staff also for working with us so closely on this bill. 
   The team effort that we have demonstrated on this issue, and our ability to work closely with our Democratic counterparts, yielded the product we are poised to vote on this afternoon. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Delaware State University is an example of a Head Start HBCU partnership that nurtures a continual goal of providing high quality educational experiences to Head Start participants by enhancing the competence of teachers and teachers' aids; improving parental confidence and life management skills to ensure that the work of Head Start is continued in the home; and improving the administrative, managerial and leadership skills of centers directly so the Head Start resources, including personnel, are used as efficiently as possible.     
   We think that her amendment will further this help, and we think it improves the bill. We would be happy to support the amendment.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment allows grantees to negotiate a reduced enrollment level with the Secretary of HHS if the amounts appropriated for Head Start do not exceed the prior year's appropriation or include an increase commensurate with  the cost-of-living allowance. In effect, this amendment allows grantees to cut services for children and kick children out of the Head Start program if Congress does not appropriate ever-higher funding amounts for Head Start. 
   I think all of us want to service as many children as we can, and we want to have as high an appropriation level as we can, but if we fail to appropriate higher numbers, I don't think we should take it out on the children. I ask my colleagues, is Head Start an early education program or a jobs program?

This misguided amendment has the potential for denying these children Head Start services, and I therefore urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, let's be very clear at the outset about why this amendment is being considered today: It's all about political cover. It has nothing to do with protecting the civil rights of faith-based providers. If that is what we are out to do today, we would be considering Mr. Fortu&#241;o's amendment right now. Instead, the majority has brought up a hollow, politically motivated attempt to have it both ways. On one hand, this amendment cheers the work of faith-based providers and recognizes their contributions to our Nation; but on the other hand, it leaves them completely unprotected when it comes to their right to preserve their identity while serving children in Head Start. Frankly, this is insulting to faith-based organizations as it is transparent. Let me elaborate. 
   With respect to hiring authority, section 702(a) of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1972, states, ``This subchapter shall not apply to a religious corporation, association, educational institution or society with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association, educational institution or society of its activities.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, does this amendment reaffirm the language from this statute? No, it does not. 
   Consistent with this language from the Civil Rights Act, former President Clinton signed four laws that explicitly allow religious organizations to retain their right to staff on a religious basis when they receive Federal funds. The 1996 welfare reform law, the Children's Health Act of 2000, the Community Services Block Grant Act of 1998, and the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 each contain language that reflects the language offered to the Rules Committee yesterday by Mr. Fortu&#241;o. 
   Mr. Chairman, does this amendment reaffirm the language signed into law on four separate occasions by former President Clinton? No, it does not. The Fortu&#241;o amendment would codify a 2002 executive order protecting the right of a participating faith-based organization to display a cross or other religious symbols on its grounds. Mr. Chairman, does this amendment do the same? No, it does not. 
   This amendment may have been written in such a way that may run counter to that executive order, potentially endangering rights faith-based providers already enjoy. 
   In short, Mr. Chairman, in an attempt to play politics, this amendment is, at best, an attempt to provide political cover for Members who do not want to take a real vote on the issue; and at worst, a poorly drafted measure that may end up turning back the clock on the rights of faith-based providers to display religious symbols. Because of that, I urge my colleagues to oppose it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Later on in the discussion, I will add these letters, along with several others I have in support of the Fortu&#241;o amendment and in opposition to this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I think that this amendment makes it a stronger bill. Rural grantees are more likely to rely on home visits due to problems associated with staffing and transportation. Head Start in-home programs are required to make a minimum of 32 visits per year, or one per week. In addition, there must be a minimum of 16 group socialization activities per year. 
   For this reason, I rise in support of this amendment to provide additional training and support to rural Head Start programs facing these challenges to ensure that all children can access the skills necessary to succeed in school. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, because of a flaw in the Federal Head Start law, faith-based institutions have been forced to relinquish their civil liberties if they choose to participate in the Federal early childhood program we are poised to reauthorize today. 
   A sham of an amendment adopted earlier today applauded these organizations but did nothing to protect faith-based providers' civil rights. This motion to recommit does. 
   We have had this debate many times before here on the House floor, and each time we have had this debate, opponents of faith-based groups' federally protected right to maintain their religious nature and character through those they hire have equated these civil liberties as ``discrimination.'' 
   The 1964 Civil Rights Act makes clear that faith-based groups may serve their communities without being forced to give up the right to employ individuals who share the tenets and practices of their faith. Mr. Speaker, were the authors of the Civil Rights Act pro-discrimination? No. 
   The United States Supreme Court in 1987 unanimously reaffirmed the hiring rights for faith-based organizations. Was the Supreme Court pro-discrimination? No. 
   Former President Clinton signed four laws explicitly allowing faith-based groups to staff on a religious basis when they receive Federal funds. Was he pro-discrimination? No. 
   The motion to recommit we are considering today is offered in the same spirit as the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1987 Supreme Court decision, and President Clinton's signature on those four bills. 
   I commend the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Fortu&#241;o) for offering this as an amendment before the Rules Committee yesterday. 
   Mr. Speaker, I now yield the balance of my time to Mr. Fortu&#241;o. 
   Mr. FORTU&#209;O. Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak today on the motion to recommit H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act of 2007. I must commend Chairmen Miller and Kildee and Ranking Members McKeon and Castle for completing work on this important reauthorization. 
   This motion to recommit would ensure that, one, religious organizations that are participating in the Head Start program are allowed to take religion into account in their hiring practices; and, two, religious organizations that are participating in the Head Start program are not discriminated against on the basis of their religious character and are not required to alter their form of governance or remove religious art, icons, or scripture or other symbols if they decide to participate in the Federal Head Start program. 
   Faith-based organizations, such as churches, synagogues and other faith-based charities, are a central part of the fabric of communities across America. Many of these organizations provide assistance and services to the neediest members of society, offering a helping hand to the least fortunate among us. Faith-based organizations can make a vital contribution to Federal assistance programs and are critical to the survival of many communities and to the improvement of the lives of countless individuals. 
   When faith-based groups hire employees on a religious basis, they are exercising their civil rights and liberties. The Civil Rights Act made clear when faith-based groups hire employees on a religious basis, it is an exercise of the group's civil liberties and does not constitute ``discrimination'' under Federal law. Faith-based providers who are willing to help provide early childhood education and other critical social services should not be denied this opportunity. 
   Faith-based organizations cannot be expected to sustain their religious mission without the ability to employ individuals who share the tenets and practices of their faith because it is that faith that motivates them to serve their neighbors in trouble. Without the right to continue to hire on a religious basis, religious organizations, in order to avoid such dangers, are likely to simply withdraw from the  Federal social service efforts altogether, to the loss of people in need everywhere. 
   Constitutional protections are included. The motion to recommit prohibits funds from being used for worship, instruction, or proselytization in keeping with constitutional requirements. 
   This motion to recommit does not permit religious organizations to refuse to assist individuals on the basis of religion, a religious belief, or refusal to participate in a religious practice. The nondiscrimination language of the current Head Start statute prevents discrimination in the provision of service on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, political affiliation, or beliefs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and appreciate the gentleman yielding time. 
   To be blunt, the rule before us is not worthy of the bill we will be debating in just a short while. Let me be clear at the outset. I support the improving Head Start Act and will vote for its final passage later today. However, the rule before us restricts debate and provides very little opportunity to improve this bill. 
   While I appreciate the Rules Committee making in order a few Republican amendments, including ones offered by my Education and Labor Committee colleague, Mr. Price of Georgia; my former committee colleague, Mr. Porter of Nevada; and my friend, Mr. Putnam, this rule is defined more by what it does not include than what it does include. 
   Yesterday, Mr. Fortu&#241;o submitted to the Rules Committee an amendment to protect the civil rights of faith-based organizations wishing to provide services to Head Start children. In the aftermath of September 11, Hurricane Katrina or any other tragedy, faith-based organizations have been among the first to reach out a hand in service to those impacted by the event. It does not take a large-scale catastrophe to rally faith-based organizations into action, however. These groups are working to assist their fellow Americans each and every day, focusing on issues from job training to child care and everything in between. 
   Too often the Federal Government has ignored or impeded the efforts of faith-based organizations willing to lend a helping hand in providing critical services to the neediest in our communities. Mr. Fortu&#241;o's amendment would have protected the rights of faith-based groups to fully participate in serving Head Start children without relinquishing their religious identities. And the majority turned it away. 
   Mr. Speaker, they turned it away even though the 1964 Civil Rights Act made clear when faith-based groups hire employees on a religious basis, it is an exercise of the group's civil liberties. They turned it away even though in 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously upheld this right. And they turned it away even though former President Bill Clinton signed four laws explicitly allowing faith-based groups to staff on a religious basis when they receive Federal funds. 
   In its place, they allowed us to debate an amendment that applauds the work of faith-based providers but fails to protect their civil rights. This hollow amendment may provide certain Members of the majority political cover, but in reality, it does nothing to protect the constitutional rights of faith-based organizations seeking to serve Head Start students. 
   This is just one example, the most significant of all, of how this rule is not worthy of the bill we will be debating later today, and so I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to rise in support of ADA Amendments Act of 2008, a bill we first approved earlier this year. The bill we passed was the product of good-faith negotiation and careful compromise, and I appreciate that the framework of our bill has been maintained. 
   At the same time, our counterparts on the other side of the Capitol were able to further refine and improve the legislation. Thanks to that effort, the bill before us today represents an important step forward for Americans with disabilities and the employers that benefit from their many contributions. 
   The Americans with Disabilities Act was enacted in 1990 with broad bipartisan support. Among the bill's most important purposes was to protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination in the workplace. 
   By many measures, the law has been a huge success. I firmly believe that the employer community has taken the ADA to heart, with businesses adopting policies specifically aimed at providing meaningful opportunities to individuals with disabilities. 
   However, despite the law's many success stories, it is clear today that for some, the ADA is failing to live up to its promise. 
   In the years since its enactment, court cases and legal interpretations have left some individuals outside the scope of the act's protections. Some individuals the law was clearly intended to protect have been deemed ``not disabled enough,'' an interpretation we all agree needs correcting. 
   In response, however, proposals were put forward to massively expand the law's protections to cover virtually all Americans. This is an equally dangerous proposition. 
   Our task with this legislation was to focus relief where it is needed, while still maintaining the delicate balance embodied in the original ADA. 
   In the months since this bill was first introduced and moved through the House, I am pleased to say that we were able to do exactly that. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, and the time to enact it is now. It ensures that meaningful relief will be extended to those most in need, while the ADA's careful balance is maintained as fully as possible. 
   Once again, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for honoring our shared commitment to work together on this issue that has the potential to touch the lives of millions of Americans. 
   I would especially like to recognize Majority Leader Hoyer, Representative Sensenbrenner, and Chairman Miller for their leadership and commitment to enactment of these important bipartisan reforms. I also want to thank the many stakeholders, especially the ones that Chairman Miller mentioned in his remarks, who were involved in this process for their efforts. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   I commend the leader for his eloquence and for the great work that he has done on this bill; likewise Mr. Sensenbrenner, Mr. Miller, Mr. Langevin, and all those who have worked so hard for bringing forth this bill and for bringing it to this point. 
   Back in June, I had the privilege to join advocates for Americans with disabilities and many of the Congressional leaders who made that bill possible at a rally in support of this bill. At that time, we made it clear that we needed to get a bill to the President for his signature this year. This is a bill that cannot wait another year. That is why I'm so pleased to be standing here preparing to give final approval to this important legislation. 
   Once again I want to recognize Chairman Miller, the leaders of the Judiciary, Transportation and Infrastructure, Energy and Commerce Committees and the members of leadership on both sides of the aisle for shepherding this bill through the process and insisting on an open, inclusive process. This bill is better for it. I also want to recognize the members of my staff who worked hard on this legislation, Jim Paretti, Ken Serafin and Ed Gilroy from my staff helped to make this bill  a reality. This is a bill that fulfills our goal of providing strong, balanced and workable protections to ensure that individuals with disabilities can participate more fully in the workforce and in our society. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are some other comments I would like to make at this time. I think this bill has been a marvelous example of how Congress can work together. It's one that we've worked on now for a number of years. In the last Congress, Chairman SENSENBRENNER introduced this bill. It was introduced in many committees. Many hearings were held. Markups were held. It carried over into this Congress. Under a change of leadership it moved forward. Again, hearings were held. Markups were held. It was passed through the body here in the House. It went to the other side. The other body took this bill up, passed it through regular order and improved the bill. And we find it now back before us in the concluding weeks of this Congress. All of us have worked together to make it a good product that will help the individuals with disabilities that it's meant to help. And I think it makes me proud to be a part of this body to have been able to participate in this process. 
   Last night we participated in a process that made me not so proud of this body. I understand political process. I understand that we have an election coming up. And I understand that there are times when politics rises above policy. But it still disappointed me to see a bill presented Monday night, no bipartisanship, no hearings, no regular process. Right up here above us it says, ``Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions.'' It's a direction that we're supposed to be operating under. 
   This bill was brought up Monday night to address a very, very important issue in our country. We are dependent upon other countries for resources to run our energy, to run this country. It puts us in a very difficult position. It's an issue that is equally as important I think as this bill that we are working on here right now. If it had been addressed in the same way, if we had been able to work together the way we've worked on this bill, I think the country would have been much better served. As it is, we are left with a political statement, a bill that everybody in this body knows is going nowhere, that will do nothing to actually solve the problem of energy, something that will be pushed into the next Congress. Hopefully at that point we can sit down and as adults, as Americans, as leaders that have been elected by the people we serve to come here and work through a good process to really solve a problem that is very, very important to our constituents and to our Nation and to our growth in a time of very serious issues confronting our country. It's my hope that we will be able to do that. I'm saddened by what happened yesterday. But as I said, I understand the process. I understand we're facing an election. 
   Having said that, seeing this body work at its best and I think at very, very far from its best, I do urge passage of the ADA Amendments Act. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2831, LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in opposition to this rule. 
   Last Thursday night, Members received notice of an emergency meeting of the Rules Committee on the following morning, with no deadline given for Members on either side of the aisle to submit amendments to this badly flawed legislation. Even though I was able to file two of them because they had already been drafted for an Education and Labor Committee markup last month, this extremely short notice and lack of amendment instructions effectively shut both Democrat and Republican colleagues out of the Rules Committee's increasingly undemocratic process. 
   I say increasingly undemocratic because last Thursday night and Friday morning's turn of events was just one of several occasions this year in which I've found the Rules Committee acted in a wholly unfair manner. 
   For example, in my first appearance before the committee this year, before the House considered the minimum wage legislation, I was told by the panel's Chair that the Democrat leadership had already decided the rule would be closed. Again, this was announced before I had even testified before the committee on my substitute for that bill. 
   There was also an occasion several months later, prior to consideration of student aid legislation through the budget reconciliation process, when the Rules Committee announced the bill's amendment filing deadline would fall during the Independence Day district work period. In other words, this deadline fell when Members were absent and staff was scattered, making amendments extremely difficult to file. 
   So last Thursday and Friday's ``emergency'' was hardly surprising, yet still very disappointing. It rendered nearly 400 Members of this House, meaning those who do not sit on the Education and Labor Committee, powerless to change or even consider a change to this bill. And by doing so, the Democrat leadership of the Rules Committee, and yes the Democrat leadership of the Education and Labor Committee and the House, has done a disservice to this institution and to the voters who sent us here. 
   That's because the measure before us is not a minor tweak of labor law meant to reverse a single Supreme Court decision. Rather, it guts the statute of limitations and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charging requirements contained in current law. And it effectively would allow an employee to bring a claim against an employer decades after an alleged initial act of discrimination occurred. Such a wholesale change should be made only after close, appropriate and deliberative examination. 
   But H.R. 2831 has been exposed to none of that. Rather, it was poorly drafted, rushed through committee with practically no input from outside stakeholders or from committee Republicans and, now, sent to the floor under an airtight, closed rule. 
   Because of this, Mr. Speaker, I have no choice but to continue my opposition to it, both for policy and process reasons. Shortly, I will be proud to manage time in opposition to it, but before then, I will vote against this undemocratic rule, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this ill-considered and over-reaching legislation. 
   Proponents of this bill claim it simply reverses a May 29, 2007, U.S. Supreme Court decision and further clarifies congressional opposition to wage discrimination against employees in the workplace. In reality, however, it will set into motion unintended consequences that its supporters simply are not willing to acknowledge. 
   At the outset, let me make it clear that opposition to discrimination of  any type, be it gender discrimination, racial discrimination, or any other type of discrimination inside or outside the workplace is not confined to one party or the other. Every Member of this Chamber stands in strong opposition to the unfair treatment of any worker, but at the same time we must stand firmly behind a process that ensures justice for all parties, and that includes protecting against the potential for abuse and over-litigation. That, I believe, is where the two parties diverge on the bill before us. We aren't taking sides for or against discrimination in the workplace; rather, we're staking out different positions on fair and equitable justice and the rule of law. 
   For more than 40 years, title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act has made it illegal for employers to determine an employee's pay scale based on his or her gender. And this is a principle upon which all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, can agree. As such, current law provides that any individual wishing to challenge an employment practice as discriminatory must first file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within the applicable statute of limitations, which is either 180 or 300 days, depending on his or her state of employment after the alleged workplace discrimination occurred. 
   The statute of limitations was clearly established in the law to encourage the timely filing of claims, which helps prevent the filing of stale claims and protects against abuse of the legal system. 
   Consider these worst case scenarios, for example. Without a statute of limitations in place, an employee could sue for discrimination resulting from an alleged discriminatory act that might have occurred 5, 10, 20, 40, or even more years earlier. And without a statute of limitations in place, it is entirely conceivable that a worker or retiree could seek damages against a company run by employees and executives that had nothing to do with the initial act of alleged discrimination that occurred dozens of years ago. 
   H.R. 2831 would essentially dismantle the statute of limitations and replace it with a new system under which every paycheck received by the employee allegedly discriminated against starts the clock on an entirely new statute. While fair-minded and principled, this dramatic change in civil rights law would have incredibly far-reaching impact, one that supporters of the bill have yet to take the time to thoroughly and appropriately consider. And B, under H.R. 2831, the worst case scenarios I just described would become commonplace. And let's not kid ourselves; our Nation's trial lawyers would seize upon them. 
   Because H.R. 2831 would dismantle the critical statute of limitations, the Bush administration last week threatened to veto, should the bill ever arrive at his desk. Specifically, the administration noted that the legislation ``would serve to impede justice and undermine the important goal of having allegations of discrimination expeditiously resolved.'' 
   Furthermore, the effect of elimination of any statute of limitations in this area would be contrary to the centuries' old notion about limitations, period, for all lawsuits. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter the Statement of Administration Policy into the Record

   Washington, DC, July 27, 2007.

   Mr. Speaker, as Mr. Kline just said, I think we have had a good debate here tonight. 
   As we did have that hearing on Ms. Ledbetter's case, the bill wasn't before us, but we did hear her story. And all of us I think felt bad for her for the things that happened to her 20, 30 years ago. 
   But what was also said, as we're sent here to represent all of our constituents, we can't totally let emotion guide our decisions. We have to make good law, sound law, and I think we're worried about losing the statute of limitations. I think that's something we really need to protect against.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5715, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to be here just 2 weeks after the House voted overwhelmingly in support of this effort to restore confidence in our student loan program. Today we will give final approval to this measure and send it to the President for his signature. It is not often that Congress acts so nimbly to respond to a current market challenge, and I welcome this show of bipartisan cooperation. I hope it is a sign of things to come. 
   When we debated this bill on the floor 2 weeks ago, I noted that while it is a good start, it is not a complete solution. That continues to be true today. I am particularly interested in exploring a more market-oriented solution to what is obviously a market-based problem. I am hopeful that the administration will pursue steps such as an intervention by the Federal Financing Bank, along with the other proposals that have been offered to restore balance. Still, the steps taken under this bill are important preliminary measures, and I look forward to their swift enactment. 
   The original bill passed by the House focused on restoring stability to an uncertain market and offering reassurances to students and their families. We did that by establishing the U.S. Department of Education as a temporary backstop to purchase loans and inject modest amounts of liquidity into the market in order to ensure lenders can make new loans in the coming school year. We also offered new loan availability and flexibility, and we called on the Federal financial authorities to exercise their authority to stabilize the market. 
   I appreciate that the other Chamber chose to move quickly on our bill, rather than taking up a competing bill that would have slowed down this important assistance to students and families. However, some important improvements were made as this bill moved through the other body, and I want to highlight those here today. 
   In early 2005 and early 2006, Congress approved a budget reconciliation measure that created two new grant programs to help low-income students pursuing a college education. Those two new programs are the Academic Competitiveness Grant and the SMART Grant. These grant programs are meant to promote student academic achievement, particularly in fields that are vital to our continued competitiveness in a changing world. 
   During the committee deliberations on a comprehensive renewal of the Higher Education Act, Representative Rob Bishop took a leadership role in clarifying the role of States and not the Federal Government in establishing rigorous high school curricula. The purpose of the Academic Competitiveness Grant was to encourage students to pursue challenging course work to prepare for college, but it was never intended to usurp State and local responsibility for establishing curricula. I am pleased we were able to incorporate his proposed changes into the bill that is moving today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, but I would be remiss if I did not highlight what I believe to be the root causes of the current difficulties in our financial markets. Last year, Federal support for the loan program was slashed, forcing loan providers to scale back on benefits and reevaluate their future participation in the program. This year, disruption in the capital markets have reduced liquidity and shaken investor and consumer confidence. 
   I appreciate the steps taken in this bill to begin to stabilize a program that has been badly shaken. I am especially pleased that this bill contains no net cost to the American taxpayer and that it does not force colleges and universities to embrace the government-run Direct Loan Program that the vast majority have already rejected. I will remain vigilant in protecting against any efforts to capitalize on the current situation by imposing a big government monopoly on student loans. In fact, it is because I did not support a big government intervention that I favor the bill before us. The fact is that if we fail to act now, we may be forced to take on much greater government role in the future. 
   We made a commitment more than four decades ago that there are national benefits to an affordable, accessible, higher education system. What we are doing today is restating that commitment and sending a signal to students and families that we continue to believe in this program that has opened the door of higher education to so many millions of aspiring young Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill that deserves our support. I want to thank Chairman Miller, along with the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, Representatives Hinojosa and Keller, for their leadership on this issue. I would also like to recognize the staff for their hard work as well. I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

They moved expeditiously, and now we will be able to get this to the President's desk. And, hopefully, the concerns that I have felt for several months now will never come to bear; that we will go through this year, and students will be able to get their loans and we will do this without any hiccups. But, if not, this will be a big help as we move forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, while it is not a perfect bill, I do believe it contains a number of important improvements over prior versions of this legislation, including that which I supported a little over a year ago on the House floor. More importantly, it marks a commitment by this Congress to ensure that the laws of the United States protect American workers and health care consumers from discrimination on the basis of their genetic makeup. Because that goal is so critical, I will vote for this bill today, and urge my colleagues to do likewise. 
   Before I turn to the substance of my remarks, I would like to commend my colleague and fellow Member on the Committee on Education and Labor, Representative Judy Biggert, for her years of work and dedication on this important issue. She has been persistent and effective on so many issues that have come before this committee and this Congress and she should be commended for adding this important bill to her list of legislative accomplishments. I also want to commend the gentlewoman from New York, the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, who has been Mrs. Biggert's partner in this effort. 
   As I noted during our committee's consideration of this bill last year, I believe the title of the legislation before us, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, embodies a proposition that all Members of our committee and indeed our Congress would endorse. Simply put, no employee should face discrimination on the basis of his or her genetic makeup or on any other characteristic other than his or her ability to do the job. Similarly, no employee should risk his or her health insurance status simply because of the possibility that they might some day develop an illness. 
   This bill was drafted with those fundamental principles in mind, and I believe that through the legislative process, we have taken steps toward ensuring that the bill we send the President today ensures that those principles are fulfilled, while minimizing the potential for unintended consequences. 
   I would take this opportunity to point out a number of improvements in the bill that I think merit attention.     
   Foremost, I am pleased that the bill we will send today to the White House for President Bush to sign embodies the same logic as a past executive order issued by President Clinton to ensure that this legislation would not inadvertently serve as a broad new Federal mandate requiring all insurance plans and employers to cover all treatments related to genetic-related conditions. That is exactly the type of unintended consequences we were seeking to avoid, and I am pleased we were able to work this out. 
   Second, I would highlight a provision in the legislation that ensures that employers who are currently subject to a number of confidentiality and recordkeeping requirements under law are not burdened by yet another redundant set of paperwork requirements. The bill before us today provides that, with respect to genetic information, if an employer maintains employee records and treats them as it does confidential medical records under the Americans With Disabilities Act, it is in compliance with this new genetics law. 
   Third, I applaud a significant improvement in the bill; namely, its extension of genetic nondiscrimination protection to all Americans. 
   One of the issues raised during our committee's consideration of the bill was concern that the bill's protections did not adequately extend to cover children in utero or at early stages of development, or in connection with in vitro fertilization and other technologies. I am very pleased that the final bill before us addresses this issue to the satisfaction of all Members on both sides of the aisle who worked in good faith to ensure the broadest protections possible. 
   The Senate amendment we consider today contains a number of other improvements over prior versions, including important provisions relating to those who participate in genetic clinical testing, providing for use of genetic information in matters of public health safety, and ensuring the most focused scheme of remedies possible. These changes represent issues we were able to work through over the past year and which demonstrate how the legislative process is meant to work. We were presented with well-intentioned legislation, heard meaningful testimony on it and its potential impact on employers and employees alike, raised and debated legitimate concerns, and worked through to bridge the gap between where we began and where we stand today. 
   I thank the staff from both sides of the aisle and in both chambers for making this a reality. 
   Before concluding my remarks, I would be remiss if I did not note for the record that I am still concerned that this bill is in some respects potentially overbroad. While we all agree with the goal of nondiscrimination I discussed earlier, the facts remain that we are poised today to adopt a sweeping new expansion to Federal Civil Rights scheme, the most expansive change since the adoption of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. 
   As we send this bill to the President to sign into law, I would urge my colleagues to join me in remaining vigilant in the months to come in monitoring the administration of this new law to ensure that it addresses the problems it is intended to correct, and does not simply become yet another bureaucratic burden on employers or a lottery ticket for plaintiffs' lawyers. 
   In that same light, as courts and administrative agencies interpret and enforce these laws, I would urge them to heed the intent of Congress; namely, that this bill's most egregious penalties must be reserved for the most egregious violations of the law. If experience under this new law shows that this is not the case, I trust my colleagues will join me in supporting swift action to correct any mistakes we have made. 
   With that, I will conclude my comments. As I noted at the outset of my remarks, our actions today will ensure that the law of the United States protects American workers and health care consumers from discrimination on the basis of their genetic makeup, a goal I think is shared by every Member of this House. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   I yield the balance of my time to the gentlelady from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) and ask unanimous consent that she be allowed to control the remainder of the time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 340. This resolution makes technical corrections to the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, commonly known as GINA, the act that we just passed. Specifically, this resolution will clarify the use of genetic information at forensic laboratories used by law enforcement agencies. This technical correction ensures the Department of Defense will be able to use genetic information to identify the remains of American servicemen and women. 
   The recent DNA identification of Staff Sergeant Matt Maupin, missing since his capture in Iraq in 2004, offers us a painful reminder of why genetic information may be needed to identify the heroic men and women who give their lives in service to this Nation.  
   This is a simple, yet necessary change to a bill that enjoys the support of a vast majority of this body. Adoption of this resolution will allow this legislation to move forward. 
   The GINA bill marks a commitment by this Congress to ensure that the law protects American workers and health care consumers from discrimination on the basis of their genetic makeup. Because that goal is so critical, I support this resolution today, and urge my colleagues to do likewise. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (GRANTING AUTHORITY PROVIDED UNDER THE RULES OF THE HOUSE TO THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR FOR PURPOSES OF ITS INVESTIGATION INTO THE DEATHS OF 9 INDIVIDUALS THAT OCCURRED AT THE CRANDALL CANYON MINE NEAR HUNTINGTON, UTAH -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, on August 6, 2007, a collapse at the Crandall Canyon mine in Utah took the lives of six miners. Days later, three rescuers were lost as well. We all grieved with this tragedy, and we all share a commitment to doing what we can to prevent such an event from happening in the future. 
   The Education and Labor Committee has initiated an investigation into possible causes of the collapse, as well as the handling of its aftermath by the mine ownership and Federal regulators. Our committee has at its disposal  significant tools and resources to conduct this investigation, including the power to hold hearings, demand documents, interview witnesses, and enter evidence into the record. 
   At the same time as our committee pursues its inquiry, there are a series of official investigations underway by the Department of Labor and the State of Utah. The investigations by the Mine Safety and Health Administration are of a law enforcement nature--if it is determined that criminal conduct occurred, they can at any time make a referral to the Department of Justice. 
   Although our committee investigation is still in its early stages, it has already been fruitful. In addition to the single hearing that has been held, we have requested--and the Department of Labor has produced--hundreds of thousands of pages of documents. We have conducted interviews with witnesses, and visited the site of the accident. 
   Despite the progress that has been made with our significant existing oversight capabilities, the majority today is seeking to confer on our committee the extraordinary power to subpoena witnesses for closed-door, staff-led depositions. This is an authority granted only in the rarest of circumstances, such as the protection of national security, the impeachment of a President, or the alleged defrauding of a national organization by its leadership. 
   I have serious reservations about establishment of deposition authority at this early stage of our investigation. The majority has not established any clear need for this authority. In fact, we are not aware of a single witness who has refused to cooperate with the committee after an official invitation. Moreover, while the majority has been unwilling to disclose exactly whose testimony 
   this authority is intended to compel, they have indicated that just a handful of individuals are expected to require a subpoena. Members on our side of the aisle are more than willing to cooperate with regular committee procedures including hearings for this purpose, and as such, it remains unclear to me why this authority is necessary. 
   In addition to being premature and unnecessary, I believe this authority carries with it the possibility of grave unintended consequences. Deposition authority will allow dozens of interviews to be conducted under oath and compelled by subpoena. This could create the possibility of conflicts of interest, privilege claims and rulings, requests for immunity, leaks, and contradictory evidence. 
   Previous congressional probes should serve as a cautionary tale as we head down this path. Tactics used in the congressional investigation of the Iran-Contra affair caused key testimony against Oliver North to be thrown out, and his convictions to be overturned. 
   The Acting Solicitor of Labor voiced concerns that this investigation could similarly imperil any civil or criminal enforcement that may be necessary in this matter. In September, he wrote to Chairman MILLER and me, along with the leadership of the House, saying that the Committee's ``parallel investigation ..... may compromise the integrity of MSHA's law enforcement investigation and potentially jeopardize its ability to enforce the law and hold violators accountable. `` 
   Up to this point, the majority has heeded our warnings and those of the Department of Labor. Our hearing and the series of interviews that have been conducted were structured in such a way as to avoid endangering the investigations. I'm concerned that by granting this extraordinary deposition authority, the House is backing away from that cautious approach and rekindling the threat that our activities could undermine the aggressive enforcement that MSHA and other investigators have an obligation to pursue. 
   The deposition authority proposed today is crafted narrowly to cover only the Crandall Canyon mine collapse, and the rules adopted in our committee to govern these depositions were developed fairly to ensure the full participation of the minority. I believe these steps are acknowledgements by the majority that deposition authority is truly an extraordinary step, and must be undertaken with great care. I appreciate their cooperation on these points. 
   As I have made clear, there are serious questions about the timing and necessity of this narrowly crafted authority. Beyond that, however, I want to be perfectly clear that the specific authority being granted in this instance should in no way be viewed as precedent for future oversight functions of our committee or any committee of this House. Committee rules allow for a range of tools and resources that can be used to conduct rigorous oversight. Any effort to grant broader deposition authority will surely bring greater danger, and therefore greater objection.  
   The resolution was agreed to. 
   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5351, the latest in a string of flawed energy proposals that will drive up prices for consumers while rewarding special interests. 
   As Senior Republican on the Education and Labor Committee, I oppose not only the bill's unprecedented energy tax hike, but also its inclusion of bureaucratic mandates that will drive up costs for taxpayers and stifle job creation. 
   This bill furthers the majority's aggressive expansion of Davis-Bacon wage mandates, a Depression-era policy that saddles federal projects with complicated and highly inaccurate prevailing wage requirements. 
   Davis-Bacon wages can inflate project costs by as much as 15 percent--costs that get passed on to taxpayers. They also force private companies to do hundreds of millions of dollars of excess administrative work each year, squandering resources that would be better spent creating jobs and spurring innovation. 
   H.R. 5351 creates and expands bond authority for energy conservation and clean renewable energy. Unfortunately, these bond programs are prone to waste, fraud, and abuse because of a lack of clear oversight. Moreover, projects funded through these bonds would be subject to Davis-Bacon wage mandates. 
   The notion of a one-size-fits-all federal wage mandate is bad enough, but the specifics of the Davis-Bacon rules are even worse. Because of flawed wage calculations, use of Davis-Bacon wages can drive up wages on one project, while shortchanging workers on another. 
   The costly and time-consuming requirements of Davis-Bacon bias government contracting against small businesses that are often minority- or female-owned--businesses that simply do not have the resources to comply. As a result, large, unionized companies are more often awarded government contracts--even for small projects. 
   We need energy independence and lower fuel costs. This bill imposes energy tax hikes that will drive up costs for consumers. We need to eliminate federal red tape to promote job creation. This bill expands the bureaucracy by layering costly Davis-Bacon wage mandates on bond programs already prone to waste, fraud, and abuse. 
   For these and many other reasons, Mr. Speaker, I cannot support this energy tax increase, and I urge my colleagues to join me voting ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the bill and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Discrimination in the workplace is wrong. Paying women lower wages for the same work is wrong. It's also illegal. Congress enacted protections to ensure equal pay for equal work in 1963 when the Equal Pay Act was added to the Fair Labor Standards Act. Congress acted again to protect women and all Americans from workplace discrimination with enactment of title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Together, these laws offer women protections against workplace discrimination, and strong remedies should they be subject to illegal employment practices. 
   Yet we're here today debating a bill that has been touted as necessary to protect women from being underpaid. Supporters of the bill would have you believe that unless this legislation is enacted, employers are free to pay women less money for doing the same job as their male counterparts. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   H.R. 1338 isn't needed to protect women from wage discrimination; such protections are already included in the law. No, this bill is about something entirely different. Rather than addressing the real concerns of working families, issues like health care, a lack of workplace flexibility, and yes, the high price of gasoline, this bill invites more and costlier lawsuits. 
   The bill opens EPA claims to unlimited compensatory damages, even in cases where there was clearly no intentional discrimination. The majority will offer an amendment today that attempts to mask this trial lawyer boondoggle. But make no mistake about it, at the end of the day this bill will invite more lawyers to bring more law suits because it offers them the promise of a bigger payday. H.R. 1338 will breed litigation in other ways as well, from encouraging class action lawsuits to expanding liability. 
   I'm also concerned that this bill has been put forward using misleading claims to justify its dangerous consequences. Supporters will repeat over and over the statistic that women earn just 77 cents on the dollar. Mr. Chairman, if a woman earned 77 cents on the dollar doing the same job as a man, it would be a travesty--and it would be illegal. 
   What supporters of this bill won't tell you is that the 77 percent figure does not compare one man and one woman doing the same job. To argue that a woman only makes 70 cents on the dollar doing the same work as her male counterpart is to distort reality. The 77 percent figure is based on 2005 Census data looking at median earnings of all women and men who work at least 35 hours per week. 
   Interestingly, if you look at 2006 data from the U.S. Department of Labor comparing men and women who work 40 hours per week, women actually earn 88 cents on the dollar. The wage gap is much narrower, but the existence of a gap is still troubling. 
   However, last year the Education and Labor Committee heard testimony that cited an article published in The American Economic Review which found that when data on demographics, education, scores on the Armed Forces Qualification Test, and work experience are added, the wage ratio rises to 91.4 percent. The addition of variables measuring workplace and occupational characteristics, as well as child-related factors, causes the wage ratio to rise to 95.1 percent. When the percentage female in the occupation is added, the wage ratio becomes 97.5 percent, a far less significant difference. 
   In another study, researchers from the University of Chicago and Cornell University found almost no difference in the pay of male and female top corporate executives when accounting for size of firm, position in the company, age, seniority, and experience. 
   So before we use the 77 percent figure to justify new legal ``gotchas,'' I think we need a better understanding of the  scope of any actual pay disparity and why such a disparity exists. 
   Luckily, there are steps we could take right now, right here, that would ease the strain on working women. Republicans have proposed a bill, the American Energy Act, that embraces our ``all of the above'' approach to the energy reform. It would unlock America's vast energy resources, increasing the production of American-made energy and reducing foreign nations' stranglehold on our economic and national security. 
   Republicans recognize that we need comprehensive solutions to solve our energy crisis and ease the strain on working families brought by high energy costs. Unfortunately, the majority has refused to allow a vote on commonsense energy reform. Now we're poised to go home for a month without voting on real energy reforms. We're about to pass a bill that will bring a major payday to trial lawyers, but will do nothing to ease the pocketbook concerns of hardworking American families. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am strongly opposed to H.R. 1338; it's the wrong bill at the wrong time. We shouldn't be here giving handouts to trial lawyers; we should be voting on energy solutions for American families. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   My good friend the majority leader mentioned trial lawyers. I'm not a lawyer. I know we have a lot of them here in the House, and I am not particularly against lawyers. I think they perform a good service. 
   One of the things that we did in subcommittee is we thought maybe we should be able to limit trial lawyers' pay when they take some of these claims, and we even had an amendment that we presented that we would limit the trial lawyers to $2,000 an hour. We thought maybe that would be reasonable. Every Democrat voted against that. And when we took it to the Rules Committee to bring it here to the floor, we were denied the opportunity of discussing that here on the floor. So maybe that's why the other side feels that we are against trial lawyers, because we wanted to limit their pay to $2,000 an hour. Anyway, we were not able to discuss that here and we won't be able to have that amendment here today.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Higher Education Opportunity Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it took us 5 long years to get here today on the cusp of the first comprehensive renewal of Federal higher education programs in a decade. I am here to tell you that sometimes what we say is true; good things do come to those who wait. 
   I want to begin by thanking Chairman Miller, chairman of the full committee, and Representatives HINOJOSA and KELLER, the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, for their strong efforts on this product that we have here today. 
   The four of us have worked as equal partners in this endeavor, not always agreeing, but never losing sight of our shared commitment to making higher education in this country more accessible, affordable, and accountable. Representative Castle has also been a close partner of mine in the effort to reign in college costs, and I want to recognize him for his commitment. 
   Of course, the House did not do this alone. Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi have worked equally hard, and I want to thank them and recognize them for their efforts. Although Senator Kennedy was not able to be here in Washington for our final conference meeting yesterday, he has had a profound impact on the legislation, and he remains in our thoughts. Senator Mikulski filled in for him and did a yeoman's job and we want to thank her for her efforts. 
   We know how important higher education is, both to individuals and to our Nation. A college degree can be a ticket to the middle class. It helps individuals prepare for good jobs, and allows them to pursue new skills in a changing economy. Higher education also has important societal benefits. College education citizens are healthier, more civically-minded, have lower unemployment rates, and use fewer government benefits. An educated citizenry is also vital to maintaining our competitive edge in a changing world. 
   Because higher education is so important, we have made it a priority to ensure all Americans have access to a quality, affordable college education. In addition to making close to $100 billion in financial aid available to students, the Federal Government also spends billions of dollars each year on aid to institutions, support for college access programs, investments in research and development, and many other avenues that support higher education. 
   Despite the considerable Federal investment, or perhaps, in part, because of it, colleges and universities have increased tuition and fees year in and year out. The increases have come in good economic times and in bad, whether enrollments are surging or holding steady. It seems the only thing consistent about college costs is that they are going up, and going up rapidly. 
   With this bill, we hope to change that. Our principles for reform are based on the idea that by giving good information to consumers, we can empower them to exert influence on the marketplace. Through the power of sunshine and transparency, we are lifting the veil on college costs and holding institutions of higher learning accountable for their role in the cost equation. 
   Those principles of sunshine and transparency are hallmarks of this bill, and not just in the area of college costs. We are also letting the sun shine in on college operations and quality through enhanced institutional disclosure and a more transparent accreditation process. There are numerous positive reforms in this bill, too many even for me to name. 
   Of course, it is not a perfect bill. No bill is. I am particularly concerned about the number of new programs created in the conference report. Rather than trying to micromanage from Washington by creating a brandnew program for every possible contingency, we should focus on less red tape and greater local flexibility. 
   However, on the whole, this bill is an achievement of persistence and commitment. It updates programs to meet the needs of students in the 21st century. It recognizes the value of for-profit institutions of higher education. It promotes distance education, a mode of delivery that becomes more important every day as gas prices force students to limit their commuting to and from school. And, it uses the power of sunshine and transparency to transform all aspects of our higher education system. Above all else, this bill  offers real solutions to the college cost crisis. 
   I thank Members on both sides of the aisle for their commitment to this cause. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The Higher Education Opportunity Act is truly a bipartisan achievement, reflecting major priorities of both parties, as you can see from the debate. In recognition of that fact, I would like to take just a moment to touch on some of the reforms that Members on our side of the aisle were able to secure in this bill. 
   This bill includes meaningful steps to address the college cost crisis. I have been fighting this battle for years, and the steps in this bill are a victory for students and their families. 
   We have ensured that this bill increases accountability through the  power of sunshine and transparency. H.R. 4137 will put quality information in the hands of students and parents to help them make more informed decisions when choosing their path for obtaining a higher education. 
   This conference report protects student privacy by prohibiting the development of a Federal unit record system. Republicans believe students should not be forced to relinquish their privacy just because they wish to pursue post-secondary education. 
   This bill includes numerous reforms to strengthen Pell Grants for low-income students. The bill now prohibits Pell Grants from being provided to sex offenders that remain involuntarily confined by closing a loophole that allowed these individuals, deemed so dangerous that they cannot be released after completing their incarceration, to receive taxpayer-funded Pell Grants to pursue higher education. The bill also includes a sensible funding limitation to protect taxpayers and ensure students are making progress toward completing their degrees. 
   This conference report also includes a proposal to make transfer of credit policies public so students can plan ahead and avoid wasting time and money. It encourages States to develop and improve articulation agreements to make credit transfer easier among institutions within a State and across State lines. 
   Republicans have worked with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle for years to make it easier to apply for financial aid. Thanks to that effort, this legislation will create a shorter EZ-FAFSA form and make financial aid information available to students earlier in the college planning process. 
   Several committee members championed new efforts to ensure our higher education system can help meet our growing international competitive challenges. Specifically, the bill includes provisions to help increase the number of math, science, and foreign language teachers and professionals. 
   Republicans believe students should not be discriminated against on college campuses because of their political or ideological views, and that's why we fought to ensure the college conference would include an Academic Bill of Rights. 
   The bill also protects local control and prevents Federal meddling in curricula in programs under the Higher Education Act, including teacher training programs and within academic competitiveness grants. 
   Finally, in a time of war, we all recognize that our higher education system must be flexible enough to meet the unique needs of student-soldiers. The bill includes numerous proposals to improve higher education opportunities for members of the Armed Forces, including changes to allow greater participation in TRIO college access programs and improvements to the way financial aid is calculated for military personnel. 
   The bill also creates a Web site to make it easier for veterans and members of the military to find information on financial aid opportunities available to them, and it requires States to provide in-state tuition rates to members of the military, their spouses, and their dependent children. 
   These are just a few of the many reforms that were important to members of the committee during this process. I want to thank Chairman Miller again for working with me to ensure this bill is truly bipartisan, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting yes on this bill that contains so many important provisions. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time. 
   For years, Republicans have fought on behalf of students and families to make college more affordable. Now our cause is bipartisan, and our vision for reform is the centerpiece of a comprehensive Higher Education Act reauthorization. 
   For students and families grappling with rising college costs, this bill establishes college affordability comparison tools to help put cost increases into perspective. Students will be able to search, sort, and compare key cost indicators for every school in the country. We will identify institutions that are the most costly, the least costly, and those with the fastest rising costs. And for schools engaging in a pattern of extraordinarily high cost increases, we demand greater disclosure and concrete steps to identify inefficiencies and fix them. 
   This legislation reflects Republican principles for reform, including financial aid simplification, protection of student privacy, safeguards for taxpayer dollars, an emphasis on competitiveness, and many more positive reforms. 
   Before I close, I want to recognize the staff on both sides of the aisle for their hard work. I want to thank Amy Jones, in particular, for her tireless efforts. Amy has carried this bill now through two Congresses, and we couldn't have done it without her. 
   I also want to recognize Susan Ross and Rob Borden on my staff, along with my staff director, Sally Stroup. 
   I'd also like to recognize Chairman Miller's staff--and I'm trying to learn their names--including Gaby Gomez, Julie Radocchia, and Jeff Appel; great people, and they've worked hard and worked well together. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill isn't perfect, but it will make a real difference to students and families struggling to pay for college. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in voting yes to send this bill to the President for his signature.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, let me yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to put it on the record that I like women. I have been married almost 46 years, and we have three daughters and we have three sons, and I would not want the daughters to be discriminated against, I would not want my sons to be discriminated against. 
   I wish we could do something here that would end for all time all discrimination. Unfortunately, I guess when there are people involved in different things, some of them will tend to discriminate. That is why the law was passed in 1963, to level all pay. I want to just on the record make sure that everybody understands when we throw everybody into a pot and then add up all of their salaries, we are not talking about equal pay for equal jobs. 
   One of the things that we learned when we had the hearing last year, when we are talking about actual people and actual jobs, is that many women ended up going into, after graduating from college, many of them go into teaching, many of them go into social work. Many men go into jobs, some of them go into teaching. If they go into teaching, they are hired, they make the same exact wage. If the men go into social work and women go into social work, they make the same wage. But if a person goes into banking at a level that pays higher or into law at a level that pays higher, again, a woman going into law will make the same as a man. But when they throw all of these jobs into the same pile, that is where you get some differentiation in the pay. 
   Again, if we could just hold to equal pay, same job, same pay, I am totally supportive of that. That is what the law says, and that is what we should enforce. And the numbers that I quoted earlier, the pay is almost exactly the same. Where there is some discrimination, we should go after it, we should enforce the law. That is what I would encourage us to do. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman that spoke earlier, a good friend of mine from California, said that I gave a long description of equal pay for equal job, and I thought that that is kind of what the debate was about. People keep talking about wanting equal pay for equal job. They want to have the same pay for the woman as for the man for the same job. 
   Now, if we are just talking about we want just women paid the same as men for whatever job, then that is kind of the figures being used. But I think most of us know, we fly a lot, the pilot usually makes more than the flight attendant. Whether the flight attendant is male or female, they are paid the same. The pilot, whether he is male or female, they are paid the same. But the pilot is not paid the same as the flight attendant. We understand that, and I think that is probably not what we are arguing about here, but it seems like that is the way the debate is going. 
   I support equal pay for the same job, men, women. With this bill, apparently the debate is equal pay for men and women, and I thought that is what we were talking about, because that is what the debate is. But as the gentlewoman said, that is not what this bill does. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, again, it sounds like we are talking equal pay for equal work, and, again, I support that. I oppose discrimination. I support equal pay for equal job. 
   If we are saying that nurses should make the same as doctors, if the doctor is a female and the nurse is a male, should they make the some money? Or if the doctor is a male and the nurse is a female, should they make the same money? No. I think all nurses should make the same money. Doctors should make the same money if they are doing the same work. Not even all doctors make the same. Some surgeons make more than others, depending on their specialty, depending on what they do. 
   We understand that in our economy what the work does decides on what the pay is. I think if you take everybody working and divide up all of their pay, and you have more women that are serving in occupations that pay less, as my good friend just pointed out, women didn't have I guess the same opportunities in the past as they do now, and so if you took those figures and you had more women working in lower-paid fields, that is how you get the 77 percent discrepancy. 
   But if you took all of the same jobs, added up what they are paid, maybe 40 years ago, 50 years ago there was a lot more discrimination than now, but I think now if you look across the field and equal pay for equal job, you would  find there is, if anything, very little difference.     
   Should it be no difference? You bet. And I think you would probably find in some occupations you have women making more than men. And I guess men should probably claim discrimination in that case, but I don't think they should. I think the reason women are paid more is they are probably worth more. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Someone on the other side said this bill isn't about equal pay for equal work, but I know others have said it is about equal pay for equal work. I have Mr. Hoyer's statement here, the majority leader, and he began his statement saying equal pay for equal work. That is the principle that we are talking about.  
   The Paycheck Fairness Act is a clever name. Who doesn't support paycheck fairness? Unfortunately, that is not what this bill is offering. 
   No, Mr. Chairman. If this bill becomes law, it will make the system fundamentally unfair by putting the interests of the trial lawyers above the interests of the workers. 
   As I mentioned earlier, we did try to offer an amendment. I don't think it was totally out of line to think that we should maybe limit the trial lawyers working on these cases to $2,000 an hour. But every Democrat voted against that. And then they didn't let that amendment be placed in order to discuss here on the floor. I am sorry that we weren't able to do that. 
   This bill will expose family businesses to unlimited liability even if there is no intentional discrimination. The Democrats' fig leaf amendment doesn't change the fact that trial lawyers stand to receive a big payday by lowering the bar on costly jury awards. 
   This bill will encourage class-action lawsuits, treating the EPA as a litigation factory. This bill will make it harder for businesses to defend against legal challenges, inviting unscrupulous trial lawyers. I say unscrupulous; I have many good friends who are trial lawyers, and I exclude them from that definition. But the unscrupulous ones will pursue baseless claims. 
   Now we know what the bill would do. But what about what it fails to do? It doesn't prohibit discrimination under the law. We did that 45 years ago, as Mr. Price so eloquently explained. It doesn't offer working women new flexibility so that they can balance work and home. 
   Mrs. McMorris Rodgers had a bill earlier that she wanted to present that she has never been given the chance to do so. But it would give women the opportunity to take compensatory time, the same as government workers can do now. If you work overtime, you can be paid time-and-a-half in cash; but if you want to take that time in compensatory time, we do not give people the opportunity to do that. We should do that. 
   It certainly doesn't do anything to bring down the price of gasoline, which is the number one issue many working families are struggling with today. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a bad bill. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose it. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I will not oppose the gentlelady's amendment, but I wish to make clear, as with the other Democratic amendments to this bill that we are likely to debate today, this amendment makes the most minor of improvements to a fundamentally flawed bill. I will not oppose the amendment, but its adoption does not change my strong opposition to the underlying bill. 
   As I understand the gentlelady's amendment, it would strike from the underlying bill a provision which would extend the Equal Pay Act to cover not only employees, but even applicants for employment. I agree that striking this provision is the right thing to do. 
   Under current law, and since 1963, the Equal Pay Act has required that employers pay equal wages earned for equal work performed. It is hard to imagine how the law was ever meant to cover the payment of wages which have not yet been earned for work that has not yet been done. Frankly, the provision should not have been included in the bill in the first place, and I support its deletion. 
   That said, I stress again that this change is, at best, cosmetic and too little too late to address the fundamental flaws in the underlying bill. Put more simply, this amendment is the equivalent of putting lipstick on a pig. At the end of the day, it doesn't change things much. 
   You know where I got that from. 
   I will not oppose the amendment, but I remain opposed to the bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I think that we have heard in this debate today, 70 percent, 77 percent, over and over and over and over. And when we had a hearing last year, we had a lot of different figures that were given. It seems to me that it is important to have an outside source look at this, and I think the Secretary of Labor should do this study so that we don't do more harm than good. 
   I think this is a good amendment. I thank the gentleman for offering it, and I urge support of the amendment.

   Mr. McKEON. I will not oppose the gentleman's amendment. As I understand it, the gentleman's amendment  does two things: First, it provides a 6-month delay in the effective date of the bill; and second, it directs the Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to develop materials to assist small businesses in complying with the law's new requirements. 
   I do not object to either of these provisions. Indeed, I have always believed that we should do all we can, all that we should to assist small businesses which are the backbone of our economy and the leading source of job growth in our Nation. 
   Frankly, I would say that the gentleman's approach is a decidedly second-best option. As we just heard in debate on the prior amendment, I would support delaying implementation of the key provisions of this bill until we have a full understanding of its impact on jobs and on the recruiting and hiring of employees. If Members genuinely want to make sure the businesses, particularly small businesses, are not unfairly penalized by this legislation, they will, I hope, support the amendment previously offered by my colleague, Mr. Price, which will do just that. 
   I will also say there is a certain irony here. While the gentleman's amendment purports to help small businesses, what it fails to do is address fundamental flaws in the underlying bill, core issues which leave me to strongly oppose this legislation today. As I have said before and I expect I will say again before debate is concluded, the underlying bill offers little to benefit working women and families while threatening to wreck havoc on workers and employers by expanding liability and encouraging costly lawsuits. Nothing in the gentleman's amendment changes that simple fact. 
   I will not oppose the gentleman's amendment, but I would advise Members to not kid themselves into thinking that compliance assistance for small business in any real way addresses core failings in the underlying bill. Whether this amendment is adopted or not, I remain opposed to H.R. 1338 and urge my colleague to join me in voting ``no'' on final passage. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I will not oppose this amendment. I do want to make clear that as the gentlelady spoke, the Chamber of Commerce supports her amendment, not the bill. They are opposed, as I am, to the underlying bill. I want to be clear that adoption or defeat will not change my position on the underlying bill. The so-called Paycheck Fairness Act, which we're debating today, has nothing to do with making paychecks fairer and everything to do with lining the pockets of trial lawyers. 
   The gentlelady's amendment tinkers at the margins of just one of the bill's fundamental flaws. Whether adopted or not, it does not change my strong opposition or the Chamber of Commerce's strong opposition to the underlying bill. 
   The gentlelady's amendment would appear to limit the circumstances in which a plaintiff can recover punitive damages under the bill to those situations where he or she can show that an employer acted with malice or reckless indifference. First, let me point out that nowhere in the Fair Labor Standards Act or Equal Pay Act is this standard of proof, malice, or reckless indifference used. It's an entirely new concept to this statute and one which will no doubt and to no one's great surprise encourage extended litigation to determine its meaning in the context of the Equal Pay Act. 
   Even more telling is what the gentlelady's amendment does not do. It does not limit compensatory or punitive damages but still puts employers  at risk for unlimited punitive and compensatory damage awards, remedies far beyond those contained in title VII, nor does it require that the plaintiff show the employer engaged in intentional discrimination. Presumably now an employer can be slapped with a multimillion-dollar punitive fine if a jury finds that he or she was indifferent, whatever that means. 
   When all is said and done, the amendment does little, if anything, to address the radical expansion of liability and the payback to trial lawyers contained in the bill. I'm excited to see what lawyers will do with that in front of a judge discussing indifference and how that pertains to the law. The gentlelady's amendment provides the most modest limitations of the bill's dramatic expansion of liability that one could imagine. 
   Now some limitation may be better than none at all, but this fig leaf does not come close to addressing core problems in the bill. 
   I will not oppose the amendment, but I remain strongly opposed to the underlying bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I will not oppose this amendment. I don't know that any Member of the House would or could. It is simply a restatement of current law. I strongly believe that every employer and every worker should comply with our Nation's immigration laws. Indeed, I have long argued that our immigration laws need to be strengthened, that we need to get serious about reasserting control of our borders, enforcing the laws that are on the books and enhancing those laws which are failing if we truly want to secure our borders.     
   No one is as committed to those goals as I am. 
   That said, that is a debate for another day, and not the issue presented to us in this bill. We are not debating the question of immigration reform, but rather, whether we should adopt a trial lawyer bonanza under the guise of ``paycheck fairness.'' As I have said before, this bill does nothing to promote fairness in pay, and everything to invite costly, and often frivolous, litigation. 
   Whether the gentleman's amendment is adopted today or not, that fact will not change. This is an ill-conceived bill, based on flawed and demonstrably false economic theories, and sure to lead to unintended consequences for workers and employers. 
   The gentleman's amendment is inoffensive, but it is not particularly meaningful. I will not oppose the amendment, but it does not change my strong opposition to the underlying bill, nor my intention to vote ``no'' on final passage. 
   I would like to address the gentlelady that spoke on the amendment just before. When she concluded her statement, she commented on her fact of having been a small businesswoman and running a family business. I had the same experience for many years before I came here to Congress. It's good to see other small businesspeople come to Congress, and I appreciate her amendment that she presented. 
   And I also want to restate again the fact that, even though the Chamber did support her amendment, that we're strongly opposed to the underlying bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H. Con. Res. 63 and in support of a just cause that is facing a critical turning point. The outcome hangs in the balance, and, Mr. Speaker, we should not kid ourselves into believing that victory is foreordained. 
   Churchill once said that there would not be war if both sides did not believe that they could win it. The enemy we face in Iraq and in the broader war against the radical Islamists is driven by an apocalyptic vision of God, and because such apocalyptic visions are rooted in faith and not facts, they are very hard to dispel. We, therefore, face an opponent who is neither open to reason nor to compromise, nor will he necessarily be defeated by calculations of military strategy and prudence. 
   We face the paradox of a perilous time. At the opening of the 21st century, we are opposed by an adversary who preaches the savagery and barbarism of the 12th century. We face in Iraq an enemy that will allow us absolutely no quarter, and, Mr. Speaker, I am bound to say that I think we in this chamber, and, indeed, even in the country at large, have been slow to grasp that fact. 
   However, the difficulty of the fight should not dissuade us from waging it if the cause is just, and the cause is just. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have had the sad duty to attend the funerals of several of the servicemen killed in Iraq who come from my district. There are those who say that we should not withdraw from Iraq because to do so would mean that they died in vain. That is not correct. Nothing that we have done or will do will ever subtract one ounce from the valor and nobility of those who have died in the service of their country. 
   As Lincoln said in the Gettysburg Address, ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.'' 
   However, we should pause to note that our service men and women are fighting and sometimes dying because they know the terrible price that will be paid if our adversaries prevail. They have seen, as I have seen when I traveled to Iraq, what a world our enemies would have us live in. It is a world filled by a grotesque and distorted vision of God. It is a world of slavery and submission, where the Almighty is not a benevolent and loving creator of his children, but rather is a pagan idol that demands blood sacrifice and glories in the murder of the innocent. 
   You need look no further than the carnage in Baghdad, or Kabul, or Mogadishu, or never let us forget the Twin Towers, to see the truth in that axiom. That is what our enemy, for all his talk of God, seeks to do, and we are all that stands between our adversary and the realization of this nihilistic vision. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are those in this House who are far better versed than I in the strategy and military calculations that are the essence of this conflict. There are those who say that we mistakenly entered the war in Iraq on the basis of flawed intelligence. This, I think, underestimates the nature of our adversary. 
   Given the expansiveness of our enemy's nightmare vision, I think it is safe to say there would have been a war in Iraq no matter what we did. That, of course, will be for historians to decide. But this much I do know: We stand for hope. We fight for peace in a world that is free. We sacrifice now so that the little children that I met when I was in Iraq might live in a better world tomorrow, and because they will have a better world, we Americans will live in a safer one. To quote DeGaulle, ``Behind this terrible cloud of our blood and tears here is the sun of our grandeur shining out once again.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I do have one concern. I think that we in this Congress have allowed too wide a gap to develop between the society we help to govern and the war we have been compelled to wage. We have to correct this, because we will not win this war in Iraq or beyond unless we as a Nation come to grips with what we face and begin to act accordingly. 
   We must never forget, to quote Lincoln again, ``Public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it, nothing can succeed.'' Right now I look around me and I see a Congress and a country distracted, and nothing could be deadlier to our security and our hopes for a better future. 
   To some extent, this is understandable. America is and has every right to be tired of conflict. In 1917, for the first time we went ``over there'' to make the world safe for democracy. In 1941, in Churchill's evocative phrase, the new world stepped forth, yet again, to the rescue and liberation of the old.     
   Then after 1945, we stayed on to wage the long twilight struggle that came to be called the Cold War. 
   Then, in 1989, a miracle. We stopped holding our breaths. The Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union disappeared. The hair trigger nightmare of the nuclear world seemed to recede. We came off of the figurative tip-toes on which we had been standing for nearly 50 years. We had grown so accustomed to it that when the Cold War ended, we scarcely realized just how nerve wracking, and what a strain, it had all been. 
   Now here we are again. More war, more sacrifice, more death. It is not a pleasant picture but it offers this. It offers hope. It offers an alternative to yet another in a long line of obscene and perverted visions that seem to be forever conjured in the minds of men. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have dared to say today something that very few of us seem to be willing to say. We could lose this war.  
   There is nothing in the stars that says we must prevail. In history, freedom is the exception, not the rule. So I say to my colleagues, we must press on in Iraq. We must fight wisely, but we must not falter. 
   Churchill once said in the midst of another terrible war, ``Give us the tools and we will finish the job.'' Mr. Speaker, it is the duty of this House and of this Congress and of this Nation to give our men and women the tools they need to see this conflict through to the end. We must send them the reinforcements they need to win this war--and that is why, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat this misguided resolution. 
   Most of all we must stand together. That way, when our children and grandchildren look back at this moment in history, they will say that at the threatened nightfall the blood of their fathers ran strong.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. I have great respect for him, and I know of his strong dedication to the troops and to the people serving. 
   I had in my office yesterday a constituent, a young man that played football for my brother at home. I introduced him to the chairman. He has spent the last 3 years at Walter Reed. He says he is like one of those dinosaurs that has a big mouth and two hands that he can't use, and he does struggle, and he has a bad leg. He was a master sergeant and he protected his troops but he took rounds from mortar. In talking to him he said, this debate is very distracting and hard for the morale of the troops. 
   I pray that they will understand that all of us have different feelings, but we do understand their devotion and their commitment to duty, and they understand our commitment. We just see things differently, and at the end of the day, I hope what we end up doing is what will be best for our troops and for our country and for the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the H.R. 976, the Small Business Tax Relief Act.  
   Last month, after the new Majority rushed an unbalanced minimum wage bill to the floor without following regular order and without opportunity for amendment, I spoke from here and explained to my colleagues that I believed it was a colossal missed opportunity. Now, about six weeks later, it's clear that a colossal missed opportunity is exactly what it was. 
   From the outset, I joined many of my colleagues in insisting on protections for small businesses and their workers as part of a comprehensive minimum wage bill. I thank one of these colleagues, Mr. McCRERY, for his work on the legislation before us. He joined me prior to our debate last month in introducing comprehensive minimum wage legislation that provides small business protections similar to those found in this bill. As a result of our action here today, when we finally send a final measure to the President, I am confident that it will look a lot more like our bill than it will the Majority's initial, unbalanced proposal. 
   Small businesses create two-thirds of our Nation's new jobs, and they represent 98 percent of our new businesses. Since they are responsible for so much of our Nation's recent economic growth. they and their workers are counting on Congress to consider how any minimum wage proposal would impact them. And this legislation will help us do just that. 
   More than ever, Mr. Speaker, momentum remains squarely on the side of those who want to act in a comprehensive way so small businesses and their workers are not left to fend for themselves in the face of a hike in the minimum wage mandate. And today, we're one step closer to sending President Bush a final product that doesn't saddle them with unnecessary burdens at the same time that they are creating most of the new jobs in our in our growing economy. This bill was crafted with that goal in mind, and because of that, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of it.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act. 
   First, let me extend my thanks to Armed Services Committee Chairman Skelton and Ranking Republican Duncan Hunter for bringing this partisan legislation to the Floor today. The bill before us authorizes funding for our national defense programs in the coming year, including our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It enjoys the support of both Republicans and Democrats on the Armed Services Committee, and in fact was reported out of committee by a unanimous vote. I am very pleased to note that while some circumstances have changed in this Congress, the Armed Services Committee remains one in which Members on both sides of the aisle remain committed to comity, bipartisanship, and the best interests of our Nation's defense and our brave men and women in uniform. I congratulate both Chairman Skelton and Mr. Hunter on their successful efforts, and intend to vote in support of this bill later today. 
   I would take this opportunity to raise concern with one of the amendments made in order under the rule, specifically, the Altmire/Udall Amendment, which would expand employer mandates under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Let me state at the outset that I will not oppose this amendment, nor will I urge my Republican colleagues to do so. I do, however, for the record and for the good of this legislation going forward, want to note my strong concerns with this amendment. 
   First, let me say that as a matter of procedure and responsible legislative process, I am deeply troubled that this amendment comes to the Floor today without so much as a cursory examination by the only committee of jurisdiction in the House, the Committee on Education and Labor, on which I serve as Senior Republican Member. The Altmire/Udall Amendment represents a significant expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act, and would be the first such expansion in the 14-year history of the Act. Yet it has not been the subject of a single hearing in the Committee on Education and Labor, nor has any Member of the House or my Committee had the opportunity to examine the impact of this amendment in even the broadest sense. Where, as under this amendment, we are talking about expanding a federal mandate that potentially impacts large and small employers in every industry and every state in the union, I think we owe more to our constituents. 
   I do not want my concern and my remarks to be construed as simply procedural, or solely a function of marking jurisdictional turf. While I do believe that respect for the committee legislative process is important, I want to make clear that I have substantive concerns as a matter of policy with the Altmire/Udall Amendment. The Amendment would appear to broadly expand the Family and Medical Leave Act, allowing any covered employee to make use of leave for ``any exigency'' that arises out of the fact that a family member is called to active duty. Now I am certain that Members on both sides of the aisle would agree that the question of whether and how we ensure that workers whose families have been impacted by a call-up to active duty are able to address legitimate needs is a valid question. I am concerned, however, that the language of the Altmire/Udall Amendment may go much further than intended, and potentially create an overly broad use of leave. Similarly, under the Amendment, an employee could use this leave intermittently, in very small increments, and in many instances, with potentially little or no advance notice to an employer. 
   Earlier this year, the Department of Labor set forth a Request for Information seeking detailed evidence and recommendations for both regulatory and legislative changes to the Family and Medical Leave Act. That process is ongoing as we speak. Members on both sides of the aisle and various stakeholders have made clear that the Act deserves serious examination--particularly with respect to questions as to when and how leave can be taken, and what sorts of leave and notice are appropriate. In light of these facts, to embark on piecemeal expansion of one of the most significant federal labor laws adopted in the last 20 years, strikes me as irresponsible, and setting a very bad precedent.  
   As I indicated, I think I understand the concerns of the sponsor that this amendment is intended to address, and I think those are concerns that many might share. For that reason, I will not oppose the amendment. I've made my concerns with both the substance and procedure of this amendment clear. I would hope that as this bill moves forward, and if we find ourselves in conference with the other body, we will take the necessary time to examine this amendment in detail, and work towards ensuring that it accomplishes its goals in a reasonable, responsible, and targeted way.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (THIRD HIGHER EDUCATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House began this exercise last week granting a temporary extension of programs under the Higher Education Act. We did the same thing in July of this year and in June, and we did it a half dozen times before that. For the most part, these extensions have been clean, simply maintaining current law. Unfortunately, they are now becoming more complicated. 
   Earlier this year, Congress passed a package of student aid reforms cloaked in the guise of a budget reconciliation bill. Instead of moving through regular order, the new majority took a shortcut. That shortcut has cost us dearly. Budget reconciliation bills have strict limitations designed to prevent them from being abused as a tool to enact policy, rather than budgetary reform. 
   Judging by this year's bill, those rules are not strict enough. Nonetheless, the budget reconciliation process chosen by the majority prevented us from including fundamental reforms to the bulk of the Higher Education Act. 
   A few weeks ago, committee Republicans introduced H.R. 3746, the College Access and Opportunity Act of 2007.  This bill is an updated version of the reauthorization bill that passed the House last Congress. H.R. 3746 would strengthen the Pell Grant program, empower parents and students through ``sunshine'' and transparency and college costs and accreditation, improve college access programs and much more. Unfortunately, the House has yet to act on comprehensive reforms. 
   The budget bill enacted earlier this year was a missed opportunity of epic proportions. But worse than that, it was a classic example of how a secretive rushed legislative process can produce harmful unintended consequences. 
   In rushing to the floor with the reconciliation bill, Democrats made mistakes. Several provisions included in the reconciliation bill need to be fixed so that everyone is treated fairly under the law and the law can be implemented as Congress intended. Additionally, the Department of Education has already reached out to Congress to discuss one of the new grant programs, which they see as near to impossible to implement as written. 
   Had Congress had time to contemplate the impact of the provisions in the new programs, we may have been able to avoid all the confusion that now must be corrected. Today, in addition to extending these programs, we are being forced to fix mistakes made by the flawed budget reconciliation bill. Some of these mistakes can be corrected because the Department of Education has yet to act on them, despite the October 1 implementation date. Other legislative errors have already been implemented by the Department of Education, rendering a correction costly, if not impossible. 
   Already our hands are tied, and we are unable to fairly and fully correct the problems created through reconciliation. Rather than repeat this rushed process again, I hope that we will move forward with the Higher Education Act reauthorization in a bipartisan and thoughtful manner. 
   I look forward to working with Chairmen Miller and Hinojosa and Ranking Member Keller, and all of my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee, in completing our work in the coming months. 
   In the meantime, however, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this extension. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my strong support for HR 356, legislation I introduced earlier this year to remove restrictions on 25 acres of land patented to the Mammoth County Water District. 
   Prior to 1987, the District occupied this land through a special use permit with the Forest Service. Of these 25 acres, 12 acres were used for the storage of materials, and prior to 1987, for oxidation ponds, which had become obsolete by that year. 
   After that time, Congress passed Public Law 97-465 that allowed these lands to be transferred directly to the District. While the law allowed for acquisition of these lands, it also directed that they could only be used for those purposes prior to the time of the conveyance. 
   Today, however, these 12 acres are no longer needed for the storage of materials and the community would like to utilize this land in a more economically and socially viable manner. 
   Such restrictions as those currently placed on the aforementioned acreage hinder the Mammoth community's ability to respond to the growing needs of its citizens and visitors. 
   As such, passage of this legislation would allow the town to accommodate for the growing economic and social needs of the region. In particular I am pleased to inform my colleagues of plans to use these acres for enhanced emergency services availability for the people of Mammoth Lakes. 
   I would like to express my deep appreciation to Chairman Rahall for bringing this legislation to the floor and ask my colleagues to support its passage here today.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (PELL GRANT EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 990, the Pell Grant Equity Act. 
   I thank my friend and colleague, Chairman Miller, for his work on this legislation. I also thank Ranking Member Keller of the Higher Education Subcommittee and Chairman Hinojosa for working with us on this measure. 
   The Pell Grant Equity Act will repeal a Federal rule known as ``tuition sensitivity.'' This arcane rule reduces the annual maximum Pell Grant for students attending institutions with very low tuition charges. 
   In a time when we are trying to keep the cost of education down, we penalize students that choose to go to a school that is charging less tuition. It seems like we have it really mixed up, and I am glad this bill is coming out to help us change that. Simply put, Mr. Speaker, a student should not be forced to sacrifice grant aid because of their choice of one institution over another. 
   As Congress and the President work to continue improving student aid programs, it is illogical that certain students who may otherwise be eligible for a maximum Pell Grant won't get it simply because of where they go to school. Moreover, repealing this rule takes away an incentive for some low-cost institutions to raise their tuition in order for their students to become eligible for the maximum Pell award. 
   The tuition sensitivity rule is estimated to impact between 90,000 and 100,000 students each year, with these students losing hundreds of dollars in grant aid annually, the students that need it the most. 
   With many California community colleges reducing their cost of attendance this semester, the tuition sensitivity rule is expected to have an even more substantial impact for students in that State if not corrected. 
   So I am especially pleased, just as I am sure Chairman Miller is, that this measure will benefit many of those seeking postsecondary education in our home State. 
   Mr. Speaker, I must say that as much as I support this bill, I wish it could have been the law of the land much sooner. This measure was included in the College Access and Opportunity Act, which the House passed last year to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. Similarly, had House Republicans, or anyone else for that matter, been able to offer this as an amendment to H.R. 5 earlier this year, I would have done so. 
   As is often the case in Washington, it is better late than never. I am pleased to support this measure which helps students and is fully paid for in accordance with the budget rules. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues. And I hope we can find more opportunities for bipartisan cooperation on college access down the road. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Keller, such time as he may consume.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 126. This resolution recognizes the University of Southern California football team for yet another great season, winning the PAC-10 conference as well as their dominating 32-18 victory over the University of Michigan in the granddaddy of them all, the Rose Bowl. 
   USC has put together one of the best coaching staffs in the country, and this game was proof. Early in the second half, Michigan had made it clear to USC that they could not establish the run. Now, former USC offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin said, ``We're not running the ball for another play.'' And for the next 30 plays USC took to the air, rushing the ball only twice. 
   The ability of Coach Carroll and his coaching staff to change the game plan mid-game and make personnel adjustments is what separates USC from the rest of the country every year, and led them to their Rose Bowl victory. 
   Today, when you hear about USC winning the Rose Bowl and finishing the season as the fourth best team in the country, it doesn't sound like too much of an accomplishment, that is until you look at this team and see that they lost two Heisman trophy winners, six key pieces in their offense in the first three rounds of the NFL draft, and lost 11 players overall to the NFL before the season began. 
   I extend my congratulations to Head Coach Pete Carroll, his coaching staff, and every one of the dedicated players, the fans, and to the University of Southern California. 
   I am happy to join in honoring this exceptional team and also of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 103. This resolution congratulates the Mount Union College Purple Raiders for winning the 2006 NCAA Division III Football National Championship. 
   The Purple Raiders captured the title by defeating the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Warhawks 35-16 in the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl on December 16 in front of 6,051 faithful fans. 
   Since 1990, and under the tutelage of Head Coach Larry Kehres, the Raiders have made 16 playoff appearances while posting college football's most wins and best winning percentage. Coach Kehres completed his 21st year at the helm of the Purple Raiders football fortunes in 2006 and has built one of the most successful programs in all of college football. His teams have won 17 Ohio Athletic Conference Championships while posting 15 undefeated regular seasons and have won nine Division III National Championships in the last 14 years. Along the way, Coach Kehres has compiled a phenomenal 246-20-3 record and the best career winning percentage for a head coach, at any division level, in the history of college football. For his efforts, Kehres has been named the AFCA Division III National Coach of the Year eight times. 
   I extend my congratulations to Head Coach Larry Kehres, all of the hardworking players, the fans, and to Mount Union College. I am happy to join my good friend and colleague Representative Regula in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield at this time such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula).

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in opposition to this conference report which is the product of both a flawed policy and a flawed process. 
   The conference report was made available to Republicans for the first time less than 24 hours before it reached the Rules Committee. Unfortunately, that was just the latest in a series of disappointments we have endured throughout the process. But perhaps my greatest disappointment is the sinking reality that this conference agreement could have done more to help low-income students gain access to college. Instead, I fear we have squandered a tremendous opportunity. 
   College Cost Reduction, the name of this act, really is not a part of this bill. It is a huge spending bill. There is one element of this conference report worthy of praise, and I would like to begin there. 
   This conference agreement will invest approximately $11 billion in Pell Grants, which I believe are the single most effective tool to help open the doors of higher education to low-income students. 
   The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller), the senior Republican of the Subcommittee on Higher Education, Lifelong Learning and Competitiveness, deserves great credit for the Pell Grant increases that have been provided over the last several years. Mr. Keller is a champion for the Pell Grant program, having founded the Congressional Pell Grant Caucus to advocate for this critical program. The recipient of a Pell Grant himself, Mr. Keller has shined a spotlight on the importance of targeting the Federal investment in higher education to serve low-income students. 
   If I had been in the room when this agreement was reached, I would have preferred to invest even more in Pell Grants. In fact, I advocated a straightforward approach to reform that would have saved billions of dollars by making the student loan program more efficient and plowed those resources directly into Pell Grants. It is an approach that I continue to believe would have received strong bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. Instead, the Democrats opted to jeopardize the stability of the Federal Financial Education Loan program by imposing excessive cuts, created an unnecessary complex and cumbersome auction scheme that will deny parents a choice of loan providers, imposed an impossible timeline for implementation that sets students up for confusion and program participants up for failure, and created massive new entitlement programs. 
   I harbor serious concerns about this conference report when it is simply taken at face value. Unfortunately, I fear that when we consider the long-term ramifications, these concerns grow much more serious. 
   First, the conference report creates new entitlement programs, but only provides short-term funding. Every single person in this room knows that once created, an entitlement will not die. That means in 5 years we will be forced to make additional cuts to fund these new entitlements.     
   Second, the conference report includes the misguided plan to temporarily reduce interest rates. What once was a campaign promise has become a trap that will ensnare either students or taxpayers, and possibly both. The plan would temporarily phase down interest rates over the next 4 years, and just as soon as the rate gets down to half the level it is today, as Democrats promised during the campaign, it will jump back to its current level. The choice then becomes whether we break the promise to students and allow the rates to rise or break the promise to taxpayers that this legislation is paid for and stick them with an additional 20 to $30 billion to pay for those cuts over the next 5 years. 
   The third consequence of this proposal, which I believe the majority has not considered, is the undue burden that will be caused by its hasty implementation. The conference report presumes that complex technological and service changes will be implemented in a matter of weeks. It seems almost inevitable that this unrealistic timeline will create chaos within these programs for students, program participants and the Department of Education. 
   And, finally, let me be perfectly clear. I have absolutely no confidence in the Department of Education's ability to implement the changes outlined in this conference report, particularly with the timeline it sets. It gives me no pleasure to point out this obvious fact, particularly in a Republican administration, but it's true, and sadly, we will all be watching this failure play out in the weeks, months and years ahead. 
   There's another issue that bears mentioning, and it's what this conference report unfortunately does not do. Despite its lofty name, this legislation does nothing at all to reduce the cost of college. It didn't have to be this way. In fact, the bill that passed the House contained provisions that I championed to make college cost increases more transparent to students and parents. These commonsense reforms were stripped away, leaving consumers with nothing. 
   The majority will tell you these college cost provisions were removed because they did not meet the stringent rules applied to a budget reconciliation package. That may well be true. If so, I consider it further proof that by abusing the reconciliation process we missed key opportunities to help students. 
   While this conference agreement is unmistakably a product of the Democratic Congress, I cannot help but express my disappointment in the administration for their role in this process. The fiscal year 2008 budget request proposed excessive cuts to the student loan programs, cuts that I believe may ultimately destabilize the largest source of Federal financial assistance. And when the bill left this House, the administration promised to veto the bill if some of these egregious measures were left in the bill. They are still there, and I now understand the President will sign the bill. 
   This conference agreement makes a significant investment in the Pell Grant Program. For that, I'm appreciative. I only wish it had done more. I wish that we could have seized upon the opportunity, worked together in a bipartisan fashion, and produced a conference report that lived up to its name. 
   Madam Speaker, I am deeply disappointed in the conference report we are considering and the process that was used to get here, and so I must oppose final passage. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, we've, I think, heard some very good things about this bill. I've been on this committee now for 15 years since I  came to Congress. I've had great concerns about people that are not able to go to college. We've seen statistics that show that 48 percent of young people from lower-income families are not able to attend college because of the cost of college. I have introduced legislation. I've done what I could to try to reduce the cost of college. 
   This bill is called the Cost Reduction Act. It does nothing to reduce the cost of college. It gives money to schools, which we haven't done in the past. We've given the money to individual students and let them pick the school that they've gone to. It does increase the money to Pell Grants, and I appreciate that. 
   During the time that I was Chair of the Higher Education Subcommittee and the time that we've been in the majority, we've doubled the money going into Pell Grants, and we have a million and a half students, now, more that are receiving Pell Grants than before. And that's good. 
   But the thing about this bill that really bothers me, I guess, is the promise it holds out to students that they're never going to receive. It reminds me of a TV contest, game contest that I've seen in the past that showed three curtains or three doors, and you tried to pick the door that had the great prize. And my concern is that these students are going to start school with the idea that their interest is going to be cheaper 4 years, 5 years from now when they graduate, and they're going to find that it's not. There's a promise there that when they open that door they're going to find a huge tax burden. They're going to find huge loan burdens. 
   And what we should be working on in a cost reduction bill is something that actually addresses what we can do to lower the cost of a college education, not the loan interest. What we should really be trying to do is address the core problem, the cost. College cost has been going up four times faster than people's ability to pay for the last 20 years. We should be addressing that problem. We should oppose this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. This rule would provide for consideration of fiscally irresponsible legislation that would create costly new entitlement programs and misdirect billions of aid toward colleges, universities, college graduates and philanthropic organizations rather than the low-income students who need the help the most. 
   My colleagues who were around in the last Congress may remember that when we passed a real budget reconciliation bill, the Education and Workforce Committee found some $18 billion plus in savings, two-thirds of which we directed towards deficit reduction and one-third of which we directed towards increased student benefits such as higher loan limits, more grant aid for low-income, high-achieving students, and loan forgiveness for high-demand teachers. Unfortunately, H.R. 2669, the bill that will be before us today, takes us in a drastically different direction. 
   The rule before us provides for the culmination of months of abuse of the budget reconciliation process as a backdoor way to implement significant changes to programs best addressed through regular order. Not a single committee hearing has been held on this legislation. The potential impact of many of its student loan cuts has never been weighed, and no one has provided adequate reasons regarding why the new entitlement programs and complex student loan auction scheme created under the conference report are necessary or fiscally reasonable. 
   It eliminates the right of parents to choose their lender and replaces consumer choice with a government-run auction system that is complex, burdensome and untested. And all of this will be put into place in a couple of weeks time. I'm anxious to see how the department puts this into place. 
   This measure could have been improved by infusing more savings into the Pell Grant Program. Pell is a proven success that has helped millions of young people attend college. In the time during the last 12 years that we were in charge, we have increased Pell Grant spending double. As the chairman just pointed out, the amount of what he talked about, the individual aid to each individual student, has remained fairly even, but the amount that we have put in has been increased like a billion dollars a year over that period of time because we have a million and a half more students that have now been able to take advantage of that and use the money for their help in getting their chance to achieve the American Dream. 
   By creating a bundle of new entitlement programs complete with new bureaucracy, rules, and regulations, this conference agreement places billions of dollars in new Federal spending on autopilot with no accountability to taxpayers whatsoever, completely opposite of what the real purpose of reconciliation is for. 
   The purpose of reconciliation, requiring an easier passage by only requiring 50 votes in the Senate, was set up to reduce mandatory spending and to save money on the budget deficit. And this will actually increase and go just the opposite direction. 
   And finally, let me be perfectly clear: I have absolutely no confidence in the Department of Education's ability to implement the changes outlined in this conference agreement, particularly with the timeline it sets. It gives me no pleasure to point out this obvious fact, particularly in a Republican administration, but it's true. And sadly, we will be watching this failure play out in the coming months and years. 
   The rule allows consideration of a conference report that breaks promises to students and taxpayers alike. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing it.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 5715, a bill that will help ensure college students and their families are able to plan with confidence for the upcoming school year. On its own, this bill will not restore confidence and stability to the student loan programs, but it is an important first step. 
   For months, Members on both sides of the aisle have been warning the U.S. Departments of Education and the Treasury, the various federal financial institutions, and indeed anyone who will listen, about the potential risks to our student loan program. Many of us recognized early that it was only a matter of time before the turmoil in the broader credit markets would spill into the student loan programs. 
   Unfortunately, those warnings have become reality. I would like to share just a few of the headlines that have appeared in major papers over the last several weeks. The Wall Street Journal said, Credit Woes Hit Student Loans. The New York Times said, Fewer Options Open to Pay For Costs of College. The Washington Post said, Credit Crisis May Make College Loans More Costly: Some Firms Stop Lending to Students. USA Today said, Credit Woes May Hinder College-Bound. 
   Mr. Chairman, with this bill, we are acting to prevent a crisis before it develops. As these headlines demonstrate, the anxieties among students and families are very real. This bill is far from a complete solution. But it contains modest, yet meaningful, steps to restore investor confidence, begin to address liquidity shortages, and most importantly, provide assistance to student and parent borrowers. 
   The challenges in the student loan market are multifaceted. Last year, federal support for the loan program was slashed, forcing loan providers to scale back on benefits and reevaluate their future participation in the program. This year, disruptions in the capital markets have reduced liquidity and shaken investor and consumer confidence. 
   With enactment of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act last fall, we cut some $18 billion from the program over 5 years. Although we were able to reinvest some of those funds in Pell Grants, which I strongly support, it appears now that we may have done more harm along with that good. That's because we cut so deeply into the student loan program that many lenders have opted to stop offering federal loans altogether. 
   On the issue of liquidity, what we require is a two-pronged approach to reinstate the flawed capital into the program. 
   First, this bill authorizes the U.S. Department of Education to act as a secondary market by purchasing or agreeing to purchase student loans so that lenders and holders can make or purchase new loans in the upcoming school year. Although this plan will provide only a modest amount of liquidity, it sends an important signal that policymakers are committed to the program's long-term stability. And it does so with no cost to the taxpayer. 
   Second, to provide an even greater flow of capital into the program, we are taking steps to ensure other federal financing authorities are viewed as viable sources of liquidity. To that end, this legislation contains a sense of Congress, urging these authorities to exercise their existing authorities to inject liquidity into the marketplace. 
   We're not alone in recognizing that this market-based problem requires a marked-based solution. Just yesterday, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing on the impact of market disruptions on student loan access, and he called for intervention by the Federal Financing Bank. I welcome these types of creative and complementary approaches, which will work in concert to calm the market. 
   Taken together, the prospect of federal financial institutions and the U.S. Department of Education stand ready to take the necessary steps to invest in and commit to the future purchase of loans will begin to quell the market uncertainty and restore confidence among investors, as well as among students and families planning for the coming school year. 
   The troubles facing our financial markets and our economy as a whole are daunting. But we would do a real disservice to students and families if we dismissed the challenges in the student loan program as merely a symptom of a larger problem that is outside our control. The fact is, we can take steps to prevent a collapse in the student loan market. We can do so quickly, and without a cost to taxpayers, by focusing on our commitment to market stability. 
   I would also offer a word of caution to those who are wary of federal intervention: If we fail to act now, we may be forced to take on a much greater governmental role in the future. And surely we can all agree that it's better to preserve the private sector program now than to replace it with a federal program later. 
   We made a commitment more than four decades ago that there are national benefits to an affordable, accessible higher education system. What we are doing today is restating that commitment and sending a signal to students and families that we continue to believe in this program that has opened the doors of higher education to so many millions of aspiring young Americans. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill that deserves our support. I want to thank the chairman for moving so quickly on this issue. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. I thank my good friend from Michigan for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying how I wish we had followed a more open and inclusive process up to this point. My friends on the other side of the aisle pledged during the campaign that the 110th Congress would be the most fair, open and honest in history. Yet it is my understanding that the Democrats are close to finalizing an agreement on a conference report before conferees have even been named and with little input from House Republicans. There is nothing fair, open or honest about that. 
   The Senate Budget Committee chairman predicted months ago that the budget reconciliation process was in danger of being abused as a ``stalking horse'' for new spending, and looking back he could not have been more on target. The House bill in fact included one of the most significant increases in higher education entitlement spending we have ever witnessed, establishing nine new entitlement programs. And bear in mind most of that new spending isn't even targeted toward low-income students who need it the most, but rather at institutions, philanthropic organizations, and graduates. 
   That is a remarkable change from the historic function of Federal student aid programs. For more than four decades, these programs have existed for a single purpose, to give our neediest students a chance at obtaining a college degree and pursuing the American Dream. The House bill turns its back on that tradition. 
   House Republicans support strengthening our Nation's student aid programs, but we do not support targeting scarce Federal student aid resources at wealthy philanthropic organizations, universities with million- or billion-dollar endowments and college graduates, and we certainly do not support doing so at the expense of the market-  based FFEL program, which has been a success by any measure. 
   There is a way, Mr. Speaker, that we can avoid making this critical mistake. Slightly reducing the cuts to lender subsidies and redirecting funding to provide additional support for Pell Grants, rather than creating costly new entitlement programs, are two steps that could be taken in an effort to achieve bipartisan support for this bill. 
   I believe the final step is to include language that would allow for a careful analysis of possible auction scenarios to determine if an auction is really in the best interests of students and taxpayers before requiring its implementation. In fact, I have heard from many Members, including 14 Democrats, who expressed concern about the automatic implementation of an auction and encourage that we approach any auction proposal with caution. 
   If the conference report achieves these four goals, I believe we can achieve strong bipartisan support for this bill. Doing anything less could endanger our support and trigger a Presidential veto threat, just as the House bill did in July. So as we prepare to formalize a conference report, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to bear this in mind. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe another part of the Senate's reconciliation bill also deserves the attention of this Chamber and inclusion in our conference report, specifically, the provision that would block the importation of terrorists detained at Guantanamo Bay into American communities. 
   We are a Nation at war and Guantanamo provides the highest level of security to ensure our enemies do not endanger American lives. Some Democrats have suggested that the site be closed and terrorists be sent into American communities such as Edwards Air Force Base in my district, Fort Knox, Kentucky, Quantico, Virginia, and others. But make no mistake: transferring terrorist detainees to these communities will create an opportunity for our enemies to escape, recruit and disseminate their terrorist skills, and it would make these domestic facilities prime targets for any attack that al Qaeda is able to mount within our borders. 
   Congress simply should not allow this to occur, and I thank the Senate for including this important language in its reconciliation bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the same by voting ``yes'' on this motion to instruct.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We are here today to consider a bill that will help protect the thousands of young people enrolled in residential treatment facilities. 
   Although we don't know exactly how many such facilities exist, it is estimated that hundreds of them have been established all around the country. We will hear a lot about boot camps today, but there are a range of residential treatment programs, both public and private, ranging from wilderness therapy to boarding schools. 
   Many of these programs are successful, helping troubled teens overcome addiction, emotional struggles, and other challenges in order to turn their lives around. We are here today not because of the success stories, and there are many, but because of cases where these programs have harmed the young people they are meant to heal. 
   Over the last several years, the Government Accountability Office has been conducting a series of inquiries into reports of child abuse, neglect, and even death at residential treatment programs for teens. 
   Beginning last fall, the Education and Labor Committee heard testimony from the GAO on its findings. We also heard directly from victims of abuse and from the families of teens who lost their lives. 
   The stories we heard were devastating and the response was unequivocal: Someone needs to take responsibility for regulating and monitoring these programs and enforcing strong protections for the young people they enroll. However, even though we know the need to regulate these programs is clear, we are faced with many obstacles in determining the best approach. 
   The threshold challenge we face is to determine exactly what facilities we are talking about. Even the GAO, which has spent years investigating these programs, cannot offer a precise count or even an estimate of how many such programs exist and where they are located. 
   There is also the question of protecting against abuse while still allowing effective programs to serve families. As I mentioned earlier, in addition to stories of neglect and victimization, our inquiries into these programs also brought to light numerous success stories. We heard from young people who suffered from drug addiction, emotional and behavioral troubles, and other self-injuring behaviors. They credited residential treatment programs with turning their lives around. 
   Balancing these and other challenges, and after a process of review, analysis, and cooperation, I am pleased that we have developed a bipartisan proposal that will ensure the effective regulation, monitoring, and enforcement of these programs by the States, with the Federal Government playing an appropriate oversight role. 
   I appreciate Chairman Miller's willingness to work with our side of the aisle throughout this process, and particularly over the last several days as we were able to forge a compromise that achieves our shared goal of protecting young people without creating the type of parallel and conflicting dual-regularity structure envisioned in the original bill. 
   As with any piece of legislation, this bill is not yet perfect. I remain concerned about potential conflicts between State child abuse laws and the new definitions and interpretations established here at the Federal level. I also think we need to consider whether linkages to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act will be sufficient to ensure States are fulfilling their duties to protect the young people in these programs. But on the whole, I am pleased with the progress we have made to develop a strong bipartisan bill that will help put an end to the cases of abuse, neglect, and death in these facilities. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I plan to support passage of H.R. 5876 today not because it's perfect but because Members on both sides of the aisle have acted in good faith to develop a package of reform that will help to protect the young people enrolled in residential treatment facilities. 
   I thank Chairman Miller. I think that he knows that this is not the bill I would have written, and some concerns do remain, but he's made compromises and I have made compromises, and together we're working to develop a seamless system of oversight to ensure the teens in these programs, some of our most vulnerable young people, will be kept safe. I plan to continue working with the chairman in the coming months to improve the bill, avert unintended consequences, and ultimately achieve our goal of putting an end to the stories of abuse, neglect, and even death that have put a black mark on some of these programs. 
   I look forward to working more closely with the programs themselves as this legislation moves forward. I believe there are best practices out there that can be identified and replicated, and I take the expertise of these programs will be invaluable as we develop  programs that do not undercut their ability to treat troubled youth. 
   I'm also eager to work more closely with the States, some of whom are doing an excellent job of licensing and regulating these programs. Unfortunately, not all States are rising to the task, which is what this bill hopes to change. 
   So let me close by simply thanking Chairman Miller by shining a spotlight on this issue and offering my assurances that I will continue to work with you to stop child abuse in residential programs for teens. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   After the devastating stories we heard of children dying at residential treatment facilities, every member of our committee wondered how this could have happened and what could have been done to prevent it. And being in Washington, it's easy to assume the answer lies here with the Federal Government. 
   But, Madam Chairman, we know the answer is not always the Federal Government. In fact, States may be better equipped to regulate, monitor, and enforce the safety protections that are needed for these programs. We can ensure stronger protections by resisting the urge to consolidate all responsibility inside the Beltway. 
   When this bill was brought before the committee, the Department of Health and Human Services said the following: 
   ``The Federal Government has no oversight or rules governing child abuse and neglect investigations, as each State has its own process for defining and investigating child abuse and neglect, including the timeliness  and methods for responding to and completing investigations of allegations. As such, any Federal investigations of abuse and neglect would likely interfere and perhaps conflict with a State's procedures for the same.'' 
   The Miller-McKeon substitute will go a long way toward addressing this issue, and I want to once again thank Chairman Miller for his willingness to consider our concerns. Some danger still remains that the specific requirements of this bill could conflict with State child protection laws, and I look forward to working in a bipartisan basis to resolve that issue as this bill moves forward. 
   There was also a practical problem with the top-down Federal regulation in the bill as it was drafted. It would have been virtually impossible for HHS to build up a new regulatory infrastructure and have the capacity to begin visiting each and every one of these programs in the time allotted. It is far more practical for the States, many of which are already licensing and regulating these programs, to take on that responsibility. This substitute ensures that States will do so. 
   The bill, as originally drafted, also included a new private right of action to sue in Federal court, something that I think would have provided a much greater benefit to trial lawyers than victimized youth. I'm pleased this provision has been removed. Victims of abuse still have the right to remedies in court, but our emphasis now is on protection and prevention instead of litigation. 
   And so, Madam Chairman, because of this substitute, the bill we will vote on later today is a considerable improvement over what was introduced. While it is still not perfect, I plan to support it and continue working with the Chairman to create strong protections for the young people enrolled in these programs. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 51, a resolution to recognize our Nation's Catholic schools and honor their important contributions to our students and our communities. I thank the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. LIPINSKI, for offering this important measure. 
   Roughly 2.3 million students attend more than 7,500 U.S. Catholic schools--more than one-fourth of them minority students. Year in and year out, these schools have made remarkable contributions to our Nation's intellectual growth. For example, on average, ninety-five percent of Catholic school students graduate, with eight out of every ten of Catholic high school graduates going on to pursue a higher education. 
   While these schools are widely-known for their academic excellence, their contributions go far behind grade point average and graduation rates. Rather, Catholic schools also emphasize the moral, physical, and social values of our Nation's young people. And for that, their contributions simply cannot be quantified. 
   Next week, our nation's Catholic schools, their students, and their families will be marking Catholic Schools Week for the 33rd year. Catholic Schools Week celebrates the quality of the education available to all students in Catholic grade schools and high schools across the U.S., and we wish them all the best during their celebration. 
   As we prepare to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act and continue to work to close the achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their more fortunate peers, we also should recognize that if it weren't for our nation's Catholic schools and the dedicated teachers who serve them, the achievement gap today would be even wider. 
   With this in mind, Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution to honor Catholic schools, students, parents, and teachers for their ongoing contributions to education, as well as for the key role they play in promoting and ensuring a brighter, stronger future for our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman for yielding and I rise in opposition to this rule. 
   Schools around the Nation are facing an immediate funding shortfall, but it's not a lack of funds for green facilities maintenance. Mr. Speaker, like the rest of us, they're struggling with gasoline prices. 
   For local school systems, energy represents a significant share of their budget. They pay for the fuel to operate the buses that drive children to and from school. They pay to heat their schools in the winter and cool them in the summer. They pay for electricity to light their classrooms and power their computers. And with the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline reaching $3.98 today--now, that might have been at the start of debate. It could be $3.99 or $4 now the way it's going up. In California, it's much higher than this already--these energy costs are consuming an increasing share of overall school budgets. 
   For schools, rising energy costs don't stop with school buses and utilities. The cost of fuel makes almost everything more expensive, from books and supplies to the food that goes into school lunches. So, yes, our schools do have an immediate need, and we ought to be on the floor addressing that need today. We should be taking action on comprehensive energy legislation that will increase production, drive innovation, and promote conservation. Unfortunately, that's not what we're going to do today. 
   Instead, the House will consider a bill that fundamentally changes the Federal role in education. I'm talking about legislation that begins the process of Federalizing the building and maintenance of individual schools in communities across this Nation. Agree or disagree with what this bill is trying to accomplish, no one can deny that what's being proposed is a significant, perhaps even monumental, shift in education policy. 
   In keeping with the pattern established by the majority, it is no surprise then that this bill is being brought up with limited opportunity for debate and amendment, after being rushed through an abbreviated committee process. 
   Of the 20 amendments submitted by Republicans, just four were made in order. That's one in five. 
   Not surprisingly, members of the majority party fared a little better. Of the eight amendments they offered and did not withdraw, fully half of them were made in order. Several others were combined with amendments that were accepted or added to the manager's amendment, making sure that in the end virtually all of their concerns are going to be addressed. 
   We can do better than this. We should do better than this, but after a year-and-a-half under this iron-fisted majority, I know better than to expect better. 
   So much for the most open Congress in history. I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I stand in opposition to H.R. 3021, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The name of this bill is a mouthful but seems harmless enough, the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act. It sounds like a program to ensure good schools, safe schools, environmentally friendly schools. It sounds pretty good to me. It is when we look a little closer that the real goal becomes clear. This is a bill that puts us on a path toward Federalizing the building and maintenance of our Nation's schools. It is about feeding bigger government and giving Washington more control over what happens in States and local communities. We are talking about an estimated $20 billion over the next 5 years handed out to States and schools so that we can exercise control over how they build their schools. 
   Maybe a school has a leaky roof. The Federal Government is happy to pay to get it fixed; but instead of spending $1,000 on a repair, we tell the school it has to spend $100,000 on a new roof that meets our hand-picked environmental standards. And Big Brother doesn't stop there. We also link this funding to the Depression-era Davis-Bacon Act, meaning that construction projects under this bill must pay so-called prevailing wages. The problem is, prevailing wage calculations are critically and fundamentally flawed. Sometimes they are higher than market rates and other times they are lower. 
   Take plumbers, for instance. I have a chart here that shows in a sampling of cities plumbers paid Davis-Bacon wages could be paid anywhere from 70 percent below the market rate to 77 percent above the market rate. Davis-Bacon requirements drive up the cost of Federal projects by 10, 15, 20 percent,  and sometimes more. These are costs that get passed on to the taxpayers. Moreover, these requirements force private companies to do hundreds of millions of dollars of excess administrative work each year. 
   So already we are talking about a new $20 billion program to fund an inefficient construction mandate that allows bureaucrats here in Washington to tell our neighborhoods and small towns and big cities exactly how their school buildings should be built, from the materials they use to the contractors they hire. 
   Madam Chairman, I would like to know where that $20 billion is going to come from. When we were in the majority, we heard no end to the complaints from the other side of the aisle that we were underfunding No Child Left Behind and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. I am proud of our record of strong support for these programs, but it is true that they are not funded at their authorized level. It was true when Democrats were in the majority up until 1995, it was true when we were in the majority even though we doubled the payments there, and it is still true today with Democrats back at the helm. The reality is that neither party has funded these programs at their authorized maximum. 
   If we have $20 billion to spend on our schools, shouldn't we invest that in keeping the promises we have already made? We are looking at $6.4 billion authorized for this program next year alone. Do you know what that could do for title I or IDEA? We could increase special education funding by almost 60 percent in 1 year. We could bring title I funding to more than $20 billion. 
   I don't know whether we have the money to spend on this program; in fact, I think we probably don't. But if we have it, we have a duty to spend it on programs that help improve academic achievement for disadvantaged children. 
   I also think it is ironic that we are here today proposing a program to build more schools when districts around the country are struggling just to pay for the fuel it takes to transport children and operate, heat, and cool the schools we already have. Like the rest of the country, our schools are being squeezed by the high price of gasoline. Rising fuel prices are taking a real toll on our Nation's schools, just as on our Nation's families and individuals. 
   Beyond diesel fuel and heating oil, schools are faced with higher supply costs, fewer field trips, and costlier school lunches. First it was community colleges forced to move to a 4-day school week; now, even K-12 school systems are reducing the number of school days because of the pain at the pump. Unfortunately, that is a problem for which the Democrats are offering no answers. 
   Madam Chairman, this is a bad program created based on a flawed premise. Yes, there is a need for school construction and modernization. It is a need that is best handled at the State and local level where they can be responsive to each community's unique needs. The Federal role in education has been limited to target interventions that help provide a more level playing field for children who might otherwise be left behind. That is where our focus should remain. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Let's talk about the things we deal with when we're not here in Congress. You have children. I have children. We have grandchildren. And I try to think about our children and grandchildren sitting at the kitchen table, and they have a little different rules that they have to operate under.     
   You know, we have a Federal responsibility that we have taken upon ourselves, and we will fund 40 percent of IDEA. We're up to about 17 percent. We said that we'll fund title I. We're way short of where we should be on that.  
   If, say, you have a grandson or granddaughter, maybe they've bought a motorcycle and they have a commitment to pay $100 a month on a motorcycle. And maybe the daughter is going to school and has a commitment to pay a couple hundred dollars a month on that. 
   Family is sitting around and they say, you know, we're a little short, we don't have quite enough to pay the motorcycle bill this month, we don't have quite enough to pay the school bill this month, but why don't we go out and buy a motor home, because the family would benefit from that; it would be a good thing. We could have good quality time that we could spend together, and we don't have the money for that. 
   That's kind of what we're talking about here, isn't it?

   Mr. McKEON. I notice the chairman has left, but I wanted to just correct the record a little bit. 
   I've been here 16 years. I know he's been here over 30 years. But when we won the majority in 1994, at that point IDEA was funded at about $2 billion. It was passed in 1976. 
   At the time, we made a commitment, those who were in the Congress at the time made a commitment, that the Federal level would be funded at 40 percent. At that time in 1976, $2 billion would have funded at 40 percent. The Democrats were in charge from 1976 to 1994. They got it from a few hundred million up to $2 billion in that time. 
   We won the majority in 1994, and we increased the funding from $2 billion up to over $10 billion in the following 12 years. 
   Now, to go back to talk about the surplus and the deficit. In 1994, we ran on the Contract With America, and we made a pledge to the American people that if we were given a chance, given the majority, we would balance the Federal budget in 7 years. Actually, we did it in 4 years. That's how we got that surplus. 
   But then in 2000, President Bush came in. There was a recession when he took office. We had 9/11 in 2001, which took us into a war footing, and you know, when you're at war, you spend more money, and that's how we've gotten the deficit. 
   But all of that aside, back to the basic premise of why we should be working to fully fund IDEA. What a problem that is to not provide fully funding for these children that need help with their special disabilities. We made a strong commitment. We took it from the 7 percent that they were funding it when they were in the majority, and they had been there for 18 years prior to that. We had 12 years. We got it up to over 17, 18 percent in that period of time. 
   So I don't think if you want to talk about commitment and who was putting the money where, we were doing it. All we're saying now is if they can find another $6 billion, why not put it to the children with disabilities rather than fund a brand new program that really is the State and local responsibility. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I just want to say that I don't think either of the two gentlemen from California used the term ``wasteful'' spending. We never meant for that. We never inferred that. 
   What we were talking about is it's a new program that is going to divert limited resources. The list that Mr. Kildee read, all of those people that supported it, yeah, you know, a lot of people want to have more and more and more spending. The problem is, we do have limited resources. I could probably read you a list of people that say we should not have additional spending that's going to carry us more and more into deficit for new programs before we fund the programs that we've already committed to, and the gentleman said he would like to have the debate on that issue. 
   I had an amendment on that issue that was not given to me. I wasn't given the ability to discuss it on the floor because the Rules Committee, I guess, felt that it wasn't an important issue.

   I did have an amendment saying that we should first spend the money for the title I.

And we have spent billions of dollars, over $85 billion, to try to close that gap, and we haven't done it, and we're still short on that funding. 
   And then the disabilities, the students that we all feel need more help, why, if we can come up with another $6 billion, don't we put the money for these children that need the help the most?

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, for our Nation's schools, the spike in energy prices means that it costs more to fuel the buses that carry children to and from school. It costs more to heat and cool their facilities. It costs more to buy books and supplies. It costs more to provide school lunches and snacks. The list goes on. 
   School budgets are being overwhelmed by rising energy costs, and they need relief. The majority refuses to unveil its commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing gas prices. On January 4, 2007, when the Democrats took charge of this House, gas prices stood at $2.33 a gallon. Seventeen months later, gas costs 71 percent more, and yet their plan remains a secret. 
   We're turning a blind eye to the burden of high energy costs in our Nation's schools, and instead taking up a bill that usurps State and local rights and responsibilities, undermines efforts to fund programs for disadvantaged children, imposes complex and costly requirements, and offers little more than a Band-Aid for the very real need for school construction and modernization. 
   Madam Chairman, I strongly oppose this legislation. Just yesterday we received a Statement of Administration Policy indicating that if this legislation were presented to the President, his advisers would recommend that it be vetoed. 
   The Federal Government has a role to play in education. That role is to provide support and assistance to ensure that all children are provided a quality education. It's to support the academic achievement for disadvantaged children, children with disabilities, and other at-risk students who might otherwise be left behind. 
   We all want our communities to have safe, modern, environmentally friendly  schools in which our children can live and thrive, but this bill is the wrong way to achieve that goal. States, local communities and the private sector are all actively engaged in the construction and maintenance of school facilities all around the country. At least $20 billion is being spent by the States each year to build new schools and modernize those already in use. 
   If we have $6.4 billion to invest in education next year, let's put it into programs that serve underprivileged and disadvantaged children. Programs are already there. Whether it's title I or IDEA or even Pell Grants to help low-income students attend college, there are existing programs that could use these resources to improve academic achievement and directly benefit those who need help most. 
   I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I oppose this amendment, Madam Chairman, for the same reason I oppose the underlying bill. 
   This proposal radically shifts the Federal role in education. This new school construction program will compete for funding with other critical priorities like title I and IDEA. And no matter what the other side tries to tell you, every dollar spent under this legislation is a dollar that won't be spent improving academic achievement for disadvantaged children. 
   Here in Congress our job is to set priorities. Are we really saying that it's more important to fund bicycle racks, as this substitute would do, than it is to provide funds for schools to serve children with disabilities? I don't deny that schools can use bicycle racks, but I challenge anyone to explain why that's a priority for scarce Federal dollars when title I and IDEA continue to be funded below their authorized level.  
   I also think this entire debate is a distraction from the most immediate financial concern facing many school systems and every family in this Nation: That's the high price of gasoline. School districts are struggling just to fill the tanks on their school buses. They're scaling back field trips and activities. And some schools are even moving to a 4-day school week to save on energy costs. Just like the rest of the country, our schools need energy relief and they need it now. 
   But we're not here today to discuss how we can produce more American-made energy. We're not here to promote new clean and reliable sources of energy like advanced nuclear and next-generation coal. We're not even here to encourage greater energy efficiency by offering conservation tax incentives to Americans who make their home, car, and businesses more energy efficient. Instead, we are proposing a big government program to exert Federal control over how States and local communities build their schools. It's the classic Washington approach to problem solving: If we just kick in a little bit of money, we'll be able to wield our power and influence over the decisions that used to be made by individual citizens and local leaders. Surely Washington must know best when it comes to where our children learn. 
   Madam Chairman, I oppose this amendment, I oppose this legislation, and I oppose the fact that Congress has yet to do anything to address the skyrocketing cost of energy. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   We have been kind of talking about supply and demand in energy. Today we are also talking supply and demand of money. There's unlimited demand for resources, but there is somewhat limited supply. And what we're talking about in this bill is that the demand is for the Federal Government to get involved in local school construction. 
   I served on a local school board, and I met with a lot of other people that served on local school boards, and I know what they're going to want to do. They are going to want to turn to the Federal Government and take all the money that's available, and then they will use that to build the schools, and then they'll find other ways to spend the money that they've been spending on schools for other things. That's how supply and demand works. You kind of take what's available and fill up the gap. 
   I was home last week, as most of us were, for the break, and I hadn't been home for a couple of weeks. I was shocked at what the gas prices were, and they went up about 20 cents during the week while I was home. And it's all based on supply and demand. 
   We have had several votes over the last 16 years that I have been here in Congress. We voted to explore for more oil in the ANWR. House Republicans, 91 percent supported increasing supply; House Democrats, 86 percent opposed increasing supply. 
   Coal to liquid is another thing that should increase the supply, which would then meet the demand and help lower gasoline prices. House Republicans voted 97 percent to support coal to liquid; House Democrats, 78 percent opposed that. 
   Oil shale exploration, which again would increase supply and meet the demand and lower prices. House Republicans, 90 percent supported it; House Democrats, 86 percent opposed. 
   This goes on and on and on. What we are saying on our side is we will support exploration, conservation, renewable, all sources of increasing supply to get energy independent. The other side says we can't do this, we can't do this, we can't do this; let's keep buying oil from Iraq and Iran and Saudi Arabia and Venezuela and not become independent.     
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.

   Mr. McKEON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This amendment allows funding under the massive new program to be used for renewable energy generation and heating systems in schools. Clearly, this amendment recognizes that schools are grappling with the high cost of energy, and they need help. I couldn't agree more. But we are acknowledging that schools, like the rest of the country, are being burdened by the skyrocketing costs of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other energy sources. I'd like to know why we are not having a real debate about energy solutions. 
   Giving schools a little bit of money for renewable energy generation and heating systems, while ignoring the problem of rising gasoline, diesel, and other energy costs, will not solve the problems our schools are facing. In the Northeast, for instance, we know that many schools rely on home heating oil during the winter months. Clearly, a one-size-fits-all approach isn't going to work. 
   What we need are comprehensive energy solutions. We need to expand production here at home, something my friends on the other side of the aisle have historically opposed 86 percent of the time. We need to encourage innovation and invest in new fuel alternatives, and we need to promote conservation. Only by embracing meaningful energy reforms will we finally be  able to move toward energy independence and provide our schools, especially those impacted by the skyrocketing costs of heating oil, much needed relief. That is why I am so disappointed in this legislation. It's quite simply the wrong solution to the wrong problem. 
   If the question is how should the Federal Government help our schools, the answer is by funding programs that promote academic achievement for disadvantaged children. If the question is how should the Federal Government help schools burdened by high energy costs, the answer is by taking decisive action to increase energy production here at home, and red tape and regulations encourage next generation energy sources and promote conservation. 
   The bill achieves none of these goals. I won't oppose passage of this amendment, but I strongly oppose passage of this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   As the gentleman that just spoke said, we cannot drill our way into energy independence. I agree, because over the past 12 years, every time we have had a vote to give us an opportunity to explore and find more oil to get us past the gap to where all these other things that they are talking about will work, 91 percent of House Republicans have historically supported the increase of production of American-made oil and gas, while 86 percent of House Democrats have historically voted against increasing the production of American-made oil and gas. 
   Ten years ago when we passed an energy bill that would let us drill in the ANWR which would reduce gas prices now 70 cents to $1.60 a gallon, and that would be in production now and we  would be receiving that benefit, President Clinton vetoed that bill. 
   So, yes, we can't drill our way out of it. We have to sit here and buy oil from countries around the globe that want to see us destroyed, and I don't see how we possibly can continue to go on putting ourselves in that position. We need to find new energy, and we need to do it now. 
   Madam Chairman, as I said, I will not oppose this amendment. I oppose the underlying bill for many, many reasons.

   Mr. McKEON. I yield myself such time as I may consume, Madam Chairman. 
   The purpose of this amendment is to gather information about the types of  floors that schools may be installing with funds provided under this massive new federally funded school construction program. Like the rest of the bill, it simply misses the point. 
   If our goal today is to address the problems facing our Nation's schools, we shouldn't be talking about floors or bicycle racks. We should be talking about how to bring down the price of gas. 
   High gas prices are hitting schools hard. They're driving up costs for nearly every aspect of a school's budget, from transportation to school lunches and from utilities to supplies. 
   What we should be debating is how to address the skyrocketing cost of energy. Instead, we're talking about creating a $20 billion program that allows bureaucrats in Washington to tell our communities how to build their schools. 
   The Federal Government has had a history of investing in our Nation's schools, but it's not the floors and the walls and the plumbing and the light bulbs where we focus our investment. Rather, it's the students themselves. Our role, the role of the Federal Government, is to support programs that help improve student academic achievement. 
   We know that disadvantaged children, children with disabilities, English language learners and our vulnerable populations have too often been left behind by our educational system. Our job is to ensure all children are given the opportunity to receive a high quality education. That means learning from a highly qualified teacher and being held to the same high academic standards. 
   I know how important safe and healthy schools are, and that's why States are spending some $20 billion each year on the building and modernization of schools facilities. 
   If we really want to meet the needs of our schools, we should be doing two things: We should be maintaining the Federal focus on student achievement, and we should be talking about how to bring down the cost of energy to help schools, families, businesses and our economy. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation and thank Chairman Miller and Chairman Hinojosa, Ranking Member Keller, and their staffs and my staff for striking a bipartisan accord to advance this bill. 
   I have often said that in order to begin reaffirming trust in our student aid system all stakeholders must step up. That means lenders, colleges, the Education Department, States and Congress all have a role to play. 
   Within the past few weeks, Secretary of Education Spellings established an internal task force to review her Department's oversight of Federal student loan programs; and, today, the U.S. House is stepping up as well. It is an important step, to be sure. We are stepping up today for a single, fundamental reason, to ensure our Nation's financial aid system continues to serve the need of the students who depend on it for the opportunity to get an education. 
   This isn't about us versus the lenders or us versus the financial aid officers, and this isn't about direct loans versus the market-based FFEL program. And, for the record, I continue to strongly support FFEL and a healthy competition between the two Federal programs. This is about protecting the interests of millions of young men and women who expect our student aid system to be there for them when they need it. 
   Several weeks ago, my Education and Labor Committee colleague, Mr. Keller, and I introduced comprehensive legislation to begin the process of reaffirming our trust in the financial aid system. I am proud that our bill served as an impetus for bringing the measure before us to the House floor. 
   Our legislation built on many of the financial aid reform recommendations Chairman Miller made earlier this year, and I am pleased that what we are poised to advance today reflects a broad agreement to set these important reforms into motion. 
   Like my bill and Chairman Miller's bill, the bipartisan agreement we will vote on today does not explicitly outlaw the practice of preferred lender lists. Rather, it reforms this practice to ensure that it continues to serve the interests of our students. Like my bill and Chairman Miller's bill, the bipartisan agreement we will vote on today aims to protect against conflicts of interest between lenders and financial aid officers. And like my bill and Chairman Miller's bill, the bipartisan agreement we will vote on today allows lenders to seek advice from institutions in order to improve products and services for students. 
   However, the measure Mr. Keller and I introduced went even further than past recommendations, and I am pleased the agreement we will vote on today incorporates our important modifications. For example, just as in the bill I authored with Mr. Keller, the measure before us asks colleges to develop their own unique codes of conduct that must include restrictions on anything else that may give the appearance of a conflict of interest between financial aid officers and lenders. And just as in the bill I authored with Mr. Keller, the measure before us bans revenue sharing between lenders of private loans and colleges or universities. 
   Mr. Speaker, the FFEL and other financial aid programs successfully serve millions of students and their families every year, and this bill makes our system even better. As we move forward from here, we must not lose sight of the fact that the Federal financial aid system must work for students and colleges alike. We must be careful not to overreach, as Congress does all too often, but we do need to reaffirm our trust in the system. I believe this bill does just that. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close the debate. 
   Mr. Speaker, what our job is here in Washington as legislators is to represent the people from our districts, the people from around the country. Specifically on the Committee on Education, we have the responsibility to protect and encourage those young people who are trying to receive an education, both K-12 level and those who want to continue their education throughout their lifetime at the higher education level. 
   We have passed many laws that try to make it easier for people to achieve the American Dream through education. Sometimes we have people that skirt those laws or take them up to the edge. When we find problems, it is our responsibility to address those problems. 
   We have about 6,000 schools across the country that participate in the Federal financial aid programs. They have financial aid officers that work with the students that come into the schools to help them get a Pell Grant or get other financial aid that is available, or they help them find a loan company that will help them get a loan that is needed to achieve their education. 
   We have about 3,500 lenders that participate in these loans. Again, some of the lenders have crossed the line or gotten too close to the line, as with some of the financial aid officers, but we definitely don't want to paint all lenders, all schools, all financial aid officers, with a broad brush, saying they are all corrupt. Most of them, the vast percentage of them, are doing a great job of trying to carry out their mission and helping students achieve their goals. 
   This piece of legislation will help make that law stronger, to verify that those students will get the most help in getting the loans and getting the financial aid they need to achieve the American Dream, and I am happy to be a part of this, to make it come to pass. I am hopeful that the other body will pick up this legislation and move forward with it. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this law. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Chairman Miller for being expeditious on this and getting this bill to the floor quickly. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   For years, Republicans have fought on behalf of students and families to make college more affordable. Now our cause is bipartisan and our vision for reform is the centerpiece of comprehensive Higher Education Act reauthorization. 
   For students and families grappling with rising college costs, this bill establishes college affordability comparison tools to help put cost increases into perspective. Students will be able to search, sort, and compare key cost indicators for every school in the country. We will identify institutions that are the most costly, the least costly, and those with the fastest rising costs. And for schools engaging in a pattern of extraordinary high cost increases, we demand greater disclosure and concrete steps to identify inefficiencies and fix them. This legislation reflects Republican principles for reform, including financial aid simplification, protection of student privacy, safeguards for taxpayer dollars, emphasis on competitiveness, and many more positive reforms. 
   We would not have this bill before us today without the hard work of staff on both sides of the aisle. I want to thank Amy Jones in particular for her tireless efforts to ensure this bill includes meaningful college cost reforms. I also want to recognize Brad Thomas and Susan Ross on my staff, along with outgoing staff director Vic Klatt and his successor, Sally Stroup, a higher education policy expert in her own right. 
   I would also like to recognize Chairman Miller's staff, including Gaby Gomez, Julie Radocchia, and Jeff Appel. 
   Throughout the day, we will consider a number of amendments. Some would make the bill stronger, while others are unquestionably bad policy that would send us backward. However, it is the give-and-take of a bipartisan legislative process that has produced the strong bill before us, and I am hopeful that at the end of the day we will be able to secure strong, bipartisan passage of this bill, to make our higher education system more accessible and affordable. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, from the outset of this process, Chairman Miller has recognized that by working together we can make this bill stronger. Just as he worked with us on the underlying bill, he also invited our input and involvement in the development of this manager's package. I believe the amendment is stronger because of it, and I want to thank him for his bipartisanship. 
   Anyone who has studied the college cost issue recognizes that there are no easy or obvious solutions. It has taken 5 years of refining to produce the proposal we are voting on here today. 
   When this process began, we identified three key principles to guide our proposals. First, we saw the need for sunshine and transparency in college costs. Students and families do not have access to accurate, useful, and comparable information about college costs. 
   Second, we recognized that colleges and universities were not being held accountable to consumers. There were no consequences for schools that engaged in massive unexplained tuition increases year after year. 
   Third, in our effort to identify solutions, it became abundantly clear that Congress could not do it alone. We realized that all stakeholders must come together. That includes the Federal Government, State government and local communities, institutions of higher education, students, and parents. 
   States have scaled back their investment in higher education, and the Federal Government has been expected to make up the difference. While some of the details have changed over time, the bill before us adheres to these same three principles. 
   I want to thank Chairman Miller for allowing me to take the lead on these college cost provisions. After years of listening to stakeholders, seeking the advice of experts, and studying potential unintended consequences, I believe this proposal strikes the right balance on the cost issue. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Miller for working with me to prevent this bill from limiting access for low-income, first-generation, and nontraditional students. An amendment offered during committee consideration of the bill changed the way cohort default rates are calculated. While the proposal did spur an important conversation about how to get a more accurate understanding of default rates in order to protect students and taxpayers, the consequences of the proposal would have done far more damage than was intended. I am pleased that, in this manager's amendment, we were able to forge a compromise that achieves our goal of a more accurate cohort default rate calculation without putting financial aid in jeopardy for the students who need it most. 
   On these and other issues, Chairman Miller has worked closely with me to ensure the final bill reflects the priorities of Members on both sides of the aisle. I thank him for his willingness to cooperate, and I urge the majority to continue this spirit of cooperation to address other flaws that remain in the bill, so that when this legislation is signed into law, it is as strong as it can be. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We are here today addressing the college cost crisis, a problem that has reached epic proportions in this country. There are many who believe, me among them, that we should never have allowed this challenge to reach a crisis point. 
   I am pleased to be acting today, but this bill serves as a reminder that Congress often fails to recognize challenges in our higher education system and act quickly to solve them. I am afraid we may be making the same mistake by failing to recognize the brewing problems in our Federal student loan programs. 
   Since 2006, Congress has cut nearly $30 billion from the Federal Family Education Loan Program. While many of these reforms were needed to improve program efficiency, I am afraid we may have gone too far, cutting not just the fat but straight through to the bone. 
   The impact of these cuts has yet to be fully realized; but already borrower benefits have been curtailed, lenders have left the program, and workers have lost their jobs. The consequences of program cuts are being exacerbated by a crunch in our financial markets that has produced a loss of liquidity, an increase in financing costs, and uncertainty about the future viability of the Federal loan program. 
   Just a few short months into this time of market turmoil, already 1,200 jobs have been lost and eight lenders have left the Federal student loan program or severely limited participation. This includes the departure of the seventh largest lender in the program. Major lenders have significantly scaled back or ended their borrower benefit programs. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am afraid this is only the tip of the iceberg. I had hoped to offer an amendment today that would help ensure Congress does not ignore these challenges until they, too, reach a crisis point. 
   My amendment was nothing more than a sense of Congress, but I believe it would have signaled our commitment to averting a student loan crisis before it happens. Unfortunately, I was blocked by the majority from offering this amendment. It seems we have not yet learned from past mistakes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Before this reauthorization even began, I was involved in an innovative, bipartisan effort known as the FED UP project that laid the groundwork by reducing red tape, eliminating outdated rules, and streamlining Federal financial aid programs.  
   The late Representative Patsy Mink and I joined together to solicit input from the higher education community to increase the effectiveness of our Federal financial aid programs by cutting through the red tape and regulations. We did this because over the years, colleges and universities have become subject to an increasing level of Federal regulation. Unfortunately, when new regulations are layered on top of the old, we often end up with duplication and confusion. 
   Today, as we contemplate another set of new programs, regulations, and requirements, I believe we need to renew that commitment to less red tape. That's why I am proposing a comprehensive study of the regulations that impact higher education. Under my plan, the National Research Council will undertake a governmentwide review to identify regulations that are duplicative and unnecessary. 
   Particularly in a bill with so many duplicative and unnecessary new programs, there is a danger that we may be exacerbating the college cost crisis by burdening colleges and universities with excessive new reporting and compliance costs. With this study, I hope we can move in a different direction. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I support the amendments, with a couple of caveats. The Inslee amendment, while we are not objecting to this amendment, we do have some concerns about the consequences of the amendment. The requirement that these sustainability grants provide for greenhouse gas emissions reductions will increase operating costs for colleges and universities. If that happens, the result will be still higher tuition and fees for students at a time when we're trying to lower the cost of the higher education. 
   And some comments on the Susan Davis amendment. I appreciate the amendment. I served with Mrs. Davis on the Armed Services Committee, and I appreciate her efforts. There are some questions that I do have. 
   First, what her amendment does, it says that an individual that is serving on active duty during a war, performing qualifying National Guard duty during a war, military operation or national emergency and is serving in the area of hostilities in which service qualifies for special pay, I'm hopeful that that includes everyone that we're trying to reach in the service, and I'm not sure that that is totally inclusive for what she's trying to cover. 
   And then the next concern I have is that the borrower must have obtained their loan through the government-run direct loan program. Currently, the direct loan program only provides about 20 percent of the loans, so that would mean that if one of these military personnel got their loan through one of the other programs, they would be excluded from this. I believe her intention would be to grant this benefit to all serving in the military in wartime. So I'm hopeful that we can clean that up, make changes in that during the conference, because I believe that that's probably her intent on that. 
   And, finally, I would like to also say to my good friend, Mr. Kildee, the 10 years have gone quickly. But he looks just as young as he did 10 years ago, and I appreciated working with him then, as I do now. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, this amendment essentially requires a feasibility study on market mechanisms that could then be used to determine lender returns when making student loans. Had we not just adopted an auction process for student loans in the recently passed budget cutting bill, this might make sense. 
   This amendment may be couched in terms of a study; however, it's difficult to see how the Secretary would study something like this without actually implementing a broader pilot, and that is the main concern that we have. 
   The Department of Education conducted a market mechanism study several years ago with the GAO and others. That extensive study did not find auctions to be a workable mechanism for administering the student loan program. Taking another look several years later may have shed new light on the subject. 
   We need the Department to focus on the creation and evaluation of this auction before we decide to push for studies or implementations of other auctions. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, it pains me to oppose the amendment of my good friend from Wisconsin. We've served now on the Education Committee together for almost 16 years, and he's always concerned about protecting the taxpayer and the taxpayer dollars. 
   I think that I'm not so concerned about the study. It's the way the amendment is drafted that looks like it will impose the full program before the study so that the study could be made complete. And I understand that auctions are taking place all the time, but they're not generally done by the Department of Education. They're done by the Department of the Treasury and other branches. I'm not sure the Department of Education has that expertise. 
   But as we move forward on this, hopefully, maybe in conference, this could be cleared up and the intent of the gentleman could be carried out. That would be my hope.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, and I want to begin by thanking Chairman Miller along with Representatives HINOJOSA and KELLER, the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, for their efforts. Representative Castle has also been a close partner of mine in an effort to rein in college costs. In fact, it is our effort to address the college cost crisis that is the centerpiece of this legislation. 
   We know how important higher education is both to individuals and to our Nation. A college degree can be a ticket to the middle class. It helps individuals prepare for good jobs, and it allows them to pursue new skills in the changing economy. Higher education also has important societal benefits. College-educated citizens are healthier, more civically minded, have lower unemployment rates, and use fewer government benefits. An educated citizenry is also vital to maintaining our competitive edge in a changing world. Because higher education is so important, we made it a priority to ensure all Americans have access to a quality and affordable college education. 
   In addition to making close to $100 billion in financial aid available to students, the Federal Government also spends billions each year on aid to institutions: support for college access programs, investments in research and development, and many other avenues that support higher education. 
   Despite the considerable Federal investment, or perhaps in part because of it, colleges and universities have increased tuition and fees year in and year out. The increases have come in good economic times and in bad with steady enrollments and surging enrollments. It seems the only thing consistent about college costs is that they're going up, and fast. 
   With this bill, we hope to change that. Our principles for reform are based on the idea that by giving good information to consumers, we can empower them to exert influence on the marketplace. Through the power of sunshine and transparency, we are lifting the veil on college costs and holding institutions of higher learning accountable for their role in the cost equation. 
   Those principles of sunshine and transparency are hallmarks of this bill and not just in the area of college costs. We are also letting the sunshine in on college operation and quality through enhanced institutional disclosure and a more transparent accreditation process. 
   There are numerous positive reforms in this bill, too many even for me to name. There are also a number of problems with the bill that I hope we could resolve through the amendment process. Unfortunately, Republicans were blocked from being full participants in this debate. 
   I urge the majority to work with us as we go to conference to resolve these issues so we can get the strongest possible bill to the President's desk. 
   I'm particularly concerned that in its zeal to prevent conflicts of interest in student lending, this bill creates a patchwork of new requirements that conflict with existing truth-in-lending rules and disclosures. I'm a firm believer in disclosure, but I also recognize that if we overwhelm borrowers with too much paperwork filled with confusing and conflicting information, we may undermine the consumer protection we are actually trying to achieve. 
   Right now, we know that many lenders, whether they are banks or State agencies, are providing sound disclosures to borrowers on their student loans. I'm hopeful that as we move into conference we can take that information and use it to develop meaningful  disclosure that will ensure that borrowers receive the same type and quality of information from each lender. 
   I'm also concerned about the number of new programs created in the bill. Rather than trying to micromanage from Washington, by creating a brand new program for every possible contingency, we should focus on less red tape and greater local flexibility. 
   Later today, I plan to offer an amendment that moves us in the right direction by identifying duplicate, burdensome, or unnecessary regulations imposed on our higher education system from throughout the Federal Government. This amendment builds on an initiative I began in 2001 in partnership with the late Representative Patsy Mink, known as the Fed Up Project. 
   Mr. Chairman, there is always room to improve a bill, and the College Opportunity and Affordability Act is no exception. However, on the whole, this bill is an achievement of persistence and commitment. It updates programs to meet the needs of students in the 21st century and to use the power of sunshine and transparency to transform all aspects of our higher education system. 
   Above all else, this bill offers real solutions to the college cost crisis. 
   I thank Members on both sides of the aisle for their commitment to this cause. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McKEON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   A decade ago, the last time we renewed the Higher Education Act, it was debated under an open rule that allowed every Member the opportunity for full participation. On an issue so important to our Nation's continued success, I would expect nothing less than a full and open debate. I am disappointed that the same opportunity was not provided today. Sadly, suppressed debate is all we have known under this majority. 
   I am also disappointed that misuse of the budget reconciliation process last year has left us with a bill that includes many important reforms, but does not provide a full review of the largest financial aid programs. 
   Because the budget reconciliation bill contained drastic and far-reaching changes to Federal student loans, the bill before us pays very little consideration to student lending. Unfortunately, circumstances surrounding the loan programs have changed in the last several months, and it looks like now is exactly the time when we should be looking at these programs. 
   We are all painfully aware of the collapse in the subprime mortgage market. Those financial insecurities have spread the higher quality assets, including the asset-backed equities that are often used to finance Federal and non-Federal student loans. 
   As we face these market insecurities, the full extent of the cuts enacted through last year's budget reconciliation bill are just beginning to be understood. Taken together, it appears our Federal loan program may be facing a perfect storm, yet here we are with a comprehensive higher education renewal that does not consider the student loan programs. 
   I had hoped to offer an amendment today that would acknowledge the challenges facing the loan program. Although my amendment did not call for any immediate changes within the credit markets or the loan program structure, a sense of Congress urged the Secretary of Education to closely monitor the student loan marketplace so that if in the near future these market insecurities translate into a loss of loan availability, we could act quickly to protect the interests of students. 
   Mr. Speaker, I won't be offering that amendment today; it was not ruled in order. Somehow, a sense of the Congress acknowledging the very real challenges facing our Nation's largest financial aid program was deemed unfit for consideration. 
   We also won't be considering an amendment to protect students' free speech rights on campus, or either of two amendments to ensure taxpayers aren't forced to provide assistance under this bill to illegal immigrants. Nor will we take up any of the other Republican amendments that were stifled by a heavy-handed majority. 
   Mr. Speaker, we're here to consider a bipartisan bill that I strongly support. In fact, the bill was voted out of committee with a vote of 45-0. Yet even on a bipartisan college access bill, the majority could not bring itself to allow a fair and open debate. 
   Just four of the 27 amendments we'll consider today were offered by Republicans, about 15 percent. For every 6 minutes we spend debating Democrat proposals today, the Republican ideas will be given 60 seconds. Democrats will claim that's how we ran things when Republicans were in charge. But during this same debate in 2006, when we considered comprehensive higher education reform, more than one-third  of the amendments considered on the floor were offered by Democrats. 
   This is not just a problem of amendments being made in order. Republicans were blocked from even submitting amendments just 3 minutes after the deadline Tuesday morning. Key Republican proposals were rejected from consideration some 30 hours and 57 minutes before the Rules Committee met. Is this a majority that strictly adheres to deadlines no matter what the circumstances? Evidently not, at least not when they stand to benefit from a little flexibility. 
   The listing of amendments on the Rules Committee Web site was modified at 4:39 p.m. Wednesday, just 21 minutes before the committee met. Fully 20 of the Democrats' amendments were modified or withdrawn after the submission deadline. 
   I cannot help but ask, Why are Republicans being shut out of a bipartisan bill? Why is the majority only permitting Republican amendments that align with their policy goals? Is this payback because Republicans plan to demand a vote today on earmark reform? 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an unreasonable rule that taints the bipartisanship of the underlying bill, and I strongly oppose it.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the motion being considered. Yet again, I find myself standing in defense of our military leaders and our honorable men and women in uniform. Today's ill-conceived resolution is another example of partisan maneuvering by the Democrats. I think it is important to remind my colleagues exactly what is being sought by this resolution and the negative effect it will have. While our troops are fighting in Iraq, Democratic leadership is attempting to draw attention from any signs of progress and ignore the sound strategy that we laid out earlier this year. What happened to the promise of a New Way Forward in Iraq? 
   General Petraeus has honorably taken on this leadership role in this war with the support of Democrats in the other body, and yet, here today the Democrats seek to publicly undermine him. It is shameful. He was given a job to do--to execute the Baghdad Security Plan--and he is doing it alongside our troops. The plan is still underway and today's interim report indicates a reduction in violent attacks in Baghdad. We should be standing with him, with our plan, and allowing for its full implementation. Instead, however, we see today the real Democratic agenda in this resolution: the truth is the Democrats aren't interested in whether or not the security plan will work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I question whether this resolution would do more harm than good. A precipitous withdrawal of troops would seriously endanger our soldiers and would signal defeat to our enemies around the world. 
   Mr. Speaker this House speaks loudest when it speaks with purpose, and voting to remove troops before receiving the report in September, that we asked for, is contradictory and bad policy. This bill does not honor the sacrifice and dedication of our troops who have fought to implement the plan we approved. 
   We should never miss the opportunity in this House to act in the best interest of our foreign  policy and our men and women in harm's way. We should--at every opportunity--reject undermining the faith and dedicated work of our brave men and women in uniform. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing this dangerous resolution. It is the duty of this House and of this Congress and of this Nation to give our men and women the support they need to see this conflict through. We have allocated a timeframe for our new General, and now we must allow our military leaders the opportunity to prevail.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (GENERATIONS INVIGORATING VOLUNTEERISM AND EDUCATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of the GIVE Act. 
   I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Miller, as well as the Chair and the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mrs. McCarthy of New York and Mr. Platts from Pennsylvania, for their efforts to develop a solid, bipartisan bill that will strengthen our national service programs. I would also like to recognize Brad Thomas from my staff for his hard work on this bill. 
   Like many of my colleagues, particularly on this side of the aisle, I historically have had concerns about AmeriCorps and the other programs within the Corporation for National and Community Service. Particularly during the 1990s, Federal management of these programs was at best dismal.  For years, I joined many of my colleagues, led by Mr. Hoekstra, in seeking to establish performance measures to ensure that these national service programs are in fact meeting their goals. 
   Under the Bush administration, it has become clear that these programs are being held more accountable and they have become more efficient as a result. For example, the corporation received its seventh consecutive clean audit during the fiscal year 2006. Likewise, the corporation's leadership has instituted significant improvements in efficiency and quality, including streamlining the grants and application reporting processes, consolidating five field service centers into one, and automating education award payments, time and attendance, and travel. 
   In short, the recent management of this program has far surpassed its record of low accountability under the previous administration; and for that reason in particular, it deserves our continued support. 
   Moreover, this program brings together our neighbors to serve one another and thus benefit our Nation. Although there are clear opportunities to strengthen and improve these programs, the simple fact is that the corporation plays a key and increasingly effective role in, as President Bush would say, ``rallying the armies of compassion.'' 
   Later today I plan to offer an amendment that will strengthen this already good bill. The purpose of my amendment is to acknowledge the patriotism, commitment, and sacrifice made by members of the military and their families. In return for their service to our Nation, I believe the least we can do is ensure our national service programs are able to benefit veterans and military families. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill is based on sound principles for reform outlined by the administration and developed in conjunction with the corporation. It includes a long overdue emphasis on accountability with its inclusion of performance measures and increased competition. And on the whole, I find the bill to be a balanced one that is worthy of our support. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill represents a bipartisan effort to come together on a program that is good for the citizens of this Nation. 
   Unfortunately, our Democrat colleagues have been unwilling to work in the same bipartisan fashion on our Nation's security interests. It has been 18 days since the Protect America Act expired, nearly 3 weeks that the majority has conspicuously refused to bring the bipartisan Senate Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act modernization bill to a vote. And yesterday we got a glimpse of the reason why. An anonymous Member argued that delaying action on this critical security measure made for good politics. Madam Chairman, it is unfathomable that our Nation's security may be put at risk in the name of political gamesmanship. I strongly urge the majority to bring FISA modernization for a vote. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Platts), and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control that time.

   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment which will enhance the GIVE Act by codifying our commitment to ensuring veterans can serve and be served within our national service programs.  
   The purpose of my amendment is to acknowledge the patriotism, commitment, and sacrifice made by members of the military and their families. In return for their service to our Nation, the least we can do is make sure that our national service programs are able to benefit veterans and military families. 
   On a bipartisan basis, the Education and Labor Committee chose to incorporate support for veterans in the GIVE Act. My amendment is a natural extension of that theme, and I hope it will garner the same bipartisan agreement as the underlying bill. 
   Already, the GIVE Act seeks to increase opportunities for veterans to serve and to increase the number of national service programs responding to the needs of veterans under AmeriCorps. My amendment enhances that effort by prioritizing services for and service by veterans throughout all of our national service programs. 
   The bill before us includes a set-aside within AmeriCorps to support programs for veterans. In addition, the bill includes a study of how veterans are served and how they can be served more effectively. These are positive first steps, but my amendment goes further. Under my amendment, the Corporation will be required to place a priority on applications that serve veterans or recruit veterans to serve. Rather than a fixed set-aside within a single program, this amendment will allow us to broaden the reach of service by and in support of veterans. 
   The Corporation for National and Community Service is required to establish priorities when funding national service initiatives. This ensures a targeted, effective investment. Under my amendment, included among those priorities would be an emphasis on programs that recruit veterans into service opportunities, promote community-based efforts to meet the unique needs of military families while a family member is deployed, and promote community-based efforts to meet the unique needs of military families when a member of a family returns from a deployment. 
   In addition, this amendment requires the Corporation to report to Congress on its efforts to increase the number of veterans serving in AmeriCorps and other positions that are eligible for the education award. 
   Veterans, particularly those recently deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, deserve opportunities to reintegrate into their communities through service programs funded under the national service laws. This amendment will increase those opportunities. 
   Without this amendment, we will not have the necessary information to effectively increase veteran participation in national service positions or provide an educational award in exchange for citizen service. 
   At a time when our service men and women are sacrificing on our behalf around the world, we should be doing all we can to repay that sacrifice. My amendment will make it the explicit policy of the Federal Government to encourage the national service programs to focus more on the unique needs of those heroes and their families, and to encourage more veterans to take advantage of service opportunities under these laws. 
   The GIFT Act is a solid, bipartisan reform package that will strengthen our national service laws to make them more accountable, efficient, and cost effective. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McKEON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against the motion under consideration. As the House debates this so called non-binding resolution concerning the recently implemented troop surge in Iraq, I think it is important to remind my colleagues exactly what is being sought by this resolution and what is to be accomplished with its passage. 
   This ill-conceived resolution seeks to do two incompatible and indeed conflicting things; it attempts to speak for this chamber in disapproving the proposed troop increase. And it simultaneously claims to support those troops, whose devotion to duty is essential, in prosecuting a mission which is, in part, renounced by this very same resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do not question that the members who serve in this chamber do so with integrity and with a high regard for the men and women who serve in uniform. I do, however, question the wisdom of considering a resolution which will have no practical effect, but will have serious and inevitable consequences for the men and women who have been asked to serve. 
   While we consider this resolution, our enemies, in prosecuting their side of this war--will little note its allegedly non-binding character. In that sense, Mr. Speaker, this is very much a binding resolution. It binds this House irreversibly to a statement of disapproval. But it will do nothing to change the situation to which it is nominally addressed, because it does not bind our words to any actions. 
   General Peter Pace, in his testimony before the Armed Services Committee displayed confidence in our armed forces. He said that he believes our men and women in uniform understand the intricacies of our democracy and the nature of our vibrant debate in this Congress. Mr. Speaker, I would add that while they may understand our prerogatives, they will seek to decipher our intent and the resolve of this Chamber to support them in this fight. I also believe that they will rightfully see this resolution for what it is--mere contradiction. 
   Without our continued commitment to the young democracy in Iraq, the political and security situation in that country will suffer tremendous setbacks. Without support from American troops and our allies, there is a greater chance of failure in Iraq. General Petraeus, Commanding Officer of Multi-National Force-Iraq, last month described what failure in Iraq would look like when he said that ``Sectarian groups would obviously begin to stake out their turf, try to expand their turf. They would do that by greatly increased ethnic cleansing.'' 
   Defense Secretary Robert Gates in a press conference last month said that if we fail, ``One would see an emboldened and strengthened Iran, a safe haven and base of operations for jihadist networks in the heart of the Middle East, a humiliating defeat in the overall campaign against violent extremism worldwide, and an undermining of the credibility of the United States.'' Mr. Speaker, these results are not acceptable to Americans because they are not in America's interest and because more turmoil in Iraq or the Middle East will unacceptably threaten our national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, we know that among the strengths that our men and women in uniform possess is the courage to carry on. They are armed with the notion that no matter what inspires our enemies, we fight in defense of human dignity and natural rights. This chamber, which would say that it supports our troops, should not do anything that would lead those troops to question the meaning or sincerity of our support. 
   I therefore encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing this dangerous resolution, which in two short paragraphs declares principles while avoiding the actions those principles seemingly require.
