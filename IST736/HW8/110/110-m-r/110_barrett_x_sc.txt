<DOCNO>Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. (NUCLEAR ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, in the past few weeks the focus of the energy crisis conversation has been about lifting the offshore ban on drilling to increase oil and gas supplies in the U.S., and offshore drilling is one solution that can help ease the energy crisis and lower gas prices at the pump. 
   However, there's also been talk about using alternative energy sources to solve our energy problems for the long term. The Department of Energy found that in the United States 103 nuclear units supply about 20 percent of the electricity produced here in the United States. 
   And in my home State of South Carolina, 52 percent of our State's power comes from nuclear power plants. For years, I've worked with organizations and companies within South Carolina to promote the benefits of nuclear power. Nuclear is clean, safe, and it's accessible in our country. 
   Nuclear energy is an alternative energy source that our country can use to create long-term energy solutions for generations to come. It's a real solution that, if we invest now, will help us bridge from a short-term solution to a long-term solution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I have been on the House floor asking the majority party if they've been hearing from the citizens about their financial struggles with high gas prices because I have. 
   This month, I mailed a survey to families in my district asking for their comments about the energy crisis. I wanted to hear from them about their opinions, their ideas of what we, as Members of Congress, should be doing to ease the high gas prices. 
   In response to the survey I sent to these citizens, we had tremendous responses: some things like find alternatives to oil; move the country beyond that; we need to support conservative changes in lifestyle; waste less; we have to change; develop new technologies, to get us off oil; drill now; drill everywhere; encourage automakers to make vehicles not powered by gasoline. Yeah. They're right. We need to do it all, and we need to do it now. 
   Is the majority party not hearing what I'm hearing? Worse, if they are, are they not choosing to help these people and bring energy legislation to the floor? 
   Mr. Speaker, we need energy legislation on the floor, and we need it now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, what is the deal? Lately when I've been in South Carolina, I have been talking to a lot of frustrated folks. And they are frustrated because they are watching their hard-earned paychecks burn up in their gas tanks. And I'm frustrated because I know there is no energy plan to help these families. 
   Two years ago the Democrats said they would introduce a commonsense plan to help the energy crisis. And today, when the Americans need it most, when they're paying $4 a gallon for gas, there is no energy plan. Yet I stand here today week after week, as I am doing, asking my friends on the Democrat side, ``Where is the plan?'' I have only seen plan 1, and that has been drafted by the Republican party. 
   Are my Democrat colleagues not hearing the pleas of the American public about high gas prices? Do they not travel to their respective districts and talk to their citizens? Have they not heard the public's frustration? Or do they choose to ignore them? 
   As Members of Congress, it is our duty to solve the problem. And it is just not good enough to tell them, ``We have no plan.''

   Individuals and businesses across the Nation are suffering, Mr. Speaker, and there's too much talk. Congress must take steps now to address our Nation's energy needs. So today I'm proud to announce I'm an original cosponsor of H.R. 6001, the Main Street U.S.A. Energy Security Act of 2008. 
   This legislation is an action plan and our first step to energy independence. It will boost our national security by increasing domestic exploration, encouraging research in the area of alternative energy sources, and promoting clean nuclear energy. 
   Mr. Speaker, for decades the United States has not had a comprehensive energy policy. Now with gasoline prices eating up Americans' paychecks, we need to find solutions to our growing energy needs. We have the resources and technology available to make energy independence a reality. 
   So no more talk, Mr. Speaker. It's time to act and act today.

   I understand that stem cells are necessary for the advancement of medical science. I am encouraged and hopeful of the promising effects stem cell research has for those struggling with debilitating diseases and disabilities, but these solutions can be found without destroying innocent life. 
   We no longer have to choose between medical advancement and the protection of life. In fact, stem cells derived from adults and umbilical cords have produced over 70 successful therapies, while embryonic stem cell research has produced none. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do believe in the wonders of science and medical research, and I am hopeful that together we can find cures to these devastating diseases and disabilities, but the end does not justify the means. 
   The citizens that I represent cannot stand at this podium and speak for the protection of the innocent and those unborn yet do not have a voice, so I ask my colleagues to vote against S. 5.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this week, the Budget Committee marked up the budget for fiscal year 2008. Unfortunately, instead of a commonsense balanced budget that lowers spending, reforms unsustainable entitlement programs and encourages economic growth without raising taxes, it is full of a lot of empty promises, with the exception of two, higher taxes and more spending. 
   My Republican colleagues and I believe that government should limit its taxing and spending, ease the burden on the economy and let the country grow. This Democratic budget trusts government more than it trusts the people. Those are the guys paying the bills. 
   As a result of Republican support of tax policies passed in 2001 through 2005, every taxpayer who paid income taxes will get tax relief this year. If these tax policies are eliminated, as the Democratic budget calls for, these taxpayers will see a tax hike. 
   Mr. Speaker, for these and many other reasons, the budget put forth this week is just plain wrong for our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding and also for Representative Davis today. 
   I would also like to thank Chairman Henry Waxman and Ranking Member Tom Davis of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee for facilitating such swift consideration of this bill that recognizes such an honorable man. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1335, a bill that honors the life and sacrifices of Staff Sergeant Lewis Watkins who gave his life for his country in the Korean War. Lewis Watkins was born on June 6, 1925, in Seneca, South Carolina. He graduated from Greenville High School in South Carolina in 1949. 
   He was a member of the Greenville Police Department where he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on September 12, 1950. After training at Parris Island, South Carolina, he served at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and Camp Pendleton, California, before being deployed to Korea. 
   On October 7, 1952, Sergeant Watkins' platoon was assigned to retake an outpost from the enemy. Even though Sergeant Watkins had been wounded during the fight, he continued to lead his men and return gunfire on the enemy machine gun position holding up the assault. At one point, an enemy grenade landed among his men. Selflessly and without thinking, he pushed his men out of harm's way and picked up the grenade. While attempting to throw the grenade back toward the enemy, it exploded in his hand, fatally wounding him. 
   Sergeant Watkins heroically sacrificed his life to save the lives of his fellow marines under his command, and in doing so, helped contribute to the overall success of his unit's mission during the Korean War. 
   I thank Sergeant Watkins and his family for his service. Every American owes a debt of gratitude for his service and his sacrifice. 
   In addition, every member of the South Carolina delegation cosponsored this legislation as a way to say thank you and honor a man who gave his life for his country. 
   Mr. Speaker, Staff Sergeant Lewis Watkins is the only known native Oconee County resident to receive a Medal of Honor. To designate the post office facility located at 508 East Main Street in Seneca, South Carolina, as the S/Sgt Lewis G. Watkins Post Office Building is one way we can pay tribute to his life. It will allow all who enter the post office and view the dedication plaque a unique opportunity to be  mindful of the sacrifices our military have made and continue to make today. 
   In addition to the Medal of Honor, Watkins' decorations include the Purple Heart Medal; Korean Service Medal with two bronze stars; and the United Nations Service Medal.     
   Lewis Watkins made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, and I am honored that this country is about to bestow upon his memory and his family yet another recognition. 
   There is a verse that says, ``No greater love hath he,'' and Lewis Watkins proved that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of H.R. 1335.

   Mr. Speaker, over the next 2 to 3 days, Members of Congress will come to the well and they will talk about the Iraq resolution. They will talk about troop levels and spending and funding and security, training, strategy, a lot of different things in a lot of different ways, with valid arguments on both sides. But I want to boil it down to something simple, something that I understand, something that means more to me than some of the things I mentioned. 
   There is a gentleman from my district, a Major Rick Simmons, a native of Pickens, South Carolina, an Eagle Scout, a Citadel grad. From time to time he has written me letters concerning different issues in Iraq. He is in Fallujah right now. 
   He wrote me a letter dated 5 February, 2007. It is a rather lengthy letter, but I want to read you one sentence from this letter: 
   ``This is not Bush's war, it is my war, and it is the war of every volunteer here because we know how high the stakes are for this country.'' ``My war.'' That is what he says. ``This is my war.'' 
   Rick, first to you and all your comrades over there, I say thank you and God bless you. I pray for you every day. But I want to tell you something, son; it is my war too. It is my war and my children's war and my children's children's war. 
   This is our war, ladies and gentlemen. This is the greatest enemy that we have ever faced in my lifetime, Mr.  Speaker. And when I raised my right hand and put my left hand on the Bible, it was to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies. And it was to protect the protectors, the protectors of liberty, the protectors of democracy, the protectors of freedom. And if it takes a troop surge and a funding stream that is guaranteed, I will do everything I can to ensure the protectors have everything they need. 
   There is only one way out of Iraq, Mr. Speaker. There is only one way out of this war. Victory. Victory. I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and I urge them to vote against this resolution.

   My constituents are tired of the out-of-control spending that they see at the Federal level. That is why I stood with my colleagues in the fiscally responsible Republican Study Committee last week and announced the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. We believe that the taxpayers have a right to a Federal Government that does not grow beyond their ability to pay for it. They have the right to receive back each dollar that they entrust to the government for their retirement; a right to a simple, fair Tax Code they can understand; and they have a right to expect that the government balance its budget without having to raise taxes. 
   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working in a bipartisan way with my colleagues on the Budget Committee to ensure that the rights of the taxpayer are not ignored.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, there was an energy bill brought to the floor yesterday, but unfortunately, it was not a comprehensive bill or open for debate, and no Member was allowed to offer any amendment expanding the scope. 
   The bill passed restricts miles of coastal States like my State of South Carolina. It tells us what we can explore, and it prohibits the States from sharing any revenues. That's a bad deal for coastal States, and it's a bad deal for this country. 
   It imposes a new 15 percent renewable energy requirement on utilities, but it leaves out energy sources like nuclear, most hydro and even clean coal. South Carolina gets about 50 percent of its power from nuclear energy, and this legislation will penalize my State. So it's a bad deal for South Carolina, and it's a bad deal for this country. 
   Madam Speaker, what I also left out of this so-called comprehensive bill is coal-to-liquid technology, increased refinery capacity, domestic exploration in ANWR, and nuclear energy--our cleanest and safest supply of energy that we have. 
   Madam Speaker, the bill passed is a bad deal for America. There is a smarter way. Let's bring comprehensive energy legislation like the American Energy Act to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Republican motion to instruct conferees on the fiscal year 2008 budget. This budget motion rests on one simple premise: to reject the largest tax increase in American history contained in the Democrats' House-passed budget. 
   By not addressing the Bush tax cuts, the Democratic budget resolution calls for a $393 billion tax hike, Mr. Speaker. In my home State of South Carolina, approximately 1.5 million people will see an average $2,400 increase in their tax bills. In my district alone, about 2,448 people will be forced to pay higher taxes, and estimates indicate a $182 million loss to the local economy, which translates in about 2,200 jobs being lost. 
   Mr. Speaker, the government spends too much money as it is. I can't imagine what it would be like with an additional $400 billion of spending. We have serious challenges facing this Nation and more money is not the solution. Instead of increasing the burden on American citizens, we have an obligation to find real workable solutions. 
   The Republican motion to instruct calls for a simple up-or-down vote on whether Congress should increase taxes on working Americans by $393 billion, as the House Democrat budget does. It directs conferees to commit to two things: Number one, reject the massive tax increase in the House budget that increases marginal tax rates, reimposes the marriage penalty, reimposes the death tax, cuts the child credit in half, and raises a range of other taxes as well. 
   And, number two, stop the raid on Social Security cash surpluses. Conferees should produce a budget with a surplus sufficient to halt the raid on cash surpluses in the Social Security trust funds by fiscal year 2012. 
   Mr. Speaker, these challenges aren't going to go away, and delaying addressing them just makes them worse and burdens future generations. The Republican alternative offers solutions, and for this reason I urge my colleagues to support the Republican motion to instruct.

   Rev. Scipio has also been a strong advocate for the African American communities in the upstate of South Carolina, specifically in Anderson, Oconee and Pickens Counties. He is said to have blessed the members of his congregation through his service.

Well, guess what? Some people are paying attention.

   The proposal that was put forth by the administration earlier was unacceptable, no accountability, no government oversight, too much burden on the American taxpayer. But politics is the art of the possible. 
   This House is a place where policy and reality come together, where people solve problems. I was sitting right there when the vote was taken Monday. As soon as it went down, I turned to my colleagues and said, It's time to roll up our sleeves, it's time to solve this problem for America, and let's move forward. And we did that. I was on the phone with Treasury, with the administration, with Senate and House leadership, with the SEC. We've got suspension of mark to market. We've got increased FDIC insurance. We've got tax relief, AMT, child tax credit. This is a better bill. 
   But it's tough out there. I've talked to my moms, I've talked to my pops, I've talked to my corporations. No matter what we do or what we pass, there are still tough times out there. People are hurting. People are mad. I'm mad. Men and women that have fought in this House, I have fought in this House for spending regulations and tougher restraint, and we have seen what has happened and where it has led us. 
   Do I still have concerns about this bill? Yes. Do I still have concerns that it will affect the free market system? Yes, I do. But we have to act and we have to act now. It's our job to lead. If we don't solve these problems, not just these problems but Medicare and Social Security, if this House doesn't lead, America will fail.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that many homeowners around the country require affordable insurance against natural disasters. However, I also know that the Federal Government cannot afford spending at the excessive levels we are spending at. By expanding the National Flood Insurance Program, the NFIP, H.R. 3121 would put the Federal Government on the hook for even more billions of dollars. 
   Coming from a State prone to hurricanes, I am sensitive to those needs and to those who live in high-risk areas for natural disasters. But it would be irresponsible for the Federal Government to expand its program without fully understanding the repercussions. Unfortunately, many Americans will likely once again find themselves affected by devastating natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. The NFIP already owes the Department of Treasury around $18 billion, and it is unlikely that they will ever be able to repay this amount; $18 billion. 
   So should we now increase the NFIP's exposure, thus increasing the Federal Government's liability, by expanding this program to include wind insurance? To do so would be unfair to the taxpayers who would be stuck with this bill, Mr. Chairman.     
   Expanding this already distressed program will increase the Federal Government's liability, and will almost definitely increase government spending on a huge scale while crowding out private insurance markets. 
   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against H.R. 3121, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act.

   Mr. Speaker, President John Adams once said, ``The highest story of the American Revolution is this. It connected in one indissoluble bond the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity.'' 
   So often we hear about the idea of separation of church and State. Mr. Speaker, I believe in the idea of separation of not from church, a distinction worth noting. 
   Our Founding Fathers never believed that faith should be taken out of our lives. However, they did believe that government should not interfere with an individual's faith. Unfortunately, in the society which we live in today, this distinction has been ignored. It has been forced out of everyday lives, and it saddens me, Mr. Speaker 
   The faith of the American people remains at the center of our great Nation. Our Founding Fathers were faithful men who believed every individual had the right to express their religious beliefs without fear of persecution or discrimination. 
   It was Thomas Jefferson, Mr. Speaker, who first uttered the term ``separation of church and state,'' indeed believed that faith played a vital role in the government of our Nation. While President, Jefferson said, ``No Nation has ever existed or been governed without religion. Nor can be.'' 
   During his public life, Jefferson urged local government officials to make land available specifically for Christian purposes, chose to attend church each Sunday at the Capitol, and even provided the service with paid government musicians to assist in the worship. Jefferson proposed that the Great Seal of the United States depict a story in the Bible and include the word ``God'' in its motto. 
   Enclosed are Presidential documents with the phrase, ``In the year of our Lord Christ, by the President, Thomas Jefferson.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm thankful to be able to address this House on this subject and for the opportunity to cosponsor this legislation designating an American Religious History Week. By their actions, our Founding Fathers showed us that faith and government can and should exist together. It's important for those here and now and future generations, Mr. Speaker, to remember the religious heritage of our Nation. I'm convinced that it's only by God's grace that our Nation has survived the many trials and tests we've experienced. And I will continue to turn to God to seek his guidance and make decisions affecting our country, and I believe by remaining faithful, our Nation will continue to thrive as a beacon of hope in the future. 
   I pray, Mr. Speaker, that God will continue to bless America.

Mr. Speaker, the very first reform passed by the new majority in the 110th Congress was a rule to create transparency publicizing projects earmarked for Federal money. Now the majority party is suggesting to the American people that it's okay to bury these earmarks in conference bills, which we know cannot be amended or challenged in any way. 
   Republicans last year brought more sunshine and transparency into this process, and instead of building on that, as promised by this new majority, Congress is taking a giant step backwards. 
   As a member of the House Budget Committee, I'm highly concerned that waiting until the very end of the law-making process to hide pork barrel spending is the simplest way to create a slush fund in the budget. This way of spending will lose America's trust. 
   Mr. Speaker, Americans have trusted us to spend their taxpayer money wisely and honestly. We have a responsibility to show them exactly how their money is being spent and defend it on the House floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. First off, I want to commend my colleagues, especially Minority Leader John Boehner, Roy Blunt, Eric Cantor, and certainly Ranking Member Spencer Bachus, for their hard work in improving this bill. However, Madam Speaker, after careful and agonizing consideration, I cannot support H.R. 3997 and will be voting ``no.'' 
   I understand the need to act, and I understand the urge to act quickly. We must restore the flow of credit. I firmly subscribe to the belief that Main Street and Wall Street are inextricably linked. Instability in the financial markets leads to instability in taxpayers' personal accounts and their personal funds. 
   Meanwhile, that capital that flows through our financial markets is vital to the continued success of our businesses, large and small. We should all agree that a failure of our credit markets would be an enormous catastrophe, and the government does have a role in ensuring that the financial markets function soundly. 
   At the same time, we cannot allow the American taxpayer to become the insurance policy for financial decisions that didn't quite turn out as planned. Whether you're talking about someone from South Carolina who took a mortgage they couldn't afford or a Wall Street banker who gave that mortgage, we see just how important personal responsibility must be to the American society. And I fear that this legislation erodes this accountability and the freedom that comes with it. 
   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, our government is in debt, and we're in a lot of it. In fact, this whole crisis is built around debt, where much bad debts has caused an inability to get new credit--otherwise known as debt. My daddy always told me that you can't borrow your way out of debt. And he was right. 
   There are other reasonable options that we should explore to help the markets heal themselves and that would not burden our country under even greater mounds of debt. I was pushing for a plan that would use more free market principles, such as suspension of capital gains, a repatriation of earnings to help spur economic growth by helping all Americans whose retirement accounts are invested in the stock market or own a house or business so they can jump start the flow of funds back in the system. 
   There is no doubt we find ourselves in a precarious situation, and the people are angry, and rightfully so. I'm angry. But we must not allow this anger to cloud our judgment and make choices that will divide this country. This is not a matter of Main Street versus Wall Street. 
   But when it comes time to vote on this bill, Madam Speaker, I will be voting ``no.'' I understand my colleagues for their reasoning, and I'm confident that we all want to do the best for this country. But I believe so strongly in the principles of the free market and the belief in the word ``freedom.'' That's why I'm opposing this bill. 
   My fear is that today the government will forever change the face of the American free market.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. My friend was exactly right. We are talking about the largest tax increase in our history, $292 billion. My friend from California was exactly right. When you talk about facts and figures, it's one thing. But when you try to bring it home and let people understand exactly what it means to them personally, it's another thing. 
   Let me just give you some examples. Nationwide, if the Democrat budget were to happen to pass, we are talking about some nationwide impacts. Here we go, a family of four earning $40,000 will face a tax increase of $2,052. That is a family of four nationwide and 113 million taxpayers will see their taxes go up by an average $2,200. Actually, $2,216, but what the heck, it's government work, let's round it off a little bit. Over 5 million individuals and families who would have seen their income tax liabilities completely eliminated will now have to pay taxes. 
   So not only people that haven't paid taxes in the past now, another 5 million individuals are going to have to hit the tax rolls; 45 million families with children will face an average tax increase of $2,864; 15 million elderly individuals, elderly. Now, most of these are on fixed incomes, will pay an average tax increase of $2,934. And 27 million small business owners will pay an average tax increase, listen to this one now, listen to this one, $4,712. Let me read that one again, 27 million small business owners will pay an average tax increase of $4,712. Unbelievable. 
   Let's bring it home. I am from South Carolina, born and raised there. Let's put it in South Carolina terms. In South Carolina the impact of repealing the Republican tax relief would be felt. Here is how. It's higher than I thought: 1,300,000 taxpayers statewide who are benefiting from the new lower 10 percent bracket would see their taxes go up. 
   In South Carolina alone, 1.3 million people added to the 10 percent bracket; 447,000 married couples in the State of South Carolina would see higher taxes because of the increase in the marriage penalty. We are penalizing people to be married; 427,000 families with children would pay more taxes because the child tax credit would expire; and 212,000 investors, including seniors, would pay more because of an increase on tax rates on the capital gains and dividends. 
   The gentleman from California was there last Wednesday into Thursday morning when we passed it, we voted against it, but the Democrats passed their budget. It's full of empty promises, with the exception of two, more spending and higher taxes. That is a done deal; it's going to happen. The Democrat budget says it's the largest tax increase in American history. The Republican budget will say no tax increases.     
   The Democrat budget will say, immense new spending. The Republican will say, we will hold the line and we were going to increase accountability. 
   Entitlements, on the Democratic side, it is a complete failure, $77 million worth of entitlement savings, $77 million when we are talking about literally hundreds of billions of dollars in entitlement spending that they are going to do. The Republican budget says reforms, improvements in reforms, trying to make entitlement more sustainable and adding to the longevity of it. So it is plain and simple. 
   Again, the figure that the gentleman from California, Madam Speaker, quoted a little bit earlier, when you bring it home in South Carolina terms where everybody can understand it, where it hits their pocketbook, we are talking per year average for 5 years if the Democratic budget passes, $2,482.66 that my people in South Carolina will have to pay more. 
   And I ask the gentleman from California, I don't think that is a pretty good deal, do you?

   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding; and, no, I don't. Again, broken promises. 
   One of the ways that the Democrats want to fund all this new spending is reserve funds. And you talk about a  shell game. We are talking about setting up reserve funds so we can spend more money, but there is actually no money in the reserve funds because we are going to put the money in there later on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Exactly. And as the gentleman from California knows, we had an empty jar, a big empty jar in our committee to illustrate that view. 
   One of the ways that the Democrats in their budget spend more money is they set up this empty reserve fund to be funded later, that the committees and the agencies and organizations can draw money out to spend more money, but yet there is no money in the reserve fund to spend. So you talk about a shell game. It is a shell game at its finest. 
   One of the things that I was proud of several weeks ago, I guess maybe it was 2 weeks ago, I was proud to be part of an RSC, the Republican Study Committee, a press conference that we had to talk about a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 
   And, Madam Speaker, what we are talking about here is giving the taxpayers across the country more accountability for their government. Four simple things, things that we have talked about and things that we would like to see come to fruition. Let me tell you what they are. 
   Taxpayers should have the right to a Federal government that does not grow beyond their ability to pay for it. I don't think we see that in this budget, Madam Speaker. 
   Taxpayers should have the right to receive back every dollar they entrust to the government for their retirement. It is incredible what we have done and what we are continuing to do, Madam Speaker, in this Democratic budget. 
   Number three, taxpayers have a right to expect the government to balance the budget without having their taxes raised. As the gentleman from California well knows, the Republican budget that we will present later this week will do that in 5 years. We will balance the budget, save the Social Security fund, and do it all without raising taxes. The Democratic budget does not. It does not. Now they may say one thing, but the figures show something else. 
   And, last, taxpayers have a right to a simple and fair Tax Code that they understand. Boy, that is a tough one there. But it is a game of trying to be responsible to the taxpayers, as my friend from California knows. It is a game of making sure that our people keep their money. They know how to spend it more than we do in Washington, D.C., and I trust my people more. 
   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, as my friend from California knows, this budget trusts the government more than it trusts the American taxpayer. 
   With that, I yield back.

   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I think it is very simple. Number one, we will balance the budget without raising taxes; and, number two, we will reform entitlements. Because, as you well know, over the next 5 years, Madam Speaker, entitlement spending will grow 19 percent. Now that is without me, without my friend from California, without anybody in this House lifting a single finger. Entitlement spending will grow 19 percent. 
   So the budget we bring to the floor this week will be very simple. We will slow the growth, not cut. We will slow the growth, because entitlement spending will still continue to grow. We will slow the growth of entitlement spending, and we will balance the budget without raising taxes. 
   And I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, it is an honor to come tonight and talk a little about spending, talk a little bit about the budget, talk a little bit about reform, talk a little bit about entitlements, and talk a little bit about earmarks. 
   What we want to do, Madam Speaker, over the next hour is talk a little bit about what is going on in Washington, what is broken, what needs to be fixed and have a big-picture discussion. We can talk about line items. We can talk about things down in the weeds. But what we want to talk about tonight is a philosophical difference between the Republicans and the Democrats on how we are going to get this country, Madam Speaker, back on track. 
   Now the President's budget lays out critical fiscal issues that the Congress is going to have to deal with in the near future. Key among them are balancing the budget, promoting sustained economic growth, slowing the growth of Federal spending and addressing the coming entitlement crisis. 
   First on deficits. Last year at this time, after several years of dramatic declines in the Federal deficit, we found ourselves on what may be described as a glide path to balance in the near term. Now that path has been interrupted, mainly due to the slowdown in the economy and the stimulus package, but we will still balance the budget. 
   Even while addressing current challenges in the economy, the President's budget achieves balance by 2012 without raising taxes. Now let me say that again, because I think that is extremely important. The President's budget achieves balance by 2012 without raising taxes by demanding the Federal Government get in control of guess what? Spending. 
   The budget also achieves balance through sustainable fiscal policies that support economic growth and job creation. It maintains the tax policies that have supported the solid growth which until only recently succeeded in producing appreciably higher revenue, appreciably higher revenue, and dramatic reductions in the deficit, and we have got some charts to show you just that. 
   Finally, the President's budget recognizes that our Nation's challenges go well into the next few years. It takes a significant critical step towards addressing the greatest threat to our Nation's future strength and prosperity, the unsustainable growth of our largest entitlement programs. 
   While the President's budget doesn't fix the entitlement problem in one fell swoop, it does propose specific reforms, ones which would reduce Medicare's $34 trillion in unfunded liability by nearly a third, and that would be a tremendous step, Madam Speaker, $10 trillion, and I congratulate the President on this step. 
   These are issues that we can debate on how best to approach that. But to cut the unfunded liability by $10 trillion is remarkable. And if the people want to criticize the President's specific proposals for addressing that problem, that's fine. Then let's make sure they come forward with solutions on how we can fix this stuff. Don't just tell me the problem. Tell me how to fix it. 
   We must reform these programs so they can meet their mission of providing health and retirement security and a reliable safety net today and in the future. The administration has a proposed plan, but it is Congress who has the power of the purse strings. It is Congress who will decide the Federal budget. And it is Congress who is ultimately responsible and accountable for ensuring a sustainable path to our Nation's future. 
   Let me show a couple of charts to kind of substantiate what we are talking about, Madam Speaker. 
   The first chart. Now a lot of people have said the Bush tax cuts, let's make them permanent. Let's do away with them. When we talk about the Bush tax cuts, what are we talking about? We are not talking about the Bush tax cuts. We are talking about real things. We are talking about capital gains. We are talking about the marriage penalty. We are talking about dividends. We are talking about a death tax. A child tax credit. Things that affect everyday Americans, Madam Speaker. 
   Now this chart shows the best Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. If you look at the red first, this shows what happened before the tax cuts, and the blue shows what happened after the tax cuts. Now my friends on the other side have always said, well, what we need to do, we need to tax the rich. We need to make sure that they are paying more than their fair share. 
   Let me show this. After the Bush tax cuts, the top 1 percent, their taxes actually went up. That's right. The top 10 percent, guess what? After the Bush tax cuts, their taxes actually went up. The top 50 percent, after the Bush tax cuts, guess what? Their taxes actually went up. 
   Now, again, the Democrats will argue, well, we need to do more for the little man, for the guy that is in the middle. Look at the bottom down here. The bottom 50 percent after the Bush tax cuts went into effect, their tax liability actually went down. So the argument that we need to tax the rich more to save the little man doesn't quite fit that chart, does it? 
   Let's show another one. Job creation before and after the Bush tax cuts. If you look at the red lines going south, or below the line, this is before the Bush tax cuts. Look what happened after the Bush tax cuts. Now it appears to me on this chart that job creation went up. So we have got the lower 50 percent that are actually paying less, and we are creating more jobs.     
   An interesting concept. Let me show another one. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, I really love this one. This is one that me being from South Carolina can truly understand. This is before the Bush tax cuts. Then, after 2003, everything was fully implemented. The line goes increasingly up. So even after the Bush tax cuts were fully implemented, revenues to the Federal Government soared through the roof. 
   It just proves that when you allow Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money, that they know how to spend it better than we do. They are going to buy a new truck. They are going to build a new building. They are going to hire a new employee. They are going to grow the economy. And the way you grow the economy is through the private sector and not the public sector. 
   Now, let's change subjects just a little bit. Spending. No matter what we do, whether it is tax policy, whether it is changes here or changes there, we have got to get spending under control. The red line assumes that my friends on the Democrat side are successful and the Bush tax cuts are going to go away. We will have higher taxes. The red line shows here that the taxes are increasing. 
   But look at the green line. The green line, Madam Speaker, is runaway spending, and you can't address one without addressing the other, because unless we get our fiscal house in order, none of it is worth anything. 
   Now, I want to read you a quote here. Comptroller General David Walker came in front of our committee and said, ``You are not going to tax your way out of this problem. You're not going to grow your way out of this problem. You are not going to do it by constraining spending. You are going to have to do a combination of all these things, and the biggest thing is going to be entitlement reform, Social Security and Medicare, health care being a much greater challenge. And  we need to start soon, because time is working against us.'' 
   Let's look at entitlements. Now, of course, the top of it says ``mandatory spending.'' There is actually nothing mandatory about this, because Congress can change this if we need to. It is entitlement spending. 
   In 1995, entitlement spending was roughly about 49 percent of our Federal budget; in 2005, which, by the way, was 3 years ago, 53.4 percent of our budget. And, lo and behold, unless we do something to address entitlement spending, by 2018, it will be 63.3 percent of our budget. 
   Now, you look at the interest, how it has kind of stayed the same, actually gone down a little bit. But discretionary spending has gone from 36 to 29 percent. Roads, education, infrastructure, defense, things that are vital to our Nation, things that are vital to our national security, are being eroded because of this monster that we call mandatory spending. 
   This is the last chart I want to show. Now, again, I want to applaud the President for trying to attack entitlement spending. There is $34 trillion, as we speak, of unfunded liabilities. And what his budget proposes is an estimated $10 trillion trying to trim that off. 
   Now, my chairman, Chairman John Spratt from South Carolina, an honorable man, sat right in the committee and said these are draconian cuts to Medicare, to Medicaid. But, Mr. Chairman, tell me how to fix it? Let's have an open and honest debate on how to address entitlement spending, because, Madam Speaker, this is the camel that broke the straw's back literally; not the straw that broke the camel's back, but the camel that broke the straw's back. 
   Madam Speaker, I can go on, and I want to do that, but I have some tremendous partners here with me tonight that want to talk about spending, that want to talk about runaway spending, that want to talk about this system that, personally, I think is broken. 
   The first gentleman I would like to recognize is a dear friend of mine, a classmate of mine from the great State of Minnesota, Representative Colonel John Kline.

   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, I guess it is a philosophical question: Who do you trust? Who do you trust? Do you trust a Federal bureaucracy that has grown and grown and grown? Or do you trust the men and women in South Carolina? Do you trust the men and women in Minnesota? Do you trust the men and women in Texas or Tennessee? Because they are the ones out there day after day busting their humps, making a living, trying to make ends meet. And all they want is a fair shake. All they want is for us to spend their money wisely. 
   I have never met a constituent, Madam Speaker, that didn't say ``I don't want to pay my fair share.'' But every one of them will tell you ``I don't want to pay more than my fair share.'' And it is incumbent upon us, it is incumbent upon the United States Congress, to do the right thing. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, there is a lovely lady in the Chamber tonight that is a budget hawk, that is a stalwart when it comes to conservatism in the House, a lady that speaks with a gentle voice but carries a big stick, and I am talking about my dear friend from Tennessee, MARSHA BLACKBURN.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, this would basically eliminate funding for the Byrd Honors Scholarship program by saving about $40.6 million. 
   And I guess what I'm here to talk about today, Mr. Chairman, is that this program, which is certainly a merit-based scholarship program, was rated as ``results not demonstrated.'' When we talk about funding, when we talk about scholarships, when we talk about trying to make government more effective and more efficient, I think this is a perfect example, Mr. Chairman, of duplicative services. 
   I understand the need of helping our high school seniors, and I applaud the effort. But in a time when money is scarce and we're trying to be good stewards of the taxpayers' dollar, doesn't it make sense, Mr. Chairman, to take programs like this, and all other associated programs, take a look at them from the bottom up and look at what is effective? 
   Why was this particular program rated ``results not demonstrated''? Was it because of a lack of funding, Mr. Chairman? Was it because of a lack of information that high school students didn't know what was going on? Was it because of a lack of organization on how the scholarship is administered? I don't know. I don't know these answers. 
   So all I'm saying is, if we're going to continue to help seniors, and I hope we do, let's try to do it in a more responsible manner. Let's just not create another government program. Let's not create a duplicative service. Let's take a look at what we're doing, how we're doing it, bring things together. It may be that this program needs to be increased, I don't know. It may be that it needs to go away and this money go to a program that is far more effective. All I'm saying is that I think this is the wrong way to go about it. 
   I think if we took a real hard look at all these programs, we could pull our  resources together, we could help our high school seniors much more effectively and maybe, at the same time, save $40.6 million of hard-earned taxpayers' money. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Can it not be rolled into another program or taken a look at to make sure that we're getting our best bang for the dollar, that we're spending the taxpayers' money wisely, and we're being the most effective helping our high school seniors with a higher education degree?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, our friends on the other side of the aisle have spent a great deal of time over the past few years railing against deficits and railing against the debt. And last year, their first time in the majority in over a decade, the Democrats finally got their chance to show their version of what a fiscally responsible Congress should actually look like. But all they've done since they've come into power is mismanage the fiscal situation. 
   The key to managing and to budgeting is to set priorities, and everyone who has ever had a family or run a business knows this. You have to make difficult choices, and you can't always have everything you want right when you want it. 
   But the Democrats have refused to set priorities. They simply want to spend more on everything and everyone within the reach of the Federal Government. And we've even seen things that they spend money on that the Federal Government has absolutely nothing to do with. 
   And to pay for all this new spending? Well, they're simply going to raise taxes, this time by $683 billion. That tax hike lets them show balance, at least on paper, for this round of spending. But their plan to chase ever-higher spending with ever-higher taxes can only work for so long. Pretty soon, as their spending continues to spiral out of control without any priorities, without any effort to cut waste, and without any effort to reform entitlements, they're simply going to run out of people to pay for it all. Then what? 
   Again, budgeting is about setting priorities and making decisions. But the decisions this budget makes, and perhaps more importantly, those that it fails to make, sets up a vicious cycle of tax and spend that neither the budget nor the American taxpayer can sustain for long.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, our veterans and our troops have protected us from enemies, foreign and domestic, in the past decades and currently today. 
   When has it become a part of our congressional activity to not fully protect their interests? Our VA appropriations bill passed the House over 140 days ago with strong bipartisan support. However, the House majority party never appointed conferees for the bill, where the Senate immediately appointed them. 
   The military and veterans appropriations bill is now back on the floor with an additional bill attached. Our servicemembers, veterans and our troops, deserve the best that Congress can deliver to them. The MilCon-VA appropriations bill should not be an accessory for massive labor spending. 
   Has politics blocked our activities in Washington where we cannot pass a military funding bill for our soldiers? 
   I stand here today with so many others who join me in saying, our MilCon-VA appropriations bill needs to stand alone, unattached to another bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, on October 28, 2007, a tragic and accidental fire in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, claimed seven very young lives. Six of the victims were students at the University of South Carolina: Cassidy Fae Pendley, Lauren Astrid Kristiana Mahon, Justin Michael Anderson, Travis Lane Cale, Allison Walden, William Rhea. One of the victims, Emily Lauren Yelton, was a sophomore at Clemson University, a graduate of J.L. Mann High School in Greenville, a member of the Delta Zeta sorority and a member of Young Life of Greenville. 
   These brilliant young college students were sisters, brothers, devoted sons and daughters, athletes, instructors, friends, volunteers, coaches, and leaders. Family members and friends have recounted how each one has given support, made a difference and brightened people's lives. 
   I stand here today to support H. Res. 787, which is a resolution sponsored by Congressman Jim Clyburn to express much-needed support for those fire victims. 
   I would also like to recognize and offer sympathy to the victims' families and let them know that South Carolina and the people of this Nation, Mr. Speaker, will always honor those names that we loved and lost.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week, Senator JOHN MCCAIN stated that we need to lift the Federal moratorium on offshore drilling for oil and gas. President Bush also agreed that the U.S. needs to lift its long-standing ban on offshore oil and gas drilling so we can increase our energy production here. 
   I agree. We need to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for American families. Mr. Speaker, the U.S. has access to 112 billion barrels of onshore and offshore oil and access to 1 to 2 trillion barrels of recoverable oil shale. To ban exploration of these energy sources is simply outdated. 
   The rise in gas prices has brought a daily increase in the cost of consumer goods due to higher transportation costs, groceries and airfare. American families are looking for relief, Mr. Speaker, and the President is correct when he said Americans are turning to Washington for solutions. The only way we can help these families is to lift the ban on energy resources that we have here at home.

In fact, research has shown that stem cells derived from adults and umbilical cords are already used in over 70 successful therapies today and hold the most promise for the future. We do not have to choose between the need to encourage the advancement of science with the need to protect life.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. (FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this bill, which I think is unhelpful for the housing market and unfair to the American taxpayer. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I'm concerned that this program will only distort housing prices, causing problems in the future by forcing the taxpayer to foot the bill. 
   I have no doubt that some of the lending practices in the beginning of the decade, Mr. Speaker, were irresponsible, and that the government should take certain steps to help the market right itself and to prevent these problems from recurring in the future. At the same time, I'm a firm believer in the power of the free market, and I believe that the housing market fundamentally reflects the laws of supply and demand. 
   I'm always wary of government intervention in the markets and concerned about unintended consequences. I fear that in our rush to help, we are overlooking the basic realities about today's housing market and about the cost of government spending. 
   I think we can all agree that government programs cost money, and this program has the potential to cost a tremendous amount of money. And that money comes from the taxpayer, Mr. Speaker. Because, in reality, like the laws of supply and demand, decisions have consequences, and money has to come from somewhere. It's not fair to ask my constituents from South Carolina, who work hard and spend wisely and pay, in my opinion, too much tax money, to carry the burden for others' financial mistakes. 
   While I believe that people in need deserve our understanding and our help, I trust in the ability of the free market to correct itself. And I think Americans know how best to spend their money and should be trusted to make their own financial decisions. I also think that lenders have a responsibility to live with the consequences of investments that did not quite turn out as planned. 
   Mr. Speaker, I offered an amendment in the Financial Services Committee that is representative of my concerns. The amendment was not adopted, and it was very simple. It was to strike the section of the bill that prohibits FHA from denying borrowers entry into the new FHA program solely on the basis of the mortgagor's current FICO or other credit scores, or any delinquency or default by the mortgagor. In South Carolina talk, Mr. Speaker, this amendment would have given the FHA the opportunity to use individual pieces of information on their own that reveal the risk of borrowers defaulting. In offering the amendment, I wanted to allow the FHA to protect the American taxpayer by giving them every tool available. 
   I understand the motivations of this section of the bill to try to include as many people as possible in the program meant to help them. And I understand it would be nice if we could help all of these borrowers, but some may have very bad credit scores that reflect irresponsible borrowing behavior. It's not fair to the American taxpayer to insure the loans of the riskiest borrowers who may not be able to pay their mortgages no matter what the terms of the loan. 
   Without a doubt, it's never easy to hear the stories of hardworking individuals and families losing their homes, but I do not believe that more government intervention is the solution to our problems. And we should not allow the American taxpayers to become the insurance policy for the financial decisions that did not turn out as planned or for temporary market downturns. We should not punish those hardworking and responsible American taxpayers for the mistakes of a few. For these reasons, and others, I oppose this legislation and ask my colleagues to do the same.

   I will tell you, I was talking to Jeb Hensarling earlier, who spoke a little bit earlier, Mr. Speaker, a dear friend of mine, and we were talking about what a smile we had on our faces today.     
   A celebration of life. Something that we have been waiting for, for a long time, and I am just ecstatic. I look to my left over here and see the colleagues that are going to be speaking, and every one of them has got a smile on their face, and it is just exciting. It is a tremendous day; it is a tremendous moment for our country. 
   And I come here tonight for three reasons, three simple reasons: The first one is Madison Finley Barrett, my oldest daughter. The second one is James Edward Barrett; we call him Jeb, Cowboy, my middle son. And the third is Charles Ross Barrett, my baby. I think about them every day. I think about watching my wife give birth. I think  about how precious they are. I know it was a tremendous moment for me both physically and spiritually, and I don't think any person can witness something like that and not know that there is a God in heaven. 
   But I think about, Mr. Speaker, my children and my family, and I celebrate for them today. I celebrate for all the families across this Nation and the lives that we will save. I think about their first steps. I think about their first falls. I think about the first time they drove a car. I think about the excitement and the joy I feel and the satisfaction that I have because they are so precious. And out there tonight, Mr. Speaker, there are Madisons and Cowboys and Pally Pals that are being born. Each one of them special, each one of them a gift from God, each one of them with the ability to change the world. 
   It is a first step. It is a great step. I am just proud to be here to celebrate, to celebrate life, to celebrate freedom, to celebrate this wonderful thing. What a great country. What a great life. What a tremendous success.

But there have been many of us that have been on this floor throughout the month of August. We have talked directly with the American people about the immediate need for comprehensive energy legislation. And during August, it became crystal clear that there's a disconnect between what is happening on the streets of America and what is happening here in Washington, DC. 
   One day my colleague was talking and in a moment of doubt and frustration, he said, ``I don't even know if anybody is listening,'' to which somebody stood up on the floor here and said, ``America is listening, Congressman. America is listening.'' And he was right. 
   The American people are hurting. At a gas station in North Augusta, South Carolina, one gentleman, a special needs gentleman, came up to me and said, ``Congressman, I can only afford $39 of gas, half a tank, because that's all I have and that's got to do me.'' 
   What are we doing to help this gentleman?

   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, one reason America has remained free of attack for the last 7 years is because we have given the tools necessary to those on the front lines, whether it be our military or our intelligence officers. Many tactics to defend and protect this country have been used, one being electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligence through the FISA Act. 
   Madam Speaker, FISA was first implemented to assist the gathering of information during another era, well before the invention of cell phones, satellite tracking, or even the Internet. Terrorist groups and, more specifically, al Qaeda, have adapted to modern technology, and it's time the U.S. did the same. We're not talking about skirting the legal process but, rather, giving our intelligence officers the ability to gather information coming from foreign and/or known terrorists in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to conference report S. Con. Res. 21, the Democratic congressional budget for 2008. 
   By not addressing the Bush tax cuts, the Democratic budget resolution conference report calls for at least a $217 billion tax hike, the second highest in American history. 
   This budget resolution also includes a trigger which would automatically turn the tax increase into the largest in American history. 
   Mr. Speaker, the government spends too much money. We have serious challenges facing this Nation and spending more money is not a solution. The conference report increases non-defense appropriations by $22 billion above  2007, and $21 billion above the President's request. 
   It fails to maintain emergency funds included in last year's budget resolution. Also, emergency spending is loosely defined in this budget resolution and does not prevent future abuses in emergency supplemental appropriations. 
   The conference report has 23 reserve funds which include the promise of more than $190 billion in additional spending which I can only assume will be paid by additional taxes. 
   The House Budget Committee listened to many testimonies from budget experts, indicating our Nation was facing a fiscal crisis when it comes to entitlement spending; yet the conference report does nothing to address this issue. We cannot simply raise taxes and hope our entitlement problems will solve themselves. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hoped at least some of the commonsense solutions put forth in the Republican substitute would have been settled, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this budget resolution.

Either commit to their mission and bring them home victorious or stop their funding and bring them home in defeat. The choices are there in front of us.

   In less than 3 months, Democrats have called for immense new spending. Their agenda for the 110th Congress calls for throwing billions more at entitlements that are already growing at unsustainable rates. At the same time, they have not proposed a dollar of savings or a single reform--just more spending, financed by higher taxes. 
   The American people want reductions in spending, they want reforms to our overburdened and unsustained programs, and they want their elected leaders to be held accountable for the plans they put forth and the funding they approve. 
   Republicans have a responsible plan that balances the budget by encouraging economic growth and reforming entitlement programs--without raising taxes. Increasing the tax burden on the American people has never led to economic prosperity.

   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of the budget conference report. 
   By allowing tax relief to expire, the House-passed Democrat budget resolution calls for a $683 billion tax hike. And in my home State of South Carolina, the Democrat budget is about a $2,500 tax increase for the average South Carolinian's home. This would be, Mr. Speaker, the largest tax increase in history. 
   The government spends too much money, Mr. Speaker, and I can't imagine giving the government an additional $683 billion. We have serious challenges facing the Nation, and money is not the answer. 
   The conference report fails in many areas, but the most notable is in spending. It increases discretionary spending by $21 billion above the President's request and pushes discretionary spending past the $1 trillion mark in FY 2009. 
   It fails to maintain emergency funds that were included in the Republican 2007 budget resolution. It has 37 reserve funds, which include the promise of billions of additional spending, which I can only assume will be paid in additional taxes. 
   And finally, the House Budget Committee listened to testimony from budget experts indicating that our Nation was facing a financial crisis when it comes to entitlement spending, yet the conference report does nothing to truly address this issue. We cannot continue just to raise taxes and hope that entitlements will be solved by themselves, Mr. Speaker. 
   And lastly, Mr. Speaker, in a time when we have economic hardships with our folks trying to put their entire paycheck in their gas tanks, to bring tax increases, additional spending, more government regulation I think is unconscionable. 
   So I would urge my colleagues to vote against this budget resolution and bring some fiscal sanity back into this process.

   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, instead of the reauthorization of a successful plan, the majority party is trying to reinvent the government health care wheel by proposing a $35 billion expansion of the current SCHIP plan. 
   The current SCHIP plan has proven itself successful because it now provides approximately 6.6 million low-income children with government-funded health care services annually. By the way, only 13 percent of this money will actually go to children anyway. 
   If we allow the vetoed SCHIP bill to pass, the intent of the original SCHIP program, which is to provide health care insurance to children of low-income families who are unable to afford private coverage, will be lost. 
   This bill would allow families earning an annual income $83,000 a year to take advantage of a program designed to help low-income, uninsured children. 
   Voting against the SCHIP bill reflects a disagreement for the manner in which the health care coverage will be distributed and to whom. The SCHIP bill needs to be authorized, but can be and should be done in a fiscally responsible manner.

   Part of the Republican plan is to make permanent the tax relief that continues to support our Nation's economic prosperity. Our pro-growth policies have worked to support our economy's solid sustained growth and have created more than 7.4 million new jobs. This growth has also fueled double-digit growth in Federal revenues and put us on a path to balancing the budget.

   I would like to honor Dr. Johnson during February's Black History Month as a very notable and distinguished African American who has heavily impacted the Third Congressional District of South Carolina. Dr. Johnson's extensive background and his many leadership positions as a teacher, coach and administrator has laid the groundwork for him being named to the position of district superintendent. 
   Since 1991, Dr. Johnson worked for Rock Hill School District Three, beginning as assistant principal at the Rock Hill High School. After serving as assistant principal and principal for Sunset Park Elementary School, he moved to the district office in 1998 as director of student services. In 2001, he was named assistant superintendent. 
   His dedication to making a difference in education propelled him to earn his superintendent position, and rightfully so. I congratulate Darrell Johnson for being able to excel in this capacity where he may apply his natural ability to lead those who are most important to our future, our students.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' 
   That was Ms. Pelosi in a press release 1 year ago today. The price at the pump then, $2.91 a gallon, today almost $4 a gallon. 
   Also 2 years ago, Ms. Pelosi vowed that if her party took over Congress they would cut energy prices, especially gasoline. It's obvious there's a fast growing need for energy in our country, and this need must be met with a solution. 
   To provide a reduction in gas prices for Americans, we need to find resources here at home and support domestic energy production. Our country needs to research and fund alternative energy production to become less dependent on foreign sources for the security of our country, and to ease the burdening gas prices for our American families. 
   American families were promised a commonsense plan by the Democrat majority. If there's a commonsense plan, don't you think it's time that we see it?

   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, over 100 days have passed since the President's first request of additional monies for our troops, and still no money. As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to ensure men and women in our military have the resources and tools necessary to succeed. Just 2 weeks ago, we heard from nearly 3,000 of those men and women asking for our support. 
   Mr. Speaker, politics should never interfere with wartime decisions. Unfortunately, some have taken this opportunity to score what they believe to be political points and undermine our Commander in Chief. Our troops deserve a clean supplemental that does not embolden the enemy with language of retreat and defeat. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democrat leadership should stop the rhetoric of empty promises of ``we support our troops'' by giving them the critical funds they need today so they can finish the mission we gave them and come home in victory.

   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, it is understood that overall America's health care facilities face a decline in the quality of their staff. But South Carolina is graciously blessed with Dr. James L. Coleman, Jr., whose mission it is to improve the ways we provide the best and accessible primary and preventive health care to folks in our State who lack the means for quality medical care. 
   Currently serving as chief executive officer of the Margaret J. Weston Medical Center, Dr. Coleman is known for providing a message of diversity in health care. He and his staff at the medical center understand that in order to have healthy citizens, it is essential to provide affordable health care services. 
   With degrees from Winthrop, Central Arkansas and a doctorate of education from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Dr. Coleman is a teacher and local crusader for the improvement of lives by the improvement of health services. 
   During February's Black History Month, I would like to recognize Dr. Coleman. His efforts to provide better health care to underprivileged South Carolina citizens has not gone unnoticed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have a lot of faith in the American people. I believe that, given the proper tools, they can best decide how to spend their money. I also believe they can best determine how to borrow money, just as lenders can best determine who should be lent money. In other words, I trust free choice in the free market. Businesses should be able to take risks just as consumers should be able to. With these risks, come consequences. 
   However, I understand we have a major problem on our hands, a problem that has spread far beyond the housing market to the heart of the American economy. Some homeowners are struggling to make mortgages they can't afford and financial institutions are stuck holding mortgages that probably will not be repaid. But to say all subprime mortgages are bad is an incorrect conclusion. 
   Unfortunately, this legislation, Mr. Chairman, will not help those who today are in danger of losing their homes, and it will certainly not help the availability of credit for those purchasing homes in the future. This legislation will not add confidence to the credit market and will not help our housing market find its footing. 
   I was a small business owner in another life, and I understand when we make certain types of loans cost-prohibitive by adding burdensome regulation or liability, all those loans will simply stop being made. When we ban compensation for certain types of loans, the originators have no reason to make them, especially when they are now subject again to these new regulations and liabilities. 
   Rather than ensuring this market works smoothly through increased oversight and transparency, we are effectively legislating these loans out of existence and further tightening our credit markets. It is not a good thing for our housing market, our economy, or the free choice of our homeowners. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, I must oppose H.R. 3915, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mrs. Elestine Smith Norman. Born December 12 of 1949 to the late Wilbert and Elese Morton Smith in the Promise Land Area of Greenwood, South Carolina, she is the youngest of five children. 
   She attended the public schools in Greenwood and is a graduate of Piedmont Tech and Limestone College. She was the first in her family to graduate from college. 
   She has been married to Pastor Willie Neal Norman for 37 years. Willie is the pastor of Weston Chapel AME Church in Greenwood where Elestine and he have served faithfully for over 18 years. She and Neal have never had any children of their own, but there are lots of folks that would call Elestine their spiritual mother. 
   She has survived a diagnosis of breast cancer twice in her life and has ministered to many, many others with cancer throughout the years. Her positive attitude through these trials has always inspired others to fight a strong fight. She has trusted faithfully in her Lord Jesus Christ to bring her through the many hardships. 
   Mr. Speaker, she is a former president of the Greenwood Business and Professional Women's Club. She has served on the Greenwood United Way Board, the Lander University Board of Visitors, and the Piedmont Technical College Board of Visitors. She is also the recipient of the 2007 Women's History Month Government Award from the AME Church for the State of South Carolina. 
   In 1972 she went to work for then-Congressman of the Third Congressional District of South Carolina, Bryan Dorn. She has continued to work as a senior caseworker in the Greenwood district offices for the following Members: Congressman Butler Derrick and Congressman, now Senator, LINDSEY GRAHAM. She has worked for both Democrat and Republican Congressmen, always putting the love of serving people above politics. 
   When I was elected to succeed Senator Graham as the Representative from the Third Congressional District, I was honored that Elestine agreed to continue her dedicated service in my Greenwood office. Now after 34 years of public service, she has decided to retire. And all these years of compassionate service, she has never lost her heart for people. And I know she will always continue to serve throughout the community for as long as the good Lord keeps her on this Earth. 
   Mr. Speaker, I had these prepared remarks that I wanted to say so I didn't forget anything. But I want to share one short story about Mrs. Elestine Norman. When I was elected in 2002, I knew Elestine had worked for three other Congressmen, and I thought to myself, well, there is no way that she could have the compassion and the fire and the desire to help people. And this lady has proved me wrong time and time again. Her love, her can-do attitude, her sweet spirit, she has been a rock for me, for my staff, and for all the people of the Third Congressional District. 
   Mrs. Elestine, I hope you're watching tonight. We love you. I love you. We will miss you greatly. Godspeed.

   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   This past week for the first time, some Americans paid $4 a gallon for gas. The national average for regular unleaded gasoline now is $3.61 a gallon. Americans have never paid such a tremendous amount of their hard-earned dollars on gasoline, Mr. Speaker, and the high gasoline prices are taking a toll on their pocketbooks. 
   Many issues are responsible for the higher gas prices, but in order to lessen America's dependency on foreign and unstable energy sources, we need to be looking right here at home. We're relying too much on foreign energy sources and our dependency on these sources is a risk for our national security. We have natural and technological resources to support domestic production and find oil sources here at home. We can increase our domestic energy exploration and production in the U.S. while also utilizing alternative energy sources such as hydrogen, wind and solar power. 
   Citizens can't afford the price of gas. For our people, for our country, the majority must bring an energy solution to the floor now so that American families are no longer paying an unprecedented $4 a gallon for gas.

   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the American public asked Congress to change their spending habits and to be more responsible with the people's money. Last fall, the majority party promised Americans greater fiscal responsibility and more spending restraint. I believe Congress needs to deliver a responsible Federal budget worthy of approval of the American public. 
   Unfortunately, the majority has only introduced legislation that has promised the largest tax increase in history, runaway entitlement spending, and an out-of-control appropriations process. 
   If Congress as a whole does not pledge to change, the American public will continue to be let down by the actions of the majority party. 
   The Republicans are not going to let them down, Mr. Speaker. I understand the immediate need for spending restraint and the Republicans will continue to oppose excessive spending by the majority party. Therefore, I will vote against H.R. 2643, the Interior and Environment appropriations bill, later today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Republican substitute. And there is a clear difference between the two proposals on the table. 
   The key to managing, and budgeting, is to set priorities. Everybody knows that that has had a family or run a business. You have to do this. You have to make tough choices, and you can't have everything you want when you want it. 
   But the Democrats have refused to set priorities, Mr. Chairman. They simply want to spend more on everything and everyone within the reach of the Federal Government. And to pay for all this new spending, well, they simply want to raise taxes, this time by $683 billion, the largest tax increase in American history. 
   If you want me to bring it home in South Carolina terms so all my folks in South Carolina can understand it, this is a $2,500 tax increase for the average South Carolina home, $2,500. 
   The Republican substitute achieves a balance by 2012 without raising taxes. Also, this substitute attempts to repeal another looming tax increase by completely repealing the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, by 2013. 
   Our country's on the verge of a financial crisis, Mr. Chairman. The total unfunded entitlement liability, Medicare and Social Security, this country faces is $53 trillion. Former Comptroller General David Walker said, ``You are not going to tax your way out of this problem. You are not going to grow your way out of this problem. You are not going to do it by constraining spending. You are going to have to do it by a combination of things, and the biggest thing you are going to have to do is entitlement reform, Social Security and Medicare being the greater challenge. And we need to start soon because time's working against us. That $53 trillion number is going up between 2 and $3 trillion a year by doing nothing.'' 
   The Republican substitute reduces the $53 trillion unfunded liability by $11 trillion. It makes an attempt to secure the future existence and benefits of major entitlement programs, especially Medicare and Medicaid, which are currently on an unsustainable path to spending. 
   Mr. Chairman, therefore, I not only firmly support this Republican substitute but insist on it so we don't raise taxes any higher on the American citizens.

   Madam Speaker, we need to complete an overhaul of the tax-and-spend system in Washington. For taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money, the key is to tighten government spending overall now. Next, we need to implement a tax system to revive and stimulate the economy for the long term. This involves offering permanent tax relief for married couples, families with children, small businesses, and putting an end to the death tax. 
   Reforming the tax system through tax relief will boost the economy, increase revenues, and promote job growth.

   Mr. Speaker, solicitors and district attorneys are the unsung heroes in the fight to keep our streets, and our homeland safe. They go to work every day fighting for justice and in doing so, protect each and every one of us. These brave men and women are on the ground every day working with law enforcement on how best to enforce our laws, and implement justice, and for that, we owe them a debt of gratitude. 
   It is vital for the operation of our justice system, and the protection of citizens across this Nation, that our district attorneys be well trained and highly educated. That is why, in 1950, the National District Attorneys Association, the NDAA, was formed. Today, this group is the oldest and largest professional organization representing criminal prosecutors in the world. 
   In pursuit of its mission to equip State and local prosecutors to best do their jobs, the NDAA operates the National Advocacy Center on the campus of the University of South Carolina in Columbia. In this one of a kind center, the training of State and local prosecutors has been centralized in a single location. Offering classes such as ``Boot camp: An Introduction to Prosecution'' and ``Childproof: Advanced Trial Advocacy for Child Abuse Prosecutors,'' this center delivers unmatched education and training to prosecutors from all across our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, because it is in everyone's best interest to have the best trained legal minds prosecuting criminals, and by doing so, keeping us safe, the National Advocacy Center deserves our full support. And the solicitors, prosecutors, and district attorneys across our Nation deserve our thanks. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   When FISA passed 30 years ago, technology didn't include devices used now on an everyday basis. Just think, 10 years ago hardly anybody even owned a cell phone. The Director of National Intelligence testified before the House Judiciary Committee that if the government required FISA court orders for surveillance overseas, approximately 66 percent of the information normally collected would be lost. 
   Therefore, Congress should have its duty to update the tools used by our intelligence officials so that they have the ability to gather all the essential information to prevent future attacks. FISA needs to be modernized.

   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, our friends on the other side have complained that I guess we Republicans don't know what fiscal mismanagement is. What does it mean? I guess our Democrats, by their actions this year, especially looking at this budget, I think that fiscal mismanagement means that we are not spending enough. Apparently, if the Republicans had spent more money on everything, including everything in this budget, everything would be perfect, but we certainly know that is not the case. The Democrats seem to think that the IRS tax collectors just need to bring in more money. 
   But let me tell you exactly what has happened. Collections over the past year are up $2.5 trillion. That figure keeps going up every year. We are collecting more tax revenue, as a share of the economy, more than the average over the past 40 years. 
   So I guess they are telling me it is not enough. According to the Democrats, there is still too much uncollected tax revenue out there. So their budget, like the budget in the Senate that was produced last week, calls for the IRS to make up the difference trying to close this magical tax gap. I am sure somebody will tell me exactly what this magical tax gap is some time tonight. 
   In short, this Democrat budget has found that the Federal Government budget is almost perfect. I guess all we need to do is spend more money. Clearly, my colleagues and I have a different approach. Number 1, we think prosperity and economic growth mainly comes from economic investors and workers, not the Federal Government. We think creative ideas, the ones that lead to progress and higher standards of living come from thinking outside the box, not inside the box, because that is government. 
   I guess last of all, we believe, as President Reagan said in his first inaugural address, we are a Nation that has a government, not the other way around. We believe these things, because we believe the government should limit its taxing and spending, ease the burden on the economy, and let it grow. 
   Judging by this budget, the Democrats, they don't see that. They think government should call the shots and keep widening its control. 
   For that reason, this budget trusts the government more than the people that are paying the tax bills. We believe this budget is fundamentally a failure. 
   If you want to bring it home, in South Carolina terms, so I can let the folks in South Carolina know, this is about a $2,500 tax increase for my average South Carolinan home, $2,500. We believe in freedom. With freedom comes less government, and that is a good thing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I hope the chairman of the Armed Services Committee knows how much I respect him and truly love this man. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know of no other place than Washington, DC, where it's okay to look a man in the face, tell him we're going to give him the time, the resources and everything he needs to accomplish a mission, and then halfway through the process, say, oops, I'm sorry, time's up. We made a mistake. Mission over. 
   No one person I know or have known executing this war on radical Islam has more credibility than David Petraeus, a gentleman who was confirmed unanimously in the United States Senate, but instead of giving GEN David Petraeus, a man whose boots are on the ground, a fair opportunity and allowing him the time he needs to better implement the plan and report back, we once again see legislators trying to micromanage this war. The problem is, we've turned this into a political war, a war where politicians are pulling the strings, not the man we said could do it. 
   If anyone can pull this off, David Petraeus can. If any armed services in the world can be successful, the men and women of the United States Armed Forces can. But let them accomplish the mission. Let them continue to win. Let them bring us victory. 
   In recent weeks, we've witnessed in Great Britain how real the threat remains. Whether we're talking about Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, the enemy is there, the enemy is real; and to ignore the threat that they pose to this Nation is unconscionable. 
   We owe it to our troops on the ground, to those who have served, to those who have died, and the American people to allow the plan General Petraeus developed to take effect. 
   Mr. Speaker, the stakes are too high. Keep this country safe. Keep this country strong. Do the courageous thing. Vote against this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, sometimes, like many of my colleagues, I get frustrated about the pace of Congress. For the last several weeks, I have come to the floor almost every day to talk about energy problems and why Congress doesn't seem to want to do anything to fix the problem. That is why I am amazed all of a sudden that Congress seems to be moving at warp speed to pass an ill-advised bill that could cost taxpayers billions of dollars and change the very nature of our financial system. 
   First, let me say that I appreciate the intentions of this bill, Mr. Speaker. I believe the government should take targeted steps to help those facing foreclosure in those neighborhoods that have had problems with the negative effects of multiple foreclosures. But we should not legislate in a rush, and we should not use a potential crisis as an excuse to expand the size of government in an unprecedented manner. 
   Please understand that I agree we cannot allow Fannie and Freddie to fail, and we must closely monitor the health of the banking system. Still, decisions of this magnitude should be considered calmly, rationally, and independently. Let's not mortgage the future of our country without fully understanding all the implications. 
   Timing is not the only problem with this legislation. As I said before, I fear we will be feeling the lingering effects of this legislation for many years. In one part of this bill, we are creating a new FHA program that will distort housing prices by neglecting the realities of supply and demand in the housing market, all while putting taxpayers on the hook for this expensive, and I think dangerous, experiment. Like many of my colleagues, I don't think we should allow the American taxpayers to become the insurance policy for financial decisions that did not quite turn out as planned. 
   There are other parts of the bill that do not make much sense at first glance. For example, the new affordable housing trust fund is funded by the income of Fannie and Freddie. At the same time that we are trying to stabilize them elsewhere in the bill, we are adding new burdens and raising their costs. While I appreciate the importance of affordable housing, I don't think this makes much financial sense. 
   Like much of what Congress has been doing this year, this affordable housing trust fund is taxing what we are trying to help. We are trying to help people buy and keep their homes, yet we are discussing raising taxes. Rather than increasing the size of government, perhaps we should be putting more money into the pockets of hardworking Americans so they can afford to keep their homes. 
   While we certainly should be ensuring that the GSEs are stable, I am concerned about the long-term effects that this bill will have on the health of the housing market, the Federal balance sheet, and the American economy. Because I do not think this legislation will provide helpful solutions to our housing market, I oppose this bill and ask my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. (WINNING IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker updated members of the House Armed Services Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee regarding the conditions on the ground in Iraq. Noting successes on the military and political fronts, both indicated reasons to be optimistic about the progress being made. 
   Having recently visited Iraq, I am not surprised to hear about these successes. Violence is down and reconciliation is happening. But the progress is fragile, a sentiment echoed by both Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus. 
   During the hearing, many of my Democrat colleagues asked about the cost of the war. Is it expensive? Yes, the cost is expensive. My question to them is, what will be the cost of defeat, and are you willing to pay for it?
