<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, my chairman of the Budget Committee just spoke, and, yes, he did read that the CBO said that the bill that passed on the doc fix, according to the CBO, does satisfy the trigger. 
   So if you are satisfying the trigger, then why are you turning it off? If you are actually accomplishing the objective set out with this law, then why are you getting rid of this trigger? Why do we have this trigger? 
   We have this trigger. It's a funding warning because Medicare is going bankrupt. Medicare is a $36 trillion unfunded liability. You know what it's going to be next year by this time? It's going to be $38.4 trillion. Do you know what will happen in 5 years if we do nothing to save Medicare as the Democratic budget proposes to do? $48 trillion unfunded liability. 
   The preceding paragraph in this CBO report goes on to specify that the judgment, the referee of the trigger, are the trustees. So why don't we take this bill off the floor, have the trustees verify what CBO says that maybe, in fact, this bill that you just passed, that we all passed, does satisfy the trigger, and don't turn off this funding warning. Turning off this funding warning is basically saying, ignore the fact that Medicare is going bankrupt. Make sure that Congress does nothing to fix this problem. 
   I might add that this CBO estimate relies on the fact that next year we are going to cut doctors by 21 percent in Medicare. The only reason this estimate holds up is if we guarantee a 21 percent payment cut to all doctors servicing Medicare. That's why we are in conformity with this trigger as CBO says. 
   CBO is not the referee of this. The trustees are, the trustees of Medicare. 
   Turning off this trigger is basically saying that we have no fiscal discipline, we have no intention of saving Medicare from bankruptcy, we have no intention of being good stewards of the taxpayer dollars, we have no intention of controlling spending.     
   We have every intention of making matters worse, not only by doing nothing, but adding more spending. That is reckless. That is fiscal abandonment.  
   The trigger was a bipartisan idea. A Democrat in the Senate and a Republican in the House came up with this idea to make sure that Congress saw fair warning and actually addressed these issues before it got out of control. 
   And so, instead of addressing these warnings, instead of bringing Medicare toward solvency, instead of making sure we can guarantee this program for seniors in the next generation, what are we doing in this Congress? We are sticking our heads in the sand. That is wrong. This shouldn't pass. You know better. 
   More to the point, if you think you are satisfying it, then why are you turning it off? That makes no sense. 
   The only opportunity, the only explanation is you don't want to have this tool of fiscal discipline. You don't want the American people knowing that you are actually contributing to the insolvency of Medicare, that you are actually making matters worse. That is wrong, and I urge defeat of this.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this. My friend from North Dakota said in the debate a minute ago that the minority doesn't want the government to help business. That was kind of an odd characterization. Here's what the minority wants: We want Congress to keep its word. And what do I mean when I say that? In the beginning of this Congress, Congress said that they were going to pay for things as they go. We were going to have this vaunted PAYGO rule that when we commit new spending, we will pay for it. We won't do deficit spending. What does this bill do? This bill thumbs its nose at the PAYGO system. 
   I think the best description of how this bill is not paid for was written in Congress Daily this morning, and I quote: ``The House will take up legislation today to renew the Federal Government's Terrorism Risk Insurance Program despite concerns that it violates PAYGO rules. CBO has ruled that the bill, which would reauthorize and expand the program for 15 years and cost the Federal government $3.7 billion over 5 years, $10.4 billion over a 10-year period. House leaders pulled the bill last week because it carried no offsets, but Democratic leaders found a way around the problem by requiring that if an attack occurred, Congress would have to vote again in a fast-track procedure to release the funds contained in the bill.'' Well, to do it justice, it's about $8.4 billion net cost, just to set the record straight for the minority. 
   What they're basically doing here is they're declaring this an emergency when an emergency hasn't even occurred yet. They're basically declaring this emergency spending, outside of the budget rules, not paid for, $8.4 billion, before an emergency has even occurred. 
   I've seen gimmicks in my day, Mr. Chairman, but this one takes the cake. This violates PAYGO. If it doesn't do it technically, it sure does it in spirit. So if we're going to say we're going to pay for legislation, then, by golly, let's pay for legislation. This doesn't do that. Not to mention the fact that this crowds out the private sector. Not to mention the fact that this tells all the insurers, go ahead and release this insurance, and if a terrorist attack occurs, we'll have some emergency legislation that pays for it after the fact. It's kind of like telling the homeowner, you don't have to pay premiums on your insurance until after your house has been burnt down, then pay your premiums and then we'll give you your payback. It doesn't work like that. That's not how insurance works. That's not how taxpayers pay their bills. That's not how Congress should operate. And, more importantly, that is not the rules that this Congress said it would operate under. 
   This violates those rules. If not technically, it sure does so in spirit. And I think when Congress says it's a new day, that we're going to pay for our spending, by golly, that's exactly what Congress ought to do, and that is not what this Congress is doing.     
   For this and many other reasons, Mr. Chairman, this legislation is flawed. It should be defeated. It encourages a crowding out of the private sector. And more importantly, it doesn't pay for the promises that are being committed here today. That is wrong. That violates the rhetoric and the principles that the majority has set out for itself. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about one particular provision in this bill which really puzzles me, and that is the tax earmark that's in this bill. This bill creates forestry conservation tax credit bonds. Sounds pretty innocent on its face. But reading through the language, the provision has little to do with forestry, and didn't appear to require the protection of a single tree. Rather, it's nominally about protecting fish. 
   Specifically, to qualify for the tax credit bond program, the parcel of land to be purchased must be adjacent to the Forest Service land; have a portion of that land turned over to the U.S. Forest Service; include at least 40,000 total acres, and must be subject to a ``native fish habitat conservation plan approved by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.'' 
   Well, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service, there is only one piece of land in America that meets this description. It's a piece of land in Montana owned by a timber giant, Plum Creek. And according to press reports, they intend to sell it to the Nature Conservancy, which can get the $500 million in bonds, who could give that $500 million, buy it from Plum Creek, turn around and sell it to landowners, for all we know. If this isn't a tax earmark, I don't know what is. 
   But the point is, this is a tax earmark. And why is it possible to add this provision which is a tax earmark? 
   Well, the anti-earmark rules that we have here in the House only apply to conference reports and bills. 
   What are we considering today? Technically, it's an amendment to the Senate bill which was an amendment to the original House-passed bill. So the earmark rules we have are thrown out the window. No earmark rules apply here. That's how you can sneak this provision in, a $500 million tax earmark provision to go to one private landowner. 
   Again, we can't be exactly sure what the deal here is because the bill just got released. We don't know who asked for this provision or exactly how it will be used, but at the very least, serious questions ought to be raised about such an expensive provision dropped into this bill to benefit one particular landowner. 
   In addition to that, this bill may not technically violate PAYGO, but it sure does violate the spirit of PAYGO. It uses timing shifts and other budget gimmicks to violate PAYGO. For this and many other reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I would like to discuss this title IV part of the package. And I learned, when we were in the majority, watching the minority speak and criticize virtually every move we made, I thought it would be wrong if you thought there were good elements of a package to criticize it. There are good elements in this package, and I want to start off by talking about those good elements that are contained in this package before I start my criticism. 
   First, the earmark reforms. I am an earmark reformer. I was one of the parts of the team that reformed earmarks, that negotiated the earmark reforms we passed last fall. I think these earmark reforms in this package that the majority created are very good. They are very commendable. They work. So I want to compliment the majority for their serious earmark reform package that they have in here.  
   I think it is high time that when a Member of Congress requests an earmark, that that Member's name be associated with that earmark, that that Member's justification be associated with the earmark, and that we, as Members of this body, have the opportunity to vote on whether or not that earmark should be funded or not. We need more transparency and more accountability in the way we spend taxpayer dollars. 
   I am very pleased that in the last Congress, in the 109th Congress, we in the House passed those rules, and I am very excited that the majority has decided to continue those rules and build on that success by improving the package of earmark reforms we passed in the last Congress. So that part of this package, I want to compliment the gentleman from South Carolina and the others who put this together. 
   I want to direct my comments on the PAYGO part of this. I had high hopes for this part of the package. I had high hopes that the PAYGO rules that we are about to vote on would provide much needed fiscal discipline to Washington and to the way we spend taxpayer dollars. Unfortunately, this package just doesn't cut the mustard. I see this as a timid, weak, watered down, paper tiger PAYGO. What I mean when I say that, Mr. Speaker, is I believe this will have the practical effect of simply raising taxes. 
   Let me be very clear, Mr. Speaker. We don't have a tax revenue problem in Washington. We have a spending problem in Washington. Tax revenues have been coming into the Federal Treasury at double digit rates over the last 2 years. That is not the problem. We are getting plenty of money from workers' paychecks, from families in their taxes. It is leaving the Treasury too fast. That is our problem, and that is where the budget discipline ought to be placed, on spending. 
   The problem with this PAYGO is it will have the practical effect of simply having higher taxes to chase higher spending. It does absolutely nothing to address the deficit we have today. It does absolutely nothing to address today's level of spending. It does not address the uncontrollable and unsustainable rates of spending that we have with our entitlement programs today. 
   Now, I realize that the last majority wasn't perfect on spending. I will be the first to note that because many people saw me coming to the floor saying that in the last Congress. But when we enact spending discipline, and when we are telling the American people that we are now going to get tough on spending, we are going to be fiscally conservative, that is what we should do; and this does not do that. 
   More importantly, Mr. Speaker, I believe that this PAYGO regime, if it does actually work, will make it clear that the tax relief of 2001 and 2003, which got us out of a recession, which brought new revenues into the Federal Government, which created seven million new jobs, will go away. This is putting the American taxpayer on a collision course with higher taxes. And why is it doing that? Because this system, this PAYGO system, will make the pressure toward raising taxes to pay for new entitlement spending. And so for that reason, I am opposed to this PAYGO regime, Mr. Speaker. There are many others I would like to speak about. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   First of all, I want to start off by saying I appreciate the gentleman from South Carolina. He is a good man, knows his stuff, and I very much look forward to working with him. I just want to respond to a couple of points. 
   In fact, we attempted to put PAYGO in place, PAYGO on spending. So if you try to increase spending somewhere else, you should cut spending elsewhere and not raise taxes. That went down in 2004, largely because of the minority opposing it. 
   Second point. The reason PAYGO worked well in the 1990s is because it was statutory. If you did not comply, an across-the-board sequestration would take place, and the threat of that was one of the reasons why PAYGO was successful. 
   The third point I simply want to make is, you are going to hear a lot of talk about we had a surplus, we handed it to the Republicans and they squandered it. What was the surplus? The surplus was projected. It was projected. And in those economic projections they did not foresee the Enron scandals, they did not foresee the dot-com bubble bursting, and they did not foresee 9/11. Of course, they did not foresee that. They did not see the perfect storm of economic calamity, and that is what evaporated the surplus. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert).

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   First off, I want to start off by congratulating the majority on the very commendable earmark reform legislation that is contained in this title. I just want to emphasize that. But this PAYGO package is woefully inadequate. It is a paper tiger. 
   Three quick points. Number one, this protects all current spending, even the programs that are scheduled to expire. However, it assumes that expiring tax relief will lapse; and, thus, require offsets to continue. This is a double standard that reflects their preference, protect higher spending but not lower taxes. It is a recipe for tax increases. 
   Number two, it contains a huge loophole. Spend now, save later. You can enact new spending now and come up with savings down the road, which we know never really happens. Big loophole. 
   Number three, this is a weaker version of PAYGO than what the majority was proposing just last year. They were not allowing points of order to be waived when you violated a PAYGO rule in their earlier version. But now when they are in the majority, you can simply waive it with a majority vote upstairs in the Rules Committee. 
   This is a much weaker version of PAYGO. But I want to address a few other things. 
   Number one, you are going to hear this all year: They gave us a surplus. We inherited a surplus; we squandered the surplus. 
   Madam Speaker, what was the surplus? The surplus was a projection. It was a projection by economists at OMB and CBO that said we are going to have all of this money coming in. 
   You know what they didn't project, they didn't project 9/11. They didn't project war. They didn't project the dot-com bubble bursting or the recession or the Enron scandals. What did that do? It was a fiscal train wreck for America, and our numbers went down and we had to spend more money when we went to Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   Where are we today? The budget deficit went down 40 percent. In 1 year, the budget deficit went down 40 percent off projections. Why, Madam Speaker? It went down that much because revenues increased. Why did revenues increase, because we let the American people keep more of their own hard-earned dollars. They were able to keep more of their tax dollars. 
   There is a very deep difference between our two parties on principle and on philosophy. We believe that the money in America in the Federal Government is the people's money. That the money we spend is not our money, it is the money of our constituents. It is their money. 
   When you see rules like this, which I want to quote from the Wall Street Journal: PAYGO, by contrast, gives the appearance of spending discipline while making it all but impossible to let taxpayers keep more of their own money. It should really be called spend and tax as you go. 
   This bill does nothing to control current spending. It does nothing to reduce the current deficit, and it puts us on a path to raise taxes. 
   We believe the priorities ought to be different: That we ought to control spending and reduce spending to balance the budget, not raise taxes because after all, the money that comes to the Federal Government is not our money. It is the people's money. It comes from the paychecks of working Americans, men and women, small businesses, farmers and businesses. By letting people keep more of their own hard-earned dollar, our economy grows, revenues grow. We have to watch spending. That is where the priorities ought to be placed. This does not deliver that. 
   Hopefully we can work together in the future to have a real spending  mechanism that actually controls spending rather than puts us on a pathway to higher taxes. 
   Madam Speaker, I reluctantly oppose this legislation because of the honorable earmark reforms. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, a couple of things: number one, we are not dedicating enough time to this debate. A half-hour is not enough time to debate what this is really all about. This is not just about health care, health insurance for low-income children. If that is all this was about, then we could pass this with 2 minutes of debate, unanimous consent, voice vote, everyone would agree. 
   That is not what this debate is about. This debate goes far beyond that, and the American people deserve to have a much more honest, much more thorough debate about what really is being discussed here. 
   This is a misleading bill. This is a misleading debate. This is misleading, number one, because this is really all about whether or not the Federal Government should run health care for most Americans or not. 
   All of us in this room, Republicans and Democrats, believe that Americans ought to have access to affordable health insurance. All Americans. We all believe that. The question is, should the government run it, or should health care be a decision between patients and their doctors? Let's have a debate about that. 
   The reason this is a misleading debate is because this bill takes more health insurance away from children with private insurance than it gives to children without insurance. We are taking more people off of private insurance than we are giving to uninsured children. If we wanted to just give uninsured children health insurance, let's do it. 
   This bill is misleading because it gives children health insurance for 5 years, and then it pushes them off a cliff. I call it the majority's ``bait and switch SCHIP funding.'' It says 5 million children get it now; 5 million children 6 months into 2012 get nothing. $41 billion is hidden out of this bill. Who believes that that is going to happen? In order to contort their way into their PAYGO rule, they are giving on the one hand and taking out with the other. 
   But what this debate is really about is putting the government in the middle of that decision between the patient and their doctor. I don't want a bureaucrat running health care. I don't want an HMO bureaucrat running health care, and I don't want a government bureaucrat running health care. I want patients running health care with their doctors. 
   That is what this debate is really about. This debate is about getting more and more and more government in the middle of the health care decisions between patients and their doctors. This is a debate about getting us on that path toward government-run health care. That is a big debate. It deserves more than a half-hour of debate. 
   And, unfortunately, the majority is misleading the American people by saying this is only about low-income children, when they are bringing us a bill that displaces kids off of private health insurance, goes to virtually to anybody of any income if a State wants to, and goes way beyond the idea of insuring low-income children. 
   Let's give low-income children health insurance, and let's have a big debate on whether the government ought to be running health care in America or not.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today in strong opposition to this emergency supplemental spending bill that not only would bust the budget with billions in nonemergency spending, but it would also raise taxes on small business. I can't think of a worse time to implement a tax increase, with a weak economy that is struggling to create and grow jobs. 
   Republicans will not support this bill. The President will veto this bill. Yet the Democratic leadership brings it to the floor and continues to play politics with funding for our troops. 
   The President's request, submitted 15 months ago, was for $108 billion. The Democrats, once again, can't help themselves. And they have added an additional $6.6 billion of this. And to add insult to injury to the American taxpayer and our troops in harm's way, this amount actually reduces the President's request by $3.5 billion. 
   I guess that's what you get when a bill is written unilaterally and in secret. 
   If the majority brought us a clean supplemental with just funding for the troops, it would undoubtedly have been passed with a big bipartisan vote and sent to the President before Memorial Day so there is no disruption in funding. That should be what we're doing, and not playing politics with funding for our troops. 
   That is what a majority would do if they were serious about passing a bill and not playing politics. 
   But that is not what the Democrat majority has done here. Instead, 15 months after the President asked for the troop funding, the majority has brought a bloated bill to the floor that will cost the American taxpayer $250 billion over the next decade. 
   This is a bill they wrote in secret, without allowing committee markups, while only allowing Members 18 hours to review a bill that would provide an amount equivalent to 26 percent of the spending in last year's regular appropriation bills, and without allowing the full House to work its will in an open and Democratic process. 
   It violates the budget passed by the majority by adding $6.6 billion to the amounts assumed for the war supplemental for the House-passed budget resolution. And the Democratic leadership has decided to lard this bill up with $66 billion in mandatory spending. 
   While they raise taxes to pay for the GI benefits, this bill adds billions in funding that has nothing to do with the war and is not fully offset. 
   So they say they are meeting the PAYGO rules. But they don't meet it for all the other spending in this bill. Mandatory spending does not belong in war emergency supplementals. The mandatory provisions in question deserve serious debate as stand-alone bills. 
   Why are they hiding this in a war supplemental? They should be proud of these provisions and let them withstand the full light of day through the regular committee process. And if increasing spending by over $66 billion wasn't enough, they are proposing to raise taxes on Americans as well, to tax and spend rather than paying for this increase with reductions in other spending. 
   The last thing we ought to be doing today is raise taxes. They will say this is a tax on millionaires. But this tax is going to hit small businesses. These are the job creators in America. This is the worst thing we can do as this economy is struggling. 
   Yesterday the House waived the PAYGO rule to give farm subsidies to millionaires.

   Mr. Speaker, there is undeniably net direct spending included in this bill. Hence it increases the deficit. Simply by putting new entitlement spending on an appropriation bill in order to evade PAYGO would constitute a blatant loophole in the PAYGO point of order. If PAYGO is designed to prevent increases in the deficit, this measure should not be considered here today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor to oppose the bill not on the merits of the FOIA policy, but on the grounds that this bill had a budget section 303 point of order against it and that it violated the new PAYGO rules we have before us. 
   This bill that we just now got 10 minutes ago, as we read it, we believe does not violate section 303 of the Budget Act or the PAYGO rules. But I think the point I would like to make is this: 10 minutes ago this bill did have a section 303 violation against it; 10 minutes ago this bill did violate the majority's own PAYGO rules they put in place less than 10 months ago. And it scores not just a $7 million, but a $63 million increase over 10 years. So $63 million over 10 years is a lot of money. And given the fact that this new amended bill, as it appears as we read it, does have the required language, subject to appropriations, that it is not out of order, it doesn't waive the PAYGO rules because it does pay for itself subject to appropriations. 
   I will withhold my objection, but I simply want to say to the majority this place would run a lot better if, when we put bills on the calendar and bring them to the floor, that they comply with the rules that the majority themselves put in place just 2 months ago with respect to PAYGO and with respect to the Budget Act. I just think the whole place would work a lot better if we do that. Then we get on to debating the merits of this legislation. 
   I think FOIA is an important tool. It needs to work better. I think there is a lot of merit to that point. But let's make sure that as we take a look at our budget problems, and they are enormous, our budget problems, if we can't make sure that bills that spend $63 million over 10 years can't comply with the Budget Act, can't comply with PAYGO, who is to say that bills that spend $2.9 trillion like our Federal budget can comply with it? So if we  can't get the rules right on small bills, who is to say we are going to get the budget discipline rules right on the big bills? 
   Fiscal discipline starts one step at a time, starts one bill at a time. We have got to get fiscal discipline rules in place and right on small business, especially if this Congress is going to get our arms around our larger fiscal problems. 
   That is simply the point I want to make to the chairman.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (IN RECOGNITION OF JAMES T. BATES -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge an extraordinary staff member who has moved on after 20 years with the House Budget Committee, Jim Bates. 
   James T. Bates, the Committee's Republican chief of staff, recently accepted a position as associate program director at the Office of Management and Budget. Ordinarily, that would be a significant, though not surprising, step in a career dedicated to Washington fiscal policy. But there is nothing ordinary about this case. 
   Jim Bates's two decades of service represents the longest tenure of any Budget Committee staffer. He served in various capacities during this time, including those of minority counsel, chief majority counsel and deputy chief of staff before rising to the top slot in late 2004. In each of those roles he demonstrated a singular dedication. 
   He came to be known as a true believer in the value of congressional budgeting; a stickler for adhering to the budget disciplines written in law and in convention; and a thoroughly convinced proponent of the institution of the Budget Committee. He is as closely identified with the committee as is the Congressional Budget Act itself. It is nearly impossible to think of one without the other. 
   Mr. Speaker, you can't go back over the last 20 years and look at the enforcement of the Budget Committee, the preservation of the Budget Act, without thinking of Jim Bates. 
   Jim started with the committee in January of 1988, a time when the Republican minority offices were across Highway 395, on the second floor of the Ford Office Building, then simply called Annex Two. He worked initially as a budget analyst, covering Income and Social Security, but before long he found his real niche as committee counsel. Here, he mastered the intricate details and subtleties of the Budget Act; he vigorously protected the committee's jurisdiction, and, when possible, expanded it. He also developed a unique understanding of budget arcana, something I can clearly testify to, such as the Gramm-Rudman baseline or the pay-as-you-go rule. 
   Here are some highlights of his congressional career: he participated in the famous Andrews Air Force Base negotiations that produced the budget agreement of 1990. In 1993, he coordinated drafting the narrowly defeated Penny-Kasich amendment. In 1997, he anchored the legislative language for the Balanced Budget Act, which a year later produced the first budget surplus in nearly four decades. Shortly thereafter, he developed a bipartisan plan for the first comprehensive budget process reform since the Budget Act was created in 1974. 
   In 2005, he oversaw the staff work that led to that year's Deficit Reduction Act, the first in a long time. In 2006, he was immensely helpful to me in writing the Legislative Line Item Veto Act, designed to allow the President to strike individual spending items without violating Congress's constitutional prerogatives. 
   Jim is an avid fisherman, which shows a greatness of soul. He is a fan of the renowned author Ray Bradbury, which reflects a creative mind. He might misplace his car keys or his BlackBerry, but he has never lost his conviction about budgeting, or his integrity. Yet, of all Jim's qualities, perhaps the most important is the trust that he has earned from Members and colleagues alike. It is because of that trust that when I was chosen to be the Budget Committee's ranking Republican last December, my first and easiest decision was keeping Jim as the chief of staff. He was and still is simply irreplaceable. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me close simply by saying that there aren't a lot of people in this town who really understand how the Budget Committee works, how this budget process works, let alone people who really know the best ideas and ways of making it work better. Jim Bates is one of the handful of people in this town who knows this. You can count the people on one hand who really know the Budget Act, know how to make it work and know how to make it work better. Jim Bates is one of those. 
   This institution, this Congress, both from the Democrat side and the Republican side, owe a large debt of gratitude for the service of this fine servant, Jim Bates.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the motion we are offering today reflects a very simple up or down choice: One, rejecting the largest tax increase in our Nation's history, which is contained in the House budget; two, insisting on the lowest possible level of taxes available in the budget conference; and three, stopping the raid on Social Security's cash surpluses. 
   Both the House and the Senate Democrat budgets call for historic tax increases, and we in the minority can't do anything to prevent that. But we hope that, with this vote, we can at least minimize the damage that these tax hikes will bring. 
   Let me take a moment to describe the options that we have to work with as a minority. The House-passed budget would impose a tax hike of $392 billion from such things as reimposing  the tax penalty on married couples, cutting in half the child tax credit, and raising marginal income tax rates on low- and middle-income working families. 
   This would increase the average family's tax bill by roughly $2,900 a year and likely reverse the economic progress we have achieved over the past few years. So, right along with their higher tax bill, Americans would see fewer jobs and slower wage growth. 
   This massive tax increase was the only way the House Democrats could accomplish their massive increase in spending. Their budget makes no effort, none, to moderate the growth of spending. It simply requires taxpayers to send more of their money to make the Democrats' budget numbers add up. 
   In our debate a few weeks ago, the Democrats tried gamely to assert that their budget doesn't increase taxes after all. And as proof, they pointed to the novel policy language that claims that they will extend some of the tax relief provisions enacted in 2001 and 2003. They have these reserve funds that say they don't really want to raise taxes. But if you read the fine print, this would only happen later and only if they hike some other taxes by the same amount. So even with the flowery reserve fund language, the goal, the preference of not raising taxes can only be met if they raise taxes. 
   But the numbers in this budget tell a very different story. By the numbers, which is what a budget is all about, the House budget raises taxes nearly $400 billion, and numbers do not lie. 
   The other option is the Senate budget, which raises taxes by about $216 billion, the second largest tax increase in American history. This will include higher taxes on middle-income earners because the Senate budget still raises marginal income tax rates across the board. But at least it attempts to protect the marriage penalty relief, child tax credit and estate tax relief. 
   Unfortunately, the other Chamber, like their Democrat counterparts in the House, also call for large spending increases. And as a consequence, their budget will continue to raid the Social Security trust funds in fiscal year 2012, something the House-passed budget and the Republican substitute did not do. 
   So while the Democrat budget in the Senate didn't raise as many taxes, it did raid the Social Security trust fund, and the House Republican and the House Democrat budget resolution did not. 
   So, what we are simply trying to do is get the best of both products such that it can be had. Accordingly, our motion would simply direct the conferees to do two things: First, reject the House's $392 billion tax increase, again, the largest tax increase in American history, and keep their tax hike to the lowest possible level permitted under the rules. Second, insist on the lowest possible level of taxes between the House-passed and Senate-passed Democrat budgets. This language is included because the motion is required to stay within the scope of the two budgets. We wish we could do more, but this is the scope we have been dealt. Third, it would direct the conferees to stop raiding Social Security for the government's operating budget. They should do this by running a unified surplus, including Social Security, of $96 billion in fiscal year 2012, which is equal to the Social Security cash surplus for that year. 
   We know that this is possible because we proved it could be done in our own budget. Our Republican budget not only balanced the budget without raising anyone's taxes, we ran a surplus that ensured the Social Security trust funds would not be raided. 
   So, again, today we are simply asking our Democratic colleagues to do the following: one, reject the largest tax increase in American history; and two, stop the raid of the Social Security cash surplus. 
   This is a simple choice. A ``yes'' vote supports these objectives. A ``no'' vote rejects them. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

So the Republican budget substitute accommodated all of these tax cuts and stopped the raid on Social Security.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   I say to my articulate friend from New Jersey, I think what he mentioned was a real good highlight on the philosophical differences between our two parties. The question is, who is first in line, the taxpayer or the government? We believe that the taxpayer ought to be first in line by keeping more of their hard-earned money, not the government. The State of New Jersey, which is a high tax-paying State, on average under these tax increases will pay an average of $3,780 more under Democrat-passed budget per taxpayer in the State of New Jersey. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, the $96 billion unified surplus reflects the cash surplus, meaning the amount of overpayments on FICA taxes, payroll taxes for Social Security, that gets spent on other government programs that ought to go to Social Security. The interest on top of that is the number that the gentleman from South Carolina is talking about. That reflects past borrowing, past raiding of the Social Security surplus. We would like to fix that, too. 
   We think that is a good start. Let's say from now on if you pay FICA taxes to Social Security, let's not spend it on all these other government programs. So the cash surplus that occurs in 2012, that is what we are talking about with that $96 billion, not the interest on top that reflects all of the past borrowing and raiding of the Social Security trust fund.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes to make a couple of comments before I yield to the gentleman from Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think I made the point on the Social Security cash surplus. We are talking about how much overpayments people pay in their payroll taxes in any given year. We don't want to keep spending that on other government programs. That is point number one. 
   Point number two: The very fact that the gentleman from South Carolina is suggesting that they are going to accept this motion to instruct, that they are going to accept this, means they agree there are tax increases in this budget. 
   They are saying right now, I just heard him say it, we don't want to raise taxes on the middle-class. We don't want to get rid of the child tax credit. We don't want to bring back the marriage penalty. We don't want to do away with the 10 percent bracket. So we will accept this motion to instruct. I.e., the other tax increases in this budget are just that, tax increases. Death tax, the marginal income tax rates across-the-board, capital gains, dividends. 
   Let me just make the point more clearly, by not quoting a think tank that may be left of center, right of center, whatever of center. Let me quote the Washington Post, clearly no paragon of right-wing thinking. 
   The Washington Post, right after the Democrat budget came out: ``And while House Democrats say they want to preserve key parts of Bush's signature tax cuts, they project a surplus in 2012 only by assuming that all of these tax cuts expire on schedule in 2010.'' 
   They further go on to say about the Democratic budget plan, ``The budget plan expresses support for certain cuts, including the extended child tax credit, elimination of the marriage penalty, and the 10 percent bracket, that would require another reserve fund to be filled with hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases to cover the cost.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished member of the House Budget Committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway).

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   One additional point I wanted to make, Mr. Speaker, is the point about PAYGO that the gentleman from South Carolina mentioned. As it is well known, we have a problem with their version of PAYGO. When PAYGO is designed to raise taxes, we don't like it. When PAYGO is designed to control spending, we like it. That is why we are for PAYGO on spending, not on raising taxes. 
   But if this amendment is accepted, if this motion to instruct is accepted, let's just be very clear, it does violate their PAYGO. Because the Baucus amendment, which is what we are referring to, which is the amendment that passed in the Senate, uses their surpluses, quote-unquote, to pay for these tax cuts. PAYGO says if you are going to reduce taxes, you have to offset them with either a tax increase or a spending cut, not with surpluses. 
   So this amendment, we believe if you are going to have a surplus, it should either go back to the Social Security trust fund and pay down debt, or reduce taxes. That is what we are proposing. 
   But just so we are very clear with ourselves here, this Baucus amendment, this acceptance of this policy of not raising all of these taxes, just some of them, which is the best choice we have between the two options as the minority, does violate their own PAYGO rule by dedicating their surpluses towards this tax relief, rather than having offsets, either coming from spending cuts or tax increases.

   The point we are making is, if we want to stop raising taxes and raiding Social Security, we are going to have to control spending. That is what we propose to do; and sadly, that is not what the majority budget does.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me concur that the resolution does say what the chairman says it does. The reason it points to the words in the House budget resolution, which say that the policy of the House is to keep these tax cuts, but we refer to the deeds of the Senate is because the House didn't pay for those tax cuts, didn't extend those tax cuts. The Senate extended those tax cuts. 
   The House used the words that said, we hope, we wish, we would like to extend these tax cuts, but they didn't do that. They raised the taxes. It is the Senate. 
   The mere fact that the Senate passed the Baucus amendment in the first place is a repudiation of the claim by the House that they are actually not raising taxes. 
   The Senate looked at the House budget resolution and said, you know what, this thing is the largest tax increase in American history. We don't want to raise taxes on middle-income earners, child tax credit, marriage penalty, 10 percent bracket; and therefore, they passed the Baucus amendment. 
   What we are saying is we wish we could extend all of the tax cuts. Since the scope is limited, we are saying, let's stick with the Senate and actually put numbers where the words are in the House by actually lowering the revenue number. 
   Now, the chairman is right. He is saying it is a reach to reach these surpluses. It is too tough to do it to reach these surpluses if you accept his premise. And the premise of the chairman's budget is do nothing to control spending. 
   Mr. Speaker, we don't have a revenue problem in Washington. Just the last 7 months alone we had 11 percent revenue growth. That is 3 straight years of double-digit revenue growth at these lower tax rates. We have plenty of money coming in from taxpayers. The problem is we are spending it too fast. That is the problem in Washington, not a revenue problem, a spending problem. 
   If you accept the premise of the chairman, the esteemed gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt), that there is no spending problem in Washington, which I don't accept, then he is correct, you can't balance the budget. You can't stopped the raid on Social Security and you can't extend tax relief.     
   We disagree. How tough is it to do it? Let me tell you what our budget accomplished, the Republican substitute. We simply said in order to stop the raid of the Social Security surplus and make all these tax cuts permanent, spend $14.977 trillion over the next 7 years instead of the current projection, $15.286 trillion. That is what we are saying. We are saying instead of spending over the next 5 years $15.286 trillion, spend $14.977 trillion. Instead of growing mandatory spending by 5.2 percent, grow it at 4.3 percent. 
   Is this Draconian, is this crazy, is this hard core? No. It's what families do around a kitchen table every day.  We are simply saying put taxpayers first. Don't make people wait for 3 years to see if they're going to have their per-child tax credit, if they're going to have the marriage penalty, if the estate taxes are going to be higher, lower or somewhere in between. Tell them now. Let's tell taxpayers, first you get to keep your money; then we're going to tighten our belt here in Washington by controlling spending. 
   Mr. Speaker, the taxpayers deserve this respect. They don't deserve to be jerked around. We should control spending, and by golly, we need to prepare for the retirement of these baby boomers. We need to reform these entitlement programs so we can extend their solvency, extend their reliability, and that is the biggest shame of all. 
   Not only does this budget have the largest tax increase in American history; it proposes that we do nothing for the next 5 years to control and reform entitlements to do anything to control spending. That's a shame. That's why we should pass this motion to instruct. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Chairman, today, the House will consider H.R. 3685, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007. In essence, the bill would expand the protections of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act that prohibit discrimination on the basis of color, religion, national origin and gender to include sexual orientation. As H.R. 3685 has undergone various iterations over the previous months, I have spent a considerable amount of time weighing the implications this legislation would have on our society as a whole. My gravest concerns lie with how religious institutions would be affected. The protections afforded to these groups by our country's founders have been upheld for centuries, and I would not support any legislation that would erode those freedoms. 
   H.R. 3685, however, provides explicit and concrete exemptions for religious institutions that are similar to the ones included in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Specifically, religious organizations, define as ``a religious corporation, association, or society; or a school, college, university, or other educational institution or institution,'' are exempted from complying with the requirements of this law. Effectively, where religious institutions are currently allowed to make hiring decisions on the basis of religion, this protection will be extended so these organizations can continue this practice. In addition, I feel strongly that non-denominational institutions, that is, religious institutions not affiliated or supported by a specific denomination, should be included in this exemption. With passage of the Miller amendment, H.R. 3685 will be adequately modified so that the hiring practices of non-denominational institutions are equally protected and will not be affected by the bill. 
   Given this, I intend to support the legislation pending before the House. I believe individuals should be judged based on merit and their ability to perform the tasks required rather than on perceived characteristics and unrelated biases. 
   One of the essential roles of the Federal Government is to protect the equal rights of individuals. H.R. 3685 is not a bill that grants special rights to a certain class of people. If this were the case, I would oppose the bill. This legislation simply protects the equal rights of individuals from workplace discrimination. Indeed, Congress is not alone in its attempt to end sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. In fact, my home state of Wisconsin has had a very similar law in place since 1982. The legislation the House will consider is an extension of this type of protection. Congress has historically acted to protect workers from discrimination and I believe H.R. 3685 meets this objective.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you're not going to vote for this trade agreement, you're probably not going to vote for any trade agreement that's before us. 
   This trade agreement is a no-brainer. This trade agreement is a bipartisan agreement. This trade agreement shows what you can get accomplished when we all work together. 
   This trade agreement recognizes the fact that we have one-way trade right now with Peru, and with this agreement we have two-way trade. Ninety-seven percent of all of Peru's exports come into the U.S. duty free; only 2.8 percent of our goods go to Peru duty free. This lets us send our stuff there duty free. This gives us the same opportunity to send our exports as we already give the Peruvians. 
   Now, what we hear often on the floor about why trade agreements are so bad, it's usually the trade deficit. Well, here is one interesting statistic, Mr. Speaker; 85 percent of the trade deficit comes from countries we don't have trade agreements with. You see, when we get trade agreements, we get good agreements for our country. We get the rule of law. We get enforceable contracts. We get access to their markets. Why is that important? It's important to get access to other markets because 97 percent of the world's consumers are not here in America; they're overseas. Ninety-seven percent of the world's consumers are elsewhere outside of this country. 
   We are a mature country, a fast economy, a mature economy. We have a high standard of living relative to the rest of the world. And if we want to enjoy that high standard of living, if we want to build on that high standard of living, if we want to fulfill the American Dream, which our parents and grandparents always taught us, which is, in America, you leave the next generation better off than your generation, you've got to find more markets and more consumers for our products. 
   We cannot possibly consume all that we make and all that we do because only 3 percent of the world's consumers are here. That's why we have to open markets; that's why we have to have access. 
   This is a good agreement for foreign policy reasons. This is saying to the reformers in Latin America, we're with you. This is saying to the human rights movement, to individual rights, to democracy, we are with you. America stands with you. That is so important at a time when you have a threat knocking on the door from people like Chavez next door in Venezuela. 
   Let me just read a few statistics of some of the recent successes of some of our recent free trade agreements with respect to our exports, which creates jobs, and how this has helped grow America's standard of living. 
   Since we've had free trade agreements with these countries, here is the success: Our exports to Jordan, up 92 percent; our exports to Chile, up 150 percent; our exports to Singapore, up 49 percent; our exports to Australia, up 25 percent; our exports to Morocco, up 67 percent; our exports to Bahrain, up 40 percent. Our exports are up 15 percent this year alone. That's one of the reasons why our economy grew at an astounding rate of 3.9 percent last quarter alone, because of exports. And we all know, the statistics are very clear, that exports produce good-paying jobs. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this is a chance to strike a blow for enforceable contracts, for the rule of law, for worker rights in Latin America, and for jobs here in America. 
   Again, as I mentioned in the start, this is a no-brainer. I want to thank the chairman of the Ways and Means, Mr. Rangel, for his work on this. I want to thank our ranking member, Mr. McCrery, for his work on this. And I also want to thank the people who really sweat this thing out at the negotiating table, the people at the USTR, and our Ambassador, Susan Schwab, for all of the hard work they put into this. This is one step in the right direction. Panama and Colombia are two more steps in the right direction. 
   I urge adoption of this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Westmoreland amendment and in opposition of the underlying bill. 
   Let's just review the numbers for a moment. This Energy and Water appropriation bill not only exceeds the President's request; it also increases spending by twice the rate of inflation. Under the Democrat budget resolution, nonemergency spending will increase by $81.4 billion compared to 2007, growing more than 9 percent, or triple the rate of inflation. That is triple the rate of our constituents', the American taxpayers', ability to pay for these bills. This is on top of the $6 billion that was already spent in the current year omnibus, and the $17 billion in non-war emergency spending that was added to the Iraq war supplemental. 
   But with this particular bill, here are my concerns: number one, it further opens the spigot on new spending. This is $1.1 billion above the President's request and $1.3 billion above the 2007 enacted levels. Again, far in excess of the rate of inflation. 
   Number two, it adds a lot of green for uncertain returns. The President requested $1.2 billion for renewable and energy efficiency under the Advanced Energy Initiative and the Reducing U.S. Dependence on Imported Energy Sources. This bill increases spending by 50 percent, yet it is extremely unclear whether this enormous boost in spending will actually do anything to achieve energy independence. 
   This bill also exploits the Democrats' pre-funding maneuver. This was wrong when Republicans did it. It is wrong when Democrats do it. Both parties have been doing these pre-funding maneuvers. This is basically taking from next year's bill. 
   I think the fact that they have already pre-funded $1.6 billion for FY 2008 Corps of Engineers spending frees up room under the cap so they can spend more money. So you have about a $1.8 billion smoke-and-mirrors pre-funding mechanism that allows them to spend even more money. That brings the total on top of the $1.3 billion to almost $3 billion over last year's enacted levels. 
   Now, $3 billion in an almost $3 trillion budget, people ask why should it matter. Why should we talk about these things. Here is why, Mr. Chairman, this matters: it starts one step at a time. 
   If you want to be fiscally conservative, if you want to be fiscally disciplined and watch the way we spend taxpayer dollars, we have to do it at every stage in the process. We will have to watch how we spend our taxpayer dollars. 
   The big problem I have with this budget resolution that is guiding this process, the current budget resolution leads to the largest tax increase in American history. Why on Earth would we want to pass the largest tax increase in American history at a time when our economy needs more jobs? 
   The tax cuts that occurred in 2003 created an unprecedented 7.9 million new jobs. It gave us 3 years of double-digit revenue growth, which helped us cut the deficit by more than 50 percent. And the key to reducing the deficit further is not increasing taxes or increasing spending. It is controlling spending. 
   That is the different vision between our two parties. We believe we need to balance the budget. The Democrat budget, the Democratic Party budget, does that too. They propose a balanced budget as well. They propose a balanced budget at this level of taxing and spending, whereas we propose a balanced budget at this lower level of taxing and spending, because we fundamentally believe that people ought to be able to keep more of their own money in their own pocket. 
   We don't measure success of a nation by measuring how much more money we spend in Washington. We measure success of a nation by how free people are in their own lives and how they have an ability to prosper and grow and how jobs and opportunities are being created in America. That is what we believe measures success. 
   So if we pass budgets that simply call for all this new spending, if we pass budgets which call for 23 reserve funds to spend $190 billion, in addition to what this budget right here does, what we are simply doing is saying we are going to tax people more, and then we are going to tax them more again, and we are going to spend that money. 
   That takes freedom and liberty away from taxpayers, away from individuals. That starves prosperity in America; it doesn't preserve prosperity in America. And that is why at every stage in this appropriations process, at every stage in this budget process we have to be mindful on how much money we are spending. 
   We are spending more than twice the rate of inflation in this bill. We are spending three times the rate of inflation on all of these appropriations bills. And that is far too much, Mr. Chairman. That is why I urge passage of the Westmoreland amendment and defeat of the underlying bill.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I wish to speak in support of the Westmoreland amendment. I think it does a good job of bringing spending to more reasonable levels. 
   But I would like to speak about the broader issue. Not only does this particular appropriation bill increase spending by $1.1 billion above the President's request, which is in excess of last year by double the rate of inflation, it is part of a broader appropriations effort to spend $23 billion above the President's request and 9 percent increase from this year versus last year, triple the rate of inflation. 
   Here is the problem with all these bills that spend all this extra money: This puts the taxpayer on a collision course with higher taxes. Because the budget resolution which we are now operating under leads to the largest tax increase in American history, by passing these large appropriations bills, $23 billion above the President's request, it puts us on a course for higher taxes. 
   Why is this a bad thing, Mr. Chairman? The reason this is such a bad thing is because these tax cuts, the tax relief gave us the economic prosperity we are enjoying today. It gave us the higher economic revenues that give us the ability to lower the deficit. 
   When we saw this problem in the economy in 2001 and 2003, consider all those problems America was facing, the Enron scandals, the dot-com bubble had burst, 9/11 happened, and we went into a recession. 
   What did Congress do at that time? Congress moved aggressively and swiftly to cut taxes, to cut tax rates on entrepreneurs, on small businesses, on corporations investing back in their businesses, on families and on taxpayers and working families. 
   What happened after that? Well, we created 7.9 million new jobs. Think of the fact that the eight quarters before tax cuts occurred, we had eight quarters of negative business investment. After that, we have had unprecedented business investment. 
   Think of the fact that we have averaged a job loss of 219,000 jobs per month before those tax cuts and now we are averaging almost 165,000 new jobs per month since those tax cuts.     
   Think of the fact, Mr. Chairman, that when the Enron bubble came and the dot-com bubble burst, people lost a lot of their savings when the market went down. Well, now the market is at an all-time high, and it is because of these tax cuts. 
   And so when we bring bills to the floor that promise all of this new spending, when we bring bills to the floor that spend $23 billion above the President's request, when we pass a budget that proposes 23 new slush funds to spend 190 billion more dollars in spending on top of those tax increases, this is a recipe for higher taxes. 
   So, you see, Mr. Chairman, what is coming through here on the floor, bill after bill, appropriation bill after appropriation bill, is more spending, higher spending, which leads to higher taxes. The fact is in just the month of July, this majority is proposing to bring two reserve funds that will alone promise to spend $70 billion, $20 billion in the farm bill and $50 billion on the SCHIP reauthorization. Where are they going to get that money from? Higher taxes. 
   So it's important that amendments like the Westmoreland amendment pass so that we can bring restraint to our spending levels. It is important that we don't pass these bloated appropriation bills that spend two to three times the rate of inflation, because that's two to three times the rate of our taxpayers', our constituents', ability to pay for these bills. And when we go on this collision course with all this new spending, $110 billion of more  spending this year alone in just discretionary spending versus last year, $190 billion in new spending proposals, in mandatory spending on these reserve funds, that puts the taxpayer on a collision course with higher taxes and that brings true this promise of the largest tax increase in American history which was passed by this majority in their budget resolution. 
   That is why we should not be passing these overinflated appropriation bills, and that is why we should be voting ``aye'' in favor of this Westmoreland amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for posing this amendment. 
   The reason we are here today, Mr. Chairman, is because this is overbudget. Take a look at this bill right here. It is $2.8 billion above the President's request and includes a $3.1 billion boost for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. There are also some phony gimmicks in this spending bill. 
   As noted, the bill provides phony offsets for spending increases by rescinding budget authority with no outlay savings. So what you are doing, you are actually canceling something that doesn't really exist to show paper savings so you can spend it somewhere else. Now, this is an old trick that has been done on both sides of the aisle over the years, but it still doesn't make it right. 
   The problem we have with this bill, as the preceding bills and the following appropriations bills, is it is $34 billion above last year's spending level just for what we have passed so far. That is $19 billion above the President's request. This majority's spending bills are going to be $81 billion above last year's spending level. 
   When you look at the budget resolution, this bill does conform to the budget resolution. It meets 302(b). What that means in budget talk is they are conforming to their budget. But what does their budget do? Their budget leads to the largest tax increase in American history. 
   If you accept these spending increases, which, on average, are 9 percent spending increases for discretionary spending, three times the rate of inflation, three times the rate of  wage growth, three times the ability for families to be able to afford this expense, three times the rate that our family incomes go up at best, if you accept these spending increases, that means you are accepting the plan in the budget, and the plan in the budget is to raise taxes. Not by a little bit, by a lot. 
   What tax increases are they specifically calling for in the budget resolution that this is a part of? Getting rid of the marriage penalty, bringing it back altogether; reducing the child tax credit in half; raising income tax rates across the board for every single working American and every single working family; bringing the death tax back in full force; raising taxes on capital gains and dividends, which makes it easier for people to save for retirement, and that creates jobs. 
   So the problem we have here, Mr. Chairman, is not a revenue problem. We have had double-digit revenue increases coming to the Federal Government for the past 3 years in a row.     
   The deficit just went down this year again by 18 percent because of faster revenue growth. So we don't have the problem with the money coming in. We don't need to raise taxes. Plenty of money is coming in to the coffers of Washington. 
   The problem we have is spending. We are just spending too much money too quickly. If we want to balance the budget without raising taxes, we have to control spending. That's the lesson we've learned. 
   Now, what does this bill do? This bill irresponsibly increases spending too fast. Are there important functions that are in this bill? Yes. Are there important things that the government needs to do, roads and bridges and transportation? Yes. 
   The problem I have with this bill is it doesn't have fiscal discipline. It doesn't contain a budget cap that makes sure we won't raise taxes. 
   So, by subscribing to the budget increases, the spending increases in the bill and the appropriations bills before it and the ones that are yet to come, it puts us on that glide path, on that trajectory to having the largest tax increase in American history. We don't want those taxes to be increased, and we sure don't want to support budgets that put us on the path to making it a sure thing, and that, Mr. Chairman, is why I think we should vote against this. 
   I think we should also have better budgeting. I don't think we should be rescinding phony budget authority to then use it for outlays. So, if we get rid of the gimmicks, this thing wouldn't even comport with the budget resolution itself. 
   So with that in mind, Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, over the last few days we have heard about LIBOR, commercial papers, spreads, swaps, about the credit markets. This chart shows you just how bad things are in the credit markets. But what does any of this stuff mean? What is credit? Credit is confidence, it is credibility, trustworthiness in someone's ability to pay. 
   Right now, our system is plagued with fear. There is no confidence. There is no trust. Lenders don't trust borrowers; sellers don't trust buyers. 
   This bill, as flawed as it is, goes right to this issue. If it works, it stops that fear from spreading into outright panic. 
   Will this bill prevent a recession? No, I don't think it will. But it will help us make sure that a recession is short and shallow, and not deep and long. 
   I know one thing for sure. Doing nothing is the worst thing we could do. This is one of those once-in-a-century kind of crises, and we need to act to prevent it from becoming a once-in-a-century kind of a recession. In Wisconsin, we are already beginning to see the beginning of this. We are already starting to see the job losses. 
   For me, this is a conscience vote. We of all people understand public opinion. We know it is not popular. But we see that gathering storm, we see it out there on the horizon. Our constituents may be outside mowing their lawns and looking up and seeing a sunny sky, but we see those storm clouds developing. And I want to know for sure that when the choice was made, I had made the decision to prevent that storm from gathering, to prevent those jobs from being lost, to protect our constituents from losing their retirement funds, from not getting that home loan, that car loan. 
   I want to make sure that what we do here today snaps that fear out of the market and preserves those jobs, and makes sure that the bumpy road we are going to have is not nearly as bumpy  as it would otherwise be if this bill fails.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I want to talk about what my friend from California just mentioned. And I want to just simply say that I think that the gentleman from California is truly a gentleman, and I enjoy the time we've spent together. But there are just a few things I think need to be corrected. 
   Number one, the gentleman mentioned that over the last 6 years, the Republicans, when they were in charge, squandered the opportunity, lost the credibility. Well, guess what? It's only taken 6 months for this majority, maybe 6 years for the former majority; 6 months, and this majority has turned their back on earmark reforms. Six months into the new majority, and this majority has turned this thing upside down. 
   What do I mean when I say that, Mr. Chairman? 
   Let me just quote our current Speaker, on December 14, 2006, ``We will bring transparency and openness to the budget process and to the use of earmarks, and we will give the American people the leadership they deserve.'' 
   What happened? 
   Well, a number of things happened. Under the Republican majority, earmarks got out of control. Under the Republican majority, waste occurred. Let me be the first one to say that. 
   So what happened? 
   In the last session, Republicans changed the rules. We said, if you're going to have an earmark, a pork-barrel project, Number one, we've got to see it. It's got to be in the bill. A Member has to have their name attached to it, so they have to defend it. 
   But most importantly, the American people need to see this, and it needs to be in the bill as it comes to the House floor, as it goes to the Senate Chamber, so that the American people have time to look at it, so that transparency and sunlight can bring accountability to the process, and so that we, as the people's Representatives, each and every one of us, representing 670,459 people, can have judgment, can vote on it. That's transparency. That's accountability. It happened late in our majority, but it happened. 
   What did the Democrats do as they took over the majority? 
   To their credit, Mr. Chairman, they extended, enhanced and improved upon these rules. So I would, at this moment, like to give some bipartisan credit to the fact that we negotiated these earmark reforms in the last session, and Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats, to their credit, carried them over and made them better. 
   Where are we 6 months later? Where are we 6 months into this new majority? We went three steps forward, and now we went six steps backwards. 
   Mr. Chairman, what are we doing? 
   No transparency, no earmarks in these bills, no opportunity for the American people, the public, to see what's in this legislation. All we have in these bills are big slush funds, a $5.9 billion slush fund in the bill that's coming up next, a $20 billion earmark slush fund in the bill coming after that. 
   What does that mean? 
   They're putting billions and billions of dollars of fiscal space of a general earmark in these bills, and they're simply saying, this money will be earmarked afterwards, when I, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee decide to put this money in to go toward pet projects, pet constituencies, at my choosing, at my scrutinizing, after Congress has the ability to consider these things on their own merits. 
   Is that transparency? Is that accountability? Absolutely not, Mr. Chairman. 
   They have gone backwards, back on their word, back from bringing transparency and accountability to Congress. 
   So let me just say for the record, both parties have messed this up. Both majorities have seen the light, and this majority is going backwards on this. That is what this is all about. 
   We recognize we've got to have more transparency and accountability in the way we spend taxpayer dollars. That's one of the problems we have. The other problem is this idea that we can just spend our way into prosperity, this idea that we can just spend more and more and more money, and all things wrong in America will be fixed. If only we take more money out of people's paychecks, bring them up here to Washington and spend their money, every problem can be solved. 
   This is the problem we have at a basic philosophical level. Here is where we are just 6 months into this new majority. 
   The President gave us a budget. His budget increased spending across all levels of government. His budget increased discretionary spending. Well, what happened since that budget came? Six billion new dollars in February in the omnibus appropriation. Then, just last month, $17 billion in new spending of unrelated, nonrequested spending in an emergency appropriation bill to go to funding the troops in Iraq, $17 billion that has nothing to do with Iraq.  And now, $21 billion in more spending. $43 billion out the window, out the door in new spending in just 6 months. 
   How do you balance the budget, Mr. Chairman? You balance it by controlling spending. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman has expired.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. We believe you balance the budget by controlling spending, not raising taxes. And at the end of the day, this is what the differences are. 
   The majority brought to the floor a bill and passed the largest tax increase in American history. They modified it to possibly reduce that to the second largest tax increase in American history. So what can they do? Raise more spending and raise taxes to balance the budget. 
   We want to balance the budget at a much lower level of taxing and spending. We want more transparency in the process. We want to control Federal spending, and we want the American people to see exactly how their money is being spent so that their Representative can call these issues into question, not put the power in one man's hands here in Congress, which is the current proposal before us.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman from Indiana for yielding. 
   I want to say to the person who just spoke, who referenced me, that my motivation here is just to come and get more pork for myself. I know the gentleman's new here, but he doesn't know me, if that's what he said. 
   He also mentioned that you want to make this system more democratic. We should be here fighting for good government and for democracy and fairness. Is giving one man in this body this power like Caesar, to decide whether or not earmarks go in and out of bills, democratic? Is that small D democratic? 
   Is giving all the power to one chairman on how all 32,000 earmark requests in his power, is that democratic? Or should we have the ability, as Democrats and Republicans, in a small D democracy, the ability to vote on these things? 
   Shouldn't the American people have the choice and the ability to see how their money is being spent? Or should we, in the name of good government, give the chairman of the Appropriations Committee sole discretion, sole  decision-making power, on how tens of billions of dollars are spent on tens of thousands of projects? 
   That's democracy? That's good government? That's fairness? I think not, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, the idea that we should simply relegate our power, our voting cards, our ability to speak on behalf of our constituents, to one chairman of one committee to spend tens of billions of our taxpayers' hard-earned dollars on tens of thousands of projects, if we think that that is good government, that is fairness, that is what democracies do, that is not my opinion. That is not my value. That is not what I think democracy is all about. 
   I believe we are here to fight for fairness, transparency, accountability. And what we are here to do is to make sure that our taxpayers dollars are spent wisely, that they are spent in a transparent way, that there is accountability in this system. 
   Why on earth does each and every one of us want to delegate our lawmaking power and authority to one person to decide how our taxpayer dollars are spent is beyond me. But for those of you who say that our motivation is simply to get a bigger slice of the pie, to get more pork-barrel spending, that's just not the case. And I think that's insulting.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   It is asked, you know, why are we doing what we are doing, and why are these amendments coming to the floor, and why are these Members saying what they are saying? There is a big picture involved here, Mr. Chairman, and I would like to speak to that. 
   Number one, this isn't just about increasing spending in one particular program or one pet project, this is about the now majority increasing spending everywhere, on virtually every program and virtually every pet project at almost every opportunity. Six months into the new majority, $6 billion on the omnibus appropriations, $17 billion in non-war-related emergency spending supplemental, $21 billion more on top of discretionary spending above the level at which we realize the veto threat is going to occur. 
   Each of these appropriation bills is representing an installment on a plan to increase nonemergency spending by more than $81 billion over last year. That is a spending increase of 9 percent, three times the rate of inflation. 
   Now, I will be the first to acknowledge that when our party was in the majority, we made similar mistakes. We made similar big spending increases. I recall my first term in 2000, coming at the end of the Clinton administration, an 11 percent increase in discretionary spending. That got built into the base, and what happened? Our budgets got thrown through the loop forever. We went into deficit. It was a big mistake at the time, that we should not have done that. 
   But there are four specific problems I have with this particular bill before us, Mr. Chairman, which the gentleman from Iowa's amendment does some things to help fix. 
   First, the President's budget called for an increase of 7.2 percent. This budget calls for an increase of 14 percent. So it raises the ante. So, instead of doubling the spending at the rate of inflation, we're going four times the rate of inflation on this bill. 
   Number two, this bill takes advantage of prefunding. They have already used the 2007 war supplemental to prefund over $1 billion in fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security appropriations. That lets us free up the cap for more spending. So, it's really more than a 14 percent increase from one year to the next. 
   Third, and this is my biggest concern, Mr. Chairman, earmark transparency. We have come a long ways on earmarks. The former majority party made mistakes on earmarks. Let me say this one more time. Republicans made mistakes on earmarks. And good thing Republicans, last session, began fixing those mistakes. Last session we brought to the floor and passed in the rules new earmark transparency rules, new earmark accountability rules, giving the public the ability to see the earmarks, see who the author is, and giving Members of Congress, there as the people's representatives, the ability to come to the floor and challenge those earmarks. To the Democratic Party credit, they extended those earmark reforms. And you know what, Mr. Chairman? They built upon them. They improved upon those earmark reforms. The Democrat majority improved upon the Republican earmark reforms when they came into power at the beginning of this year. 
   Where are we now? What has happened? We went three steps forward, and now we went six steps back, Mr. Chairman. Now, in instead of giving the public the ability to see these earmarks, instead of giving Members of Congress, the people's representatives, the ability to challenge them, to vote on them, to have scrutiny on them while we consider these appropriation bills, what are we doing? They are air-dropping them in the conference report. 
   Okay. What did that just mean for those people who don't know our lingo? This means we're not going to see the earmarks while we are considering this legislation as they go through the House and the other body, the Senate. They will be conveniently put in the bill at the end of the process so that no amendment can address the issue, so that the public will have very little time to see these earmarks, so that no Member of Congress can challenge the worthiness of a pet project. When we have come to the time where Congress is putting in thousands and thousands and thousands of these earmarks, raking up to tens of millions of dollars, one of the bills we are going to consider this week has something like $20 billion slated for earmarks in just one bill.     
   No vote, just $20 billion, empty money to be spoken for, later inserted in the conference report by a couple of people in the majority, namely the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the dean of my delegation. No transparency, no public accountability, no ability for the people, Representatives, to come to the floor and challenge these earmarks. 
   That is not earmark reform, Mr. Chairman. 
   We need real earmark reform. Let's not go backwards. And what is worse about all of this is, these bills are coming in far above where they ought to be from a funding level. We are going to have a veto at the end of the year and a train wreck.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Chairman, at this time I would like to address why we are here today. We are here to balance the budget, and what is very good about this debate we are having here today is we are talking about not if we should balance the budget; we are talking about how to balance the budget. 
   So for that point we have come to a good part of this debate, where I believe, based on the numbers I have seen, all of these amendments we are going to experience today and the base Democrat budget balances by 2012. That is a good start. So now we here in Congress are agreeing, let us balance the budget. That is good. 
   The question then becomes how do we balance the budget. This is where there are enormous differences between the two parties. 
   The three budgets on the other side of the aisle, the Progressive budget, the Congressional Black Caucus budget and the base Democrat budget, all have one big thing in common: they raise taxes. They raise a lot of taxes, anywhere from $400 billion to $1 trillion just over the next 5 years. 
   What kind of taxes are we talking about? Well, let's look at the tax relief that occurred. In 2003, if you take a look at what happened to our country in 2001 with 9/11, with the Enron scandals, with the dot-com bubble bursting, the fact that we went to war and we went into a recession, we lost a lot of jobs. We were losing over 100,000 jobs a month at that time. We went into a recession. Three years of revenues declined. We had a big deficit. So while revenues went down because people lost jobs, we went into deficit and spending went up. 
   Why? Because we had unemployment. We had programs to help people who lost their jobs. We had war costs, and so what ended up happening was we needed to get people back to work. We needed to get this economy growing again. 
   So what did we do? At that time, we were in the majority. We decided we needed a package of reforms, of tax cuts to get the economy growing again, to get people working again. So we cut taxes on families, cut taxes on small businesses, cut taxes on business investment. 
   What happened? 7.6 million new jobs were created since those tax cuts in 2003. We went from growing our economy at an anemic 1.1 percent prior to the tax cuts to growing our economy at an average of 3.5 percent. We went to creating about 160,000 jobs per month since those tax cuts. 
   What also happened? Revenues went up. Revenues went up for double digits the 2 years following. This year so far the revenues are up about 10 percent. So revenues came in, why? Because we actually cut taxes. We have lower tax rates, but we have higher revenues because people went back to work. People went to work, to jobs and paid more taxes. 
   What happened? The deficit went as high as $412 billion. Now it is as low as $176 billion. I would like to say that it is because we did a great job on controlling spending. No, that is not the case. The reason the deficit for the most part went down is because revenues went up, because the economy grew, people went back to work, paid their taxes. 
   So, Madam Chairman, we do not have a revenue problem in Washington. Revenues are coming in fast. We have a spending problem in Washington, and this is the difference between our philosophies, our budgets. 
   We believe that the money people make really is their money, not the government's money. We believe that when someone starts a business, when someone goes to work, that is the fruit of their own labor and they ought to keep more of their hard-earned money, because at the end of the day, if government takes more money out of the person's paycheck, you are taking more freedom out of their lives. If you take more money out of a family budget, you are taking more freedom away from that family. That is the difference. 
   We believe that people ought to keep more of what they earn. We believe that small businesses, which are the engine of economic growth in this society, which create all these jobs, should not be taxed at tax rates higher than large corporations, but that is what will happen if any of these three budgets pass, if the Progressive budget, the Congressional Black Caucus budget, or the Democrat budget passes. 
   We believe that we need to focus on spending and not on raising taxes, because more important than that, I want to show you one chart, Madam Chairman. If you take a look at these revenue lines, even if we take the low line, the blue line, that is the line of revenues coming in if we don't raise taxes. That is the line the Republicans are using for our budget, and we balance our budget by controlling spending instead of raising taxes, and we control spending to the point where we stop the raid on the Social Security trust fund and we pay down $100 billion in debt in the fifth year alone. 
   The red line, not much higher, but the red line says, let's raise taxes by $400 billion. That is the smallest of the tax increases we are looking at of these budgets today. That still shows, but it is a lot lower than the green line, the spending line. 
   Spending is the problem. If we do nothing to control spending, by the time my children are my age, the Federal Government will double in size simply by growing on the current path that it is on. 
   This has to be dealt with, Madam Chairman. This has to be dealt with, and no matter how much you propose to raise taxes, no matter how much you want to raise taxes on small businesses, take away the per-child tax credit, bring back the marriage penalty, reinstate the death tax, raise taxes on businesses and capital investment and seniors and dividends and capital gains, no matter how much you want to raise taxes here, if you pass one of these other three budgets, we still will not have enough to meet the spending line, the spending appetite, the spending trajectory of this Federal Government. That has to be dealt with. 
   Why does that have to be dealt with? Because we do not want to pass onto our children and our grandchildren a mountain of debt. The debt has increased. Sadly, over the last 8 years, it went up $3 trillion. I think you are going to hear that from other people. I have got news for you, Madam Chairman, just Social Security alone by doing nothing to address this program  over the next 5 years, that debt will go up by $3 trillion. 
   Medicare, if we do not address Medicare's growth, if we do not reform and maintain and save Medicare, the debt to just Medicare will go up almost $20 trillion over the next 5 years by doing nothing. 
   So, Madam Chairman, let's not raise taxes. Let's work on spending, and let's reform these programs. 
   I want to reserve the balance of my time, but I want to say one thing before I do, and that is these three programs which we commonly refer to as our entitlements are the most important domestic programs in the Federal Government. Medicare helps people who are an older age get health care. Medicaid helps people who are low income get health care. Really, really important missions, Madam Chairman. And Social Security helps provide people with retirement security. 
   These programs are too important to let slip into bankruptcy. These programs are too important to go for five more years without any reforms designed to extend their solvency and make them work better and be more responsive to the needs of the American people. 
   I think that is where we should place our efforts. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Chair, this is an important moment for our time of fiscal responsibility in America. I would like to read from a few quotes. We have had great hearings in the Budget Committee. I want to compliment the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) for holding great hearings. In all of these hearings, we had fiscal experts coming to testify from both parties, from nonpartisan organizations like the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability Office, from the Federal Reserve. 
   I would like to read a few quotes about the fiscal condition that is staring us in the face that this budget should be addressing today. 
   On the urgency of entitlement reform, we had Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, come in and say, ``Without early and meaningful action to address entitlements, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the cost.'' 
   Then we had the Comptroller General, Mr. Walker, on 60 Minutes say, ``Health care is the number one fiscal challenge for the Federal and State governments. If there is one thing that  can bankrupt America, it is health care. We need dramatic and fundamental health care reforms.'' That's at a hearing. 
   On 60 Minutes, he said, ``The rising cost of government entitlements is a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America.'' 
   Here is what Mr. Walker is talking about. If you take a look at this chart, it shows you that, consistently, our government has been taxing the American economy at about 18 percent of our gross domestic product. What that means is, basically, since about 1960, to finance our Federal government, we have had to tax the American economy, families, businesses, all those things, at about 18 percent of our economic output. It has been remarkably consistent. 
   Because of the unsustainable growth of government spending programs, of our entitlement programs, they are growing at such a quick pace that by the time my 5-, 3-, and 2-year-olds are in my age bracket, they will have to tax the American economy at 40 percent just to pay the bills. 
   Let me put it another way around. We have very important programs. We call them our entitlement programs. They meet critical missions of the Federal Government. When they were set up, they made sense at the time the way they were financed. They were called pay-as-you-go. Current workers pay taxes, particularly payroll taxes, to pay the benefits for current retirees, for current beneficiaries. It worked fine for many years. 
   Not now, though. Because as the baby boomers begin to retire, which begins next year, we will double the amount of retirees in this country; and we will only increase the amount of workers coming to this country by 17 percent. For all of those who had kids during that baby boom generation, they had a lot of kids; and it was wonderful. Our birth rates went up. But, since then, we haven't had as many kids. 
   Heck, in my own hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin, where I come from an Irish Catholic family, I had 65 cousins in just Janesville, Wisconsin. But I am a Generation Xer; and at my family level, we didn't have as many kids. That is what is happening across the world and across the country. 
   Why am I saying all of this? What did it mean? It means that these programs are going to double the amount of consumers to the programs and not double the amount of payers into the programs. 
   We have to reform these programs. We have to make them work better, and we have got to prevent our kids from having their taxes doubled. That is what this is about at the end of the day, Madam Chair. It is about our children and our grandchildren. 
   Now, this seems to be a cliche thing that everybody says when they get up to a microphone. But, quite honestly, if we don't get a handle on our fiscal situation, if we don't recognize the fact that if all you do is raise taxes to balance the budget in 2012, you are going to go right back into deficit soon thereafter if we don't control spending, if we don't reform government, if we don't fix our entitlement perhaps. If we don't do this, the debt we have today will pale, pale in comparison to the debt we are going to be passing on to our children and our grandchildren. 
   We have new economic challenges and threats unlike any we have ever seen before in this country. We don't have oceans that separate us anymore. We have broadband, Internet, digital technology. We have to compete with workers on a daily basis from countries like China and India overnight. 
   We have real economic challenges facing us, and we can't survive and thrive in this era of globalization. We can't continue to be America's economic superpower, the world's economic superpower, if we are going to double the taxes on future generations. 
   You can't tax your way into prosperity. We already today tax our businesses, our capital, more than any other country in the industrialized world except for one, Japan. They just finished two decades of recession. 
   We have got to wise up to the fact that we have to be lean and mean and compete with China and India and these other countries. We have got to make sure that the way we run our health care system works for patients, that the way we have our entitlement benefits gives us income security, retirement security, health security. We have got to make sure that it doesn't do it in such a way that it literally doubles the entire tax burden on the American economy, on the American family. If we do that, we will push more jobs overseas. We will lose our standard of living, the great gift of America of a generation to the next. 
   The legacy of the American Dream is that each generation bequeaths unto the next a higher and better standard of living. That is exactly what my parents and grandparents told me. We are at risk of severing that tie. We are at risk of discontinuing that legacy of giving our kids and our grandkids a better standard of living, a better economy, things better off than when we found them. 
   Budgets matter, and the budget that we have before us today, whether it's the CBC budget, the Progressive budget or the Democrat budget, raises taxes by anywhere from $400 billion to $1 trillion over the next 4 years and does absolutely nothing, nothing, nothing to control spending, to reform government, to prevent this mountain of debt going onto our children's backs. 
   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Chair, I wish to compliment the Congressional Black Caucus with their budget today because they are bringing a serious budget to the floor. They are bringing a budget that does achieve balance. They are bringing a budget that reflects their philosophies and their policies, and that is important. I commend the Black Caucus under the leadership of Ms. Kilpatrick for that. 
   This is what we do. We come to the floor with our budgets to encapsulate our priorities and what are the visions we have for the future of our country. 
   This budget does raise taxes. You simply can't get around the fact that it calls for $711.9 billion in additional tax revenues over the next 5 years to make the budget balance. But that is fine. 
   I wish to talk, at this time, about the underlying Democrat budget. And let me just quote from The Washington Post this morning. The article in The Washington Post this morning, in talking about the Democrat budget says: ``And while the House Democrats say they want to preserve key parts of Bush's signature tax cuts, they project a surplus in 2012 only by assuming that all of these tax cuts expire on schedule in 2010.'' 
   Now, we understand that people say, on the other side of the aisle, they don't want to raise taxes. I hear those words. I even hear that they say they have these sort of mythical reserve funds, which is really nothing more than a wish list. 
   So we had all these votes in the Budget Committee. We said, okay, if you really don't want to raise these taxes, then let's put it into the budget. Let's make it clear. Let's put it into the numbers of the budget so that we clearly can tell the American people we are not going to raise your taxes. 
   So we had a whole series of votes in the Budget Committee to amend the budget to make sure taxes weren't being raised. We had an amendment to make sure that we didn't increase marginal tax rates. We had an amendment to make sure we didn't eliminate the $1,000 per-child tax credit. We had an amendment to make sure we didn't eliminate marriage tax penalty relief. We had an amendment to make sure we didn't eliminate the capital gains and dividends tax relief. We had an amendment to make sure we didn't eliminate the State and local sales tax relief which applies to States like Texas and Tennessee and Florida. We had an amendment to make sure we didn't bring back the death tax. Amendment after amendment after amendment, which would have made this clear and simple that we weren't going to raise taxes was defeated, every single one of them, by party-line votes. The Democrats defeated every single amendment in attempts to stop these tax increases from coming into this budget. 
   Now, let's take a look at what kind of tax increases we are talking about. The Democrat budget only reaches balance because of this. This is how their budget achieves balance.     
   They have $32.5 billion in higher taxes coming from higher tax rates on dividends and capital gains. They have $40 billion in higher revenues because they cut in half the per child tax credit. They bring back the marriage tax  penalty, which makes people pay taxes simply because they are married. They get $91 billion in extra tax revenues by bringing the death tax back in full force, and they gain another $78 billion by taking away the lower 10 percent bracket for low-income Americans. They bring into the government an extra $104 billion by raising all other marginal tax rates, and that is also the tax rate that small businesses pay. 
   So small businesses, which are the engine of economic growth of America, and most jobs come from small businesses, under their plan small businesses will pay a tax rate at about 40 percent, when we are going to actually be giving a tax rate to the largest companies in America, IBM, Exxon, Microsoft, at 35 percent. 
   This is how their budget balances: Raise taxes on businesses, raise taxes on small businesses, raise taxes on investment in seniors' pension funds, raise taxes on people with children, raise taxes on people who get married, raise taxes on people who die, and raise taxes on low-income Americans. That is the only way, the only reason, the only ability that the Democrat budgets actually achieve balance. 
   We can do better, Madam Chairman, and the reason we can do better is because we have to attack out-of-control spending. 
   Washington does not have a revenue problem, Madam Chairman. Money is coming in as fast as it ever has. Money is going out too fast. Both parties are to blame for this. I am not going to be here and sanctimoniously say that our party has been wonderful on spending. No, we have not. What I am saying is we have to agree spending is out of control. That is the problem. Let's control spending. 
   The budget we are bringing to the floor later on does just that. We give the tools to get rid of pork. We give the tools to let the American people see exactly how their tax dollars are being spent. We bring more accountability and transparency to the Federal budget process. We reform our entitlement programs so we can extend their solvency, so we can make sure that people can better count on Medicare and Medicaid. These are the things that we have got to do so we don't crank up our debt, raise our taxes, and put a huge burden on our children and grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for his wonderful expertise on budget issues. He has been a leader on this issue. 
   I also want to compliment the Progressive Caucus for coming to the floor with an earnest budget and for putting a budget together. These are not easy things to do. The Progressives have put together a budget that embodies their philosophies, their opinions, and I think that is good. 
   I completely disagree with the direction of the budget, deep cuts to defense, incredible increases in spending across the board, and a $949 billion tax increase. I think it is the wrong recipe for our economy, but I compliment the Progressives for bringing a budget to the floor that actually achieves balance, albeit by raising taxes. 
   Madam Chair, I want to give a little foreshadowing of our next budget. You are going to hear the word ``cut'' and the words ``drastic cuts'' and things like that. I think we are going to hear that from the other side of the aisle because they propose to control no spending. Those chose to cut nothing, not even controlling the growth of spending. Rather, they choose to raise taxes. 
   On Medicaid, our budget will propose, yes, to increase spending, albeit not as fast as it is going right now. This will extend the solvency of Medicaid. We propose to increase spending even faster than medical inflation. 
   What about Medicare? Again, our red line below the blue line, we propose to increase Medicare spending and reform the program. 
   What will our budget achieve? It will achieve savings that will extend the life and solvency of Medicare. 
   What does the Democrat budget achieve? An exacerbation of the problem. 
   Here is what our budget proposes to do on all entitlements. I don't even know if the viewer can see the difference between the blue line, which is the current trajectory of entitlement spending, and the red line. 
   We propose to increase entitlement spending each year at 4.1 percent a year, instead of 4.7 percent a year. Is that a drastic cut? Is that a terrible, awful cut to programs? Let me repeat it one more time. We are increasing entitlement spending 4.1 percent a year, instead of 4.7 percent. That is above inflation. 
   Here is the legacy of the Democrat budget. Right now, today, according to the Government Accountability Office, the current unfunded liability of Medicare and Social Security is $37 trillion. That will go to $62 trillion of money that we would have to set aside today to make these programs work for the next two generations, my generation and my children's generation, by 2012. By doing nothing to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, the Democratic budget is actually increasing the liability of these programs. The Democrat budget is making matters worse by postponing the necessary reforms that must occur. 
   But there is one thing the Democrat budget does, and it was very well described in the Washington Post this morning. Let me quote: ``While the House Democrats say they want to preserve key parts of Bush's signature tax cuts, they project a surplus in 2012 only by assuming that all of these tax cuts expire on schedule in 2010.'' That means cap gains, dividends, income tax rates, per child tax credit, marriage tax penalty, all of those tax cuts go away. 
   Let me make it very clear. We use the Congressional Budget Office by law to develop our budgets, and this red line shows you that, in 2010, tax cuts go away, taxes increase, and revenues go up. That is the line that the Democrats are writing their budget based on. Their budget requires, assumes, legislates, needs these tax increases for them to balance the budget. 
   The green line is the line we use to write our budget. We balance the budget without raising taxes, and they raise taxes.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, we are coming to the end of 2 days of debate on how to organize our Nation's finances; how do we want to prepare the budget for the next 5 years for our country. 
   This is a big debate. It is a debate that really underscores the different philosophies between our two parties. 
   The Democrats have chosen the path of higher spending and a lot higher taxes. The three Democrat budgets we had before us here on the floor today, one raised taxes by $400 billion, another raised taxes by $711 billion and a third one raised taxes by $949 billion. 
   The last tax increase we had was the last time the Democrats had the majority, and that was a $241 billion tax increase. Now, 3 months into their new majority, they are proposing anywhere from a $400 billion to a $1 trillion tax increase. 
   We don't believe that we should take more money out of the pockets of hardworking Americans. We don't believe we should tax, tax, tax and then tax more the American economy and the American family and the American workers. 
   We believe Washington has a spending problem, and that is why we are proposing to control spending, and that is how we achieve the balanced budget. Not only do we achieve a balanced budget, but we stop the raid of the Social Security trust fund and pay down $100 billion in debt in the fifth year of our budget. 
   Now, here is the difference. The blue line is our line, the revenue line, where we keep the tax cuts intact. The red line is the line where the Democrats raise the taxes. The green line is the current trajectory of spending. 
   We have to control spending if we are going to ever fully balance the budget. Even if we accept the Democrats' tax increases, the balance they achieve in 5 years will only last for a couple of short years because we will go right back into deficits if we do nothing to control spending. 
   Now, you are going to hear a lot of words about our budget in the next few minutes. Cut this, cut that, we are savaging this, we are taking a chain saw to that. We are pitting Medicare and Medicaid. 
   Let's be really clear. Medicare, spending goes up every year from here to the next to the next. Medicaid spending under our budget will go up faster than health care inflation. But we are going to reform the program so that it works better, doesn't cost as much, and extends its solvency so that it is there for people. 
   Medicare. Are we cutting Medicare? No, we are not cutting Medicare. We are growing Medicare. We are growing Medicare, not as fast as it is currently scheduled to grow because we are reforming Medicare. And what do we do? We extend the solvency of Medicare. 
   Overall, if you take a look at the difference in spending we propose over the next 5 years, on entitlement spending we propose growing, increasing, adding entitlement spending at 4.1 percent a year for the next 5 years, instead of 4.7 percent a year. 
   Now, at the end of the day, it is about how we get our fiscal house in order. Here is the devastation of the Democrat budget. And I am just going to pick one program. 
   Medicare, the unfunded liability of Medicare is $32 trillion. $32 trillion is how much money we would have to set aside today in current dollars to make sure that Medicare is there for my children when they receive Medicare.  
   Under the Democrat budget, the Medicare unfunded liability will go to $52 trillion. That means doing nothing to reform Medicare. Doing nothing to reform Medicare at all will actually lead to adding a huge debt onto the problem. It will mean that our children and grandchildren will have another $22 trillion in debt thrown onto them if we decide not to do a thing for the next 5 years to reform our entitlement programs. But that, in fact, is what the Democrat budget does. 
   The actual household burden today on Medicare is $282,400. That is what we would have to set aside today, per household, to make sure Medicare is there for my children when they retire. If we do nothing for the next 5 years, as the Democrats propose, that goes up to almost $476,000 a household. 
   We have got to fix these programs. We have got to reform these programs. We have got to reform them so that they work better. They were written in the 1960s. We are now in the 21st century. We can make these programs work better. We can better meet the mission of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, income security, health security; and we can do it without bankrupting our children. 
   The problem is, we can't put our heads in the sand for 5 years and do nothing. That is what the Democrat budget proposes to do. Absolutely no savings, no spending control, no reform. 
   We have to reform these programs, Mr. Chairman, because if we don't, our debt gets higher. We go back into deficits, and there isn't another tax you can raise to get out of that hole. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of the time. 
   Here it comes, Mr. Chairman, the closing of this debate. We have heard it all. We have heard the quotes: these cuts are so deep, so extreme about the Republican budget. 
   Well, let's just see how deep and extreme these cuts are. Instead of spending over the next 5 years $14.976 trillion, our budget proposes $14.928 trillion over the next 5 years. Instead of growing entitlement spending at 4.7 percent a year, we will grow it at 4.1 percent a year. 
   What do we accomplish with this? What do we do with that? We balance the budget without raising taxes. We stop the raid on the Social Security trust fund and we pay down debt. That is what we accomplish with our budget. 
   What do the Democrats accomplish? No matter how they spin it, no matter how they duck it, no matter how they hide, they are raising taxes. Don't ask me. Just look at The Washington Post that said: ``And while the House Democrats say they want to preserve key parts of Bush's signature tax cuts, they project a surplus by 2012 only by assuming that all of these tax cuts go away.'' 
   Meet the new Democrat majority, Mr. Chairman, the same as the old Democrat majority. And the last time they had the majority in 1993, what did they do? They passed the largest tax increase in American history, $241 billion. Now, 3 1/2 months into the new majority, what are they planning to do? Passing the largest tax increase in American history, about $400 billion. Is that to control spending or something like that? No. They are engaging on a gorge of new spending. $50 billion is already being thrown out the door just this year, and it is not even April into their new majority. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a direction. This is a choice between two visions. Do we or do we not let people keep more of their own hard-earned money? Or do we just keep taxing them more and more and more and spending more and more and more? That is the choice. 
   We believe in the people. We believe people should keep more of their own money. We believe people should keep their child tax credit. We don't want to tax people for being married. We believe small businesses should be taxed no more than large corporations. We believe seniors ought to be able to enjoy their retirement savings. We believe in preserving, saving, and enhancing our entitlement programs by extending their solvency. 
   What are they going to do? They are hastening the demise of our entitlements, they are accelerating the bankruptcy of these programs, and they are giving us the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Like it or not, the numbers are clear. You can reserve fund everything you want, you can put any wish list you want in a piece of legislation, but numbers don't lie. And the numbers are crystal clear and they tell the truth: this budget, the Democrat budget, gives us the largest tax increase in American history, and the Republican budget keeps taxes low, and it balances the budget by controlling spending and it stops the raid on the Social Security trust fund and it pays down debt. 
   Pass the Republican budget. Defeat the Democrat budget.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, the Democrat budget raises taxes, plain and simple. You can cite all of these other groups that say one thing or another, but the group that counts is the Congressional Budget Office. That is the official scorekeeping agency that measures our budgets. 
   And according to the Congressional Budget Office, the Democrat budget provides for the largest tax increase in American history. Either that, or they don't balance the budget. They can't have it both ways. They are saying they balance the budget, and the only way they balance the budget is by raising taxes, cutting the child tax credit in half, bringing back the marriage tax penalty, bringing back the death tax, raising tax rates across the board on all income tax payers, repealing the 10 percent for low-income Americans, bringing back higher tax rates on capital gains and dividends which create jobs and help seniors save. 
   In fact, if their tax plan comes to fruition, if they actually accomplish what they are seeking to accomplish, they will tax the small businesses of America at higher tax rates than the largest corporations in America. 
   Madam Speaker, these tax cuts created jobs. They created 7.6 million jobs. Don't raise taxes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I appreciate the applause. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think it is important that we do everything we can to save money in light of the fact that we are creating a massive new entitlement program later this week with this bill that is coming to the floor. I think it is important that we show leadership at every facet of the Federal government. That is why this amendment, which now I believe saves $100,000 from the USDA Administrative Account Budget, is worth supporting, simply because of the fact that the new SCHIP bill opens a whole new open-ended entitlement. 
   In the past, SCHIP has always been a program that was capped, that had an authorization. Now we have a program that has no income limits, that requires people to actually self-certify. If they say they are eligible, they are eligible. Anybody can get it. Warren Buffett's child could get SCHIP. 
   More important to the fact is this, Mr. Chairman. The reason that it is important to save $100,000 from the USDA budget is it is going to cost a lot of money when this SCHIP bill passes and it pushes people out of private health insurance onto government health insurance. That is precisely what this will do. 
   Eighty-nine percent of the children in families with incomes between 300 percent and 400 percent of poverty and 95 percent of families above 400 percent of poverty have private health insurance. What this bill will do is push those children out of the private health insurance that their parents and their employers are paying for and make taxpayers pay for that health insurance. This is an enormous, enormous expansion of our government program, which takes choice away from patients on health insurance and makes them take this government one-size-fits-all, bureaucratic-driven health care. And that is why we need to support removing $100,000 from the administrative budget from the USDA, because we have a long ways to go to save the money to pay for this bill. 
   This bill, as it left the Ways and Means Committee, was $76 billion over the budget in that it violated the majority's PAYGO by $76 billion. The bill that was brought to the Energy and Commerce Committee that wasn't reported out was $91 billion PAYGO noncompliant. 
   Why is this, Mr. Chairman? Well, another reason why I think we need to save money by cutting $100,000 from the USDA's administrative budget is that they cut Medicare. Not just a little bit, but deeply. They raid the Medicare trust fund, and they cut and eviscerate the Medicare Advantage program. 
   Mr. Chairman, I bet every one of us has done a town hall meeting whereby we have heard constituents when we are talking about Medicare say: You know what? You people in Congress ought to give us the same health insurance that you have. 
   Mr. Chairman, that is exactly what Medicare Advantage is. Just like we as Members of Congress have, just like we in the Federal employment health benefit, we have the ability to choose among providers who are competing against each other for our benefit. We get to choose among providers. We have choice. That is exactly what we are giving to Medicare beneficiaries with the Medicare Advantage program. 
   These plans compete against each other for the beneficiary's business, and each Medicare beneficiary gets to choose traditional Medicare or Medicare Advantage plan, and that active choice has driven down prices and has driven up quality and customer satisfaction. 
   The bill coming to the floor this week will cut 3 million people off the Medicare Advantage program. It will say to all those people who chose to have this plan that gives them comprehensive Medicare coverage: No, you have to have the one-size-fits-all government monopoly plan. You can't have this choice that looks like what Members of Congress have. 
   That is why we need to cut $100,000 from the USDA budget, because all these deep Medicare cuts to pay for a massive expansion of a new entitlement program at a time when all these other programs are going bankrupt is a step in the wrong direction. That is why I urge adoption the gentleman's second-degree amendment, and I thank him for yielding me time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, if there was ever an equivalent of what we call a no-brainer in Congress, it is the Colombian Free Trade Agreement. Congress needs to bring this to the floor and pass this agreement. Why? Colombia already has free access to the U.S. market, but we don't have access to their market. Let me say that again. They already have free access to United States markets. We ought to be able to get the same fair trade in their market. 
   Number two, Colombia is our ally in fighting the drug trade. It is a democracy that is in a tough neighborhood that is helping us defeat the narcoterrorists, helping us cut off the drugs. 
   I had the pleasure of going to Colombia 3 weeks ago to see the progress, to see the democracy, to see the things they are doing to help individuals, to demilitarize the narcoterrorists and the paramilitary organizations. Colombia is lifting up their people from poverty. They are helping us in a difficult neighborhood. 
   More important, for our Wisconsin soybean growers, corn growers, dairy producers and manufacturers, it will create more jobs in Wisconsin because we will be able to sell more of our products to Colombia if they treat us like we are treating them. That is why we should pass the free trade agreement with Colombia.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the ranking member for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the student aid bill that passed out of the Committee on Education and Labor is nothing but a Trojan Horse for new spending. In fact, the bill creates nine, count it, nine new entitlement programs and abuses the protection of reconciliation procedures through token budgetary ``savings.'' It also favors the government-controlled and costly direct lending program over the nonprofit and commercial lenders, promoting a back-door expansion of taxpayer-financed student support and a substantial increase in taxpayer liability. 
   I want to make four basic points, Mr. Speaker: Number one, budget experts have unequivocally warned Congress, experts from the left and from the right and center and everywhere else, that the unrestrained growth in entitlement spending programs is the most  fundamental challenge and the largest threat to our Nation's long-term economic health. Comptroller General David Walker refers to the rising costs of entitlements as a ``fiscal cancer'' that threatens ``catastrophic consequences for our country'' and could ``bankrupt America.'' Despite all of these warnings, the majority not only failed to address the problem in their budget; they are choosing to make the problem even worse by creating nine new entitlement programs in this bill alone. That is nine new entitlement programs and nothing, not a zilch, of reforms. They're not expanding. They're not replacing. They are creating nine new entitlement programs. While the bill claims that some of these programs will sunset, we all know entitlement programs, once created, never die. 
   Second, this creates a new mandatory Pell Grant program. Among the new entitlement programs created is an unprecedented mandatory Pell Grant. The Pell grant is a great program, and under Republican leadership, we saw a tripling of Pell Grants from the year 1996 to 2006. Suddenly, this authorizing committee doesn't think that it is enough, and it is planning on taking the committee away from the appropriators into their jurisdiction, making an entitlement which, in my opinion, reduces congressional oversight. 
   Third, this contains no meaningful reform whatsoever. The bill contains none at all. It represents business as usual for existing programs, except that interest rates and limits in existing programs are changed to make room for more spending. Rather than maybe putting the savings in special education or deficit reduction to fund an unfunded mandate in local schools or reducing our deficit, it creates all of these new programs and this new spending. They will add from $15 billion to $32 billion in spending over the next 5 years alone on top of the already unsustainable entitlement costs we are facing today. Instead of reducing long-term spending, they are using a vehicle originally intended to limit spending to do just the opposite, to fund these new programs. 
   This bill gets Fast-Track legislation under the guise of deficit reduction, under the guise of controlling spending. Yet what we see here today is a bill that takes $18.58 billion from student loan providers only to spend more than $17.13 billion on new entitlement programs. The savings of this bill is 9 percent, a net savings of 9 percent. 
   Look at these two bars on the chart next to me. Does it look like the savings are anywhere near the new spending level, or does it look like a sliver of savings is being used to abuse the process of expedited reconciliation protection so they can create all of these new programs? 
   I offered an amendment in the Rules Committee that would have required that the bulk of these savings be going toward deficit reduction. It is the same amendment that Senator Kent Conrad, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, offered and was passed by unanimous consent on the Senate floor. I couldn't even get this amendment past the Rules Committee, much less on the floor of the House. 
   There is one last point, Mr. Speaker, that bears repeating, and that is, this favors government over markets. It increases taxpayer liabilities. It favors a government-controlled and costly direct lending program over nonprofit and commercial lenders, promoting a back-door expansion of taxpayer-financed student support. As students are pushed toward the government monopoly, the student benefits and services provided by nongovernment lenders to attract business would be lost. Further, the government-run program only handles 20 percent of the loans today. It would be overwhelmed with the new business and shut done, as it has been in the past, when large volumes shifted to the program. 
   I just want to finish with one quote from the Democrat chairman of the Budget Committee: ``The reconciliation instruction that led to this bill'' we are seeing here today is a ``stalking horse for a significant expansion of spending.'' 
   Please join me in opposing this back-door expansion of new entitlement spending. Let's use budget reconciliation for what it was made for, reducing the deficit and controlling spending, rather than creating nine new entitlements.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the gentleman for his leadership on health care issue, not only the fact that you're practicing physician, but also your leadership here in Congress, and the gentleman from New Jersey as well. 
   I just listened to this conversation you're having in my office, and I wanted to come down and just add maybe a few facts. I missed part of your debate as I walked over here. 
   But we're looking at all these various SCHIP bills to renew this program, and we looked at what the other body is doing over in the Senate. They propose a new $35 billion expansion of the program, but what we find in their legislation is that, not only do they provide a $35 billion expansion, they provide another $35 billion expansion after that in 5 years. Then to contort their budgets to make it all work, they actually say that we will cut off 4.5 million children off of SCHIP insurance to make their numbers work, meaning they have a budget gimmick. 
   The budget gimmick is, they're going to put as much money into this program as possible, but to fit in their contorted budget window, they will just assume that in about 9 years everybody's knocked off of health insurance. 
   Both you and I know that that's not going to happen, but what we have over here in this body is an even larger SCHIP expansion, a $50 billion SCHIP expansion which translates into $100 billion SCHIP expansion if their full 10-year ambitions are realized. 
   And what does that mean? What they're talking about is having all families at 400 percent of poverty, a family of four earning $80,000, being on government health care. What they're talking about is the largest expansion of Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care we have seen in decades, and this expansion of Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care is not the recipe for America.  
   All of us know from the fact that we represent Americans that the cost to health care and the cost of health insurance is an enormous crisis in America today. Finding good quality, affordable health care is a big problem. 
   And so what the majority is doing is, rather than attacking the root cause of health care inflation, rather than looking at what is producing these high costs, they're simply saying we will just pay for more of that from the government. They simply want to take more control in Washington and go down the same path, the same path where, today, we spend two-and-a-half times per person on health care of any other industrialized world; yet, today, we have 46 million people who have no health insurance. 
   We have a system today where all the fiscal experts in Washington and across America from the left and the right are telling us health care's unsustainable, the entitlements in this country are bankrupting America, that our children and grandchildren simply won't be able to pay for the government of tomorrow because of the cost of health care today and the trajectory it's on. 
   We believe in a different philosophy, a different alternative. We believe we can have affordable, accessible health care that is patient-centered, that is patient-driven and patient-controlled health care. 
   And so that is why we have a very different vision of this Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care, where the patient and his or her doctor are making the decisions in health care, where we actually go at the root cause of health care inflation and attack those causes so that people get affordable health care at a good price and good quality, and that the patients are the ones who are the drivers of the system. 
   Today, under the third party payment system we have today, either an HMO bureaucrat or a government bureaucrat's making the decisions, and we as consumers really don't care what things cost because someone else is paying the bills. We can't shop around based on quality and price because we don't know what quality and price is or we're told who and where we've got to go to by our closed network. That's a system that's unsustainable. That's a system that we have today, but this is the system that the majority wants to not only expand, but they want to turn more of it over to Washington, more of it over to government bureaucrats making our health care decisions which will cost us even more money, $50 billion to be specific, in this bill that's going through the Ways and Means Committee and Commerce Committee this week. 
   But the key here is that we have 16 percent of the GDP, 16 percent of the economic output of this country is dedicated to just health care. The Democrats want that to grow and grow and grow. What's ironic about this is the other 84 percent of health care doesn't work like the 16 percent of GDP that health care consumes, because the other 84 percent of our economy operates on the basic free market premise of competition, competition on price, competition on quality. If you don't do a good job, you don't get more business. If you're not price competitive, people aren't going to buy your product. 
   Unfortunately, that is not how health care works today, and those are the reforms that we want to inject into health care so that people can get affordable, accessible health insurance coverage, health care that is very high quality and that doesn't grow at 6, 10, 20, 18 percent of price increases every single year. 
   So we have two different philosophies, two different visions of where we want to go to with health care. We very much believe in putting the patient at the center of the equation, giving the patient and their physician control over the health care system so health care providers, rather than oligopolistic pricing, rather than just raising prices on everybody, will compete again for our business on price and quality. 
   What the majority wants to do is continue this system, where providers continue to raise prices over and over and over, third parties make the decision whether it's a bureaucrat at an insurance company or a bureaucrat in Washington, and they simply want to raise more taxes to pay for more of this. 
   In this particular bill, they want to cut Medicare patients. They want to raise taxes on low-income individuals in order to pay for this unprecedented expansion of Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care. To me, that's not the right way to go. It's not the right priorities, and what it will do will be to get more difficult for small businesses, individuals, families and even large businesses to be able to afford health insurance. 
   That's not the path to take. That's the way that's going to bankrupt this country. That's going to raise our taxes and that's going to take health care decisions away from individuals and families. 
   That's the approach that we want to go, and I just am pleased to see that my colleague from Georgia and New Jersey have joined in this debate on the floor because it's a very important debate. I would argue that the cost and affordability and accessibility of health care is the largest domestic crisis facing America today, and it's high time we do something about this. 
   I just want to thank the gentleman for including me in this debate.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. All I would say is I think most Americans realize, if you're spending someone else's money, you are not going to be judicious with that money like you are with your own, and that is what we do here in government. 
   And in health care, by asking Washington to spend our taxpayer dollars, they are not spending it like it's their own money. Think of what's happening in health care. In health care, they're spending someone else's money, our money, and they're spending it in a very irrational way, and it's giving us high health care costs. That is the basis of this third party payment system. 
   And so by simply saying we're going to raise taxes to spend more money in Washington on health care in a system that takes control of health care out of the hands of the patient, him- or herself, is just wrong. 
   I can't think of a more intimate and personal decision you experience in your life than making a decision over your own health care. Yet, they want more bureaucrats to make that decision than individuals. They want Washington to control this system. They want HMO bureaucrats to control this system and not the patient and their doctor. 
   That is the real core of the issue here, who you trust. Do you trust Washington with your money to make personal decisions for you or do you trust individuals to make them for themselves? 
   I would argue, and I think the evidence is clear, that when individuals make the decisions for themselves, when they're spending their own money, when they're talking to their doctor and making decisions on their own treatments, with affordable insurance, that the system's going to be far better, people are going to be much more satisfied, and we're going to save a lot more money and we'll have healthier outcomes.  
   So it's a real difference in philosophy, and where we see competition working, prices go down and quality goes up, even in health care. 
   I will just give one final conclusion. I used to have really bad eyes. I had 8.5 in this eye and 8.0 in this eye, which means you have really bad eyes, about 2800 vision. In the year 2000 after years and years of wearing contacts, I decided I'm going to get this LASIK surgery, and that LASIK surgery cost me $2,000 an eye for a total of $4,000 out-of-pocket discretionary spending in elective surgery. They used this Excimer Laser at the time, and it went very well. I can see your charts extremely well. I can even see the detail on your tie. You're standing about 20 feet away me, and the LASIK worked well. 
   Well, what is LASIK procedure now in the year 2007 where it was in the year 2000? It costs $800 an eye at the same place, and they've revolutionized this procedure, revolutionized this Excimer Laser they use four times over. So the procedure is much better in quality, it's much better in recovery, and it costs $800 an eye instead of $2,000 an eye. $1,600 instead of $4,000 seven years ago. Better quality, lower price, because of competition. 
   So, even in health care, with complicated things like eye surgery, you can see where competition is allowed to work, is allowed to flourish, that good results can occur, and that is the way out of this. That is the way forward, and that is the lesson that we need to learn as we go through this, instead of raising taxes on Americans and having more Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care, which has given us this double digit inflation on health care. 
   And with that, I'd be happy to just yield back to the gentleman, and I thank him for including me this time debate.

So in the bill that's coming to the House which takes SCHIP to have government, Washington-controlled, bureaucratic health care, for all children at 400 percent poverty, those families, 89 percent of those family already have health insurance. We are talking about having the government step in, raising taxes on taxpayers, and having the government take over the provision of health care for a group of families, 89 percent of whom right now have private health insurance?

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. So just to expand on this point a little bit further, we have here a situation where 89 percent of the children in these families are already covered by private health insurance that their parents had purchased, that their parents and employers probably had provided them. So what we are proposing here in this bill is that we raise taxes on the American taxpayers, and that we pay for government-controlled health care to replace that health insurance that they already have.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. So we are going to pay for a system that we already have coverage of so that we can raise taxes and have the government control their health care system. That is a system, that is a sense of priorities that just doesn't square with the American people that I know. That is not what people in Wisconsin sent me to Congress to do. 
   I don't believe the American people, if they really know the truth and the facts surrounding this issue, want to see their taxes raised so that Washington controls the health care for all of these families, for all of these children, especially when they already have health care provided to them. 
   I think people understand that if we truly have uninsured poor children, that they ought to get health insurance. I think there is no disagreement here about making sure that uninsured low-income children receive health insurance. 
   But talking about providing government-controlled health care to families that already have health insurance and raising taxes to do that, that just doesn't jive with the priorities of the American people and the American taxpayer, in my opinion.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. All three entitlement programs that are in place today, Medicare, Medicaid Social Security, all go bankrupt in about 10 years. It's because we are doubling the amount of retirees in this country at a time where we were only increasing those taxpayers into the program by 17 percent. 
   So we are seeing a 100 percent increase of the consumers of those three entitlements, while only experiencing a 17 percent increase of the taxpayers in these entitlements. That's why these three programs are going bankrupt. That's why these three programs will consume 100 percent of our budget by about 2030. By about the year 2040, when my kids are my age, they will have to pay twice the level of taxes we pay today just to keep today's Federal Government going at that time.     
   We have run this Federal Government remarkably constant at about 18 percent of GDP. We have had to tax the U.S. economy at about 18 percent of the output of the economy just to run the Federal Government for about the last 40 years. And what we are on the trajectory today because of the aging of America and way the entitlement programs are designed and the baby boomers retiring, my children will have to pay 40 percent of GDP just to keep today's Federal Government going when they are at my age group. You can't have a strong growing economy, a high standard of living. 
   So what we are in the middle of doing here, we are deciding whether or not we are going to sever that American legacy to our children and grandchildren. And the American legacy that I was taught by my parents was that you leave the country better off for the next generation than when you received it. You leave a standard of living better off for your children and grandchildren than that which you received from your parents. We are at risk of severing that legacy for our children and grandchildren if we are going to confound them to a system to where they will literally have to pay twice the amount of taxes to just the Federal Government than we do today. 
   At a time when we are in tough competition and globalization with China and India, it is impossible to pretend that we are going to be able to enjoy this kind of standard of living if we are requiring our kids and our grandkids to pay double the amount of taxes they pay today to Washington when they are in our age bracket. It will just be fundamentally irresponsible if this is the future we would confine them to, yet that is exactly the trajectory we are on today.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I just think that we have a different vision, and that vision is that we believe we can provide a system that gives us universal access to affordable health insurance for all Americans, where they and their physicians are the nucleus of the medical system. What the majority is offering is a bankrupting entitlement system, massive tax increases unprecedented, in addition to the largest tax increase in American history that they have already passed here on the floor this year, and more Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care, where bureaucrats, either HMO bureaucrats or government bureaucrats make the decisions in health care rather than patients and their physicians. We can come up with a system that is patient centered, where every American has access to affordable health insurance, where we have universal access to affordable health insurance throughout America. Or that person who has a risky health care profile, may be overweight and has diabetes, has a history of cancer in the family, we can come up with a system where that person, too, can get affordable health insurance and get access to it without having the government run the entire system, without have to go through a government or an HMO bureaucrat to make decisions on how you get your care. You ought to be able to go to your doctor and come up with a good treatment plan that works for you, and that is where the decisions ought to be made. 
   And more important to that, all the health care providers, the hospitals, the physicians, all those who are in charge of providing care in the health care system will compete against each other for the consumers and the patients' business. That is the vision we see, where everybody has access to affordable health care and it is a patient-centered system, not a government-driven, government-run, bureaucratically controlled system. And I just thank the gentleman from Georgia and the gentleman from New Jersey for taking this time to address this incredibly important issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, after careful consideration of H.R. 2, it is with great regret that I announce my opposition to this version of a minimum wage increase. 
   I believe an increase in the minimum wage should be accompanied by small business relief to offset the burden placed on U.S. employers, so these businesses can absorb the costs of an increase. 
   Last year, I supported an increase in the minimum wage because it also included tax relief measures for employers to offset the cost of the proposed minimum wage increase. It is unfortunate that House leadership, rather than bring this balanced approach to the floor for a vote, instead introduced what basically amounts to an unfunded mandate on our Nation's small businesses. 
   According to a 1999 study by the Small Business Administration, approximately 54 percent of our Nation's minimum wage earners are employed by firms who have less than 100 employees. This minimum wage increase will force our Nation's small businesses to make tough cost-cutting decisions in order to stay in business. When coupled with health care cost increases they are already facing, which the National Federation of Independent Businesses estimates at 15-20 percent, many employers will be forced to either increase the costs of their products or lay-off lower skilled workers. Both options would have detrimental effects on the substantial progress our economy is making. 
   This legislation also hurts job creation. Economists widely agree that an increase in the minimum wage without an offset for small business relief will result in much higher unemployment for workers. This is because an increase in the minimum wage also represents an increase in the costs faced by employers around the Nation. When our Nation's businesses face increases in their total cost per employee, they must often face the tough decision of either cutting jobs or reducing employee benefits such as health care, day care or vacation time as they struggle to pay for the new wage requirements. 
   In short, it is essential that any increase in the minimum wage be accompanied by tax relief or health care savings for our Nation's small businesses. Because this legislation does not include any provisions that may offset the costs it levies on our Nation's employers, I cannot support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill takes the cake. Let me tell you why this bill takes the cake. For all the talk about fiscal discipline we have received from the new majority, this bill represents an egregious violation of the budget rules that the Democrat majority set for itself just recently. 
   Last year in the 109th Congress, we decided to put in place a new tool of fiscal discipline, one that said if it is really an emergency, then it should be an emergency, but don't put pork and unrelated programs into emergency spending bills. So we set up a procedure, a procedure that set aside $6.45 billion to be reserved for domestic emergencies. If we had more money needed above that, the Budget Committee would meet, the Budget Committee would determine whether or not a particular program met the definition of a legitimate emergency, and then it would raise the corresponding amount, which then the Appropriations Committee could use. 
   Last night we met in the Budget Committee. We could have easily added a discussion or a vote on whether or not this extra $22 billion fit the definition of a legitimate emergency and raised the amount, but what did this new majority do, after putting in place these rules that we had from the 109th Congress to this 110th Congress? They waived them. They are gone. All of this talk about fiscal discipline, all this talk of PAYGO, of paying for things, what happened? Gone. Waived. 
   We added an amendment last night in the Budget Committee during the resolution markup to continue these rules next year so that we can't pork up emergency spending bills. Both parties have been guilty of this. Please note that I say that. What happened? They voted it down. So not only are we not living by the rules put in place just in January, we canceled the rules for next year. 
   So what happens? This bill puts $22 billion in unrelated, unrequested spending, having nothing to do with the war, in here. And the idea that we police emergencies, that we make sure that when you do an emergency spending bill with no offsets, that it really is an emergency, and that we police it and we look at it in the Budget Committee, gone. 
   The days of fiscal discipline have left. Last night in this budget, the  Democrat majority passed the largest tax increase in American history. The reason they passed the largest tax increase in American history is because that is the only way they can balance the budget to also accommodate all the new spending they called for, because this budget had zero savings, no controls on spending, nothing but tax increases. And now they are waiving the rules so that they can bring any emergency spending bill they want without checking as to whether or not it truly is a legitimate emergency. 
   Mr. Speaker, for this, and many, many, many other reasons, fiscal discipline, using the rules and obeying the rules and not handcuffing our generals, I ask for a ``no'' vote on this rule and a ``no'' vote on the underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 12 1/2 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, in many ways I believe our two parties agree on many things. We both agree on the need to balance the budget. We agree on the need for solid, sustained economic growth that produces an abundance of good-paying American jobs. And we agree that the looming entitlement crisis is the greatest threat to our Nation's economic and budgetary future. 
   But as this budget makes clear, there is a glaring disagreement on how best to achieve these goals, or as in the case of entitlements, even to address this challenge. 
   Republicans believe that the best America is an America free from the burden of Big Government. We believe that the nucleus of our society, the engine of economic growth in this country, is the individual, the family, the entrepreneur, not the government. And we believe that the more the Federal Government expands demands and takes from these citizens, the less freedom they will have and the less opportunity to realize their own potential. 
   Clearly, the Democrats have a much different philosophy. They believe that bigger government is better government, and they believe that the best way, the only way to meet our Nation's myriad challenges is with an ever larger Federal Government fueled by even higher spending, financed by ever higher taxes. With this budget, the Democrats have proven their commitment to this philosophy. And as it did last year, the first thing this budget does is tout a whole lot of new spending for, as we heard in last week's speeches and press conferences and as we heard today, for everyone and everything. 
   But right next to this budget's much hyped new spending priorities and promises are somewhat less advertised big new tax hikes on American workers, families and small businesses, many of whom are already struggling to make ends meet. 
   In recent months, we've seen a whole host of legitimate concerns in the economy. Growth and job creation are slowing, and many Americans are seeing their home values falling. At the same time their food, energy and health care bills are going up. The worst thing we could do to these families or the struggling economy is raise taxes. But if we pass this budget, that's exactly what we will be doing. Passing this budget means imposing on the economy and on our constituents the largest tax increase in American history. 
   One of the most ironic things about the Democrats' tax increase is that it comes on the heels of this bipartisan economic stimulus plan. Just last month, Congress passed a stimulus package to give struggling families some of their tax dollars back and provide incentives for businesses to expand and create jobs. But before we could even get these checks out the door, the Democrats unveiled this budget that will take all that money back plus demand hundreds of billions more new higher taxes. Far from consistent tax policy, that's not even coherent tax policy. Is $600 really going to make a difference to somebody in Janesville, Wisconsin with a tax increase of nearly $3,000 per year looming on the horizon? Does a one-time check of $1,200 really make up for later raising taxes on that same family of four by $6,000 each and every year? 
   This budget will raise marginal tax rates on all income taxpayers, including low-income individuals who are benefiting from the 10 percent bracket. This budget will slash the $1,000 per child tax credit in half. It will reinstate the marriage tax penalty. It will make it that much harder for families to pay their mortgages, pay their grocery bills and send their kids to college.     
   Unlike the Democrats' rhetoric would have you believe, we are not just talking about hurting rich people. I know a whole lot of people back in Wisconsin who paid taxes, who are married and who have kids who do not consider themselves anything close to rich. But this budget's tax cuts will hit every single American taxpayer, whether or not they checked some imaginary ``rich'' box on their tax form. 
   Now, again, my friends on the other side of the aisle insist this isn't their plan, that they're really not going to raise your taxes. They've got all of these groups from the left saying that's not happening. But yet they keep writing those tax hikes in their budget. Why? Because their numbers would never work. Their budget would never show balance. And without those massive tax hikes, this budget requires, includes, assumes, mandates a $683 billion tax increase over just 5 years. 
   First, because it exhumes the complete expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax laws. And because of their own PAYGO rule, just to continue those same laws which are already in place, they're required to offset those current provisions with an equal tax increase of $683 billion. So whatever way you cut it, you can't avoid it. It is a tax increase, a big one, the biggest we've ever seen. 
   And second, because they're already committed, every one of those tax dollars, to pay for their new spending. Beyond admitting the burden these tax hikes will put on our constituents and the economy, this Congress has got to understand that we will never rid our government of deficits and debt by simply raising taxes. 
   Our problem has never been that Americans aren't sending enough of their taxpayer dollars to Washington. Our problem has always been, and is clearly today, that Washington is spending too much money and far too quickly to be sustained. 
   But for all of the Democrats' purported concern about the deficit, all they've chosen to do since they came into the majority is spend more and more money. This year's budget would certainly continue that trend. The Democrats' budget proposes to increase entitlement spending by untold amounts of the use of numerous reserve funds. At the same time, they want to increase nonsecurity discretionary spending by more than $22 billion over the President's request. 
   But even while demanding billings and new spending, they fail to do anything to reduce the wasteful spending already included in these budgets. In fact, last year, the majority's appropriations bill included over 11,000 earmarks at a cost of nearly $15 billion to taxpayers. 
   This year, the majority has already rejected Republican calls for an earmark moratorium or even earmark reform to reduce the wasteful, self-serving spending. In this regard, we can expect more of the same: another year and another choice by the majority of pork over paychecks. But for all of the additional spending, the worst thing that is not in this budget is not what it does, but the many things it fails to do. 
   First, I think it's fair to note that if we apply the Democrats' own standards, this budget doesn't even achieve balance. That's because this budget suffers from the same shortcomings that the Democrats criticized the President's budget for doing just weeks ago. 
   This budget doesn't pay for the AMT fix and it doesn't pay for the war, as the chairman so eloquently criticized the Bush budget just a couple weeks ago. As a result, this chart shows that this budget doesn't really balance in 2012; instead, it remains in the red for as far as the eye can see. 
   Finally, for the second straight year, the majority budget fails to include even one meaningful reform to address our entitlement crisis. This means that even if this budget were to balance in 2012, it would be quickly driven right back into deficit by these programs' current path of growth. By ignoring this problem, this budget ignores every one of the witnesses we've called before the Budget Committee who have warned that our largest entitlement programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, simply cannot be sustained as currently structured. 
   These experts have told us unequivocally that if we fail to reform these programs, not only will they grow themselves right into extinction, they will impose a crushing burden on our debt, on our budget, and all but eliminate our Nation's ability to compete in the global marketplace. 
   Our Nation's chief accountant, GAO Comptroller General Walker, recently  testified that the long-term fiscal obligation of the U.S. Government is $53 trillion, or about $180,000 in unfunded liability for every man, woman, and child in the United States. It is $180,000 per person. You can buy really nice homes in Wisconsin for $180,000. 
   And we know that this problem, once dismissed as somewhere off in the future, is already upon us. On February 12 of this year, last month, the first baby boomer, a retired teacher from Maryland, received her first Social Security check. And right on her heels are over 80 million other baby boomers who will qualify for both Social Security and Medicare right after her. And just last month, the Medicare trigger was set off sending a clear warning shot to Congress that we must act immediately to get this program on a sustainable path. 
   In fact, by doing nothing, by ignoring this problem for another 5 years, the Democrats' budget will add another $14 trillion in unfunded liability for future generations. And this is just in the next 5 years. Over the long run, the problem will grow much worse than that. 
   As this chart shows, by the year 2040, our three largest entitlement programs alone will consume 20 percent of our economy, equivalent to the cost of the entire Federal Government today. By this time, the overall size of government will consume 40 percent of our Nation's GDP, more than double the historic average of 18.3 percent. 
   What that means in real life is my three children, who are 3, 4, and 6 years old, by the time they are exactly my age, they will have to pay twice the level of taxes we pay today just to keep today's Federal Government afloat for them at that time. Add no new programs and take none away, for my three kids, when they are my age, they will have to bear twice the burden we bear today just to pay the bills of the Federal Government before they can keep any money left in their own paychecks. 
   The only choice we would leave them would be to pay the crippling tax burden or simply accept the fact that their Nation can no longer afford health care, education, or even defense or national security. I can't imagine any one of us who finds that kind of future acceptable, but this is exactly what this budget confines them to do. 
   Everyone talks about this common entitlement as our greatest challenge, and rightfully so, but it is also our greatest opportunity. Today, with this budget, we have an opportunity to save our largest retirement and health safety net programs from financial ruin. We can make these programs better, stronger, more responsive, more resilient, more sustainable, and more in line with the way our economy works today. 
   And if we act now, we have the opportunity to make these reforms in a rational, well-thought-out way. We don't have to wait for the crisis to hit. But 
   regrettably, that's exactly what the Democratic majority would have us do. With this budget, they are simply accepting that we are going to continue to pile up massive amounts of debt for our children and we are going to force them to pay double what we do in taxes to keep these programs afloat in the future. 
   In closing, let me say that I have come to know and respect many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. In particular, I think the gentleman from South Carolina is the definition of a true Southern gentlemen. He's a class-act man, and I don't have any doubt in my mind that every one of them on the other side of the aisle are just as well intentioned and just as concerned about our Nation's future as anyone is on this side of the aisle. 
   Every one of us wants our Nation to remain strong, safe, prosperous, and free today and well into the future. Every one of us wants to pass on to the next generation a world that is even better than the one our parents gave us. By giving us these jobs, by sending us to Congress, that's exactly what our constituents entrusted us to do. 
   With that great responsibility in mind, I will be opposing this budget that we are considering today. This budget misses an historic opportunity to put our Nation on a better path. Instead, they choose the path of Big Government, higher spending, higher taxes, higher debt. I can only hope that this Congress will choose to change its course before it's too late, because if we fail, we may be the first generation to sever that precious, fragile American legacy of leaving a better standard of living for future generations. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds only to say that this budget that's before us raises the national debt by $646 billion this year, the largest annual increase ever. And that's $14 trillion of unfunded debt to just two programs, Medicare and Social Security. 
   With that, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina, the vice ranking member of the Budget Committee, Mr. Barrett.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes, 2 minutes to say, ``wow.'' We just heard from the sort of self-proclaimed fiscal conservative wing of the Democratic Party talking about, while it's wrong to increase debt, it's bad to send this to future generations, and then to have all of them come here and say how great it is that they're spending so much more money on all these new programs in their budget. 
   We've also heard another claim, that there are no tax increases in this budget. Well, I've got the budget right here. The budget is a series of numbers, and the numbers are crystal clear. The numbers raise taxes. 
   We heard from two gentlemen from Florida, two gentlemen from Tennessee and the gentlelady from South Dakota. The average annual tax increase on the average taxpayer in Arkansas is $2,462 per year. The average tax increase for the taxpayer under this budget in Florida is $3,040. The average annual tax increase for the average taxpayer in South Dakota is $2,596. And the average tax increase for the average taxpayer in Tennessee is $2,611. 
   Now there is this thing at the end of this budget resolution in section 5, and it's a policy title. And it says, basically, we don't want to raise these taxes, we hope not to do it, but this resolution, Madam Chairman, is worth no more than the paper it's printed on. It's simply a sense of the Congress resolution. It's the legislative equivalent of passing a bill and saying, ``Have a nice day.'' 
   This budget unequivocally, extremely clearly, relies on, depends on the largest tax increase in American history. Repealing the marriage tax penalty relief, raising income tax rates across the board, cutting in half the marriage tax penalty, bringing back the death tax in full force, raising the dividends in the capital gains tax. Real taxpayers paying really high taxes, about $3,000 on average: $2,400 in Arkansas, $3,000 in Florida, $2,600 in South Dakota, $2,600 in Tennessee. That's real money. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana, the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. McCrery.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. If the gentleman would yield, I simply wanted to chime in and compliment the gentlelady as well, my friend from Wisconsin. She and I coauthored an amendment to this budget resolution on this issue. 
   It makes no sense for child support payments not to go to the children. That is unfortunately what is happening today. And I would very much like to work with the gentlelady and anybody who is interested in coming up with the offsets in the Ways and Means Committee, from which this jurisdiction derives, to find a way to fix this problem. I think this is an area that has wide bipartisan support. And this is one of those areas where I surely would like to think we can come up with the savings to fix this injustice. 
   I appreciate the gentleman yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. 
   Mr. Chairman, I first want to start off by congratulating the chairman of the Budget Committee, a good man, a man I have a lot of respect for who has a hardworking staff and a diligent staff. I want to compliment them. These budget resolutions are not easy to write. 
   He has a tough job because he has to defend this budget. This is a budget I wouldn't want to come to the floor to defend. I just have to bring one point to bear, and I do so respectfully. You cannot say that you are balancing the budget and not raising taxes. It is illogical and axiomatically impossible. Let me explain why. 
   This red line is the baseline that the Democrats are using for their budget. It is what we also refer to as the CBO baseline. This green line is the baseline minus the tax increases. They are using the red line, not the green line. This means in order for them to achieve a balanced budget, what must happen, what is required to happen, what has to happen, all of these taxes have to be raised, specifically by $683 billion over the next 5 years. 
   Now, my friend from New Jersey, another very conscientious, skillful Member, said that was a tax vote he regretted not taking. And the Senator from New York at that time, Senator Moynihan, said that was the largest tax increase in American history. That was $240 billion. This one is $683 billion. This is the largest tax increase in American history. 
   The point is this: You cannot claim you are balancing the budget and not raising taxes because you are relying on these very tax increases to balance the budget. That is what this budget does. Now, no amount of reserve funds, no amount of senses of Congress, no amounts of ``we have delayed the decision on the tax cuts for now'' gets them out of this bind. They can't. It is impossible. You have to have it one way or the other. Either you are not balancing the budget or you are not raising these taxes because, Mr. Chairman, they are not saving any money. There is no savings in this budget. 
   The piece of paper I have in my hand is more valuable than the amount of savings they have in this budget. This paper, may it cost 1, 2 pennies. That is more money than they are saving in this budget over the next 5 years. In fact, they are expanding spending. They are increasing discretionary spending by $280 billion. What is worse is they are going to add, in just two programs, an unfunded liability of $14 trillion, to just two programs, Medicare and Social Security. 
   Let's look at the Medicare program. Today, the Medicare unfunded liability, according to David Walker, our GAO Comptroller General, is at $34 trillion. That is an average per household bill of $300,050. Every household in America right now, if we want to make Medicare whole for my children when they need it, 300 grand. 
   Under this budget, because they do nothing, they are adding $11 trillion to that liability. That is $395,650, almost $400,000 for one household to cover Medicare so my children can maybe get it. That's for our kids. That is wrong.     
   We have got to address these issues.  
   Now, Mr. Chairman, surely, there's waste in government. Surely, there's efficiencies we can get. But this budget concludes that there is not. This budget is basically saying, Washington's not wasting any money. All of these earmarks, the 11,000 we passed last year, are perfect, they're justified; we should do 11,000 more. And there's no waste, fraud or abuse anywhere in the Federal Government. In fact, they're doing such a good job in Washington spending our tax dollars, let's give them $280 billion more to spend. And on top of it, given the fact that our entitlements are going bankrupt, given the fact that we have an unsustainable course, let's just add more to the debt; and we're going to raise taxes while we do it. But we won't tell people. We'll pass this kind of cute reserve fund, sense of the Congress that says we really don't want to raise those taxes, but we're balancing the budget. That means you're raising taxes if you're going to balance the budget. 
   But let's look at the brass tacks. And this is what I want to ask the American people. Can you afford this budget? 
   People are struggling right now. People are losing jobs. We just finished 52 consecutive months of positive job growth, very impressive growth. Finished, I said. The last couple of months they've been bad months. 
   Also, prices; the cost of living is going up to America, the cost of health insurance, the cost of food, the cost of filling your gas tank when you take your kids to school, the cost of sending your kids to college. The cost of living is higher and higher, and people's pay checks are not getting as far along as they used to. 
   And so what does this budget do? It raises their taxes. It says you're going to have to send, on average, three more grand per person to Washington because we don't think Washington has enough of your money. We think Washington's great. There's no waste, there's no inefficiency, no fraud. We, in fact, need more of your taxpayer dollars, you, American men and women of America. 
   So I'd like to know, is that what America wants? Tell us. Call us, e-mail us. Call your Congressman. Because here's what this bill will do specifically. 116 million taxpayers will see their taxes on average go up $1,800; 84 million women will sustain, on average, a tax increase of $2,121; 48 million married couples will incur an average tax increase of over $3,000. Taxes will increase by an average of $2,323 for 43 million families with children. Some 12 million single women with children will see their taxes increase on average by $1,091. For 18 million elderly individuals taxes will increase by an average of $2,181. Tax bills for 27 million small business owners will rise on average by more than $4,000. And more than 6 million taxpayers who previously owed no taxes at all will become subject to the individual income tax as consequence of these tax increases. 
   Mr. Chairman, we had an opportunity here. We had an opportunity to do something that I felt would be good and bipartisan. I've heard my colleagues on the other side talk about the need to do this. 
   We had all these witnesses come to the Budget Committee, saying we've got to get our fiscal house in order, that we owe the next generation a debt-free Nation, that we owe them the mission of health and retirement being fulfilled, which means reforming our entitlement programs. 
   This budget says for the next 5 years, let's not do any of it. Let's make sure that we're on the glide path so that our kids will pay literally twice what we pay today in taxes, just for our Federal Government today to be there for them when they're our age. 
   This is a lost opportunity. Under this budget, the unfunded obligation that are Medicare and Social Security themselves go up 37 percent, $14 trillion. I'm upset at the debt that was racked up lately, but it pales in comparison to the debt that this budget proposes to rack up. 
   So what we really ought to be doing, Mr. Chairman, is we ought to be fixing this budget process, having real budget discipline, real spending caps. We ought to be making reform decisions. And the last thing we ought to be doing in this time of high prices, a tough standard of living to maintain, in this time of economic downturn which quite possibly could come into recession, the last thing we ought to be doing is raising taxes. That is what this budget does. 
   We will propose a different alternative tomorrow. We will propose a budget that balances the budget without raising taxes by controlling spending. And even in doing that, spending will still go up one year after the other. Instead of spending $15.8 trillion over the next 5 years, we're going to propose to spend $15.3 trillion. And by simply doing that, by simply exerting a little bit of discipline, we're going to make sure that we're not raising these taxes, and we're going to repeal the alternative minimum tax. 
   One more thing, Mr. Chairman. This earmark problem is getting out of control. Earmarks are an abuse. Some are worthy, some are right, but a lot of them aren't. We've got to control this. We are proposing a real earmark moratorium. 
   More importantly, we are saying let's take a timeout from earmarks and let's save that money. Our proposal tomorrow will not only have an earmark moratorium, it will save the money from an earmark moratorium. And if Congress just says no to earmarks for 1 year, you know what we can do? We can make permanent the child tax credit and the repeal of the marriage tax penalty. We can say, pass up your earmarks for a year in Congress and don't tax people for getting married. Pass up your earmarks for a year in Congress and don't cut the child tax credit in half. 
   These are the choices we are being confronted with. These are the choices that we must make. These are the values that we believe. We believe we owe our children a growing economy, a future of a higher prosperity, of a higher standard of living, and one in which the promise of health and retirement security is actually sustainable, is actually made good upon. 
   That's not what this budget does. There's no way you can split these hairs with the reserve funds, senses of Congress, flowery Washington rhetoric. This budget contains the largest tax increase in American history, not just on wealthy people, on all people. That's wrong. It's not right. We shouldn't do it because Washington doesn't have a tax revenue problem, Washington has a spending problem. Unfortunately, the Democrat budget makes it worse by spending even more money. 
   There is waste in Washington. There is waste in earmarks. There are entitlements that are out of control. We should confront those, instead of just throwing more money at Washington, because you know where that money comes from? It comes from the hard working men and women of America. It comes from families, it comes from entrepreneurs, it comes from small businesses, it comes from the individual of this country. That's wrong. They should be able to keep more of their own money and we should be able to clean up government. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this budget. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 312, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are about to decide which path we want to take in America. We are about to decide what budget is right for Americans. Well, let's think about what Americans are facing today as we consider their budget for the next 5 years. What's happening in America today? 
   Well, joblessness is up. The economy is in a downturn. It may be going into a recession. Prices are up. People are having a hard time to afford the cost of living. Gas prices are at an all-time high. Health care costs are at an all-time high and growing very fast. Home heating costs are very high. And it's a lot more expensive just to pay for food today because food prices are up. So the question is, as we debate the values that are underneath this budget, can the American people afford this Democratic budget? 
   Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle are going to try to say all day today they're not raising taxes. We really aren't, believe us, trust us. 
   Well, my friends, numbers don't lie. And this budget is a series of numbers. And the numbers they're bringing before this House in their budget resolution requires, assumes, banks, plans on the largest tax increase in American history. 
   When we looked at the 1993 budget that passed last decade, even then Senator Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, a very, very wise man, a statesman, adored by both sides, said at that time that that was the largest tax increase in history. That tax increase was $241 billion. Under the same logic, under the same math, under the same process that we have here today, the tax increase in this budget is $683 billion. 
   But let's look at what kinds of taxes we're talking about. And this begs the question, can the American people afford this budget? This increases the marriage penalty in 2 1/2 years. Can the American people afford that? It cuts the $1,000 child tax credit in half. It eliminates the marriage penalty tax relief and increases marginal tax rates. It eliminates capital gains and dividends relief, and it brings back the death tax. 
   Let's take a look at what the numbers are. Income tax rates go up across the board to the top rate of almost 40 percent. Capital gains and dividends, which are the taxes on our pensions and our savings and our 401(k)s, go up across the board as high as 40 percent. The death tax comes back in to 55 percent. The marriage penalty comes and hits an average of $1,400 per couple. The child tax credit goes from $1,000 down to $500. And the lowest tax bracket goes from 10 percent up to 15 percent. 
   Let me just give you some numbers of what this will mean to average Americans. Roughly 116 million taxpayers will see their taxes increase, on average, by $1,833. An estimated 84 million women would sustain, on average, a tax increase of $2,121. Approximately 48 million married couples would incur an average tax increase of over $3,000. Taxes would increase by an average of $2,323 for 43 million families with children. Some 12 million single women with children would see their taxes increase, on average, by $1,091. For 18 million elderly individuals, taxes would increase, on average, $2,181. And the tax bills for 27 million small business owners would rise, on average, by more than $4,000. More than 6 million taxpayers who previously owed no taxes at all would become subject to the individual income tax as a consequence of the tax increase in this budget. 
   These aren't rich people. These are ordinary Americans working paycheck to paycheck trying to get by. The problem we have today is our paychecks aren't going as far as they did before because we have rising gas prices, high home heating costs, high health care costs. 
   So the question is, can the American people afford this budget? 
   I ask people watching this to send us your e-mail. Give us a call. Call your Member of Congress and tell us, is that what you want us to do? 
   And the more important question is, should we balance the budget? Yes.  Both Republicans and Democrats say we ought to balance the budget. Here's the difference: We believe we ought to balance the budget by controlling spending, not by raising taxes. And, unfortunately, what the Democrats choose to do is increase spending and taxes. 
   So their budget will show, by the Congressional Budget Office in their numbers, they will achieve balance. The way they achieve balance is they spend an extra $280 billion over 5 years, but they increase taxes a whole lot more than that to get to a balanced budget. 
   What's more important about this budget for our children and grandchildren is not the economic damage that would be done by this budget with these huge tax increases for every income taxpayer, for married people, for people with children, for small businesses, for farmers, for investors. What really is troubling about this budget is not as much as what is in this budget, the largest tax increase in history. What's really almost the most troubling about this budget is doing nothing, doing nothing to save money, doing nothing to reform our entitlement programs. We just heard my friend from Texas. I'm on two committees with the gentleman. He said a $3 trillion increase in debt over the last 5 years. This budget proposes, in just two programs, to increase the debt by $14 trillion. 
   Let me go through that again. By doing nothing to rescue and save Social Security and Medicare, this budget proposes, by its own virtue, to increase the debt to those two programs by $14 trillion. 
   We have an obligation to the next generation to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars. We have an obligation to the next generation to leave them with a better fiscal state. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle have chosen to walk away from that responsibility. They have chosen to have more money to spend today, to raise taxes, and to make matters worse for the next generation. 
   We think that's the wrong way to go. We don't think the American people at this time of economic downturn, at this time of high prices, we can afford a tax increase of all times. We don't think there ever should be a time where we increase taxes, because you know what, Mr. Speaker? Washington doesn't have a tax revenue problem; Washington has a spending problem. And our friends on the other side of the aisle are making it worse by not only increasing spending but even increasing taxes. 
   That's the wrong recipe for this Congress. That's the wrong message to send our children and grandchildren. And that's the dead wrong thing to do at a time of high prices and economic downturn. 
   I think we should vote this budget down and do so on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and the American taxpayer so we can give a chance to our economy to actually grow. You're not going to grow an economy by giving us the largest tax increase in American history. That's for certain.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (PENSION PROTECTION TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3361, the Pension Protection Technical Corrections Act. Given the complexity and broad reach of the Tax Code and ERISA, and the difficult interactions between them, the measure before us is necessary to correct drafting and other errors in the Pension Protection Act of 2006.  
   Passage of the legislation will give certainty to plan administrators, individuals, as well as government regulators and ensure the intent of Congress is fully reflected in the governing statutes. 
   The technical corrections process is a complicated one which ensures all views are heard and which brings in experts from the relevant committees and Federal agencies. 
   In this case, it means that bipartisan staff from both the Ways & Means Committee and the Education & Labor Committee were joined by their counterparts from the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate HELP Committee as well as representatives from the Treasury and Labor Departments and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 
   Led by the staff of the Joint Tax Committee, the technical corrections process gives all participants a chance to review proposed changes to ensure they reflect the intent of Congress and do not change the substance of the law itself. 
   There can be disagreements about what should and should not be considered technical. Each participant in the process has a veto. Thus, only items that were unanimously viewed as correcting a drafting mistake are included in the measure being debated today. 
   There is one item, called smoothing, that we viewed as a particularly important technical correction but is not included in this bill because one of the parties to the process said it was not technical. Regardless of whether smoothing is technical, it is extremely important and must be passed quickly. Given that smoothing was excluded from this bill, I urge that we take up a smoothing-only bill on suspension this week. 
   It is my understanding that the Joint Tax Committee will be publishing on their web page a complete summary of these items, and I encourage interested individuals to review it. 
   Two final observations, Mr. Speaker, on the differences between this bill and the version passed by the Senate in December. 
   First, since the Senate bill was passed, several additional technical items were identified, reviewed by the participants, and agreed to as being technical and conforming changes. 
   Second, the Senate-passed bill included smoothing and a second provision that is no longer relevant. 
   I hope that the Senate takes up the bill that we are passing today so that it can go to the President and be signed into law. I also hope that both houses quickly pass a smoothing-only bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, while hardly glamorous, the technical corrections process is an important one, providing clarity and certainty to plan administrators and the millions of Americans who rely on these plans to help provide a secure retirement. 
   I support passage of the bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, this bill and the bill that just passed before us is a fiscal Frankenstein. It is a typical pattern: more budget gimmicks on spending, more tax increases. 
   Last week, a farm bill passed. Budget gimmicks, tax increases. Earlier this week, the SCHIP bill passed. Budget gimmicks, tax increases. Today, right now, these energy bills are passing. What are they? Budget gimmicks, tax increases. 
   Right now, the bill that just passed before had $6 billion in savings that were used last week in last week's farm bill, all to give the appearance that the majority is keeping their word on their PAYGO. 
   More importantly, these bills, in addition to their budget gimmicks, raise taxes on consumers. This will cost our constituents at their pocketbooks and at the pump. 
   The worst part of this bill, I think, aside from the fact that it seeks to pick winners and losers in the marketplace, to do nothing, nothing, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, to reduce our independence, it has $6 billion of walk-around money, of green pork, for large city mayors and Governors. No accountability. Just as long as it is in the spirit of green, in the spirit of, you know, energy, you get the money. 
   Every time we have ever built a new program before, as this one does, you have example after example of waste, fraud and abuse. It doesn't do a thing to help the environment, it doesn't do a thing to help our fiscal balance sheet, but it does everything to create a new program that wastes money, that requires higher taxes. 
   We are seeing a consistent pattern here: more spending gimmicks and more tax increases. These tax increases will raise prices. They will raise prices on energy. They will raise gas prices. 
   This is a missed opportunity, and the missed opportunity is we could have worked together to make ourselves less dependent on foreign oil, do a better job on energy conservation, and advance the cause for renewables. 
   Sadly, this does not do it, because it is more budget gimmicks and spending increases.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to this for a number of reasons. Does anybody on Earth think that by raising taxes on oil and gas that we're not going to raise prices on oil and gas? Does anybody believe that we're not going to raise gas prices with this bill? Does anybody believe that we're not going to make it more expensive for people to heat their homes? Does anybody believe we're not going to make us more dependent on foreign oil? That's what this bill does. This bill raises gas prices, makes it more expensive for us to heat our homes, make us more dependent on foreign oil, and less competitive internationally. 
   It could have been a good bill. It could have done more to make us less dependent on foreign oil. It could have helped us do more to make us energy independent, renewable. And why are we raising all these taxes? So we can come up with a new pork barrel spending program to give to big cities to spend as they wish. 
   Why on Earth would we do that when we're going to make our constituents pay higher gas prices? The intentions are noble. The delivery is bad. This policy has been tried before, and it has failed. 
   I urge defeat of this bill because it is a missed opportunity. It's a missed opportunity to a real bipartisan success, like we had in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, where we invested in hydrogen, in renewable energy, in conservation and, yes, in more domestic production. That's what we should do. You can't do one and not the other. 
   We need to produce more energy here so we're less dependent on foreign oil. That's very important. This does none of that. It goes in the wrong direction. 
   We need to incentivize conservation. There's some conservation incentives here. We need to do more on renewables and do it in such a way where it's not picking winners and losers; where the best technology gets funded. Sadly, this bill says we're going to pick this technology and not that technology, and by doing so, we're hurting tomorrow's breakthroughs, tomorrow's innovations. 
   What we really ought to do is make us less dependent on foreign oil, lower gas prices, lower home heating costs, more conservation, and not pick winners and losers, and incentivize tomorrow's breakthroughs so the genius of America can continue to expand and come up with those new technologies we never heard of before. 
   Sadly, this prevents that from happening. It disincentivizes that. I urge a ``no'' vote because we shouldn't be raising taxes, doing budget gimmicks and making it more expensive for us to take our kids to school, to go to work and heat our homes.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (BALANCE BUDGET BY CONTROLLING SPENDING -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, the battle of ideas is alive and well here in the House of Representatives where we have two different parties with two different philosophies; and nowhere is that more clear than in the budget debate that is occurring today. 
   In the budget that passed the House before the Easter recess, the majority passed the largest tax increase in American history. I just held 34 town hall meetings in my First Congressional District of Wisconsin, and my constituents are telling me they don't want to see the per-child tax credit get cut in half. They don't want to see the marriage penalty come back. They don't want to see income tax rates raised across the board. They don't want to see the death tax come back in full force.  
   The tax cuts that passed in 2001 and 2003 created 7.6 million new jobs. We don't need tax increases; but, unfortunately, the budget that the majority passed here does just that. It gets rid of all of that tax relief that created all of these jobs, and it gives the American people the largest tax increase in American history. I think it is wrong. 
   We on this side of the aisle, the minority, we believe in a different path: Balance the budget by controlling spending and keep taxes low. That's the way to go, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, we hear this word ``cut'' all the time. Cut. Cut. Cut. Only here in Congress, only here in Washington is spending the same amount of money this year as we spent last year a deep horrible, awful, disastrous cut. We are proposing to spend almost 10 percent more next year. 
   How many family budgets went up by this much money, an 8.9 percent increase? How much did wages go up this year? How much did pay raises go up? Did they go up 8.9 percent for most families this year from last year? No. So why should we be giving government such a huge pay raise? 
   What we are doing by doing this is we are taking more money away from the paychecks of working men and women to give government a bigger paycheck, to give government a bigger pay raise. 
   Mr. Chairman, what this is about is about trying to bring discipline to the way we spend taxpayer dollars. The budget we are operating under today contains within it the largest tax increase in American history. The budget we are operating on today says that all those tax cuts that expire at the end of the decade, we want them to expire. And do you know what? We are going to start spending that money now. 
   So the reason this amendment is important, and other amendments like this are important, is we are trying to reduce the spending appetite of government, of Washington, so we can make sure that we don't raise those taxes. Because if the incumbent budget resolution actually fulfills its promise, this money will get spent and those taxes will get raised. That is what this is about. 
   It is different approaches, different philosophies. We don't believe in all these huge increases: triple the rate of inflation, triple the rate of our constituents' ability to pay their taxes. We believe government should live within its means. 
   Let me be the first to say that both parties have done a lousy job of keeping track of this over the years. Both parties have some of the blame to share. But in the last couple of years, this party, which is now in the minority, did do a better job of holding the line on domestic spending. This party did take on entitlements. This party did stand against tax increases. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, you see here an emerging difference between whether or not we ought to have the largest tax increase in history and whether or not we ought to be increasing spending, and not at the rate of inflation, not at twice the rate of inflation, but at three times the rate of inflation. 
   I am pleased that this committee allocation is under the President's request. I wish all the subcommittee allocations were underneath the President's request, including the Defense.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this debate is really puzzling. If this was a status quo bill, if this was the same law that we already have in place, no new people, then why does it cost $130 billion in more money? Why does it cost so much more? 
   This bill goes way beyond insuring low-income children. If this was all about just giving health insurance to uninsured low-income children, no problem. You would have a near unanimous vote out of here. That's not what this bill does. 
   They say this bill doesn't have those income limits. This bill has no income limits. This bill says to the States, give it to whomever you want, no asset test, no income limits. That's why this test costs so much money.  
   In fact, the Congressional Budget Office is saying in analyzing this bill that they will push 2.4 million kids off of private insurance onto government health care, not my statistics, the Congressional Budget Office. 
   They are already acknowledging that this is more about insuring low-income, uninsured kids. This is really about putting people on government health care, especially those who even have health insurance today. 
   My friends, our constituents, the U.S. taxpayer, don't want to pay for health care that's already being paid for by someone else. But that is what this bill does. This bill creates an enormous budget mess. 
   I find it kind of ironic that the majority that could not find $1 worth of entitlement savings in their budget comes to this floor with $200 billion of cuts to Medicare to pay for expanding this new program. When it came time to reducing the deficit and keeping taxes low, no savings to be found. Now, hey, $200 billion in Medicare cuts, cut 3 million seniors off the Medicare Advantage program to grow a new entitlement. 
   Yes, this is a new entitlement program, a new entitlement for States. It gives them a never-ending spigot of new money. But what's so, so critical, what's so hypocritical about this bill is, after cranking up spending for 5 years, after putting 5 million children on health care, kicking 2.4 million off of private health insurance, what do they do to conform with their PAYGO rules? What do they do to shoehorn this huge program into their budget? They just kick everybody off. They just rescind the program. They just turn the spigot money off. 
   Does anybody believe that after putting 5 million people on health insurance we are just going to take it away from them in 2014? No, we're not. 
   So this whole thing really is a bug sham. What they are saying is, with this legislation, we want to give 5 million people health insurance for kids, no matter what income limit. But, in 2014, we are taking it away from them. That's crazy. That's not budgeting. That's creating a new program, a new entitlement, and not paying for it. 
   This puts our fiscal house, which is already messed up, in serious jeopardy. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I'd like to get into this tax issue. I think we just heard this, there's no tax increase in this budget. You're going to hear that claim over and over and over. 
   The last speaker just mentioned that they are preserving some tax relief for some people, marriage penalty, for child tax credit, the 10 percent bracket. What they mean, they're saying, they're acknowledging, I'll give them credit on the face of it, they are going to preserve some tax relief and prevent those tax increases from coming. 
   What that means is they are going to let all these other tax cuts expire. More importantly, the fact is they are banking on the fact, they are requiring all those other tax cuts to expire and all those taxes to increase. 
   Numbers don't lie, Mr. Speaker, and what a budget is is basically a page full of numbers, and the numbers don't lie. 
   This chart shows you how it works. The lower line, the green line, is the line that our budget used, which assumes and requires the extension of all the tax cuts, the per child tax credit, the income tax rates, the abolishment of the death tax, cap gains, dividends, all tax cuts. The dotted red line is what the Democrats are using in their budget, and that line says they're going to raise all those taxes, marginal rates, across the board, except we hope not to raise the child tax credit tax or the marriage penalty tax or the 10 percent bracket. And we're putting a trigger in the law, and I call this the trigger tax, and that's the red line, the solid red line. And that is in the year 2010, if the Treasury Department says the surplus will be big enough in 2012 that we the government can afford tax cuts for some people, these three tax cuts, then they will have their tax cuts. 
   But here's the vicious cycle that we're going into and the vicious cycle is this. Their budget starts with a new $24 billion spending spree just next year in domestic spending. Then they have a $217 billion tax increase in their budget. Then they have 23 promises, 23 wish lists, 23 reserve funds that amount to a call to spend another $190 billion.     
   They are going to have to raise taxes to pay for all of that. That's going to have the fact that there is no entitlement reforms. What their budget says is, tax more, spend more; tax more, spend more. Then come 2010, when those surpluses don't materialize, because we have done all this spending, they won't even get those three tax cuts that they want to extend, and this budget will go from having the second largest tax increase in American history to having the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Let's look at what the true intention of this budget was when it passed the House just a month ago. The budget that passed the House a month ago had a $392.5 billion tax increase in it. All the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that got us out of recession, that created 7.6 million new jobs, that gave us 3 years of double digit revenue growth, they wanted to get rid of it. 
   Then in conference with the other body, with the Senate, they agreed to the Senate to say, okay, we won't raise every one of these taxes, we would like to preserve three of those tax cuts, but raise all the rest. So they have a $217 billion tax increase in this budget. 
   But that's not even enough, because their trigger tax will say, if they don't spend as much money now as they are saying now they want to spend, then maybe the taxpayer will get some of those tax benefits. But if they don't, then we are back to a $400 billion tax increase. 
   The point is this, this is a vicious cycle of tax taxing and spending. The biggest problem with this budget is not what it includes, it's what it doesn't include. It doesn't include any spending control at all. There is no control on spending anywhere in the government, at all, anywhere, no control, no reform of our entitlement programs, even though witness after witness after witness, Democrats and Republicans, the left and right came to Congress and told us, you guys in Congress better get a handle on entitlements. You better get a handle on the fact that next year the baby boomers start retiring, and we are not ready for them. They say for 5 years let's do nothing, but let's just spend more money. 
   The worst thing we could do is put this budget on a trajectory of more spending and more taxes. What they will do, they will compromise the economic growth we have had over the last 3 years. They will compromise the recipe for success that have given us 3 years of double-digit revenue growth, 7.6 million new jobs. 
   To tie it all up, they came into the majority 5 months ago declaring new fiscal rules, more fiscal security, PAYGO, pay-as-you-go principle. So what are they doing in this budget? They are getting rid of PAYGO. In this budget, they are turning their PAYGO rules upside down. 
   This budget actually revises and turns upside down their entire PAYGO principle. The idea that they came in the majority just 5 months ago saying well, we will pay as we go, well, they are violating with this budget, into itself. 
   The last final point, which I think is really a shame, because 2 weeks ago we had a vote here in the House, 364 Members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans said, let's stop the raid of the Social Security trust fund once and for all. Let's stop that. That's what we said. We agreed that this budget should not raid Social Security. Both parties are responsible for this. 
   I am not saying it's the Democrats' fault, it's the Republicans' also. But what does this budget do? It raises the Social Security trust fund. Every year that this budget has a proposal, they are raiding the Social Security trust fund every year, even though 2 weeks ago 364 out of 435 of us said let's stop doing that. They turned around and said, and they are brining us a budget that continues to raid the Social Security trust fund. That's wrong. Both parties have been responsible for it. Both parties should fix it. 
   This budget should be defeated.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to start off by congratulating Chairman Spratt and the majority staff on the Budget Committee for reaching this point in the budget process. This is not easy. And they are to be commended for getting the budget up to this point. 
   I have long believed that the budget resolution is an important statement of congressional policy and a critical act of governing. So in a sense, I am glad to see this conference report here today. And the gentleman from South Carolina deserves credit for that. 
   That said, the choices in this budget, or some would argue, the complete lack thereof, represents an enormous missed opportunity, an enormous missed bipartisan opportunity. 
   The Democrats' fiscal year 2008 budget sets off a vicious cycle, Mr. Speaker. Higher taxes fuel higher spending and greater spending demand. In order to meet this appetite for greater spending, we are going to have to raise taxes again and again and again. Let's take a look at how this will work. 
   First, the linchpin of this budget, and numbers do not lie, check with the Congressional Budget Office, its only one binding fiscal policy is the same one that Democrats have been bringing to the floor time and again, ``raise taxes.'' This budget will raise taxes on the American economy and American workers by at least $217 billion. That is the second largest tax increase in American history. And to be clear, their $217 billion tax increase is just an opening bid. It will last only until the majority can raise the ante. 
   As you may recall, Mr. Speaker, the House Democrats wanted and included in their budget a $400 billion tax increase. That would have been the largest in history. But the Senate made it clear by a vote of 97-1 that they would not accept the House's number. So from this conference report, it would initially appear that the House Democrats receded to the Senate's smaller tax number, the smaller tax increase, that's according to the CBO, that is, until you take a closer look at some of the procedures and gimmicks included in this report. 
   First let's look at the trigger. There is this so-called tax trigger. In short, this trigger will provide the majority with an immense loophole allowing them to renege on their promise to protect certain high-profile tax benefits, and they can do it without leaving any fingerprints because it would all be automatic. All the Democrats have to do, believe it or not, is spend too much money, and that will set off the trigger and raise those taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, they are saying in this budget they want to extend marriage penalty relief, the child tax credit and the 10 percent bracket. But if they spend too much money, guess what happens automatically? Those tax cuts go away. 
   Then there is the $190 billion worth of unfunded spending increases promised in this budget's 23 reserve funds. If they actually deliver on these promised 23 wish list reserve funds, that's another tax hike. 
   Mr. Speaker, even their version of PAYGO, which they touted as proof of their commitment to fiscal discipline, is just a means to make it easier to raise taxes. What happens if they raise mandatory spending, Mr. Speaker? You guessed it. They have to raise taxes to pay for it. 
   So again, this $217 billion tax hike is just the starting bid. You can expect them to draw from that well again and again and again. Why is this a problem? Why do we have this huge difference of opinion, difference in philosophy of ideology of economic doctrines? Because the enormous tax increases will threaten the economic and fiscal progress our Nation has made these past several years. 
   As I have said many times before, the tax decreases, the tax cuts we passed in 2001 and 2003 have turned this economy around, it brought us out of recession. It improved job growth, GDP growth. It lowered the unemployment rate. Business investment and the entire market rebounded. And all that growth has led to surging revenues coming into the Federal Treasury. Three years of double digit revenue growth at these lower tax rates. The tax hikes contained in this budget threaten to reverse all of this. 
   And think of the impact this tax hike will have on the small businesses that it hits. Our small businesses, who are already paying the second highest tax burden in the industrialized world, will be told that they are just not paying enough. In this increasingly global economy, where these companies are struggling to compete with China and India, imposing an even larger tax burden will be crushing. It will severely threaten our ability to compete, and let alone lead, in the global economy.  
   So what will taxpayers get in return for sending Congress ever higher cuts of their paychecks? Better working, more efficient, less wasteful spending? No. The majority doesn't even pretend they are going to control spending. 
   There is no control on the existing trajectory of spending we have in this budget. We are only 5 months into this Congress, and at every opportunity the new majority has chosen the path of higher spending. They increased discretionary spending by $6 billion in the omnibus, another $20 billion or so of extraneous spending in the supplemental, and now they're increasing nondefense discretionary appropriations next year by another $23 billion. 
   For all we've heard about how the Democrats had to clean up the mess the Republicans gave them, their only response to this seems to be spend more and tax more. This formula has never worked for getting control of the budget in the past, and it won't work now. It's also the reverse of what's going on in the rest of the world. Across Europe, governments are moving away from their welfare state, big government tax policies and toward more market-oriented policies. For instance, the latest, most clear example. But here in the States, where we should be leading the tide toward free markets, Democrats are taking us in the other direction. 
   Finally, I think the biggest failure of this budget is not what it does do, it's what it doesn't do. This budget does nothing to reform entitlement programs, to extend their solvency. We had a parade of witnesses from the left and from the right, Democrat witnesses, Republican witnesses, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the OMB Director, the CBO Director, all come to us and say, you've got to get a handle on entitlements. You have to reform the entitlement programs to make them more solvent, to stop this enormous unfunded liability that is hitting American taxpayers. 
   Even with the Democrats' $400 billion tax increase, they had in the House-passed version, that would quickly outpace revenues, entitlements would swamp us. 
   So Mr. Speaker, even if we hit a temporary balanced budget, as this might achieve, it will be temporary because you can't raise taxes enough again and again to outpace the trajectory of entitlement spending growth. We will go back into deficits because this budget does nothing to control spending. 
   So why have the Democrats failed to even address this dire situation? Because as Senate Budget Chairman Senator Conrad told 60 Minutes, ``It's always easier not to. It's always easier to defer, to kick the can down the road, to avoid making choices.'' ``You know, you get into trouble in politics when you make choices.'' I appreciate that sentiment, but we all know that is not what budgeting is about. Budgeting is about making choices even when they're tough, even when they are not politically popular because that is what we came here to do. 
   In closing, I believe this budget fails to make any real choices, let alone the right ones. It will impose on American families and businesses at least the second largest tax increase in American history, if not the largest, add immense new government spending, and put off critical entitlement reforms for at least another 5 years. Our House Republican budget proved we can balance the budget without raising taxes and stop the rate on Social Security. 
   It is my genuine hope that the House will vote today to change this dangerous course and send the Democrat budget back to the drawing board. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, what we have just learned is that if a Member votes for this conference report, and it is adopted by the Senate, then they will be recorded as having voted for the joint resolution raising the public debt limit to $9.815 trillion, an increase in the public debt of borrowing of $850 billion. If a Member votes against this conference report, and it is adopted by the Senate, then they will not be recorded as having voted to increase the debt limit or borrowing by $850 billion. 
   So it's very clear that the passage of this budget increases borrowing by $850 billion and that is, in fact, the effect of this.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's just be really clear. You are hearing this debate about taxes. Nowhere is the difference between the two parties ever clear than it is right now. We brought a budget to the floor that not only did not raise taxes, it kept taxes low, and it reduced spending, and it balanced the budget, and it finally stopped the raid of the Social Security Trust Fund. 
   That's what we proposed. We are not in the majority. Our view did not prevail. The Democrat budget did prevail. What did that budget do? It passed the largest tax increase in American history. That's not what we say, that's what the Congressional Budget Office says, our scorekeepers. 
   So what did they do in conference? They decided to accede to the Senate and have a slightly smaller tax increase. They started off with the red line, largest tax increase in American history as measured by the Congressional Budget Office. No matter what you say, the numbers in the budget just don't lie. 
   Then they said, let's have a trigger. If we don't spend too much money, and if the surplus is big enough in 2010, then maybe some taxpayers could get some tax relief, and we won't raise all of their taxes. We will extend the marriage penalty and the child tax credit, 10 percent bracket, but will all the other tax increases occur? So we will have the second highest tax increase in American history. 
   That's what their proposal does. They simply cannot have it both ways. They cannot say there is no tax increase in this budget and then say we are preserving some of the tax cuts and not others. You can't have it both ways. 
   Here is what this budget does. It puts us on a vicious cycle of taxing and spending. They start off by spending $24 billion, next year, brand new spending. 
   Then they have a $217 billion tax increase. Then they have 23 reserve funds, 23 wish lists, which equal $190 billion in new spending. Then they have no entitlement reforms, which means our entitlement programs are going to grow and grow and grow at unsustainable rates. Guess what, $190 billion in wish lists, 23 new wish lists of spending. What do they get? If they get the spending, they get another $190 billion tax increase to pay for it, a vicious cycle of new spending. 
   The trigger tax says we would like to give some people some tax relief, but if we continue to whet our appetite, taxpayers won't get it. All this trigger says is it puts the taxpayer at the back of the line and the government and spending at the front of line. We have a different core set of values.  
   We believe the money that people make is their money, not the government's money. If you are making money, working hard and paying taxes, that's your money, not ours. We have a different set of beliefs. They believe the opposite. They believe that more and more and more money ought to come out of workers' paychecks. They believe that they can spend your money better than you can. 
   That is not what we believe. The reason that we don't believe it is because if you have more money in your paycheck, you have more for yourself and more freedom for your family, we know, by golly, the American economy grows. We succeed. We improve in the global economy. 
   We created 7 million new jobs since this last run of tax cuts. We increased revenues to the Federal Government from these lower tax raises, 3 years in a row, double digit revenue growth. Let's not turn that recipe upside down. Let's not ruin a good thing. 
   Defeat this budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, today the Democrat majority is going to bring the House budget resolution to the floor. Last month when they passed the budget resolution, it was the largest tax increase in American history. Today they are bringing a budget resolution to the floor that is slightly an improvement: It is the second largest tax increase in American history. And the only thing that is separating this budget from being the largest tax increase in American history is what they call the ``tax trigger,'' and under their tax trigger, if they actually get to spend all of the money they are hoping to spend, then the surpluses will not materialize and no taxes will be spared and it will yet again become the largest tax increase in American history. 
   This budget is unprecedented in its scope of its ability to tax and spend. The highest levels of taxes we have ever seen in this country and the highest levels of spending. That is not a way to balance the budget and set our fiscal house in order. We should vote against this budget, which raises taxes and raises spending at unprecedented levels.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Friends and colleagues, I am glad we are having this debate. It is good to debate the most important issue facing our country, the most important issue facing the world. I am glad we are talking about Iraq. We need to have a debate about Iraq. 
   I have grave concerns about the conduct of this war. I look back at the last 3 or 4 years and I think to myself, boy, I would have done that differently, I would have done this differently; they should have done that, they should have done this. I think we all can look at hindsight and see how things should have been done differently. 
   Well, here is where we are. The question is, is this the right resolution to pass? I for one don't know if this strategy is going to work or not. I believe our troops are going to do exactly what we ask them to do. I have perfect confidence that the U.S. soldiers, airmen, Army and Marines are going to do exactly what we ask them to do and they will do their jobs. 
   Where my doubts lie are with the Iraqi Government. Will the Iraqi Government do what we are asking them to do? Will the Iraqi Government do what is needed to do to hold up their end of the bargain? I don't know. 
   But what I do know is this: If we pass this resolution, this resolution, while our troops are in the middle of implementing this mission, while our troops are over there right now implementing this strategy, and we pass this resolution which says, you know what, we don't think you can succeed; we don't think you can do the job; we don't think you can do what you are being asked to do right now, that is a slap in the face. It is a killer of morale. This is the wrong message to send our troops. 
   We have to think about the alternatives. We have to think about the consequences of failure. We have to think about the message this sends our troops. We have to think about the message this sends our enemies. 
   Madam Speaker, by telling the world, by telling Americans and by telling our enemies and our troops we don't think this is going to work, we don't think this can succeed, what message does that send? 
   And for those who say this won't work and I am voting for this resolution, it is your obligation to tell us how better you can do this, what is your plan, what is your strategy. Because we have to think about the consequences of failure. We have to accept and know that if we just pull out we will have sectarian genocide. We will have a safe haven for terrorists with oil money. We will have a Middle East power struggle that will be very, very ugly, where countries that are very hostile to us, like Iran and Syria, will have the run of the region. We have to look at those consequences. 
   But more important than anything else, Madam Speaker, is the fact that I just cannot look our soldiers in the eyes, and I am traveling to this region in a few days, I cannot look them in the eyes and tell them that when I was in the comforts of Congress, I sat there high open my pedestal and I told the American people and you that the mission you are about to engage in, the job you are trying hard to do for us, you can't complete it. You are incapable. It won't work. Why bother trying? I can't send that message to our troops. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote. This is the right debate to have, the wrong resolution to pass.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, it's not my intention to consume the full amount of time, as we had discussed earlier. 
   At the beginning of this Congress, the Speaker of the House said the following: ``After years of deficit spending, this new Congress will commit itself to a higher standard: pay-as-you-go, no new deficit spending.'' 
   Well, the majority did follow through on half of their promise. One of the first things they did when they took control of this place was put in a new pay-as-you-go rule. 
   But things haven't quite worked out as well on the deficit. This year's deficit is projected to double as spending is projected to rise by over $200 billion. But at least they did put in the rule. And one of the things that makes this rule interesting, that requires this rule, is that the House must use the most recent CBO baseline when determining whether a bill complies with PAYGO. Let me read this rule word for word to be clear: 
   ``The effect of a measure on the deficit or surplus shall be determined on the basis of estimates by the Committee on Budget relative to the most recent baseline supplied by the Congressional Budget Office.'' 
   It sounds pretty straightforward, Mr. Speaker. You've got to use the current baseline when you apply PAYGO, no questions asked. 
   But despite this, everyone I have talked to about this issue, everything I've heard, everything I've read in the newspapers had told me that the farm bill isn't going to use the updated 2008 baseline but instead is going to use the 2007 baseline, an outdated baseline from over a year ago. Now, I hope that this is not the case. I hope that this does not happen. But it sounds like that's the direction they are headed. And that is what this motion is all about. 
   This motion is very simple. All it would do is require that the House will follow its own rules and use the current CBO baseline when determining whether or not the farm bill complies with PAYGO. 
   Why should we care? Why does this seemingly technical issue make a difference? 
   First of all, economic conditions have changed in the past year. Agricultural profits are way up. Food prices are soaring. And it's simply not accurate to use an estimate that's over a year old. 
   Second, there's a strong possibility that using the old baseline could hide  billions and billions of dollars in new spending. We don't have all the details yet, and we don't know exactly how CBO is going to score it, but based on what we've heard, based on rising food prices and other factors, we think it's quite likely that this bill is going to appear to cost billions of dollars less under the old baseline than it really does under the current one. 
   Now, isn't that convenient? I'm sure that a lot of taxpayers would love to have this type of choice. I'm sure that when they were filling out their taxes a few weeks ago, a lot of people thought it would surely be nice to have the option of paying taxes on either last year's income or this year's income. They could just pick the year where they made less money and save a couple bucks. 
   But the taxpayers don't have that choice. They are required to play by the rules. They have got to pay taxes on their current income whether they like it or not. And if the majority follows the rules, it doesn't have this choice either. They must use the 2008 baseline, or they will be in clear violation of their PAYGO rules. 
   Now, the majority has dodged PAYGO before. The farm bill they passed last year had over $5 billion in timing shifts and other gimmicks in it, and I wouldn't be surprised if you saw some of those in the conference report again this year. But if they use an old baseline, this would take it to a whole new level, Mr. Speaker. This would be the first time the majority actually used baseline shopping to violate the PAYGO requirement. 
   You see things like this, and it's no wonder people think Washington is broken. These types of games are exactly what make people cynical about Congress. And I agree. This just isn't the way the House should operate. The American people deserve better than having the House play games with its own rules and then go home and claim they have entered a new era of fiscal discipline. 
   You know, some people might find it odd for me to be down here talking about PAYGO, and I will be the first to admit that I have been critical of this rule and don't think it's the best way to proceed with respect to fiscal discipline. But let's put those concerns aside for a minute. Budgetary rules are only as good as the integrity of the numbers that you use to enforce them. So let's enforce those rules with updated CBO estimates. Let's have a strong bipartisan vote for this motion and say that these games have got to end. Let's not manipulate the rules and pick and choose whichever baseline is more convenient. 
   With that I urge my colleagues to support this motion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier).

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I am curious, does the gentleman want time from me or time from them? 
   Four quick points. The war supplemental, been working on it for a year. That is going to be done under the new baseline. Number two, CBO can score this on time. They have already told us they are going to give us simultaneous scores under the 2008 baseline. 
   Number three, you have had plenty of time to do this. The CBO baseline has been out for 2 months. But number four, and lastly, this isn't an option, this isn't a choice. You don't have discretion. It's the rules. This is your PAYGO rules. 
   So the question is: Are you going to violate your rules or not? 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. First, Mr. Speaker, let me talk about a provision in here called New York Liberty Zone Tax Credits. I hope all the Members understand that a precedent is being made right here today. 
   What this bill does is it gives the New York City government and the New York State government the authority to take the withholding, the Federal tax withholding from their employees and not send the money to the Federal Government as every single other taxpayer in America is made to do, but rather keep that money and spend it on rail infrastructure. This sets up a whole new policy preference and precedent that I think we should be alarmed about. 
   But I have one question for the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee on this particular matter, and that is this. In Senate Report 110-228, the director of the Joint Committee on Taxation to the chairman of the Finance Committee says that this provision constitutes a tax earmark given that it only goes to two taxpayers. So in light of the fact that the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation has specified in the Senate that this is a tax earmark, yet the chairman has certified in this bill that there are no tax earmarks contained in this legislation, could the chairman answer me: How does one reconcile the fact that in this bill under the joint tax definition there is a tax earmark, yet the chairman certifies that there are no earmarks in this bill? 
   I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from New York to answer the question. Just a brief yield, though.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. So am I correct in understanding that irrespective of the fact that the Joint Committee on Taxation defines this as an earmark, that the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee has chosen to supersede that ruling and claim that this is not in his filing in the bill; is that correct?

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the chairman for yielding. That was enlightening. I think we're just going to agree to disagree on this one. I think that this looks like a tax earmark, and we ought to call it that, regardless of the merits of the policy. 
   Two other quick points, Mr. Chairman. We've been hearing this rhetoric about tax subsidies to big oil companies. It's almost as if the Republican Congress decided to give a big tax break to just a couple of oil companies. What is this policy we're looking at? 
   A few years ago, we decided we wanted to do something to stop jobs from being pushed overseas. We wanted to do something to help American manufacturers keep jobs here in America. So  what did we do? We said, if you make or produce something in America, you will pay lower taxes here in America than if you make it overseas. We're going to reward you with lower taxes, all manufacturers, if you make it here in America than if you ship jobs overseas and make it overseas. 
   And so what is the majority doing? The majority is saying, well, okay, but not for the oil and gas industry. We're going to separate out the oil and gas industry and make them pay these higher overseas tax rates. 
   This was not a targeted tax benefit to one industry. This was a policy to help bring back manufacturing jobs in America. And so to call this a tax subsidy to just the oil industry, number one, is incorrect. But number two, the effect of this policy will do three things: this is going to raise the price of gasoline, this is going to push more jobs overseas, and most of all it's going to make us more dependent on foreign oil. 
   We ought to pass an energy policy that makes us less dependent on foreign oil, not more dependent on foreign oil. Unfortunately, that is exactly what this bill does. 
   The last and final point is this, Mr. Speaker. We are sitting in this bill picking winners and losers in the marketplace. Rather than investing in basic research, rather than investing in the ideas of tomorrow that have yet to be spawned, we are simply saying, today's technology is going to be subsidized; we're going to pick you as a winner and you as a loser, and we are going to do so at the expense of tomorrow's ideas. 
   It's bad policy. It makes us more dependent on foreign oil. I think we should vote this bill down.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (AMT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Let me put this in context. Mr. Speaker, the distinguished Speaker of the House came to the floor and said, we're providing tax relief for people. No, we're not. This isn't tax relief. What this bill attempts to do is prevent a tax increase, so nobody is seeing their taxes lowered under this bill. That's point number one. 
   But point number two is this is a new precedent that is being established here. What is this new precedent? This tax, the alternative minimum tax, is a mistake. It was never intended to be. Everybody acknowledges that. It was designed to get 155 really rich people in 1969, to make them pay taxes. It was never designed to tax 23 million people in the middle class this year. So we agree in Congress this shouldn't exist. Let's get rid of it. In all preceding Congresses we've said, let's not get new people caught up into this trap, and just be done with it. 
   The new precedent that is occurring here today is, the majority says, while we may not like this tax itself, we want that money. We may not like this way of taxing it, but we sure want this money coming into the Federal Government. And that's the new precedent that is occurring today which is an endorsement of this tax increase, a endorsement in acceptance, a wanting of this new and higher tax revenue. 
   What does that do? That brings us to a whole new size of government. What we have had in the last 40 years is the Federal Government has taxed the U.S. economy at 18.3 percent. That's the 40-year average. That's how much Washington takes out of the U.S. economy. 
   With this tax in place, with this new alternative minimum tax, that takes us up to an unprecedented level of government spending and taxing to 24 percent. What the majority is doing is putting us on this path of ever higher levels of taxation, even higher than during World War II. Why are they doing this? To spend more money. 
   There is a difference in philosophy here, Mr. Speaker. There's a basic philosophical difference. My good friend, who's a good man from Massachusetts will say, well, they're just borrowing to do this. We say, let's address entitlements. Let's focus on spending and keep taxes low. 
   They say, we don't want this tax but we want this money so we're going to raise some other permanent tax to get it into the government. 
   Here's the difference. Our priority is the taxpayer comes first, government second. Their priority is government comes first, the taxpayer is second. The government's in the front of the line. The taxpayer gets stuck with the tab. 
   We're saying the American families are taxed enough. They're paying enough in taxes. Because, you know what, we've got to watch it. We've got to make sure that we're competitive in the 21st century. We've got to make sure that we can keep jobs in America. And if we put ourselves on this path of unprecedented levels of taxation, we will lose our greatness in this century. We will sever that legacy of giving the next generation a higher standard of living, and we will be unable to compete with the likes of China and India  if we buy into this notion of ever higher taxes. That's why we should oppose this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First off, I want to start by congratulating Chairman Spratt. I mentioned this last time, but I think it is worth repeating. It is never easy to bring a budget conference report to bear, particularly in an election year, and Congress has had a pretty splotchy, spotty track record on this lately, and the chairman deserves accolades for keeping this process going, keeping this process alive. 
   We've had problems with the farm bill, and this bill being on the floor today is real proof of the skill and determination by the Budget chairman, and so I want to give him the compliment he deserves for bringing this to the floor. 
   It's important that we have a budget process. It's important that we recognize the need to budget in this institution, and doing this today recognizes that. But at the same time, Congress actually should budget, and I would argue, Mr. Speaker, that this budget is really nothing more than the congressional baseline with about a quarter of a trillion dollars slopped on top of it for the Appropriations Committee. 
   And so what is the opportunity we have here today if we were actually really budgeting? I think there's three things that we ought to be doing in this budget in this Congress. 
   One, let's have solid growth in our economy, and let's make sure we put ourselves in the position to lead in the international marketplace by having an economic policy that puts America ahead, in the lead and in a position to win in this era of global competition. 
   Number two, we need to reform our health and retirement security programs so we can fulfill the mission of our health and retirement security programs in this country. The government is making promises to people right now in health and retirement security that it knows it can't keep. We all know this here. We know, Republicans, Democrats, that our government is making promises to a generation of Americans and another generation of Americans that we know are unsustainable. So we need to come up with a plan to make good on that promise, which right now is not being fulfilled. 
   And number three, while we do that, we have got to lift this burden of debt  on the next generation. We, with this budget, are going faster down the pathway of sending a crushing burden of debt and taxes on the next generation. Both parties are to blame for this. So I'm not simply saying that all of the sudden now the Democrats are running Congress it's all bad. Both parties have been responsible for not addressing these problems. But now that my friends on the other side of the aisle are in the majority, this is their opportunity. This is their chance and opportunity to actually address this problem and take it head-on. And what are they doing? Nothing about it. 
   Here's the problem, Mr. Speaker. Not only does this budget propose to do nothing to address these issues, it makes them worse. Because by doing nothing, we're going deeper into debt. 
   Under this budget, what this budget proposes we do for 5 years, by doing nothing to address the two biggest problems we have, the two biggest programs we have, the two biggest unfulfilled promises we have, namely, Medicare and Social Security, this budget proposes to go $14 trillion deeper in debt to just those two programs alone; by doing nothing for 1 year according to the trustees of Medicare and Social Security, $2 trillion deeper into debt. This budget, $14 trillion increase. 
   But here's also what this budget does propose. What it does propose is the largest tax increase in American history, $683 billion over the next 5 years. That equals about $2,000 in per year tax increase on the average American family, and there's no effort to cut wasteful spending in government whatsoever. 
   We've heard about the Bridge to Nowhere. We've heard about the $50 million rain forest museum. We heard about the bill passed 2 weeks ago to give $250 million for one earmark from a Senator from the other side of the Rotunda for one company. We're earmarking ourselves to oblivion in this Congress, and this bill does nothing to curtail that. This bill basically assumes that there's no waste in the Federal Government, that every taxpayer dollar is being spent well and wisely and with full accounting and full transparency, and because of that, this ought to give the government even more money to spend on top of the baseline. 
   This bill will push the appropriations above the $1 trillion mark in the next coming year. That's an increase of $80 billion, an increase of 9 percent over last year. This bill, as a consequence of giving this 9 percent increase in discretionary spending, will lead to the largest annual increase in the debt in our Nation's history. 
   And so for all the talk of fiscal conservatism, for all the talk of fiscal responsibility we're going to hear in the next hour, this bill right here we're debating, right here, largest increase in debt in our Nation's history, exceeding the $1 trillion mark in government agency spending. 
   And this bill does absolutely nothing, absolutely nothing, to address the upcoming entitlement crisis. As I mentioned, this bill adds to the entitlement crisis. It increases the entitlement liability in this country by 37 percent, $14 trillion increase in unfulfilled promises and contingent liability, a 37 percent increase. 
   Now, given the fact that this bill does nothing to address the long-run problems in this country, what about the short-run? What about the problems in the short-run? This bill does nothing to propose any new energy policy whatsoever. 
   We have $4 gasoline, and this is where it really hits close to home. This is where I really have a personal problem with the fact that we're doing this bill. You know, just 2 days ago in my hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin, General Motors just announced they're shutting down the factory there, the factory that has produced the Yukon, the Tahoe and the Suburban. And the reason they're shutting down the factory at the end of this model year is because of $4 gas. It costs a hundred bucks to fill up a Suburban, and people aren't buying them. Thirty percent decline in sales just this year alone, and people are scratching their heads and wondering how did this happen, how did this come to be, why do we have $4 gas. 
   Well, here's the problem, Mr. Speaker, we're 60 percent dependent on foreign oil, and you know what's so galling about that is the fact that we have about seven times the amount of oil under our ground in this country than Saudi Arabia has under theirs. Yet it's all off-limits. 
   We have got 16 billion barrels of oil up in ANWR that are off-limits by Congress. We've got 86 billion barrels of oil in the Outer Continental Shelf off-limits by Congress. We have 2 trillion barrels of oil in the Intermountain Region in this country, all off-limits by Congress. 
   We know how to drill in a very safe and environmentally sound way. And what's more galling from that is the Congressional Research Service is now telling us, just passing the ANWR legislation, the smallest of these three fields I just mentioned, would get us about $191 billion in revenue to the Federal Government over the next 10 years. 
   Imagine what we could do with that. Imagine the deficit reduction that could occur as a consequence of that. Imagine the hydrogen, the fuel cells, the research that we could do to actually invest in a Manhattan Project to get us off of oil itself. But unfortunately, my friends on the other side of the aisle are not doing anything. 
   So while I'm happy we have a budget resolution on the floor, I'm very dispirited and very disappointed in its content. Largest tax increase in American history. Absolutely nothing to confront the entitlement crisis in this country, a 37 percent increase in this liability. Largest increase in national debt in the American history. And nothing to address the long-term and nothing to address the short-term by making us less dependent on foreign oil. 
   I find it interesting that our friends on the other side of the aisle are so critical of our foreign policy as being too unilateral; yet what we're simply saying to other countries is we're going to drill for oil in your country and buy that from you and not explore it in our own country. A little bit of a hypocritical stance, I would argue. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I'm going to reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, what this is all about is priorities, that  is what budgets are, and when you take a look the priorities in this budget, it is a huge missed opportunity. 
   I started the beginning of this debate by complimenting the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina for bringing a budget to conclusion, and I really sincerely mean that. I am from Wisconsin. I didn't really know what the definition of a ``distinguished southern gentleman'' is. I do now know by serving with John Spratt, and he deserves credit for bringing a budget resolution to the floor in an election year, which is something that is not often done around here. So I sincerely want to compliment the gentleman for that. 
   But what about the budget we have here being brought to the floor? I see some young people in the audience here, some young people in the well here. I have some young people in my family. I have a daughter who is 6, a son who is 5, and a son who is 3 years old, and by the time my three kids are exactly my age, this Federal Government will be doubling their taxes. 
   The pathway that we are on right now with the unsustainable fiscal crisis in this country is one in which, instead of taxing 18.3 cents out of every dollar to pay for the Federal Government, which is what we have been doing for the last 40 years, the next generation, my children's generation, when they are raising their kids will be paying 40 cents out of every dollar just to pay for this Federal Government. 
   We know for a fact that we are shackling the next generation with a mountain of debt and taxes that is unsustainable. We are bequeathing this to the next generation, unless we fix this, unless we step up as every preceding generation has done in this country and make things better. 
   What does this budget do? Not only in a time of economic recession, not only in a time of $4 gas prices, not only in a time where the grocery bill is twice as high as it was last year, we are raising taxes across-the-board the most we have ever raised them before, taxes on marriage, taxes on having children, taxes on making money, taxes on starting small businesses, taxes on pensions, taxes on retirement. This budget does that. But what is even worse than that is that this budget proposes to increase this debt, this legacy of debt to our children and our grandchildren, by $14 trillion for just two programs alone. It is unconscionable. 
   Both parties lay blame, but should claim responsibility for getting us to where we are. I am not simply saying here that Republicans have always been pristine and Democrats have always been bad. We got into this together. We are going to have to get out of this together. The problem is, this is no way to go. We shouldn't be doing this to our grandchildren, to our children, to the ``X Generation.'' 
   That is what this budget does, the largest tax increase in American history, which is going to hurt our economy even further and cost jobs. When you raise taxes, you lower jobs. When you raise taxes, you take money out of paychecks. You hurt families. You don't give them the ability to get going, to succeed. Their paychecks don't get stretched farther, they get stretched shorter. 
   And when you consign the next generation by simply walking away from the problem and saying to our kids and our grandkids, instead of giving you a $40 trillion debt for Medicare and Social Security, we are going to give you a $54 trillion debt for Medicare and Social Security, each household today, if we want just these two programs to work, would have to set aside $353,000. What this budget says is each household will have to set aside $474,000. 
   We are abdicating leadership in this budget. It is wrong. What we need to do is come together, both sides, recognize this problem, and realize that the way to prosperity in this country is not to tax our way out of this problem; it is to address this spending problem in this House, address the culture of earmarks, address the spending that we have here and get it under control so that the next generation can be better off. 
   That is what my folks told me the legacy of this country is all about. Each generation rises to the challenges in this country and leaves the next generation better off. Well, what we are doing with this budget is we are severing that legacy. We know for a fact, it is guaranteed, it is statistically a truism by all sides of the aisle, we are going to sever that legacy and we are going to give the next generation an inferior standard of living, unless we defeat this budget.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, this was the product of a bipartisan compromise in the Ways and Means Committee. That is a good thing. I am not here to talk about the merits of the bill. 
   I am here to talk about the fact that this is a suspension of the rules. Among the things that this rules suspends is the Budget Act, and this bill has two budget points of order that lie against it, section 303 and 311. So we are, in the early days of this majority, bringing a bill to the floor that violates the Budget Act. We haven't written the new budget, and we are violating the current one we have. 
   As to the new PAYGO system, if the PAYGO rule were in place that we had before, or the PAYGO rule that was advocated by the Democrat minority last year would be in place, this would violate their PAYGO rule. It is convenient that this new, more-watered-down PAYGO doesn't apply to this, but I think the facts should be known that this bill does violate the Budget Act in two important ways.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First, I'd like to associate myself with the chairman's comments in recognizing Frank Cushing and his accomplishments and wishing him well in his retirement. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that's 3,565 pages. Yes, I'm seeing that it was printed on one side, but this is the bill that was handed to us by the majority staff in the Rules Committee. It's their bill. They printed it for us, 34.4 pounds. 
   This bill has, we think, 9,200 earmarks in it. We believe hundreds of these earmarks were air-dropped, never seen before in the House, never seen before in the Senate, brand new, just delivered right here on this House floor. We received this bill today. We'll be voting on this bill in about 10 minutes. 
   This bill takes $10 million from border security to commit $10 million of taxpayer funds to hire defense attorneys for illegal immigrants. We don't know exactly how they do that, but that's in here. 
   The point is, Mr. Speaker, this is a bad day for this House. This is a bad day for the fiscal policy of this country. We are about to vote on a bill that commits about $515 billion in spending, 3,500 pages long, 9,200 earmarks, many we've never seen before; and we're  going to vote on this in about 10 minutes, and we'll have had less than 1-hour debate on the entire measure. 
   This is no way to run a railroad, Mr. Speaker, and sadly, it has been run like this in the past. The new day we were promised with the new majority, in fact, is not a new day. Unfortunately, it's like days of old. 
   I'm very pleased that the number did not go up to where the majority wanted it to go, an extra $23 billion, which would have brought another $196 billion of deficit spending into the budget. Thankfully we're at that lower number; but when you look at this process, when you look at what's in this bill, as we are just getting through this bill, this bill should be defeated; and I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I thank her for her leadership on this. 
   As we take a look at this bill that just passed the House not 20 minutes ago, I think it is important to know what is in this piece of legislation. This piece of legislation weighs about the same amount of weight as my 4-year-old son does. This piece of legislation is 3,565 pages. It is 9,200-plus earmarks, 300 of which we just found out about today.  
   This bill costs $515 billion. This bill does a lot for a lot of Federal workers in the holiday season. It makes sure that all those Federal workers working at all the different government agencies have their budget for the year. 
   But what this bill does not do going into this holiday season, it does not give those soldiers in Iraq fighting for our freedom on the frontline of the war on terror, it does not give them one penny. It does not give them 1 minute's worth of comfort so that they have the resources, the tools, the body armor, the bullets, the gasoline, the rations, the support that they need to keep us safe and to fulfill our mission in fighting the war on terror where the epicenter is in Iraq.     
   It is a shame that we spend all of this time putting all of this money, all of this pork for all of these government agencies, making sure that bureaucrats here in Washington are comforted during this Christmas season, but not a penny to support our troops in harm's way in Iraq. That is a shame. 
   What is also a shame is this bill was dropped on the table today and passed today. Not a single Member of Congress read this entire bill; yet it passed and is on its way to becoming law. 
   It is also a shame that it is putting our Nation on a dangerous fiscal path. It is the beginning of the week, and we are going to put 10,000 earmarks into law. At the end of the week, we will pass more legislation that will cost billions more. I am worried we may not actually patch the AMT because the majority here is insisting on having permanent tax increases to pay for that. 
   So while we have already seen the delay in Congress is costing people a 2-month delay in their refund checks from the IRS, if this Congress keeps on the track they are on, they will raise taxes on millions of Americans and businesses just to try to provide for a temporary prevention of a tax increase on 19 million additional taxpayers, 19 million taxpayers who already, because of this delay, will see a delay in their refunds. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not a good moment for the fiscal policy of our country. This is not a proud day for the House of Representatives to thump a 34-pound, 3,565-page bill on the desk and vote it out. But worst of all, it is not a good day for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who are in the fight, who are on the front lines, who want our support, who deserve our support. That should have been taken care of before any single Member of Congress got their pork. Unfortunately, it wasn't, and that is what passed the House here this evening. 
   I see we are joined by several other colleagues who want to make comments on this. We have leaders here in the House of Representatives on fiscal conservatism, on fiscal responsibility, and I thank the gentlewoman who is controlling the time and thank her for her tireless leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, why are we here? We're here because it's Tax Day and the majority decided they had to have a tax bill to come to the floor to pass on Tax Day. 
   There are some good provisions in this bill. I want to talk about one provision that is not a good provision. That's what we call HSA substantiation. What that basically means is without a single hearing, the majority wants to bring these new red-taped complicated rules to health savings accounts so that every time somebody goes and makes a health care purchase that's under the deductible, they have to first get permission from their banker or from the government before they do it. That's essentially what substantiation does. 
   Now, we've heard from banks, from the credit unions, from the NFIB and the small businesses. They're all saying, we're not going to do it anymore. We're not going to offer HSAs to our clients. 
   Madam Speaker, the key with health savings accounts is that people can save tax free for their out-of-pocket health care savings. Why on earth would we want to bring a bill to the floor which we know will reduce the use of health savings accounts? 
   The goal of this Congress ought to be to make health care more accessible and more affordable. Unfortunately, this bill goes in the wrong direction. So we want to inflict all of this red tape that we don't inflict on individual retirement accounts or on home equity lines of credits on this, and this will make it harder for people to save tax free for health care. It will tie them up in red tape. It will say to the banks and credit unions that offer these things, don't offer them anymore, and more to the point, we're doing this clumsy legislating without having had one hearing in the Ways and Means Committee. 
   More to the point, Madam Speaker, is this. The market is already fulfilling the need to have better recordkeeping. The market is already showing us they can do this without this law. But if you impose this law, as this bill does, guess what's going to happen? People in rural America, people in some small towns, people in Janesville, Wisconsin, they won't be able to subscribe to this law. Their retailers don't have the technology that's being required here. So you're going to leave rural America, small town America out, and only urban areas can comply with this. 
   This is not good legislating. This has not been seen through. No foresight. No hearings. More to the point, it's going to make it harder for people in rural and small towns to save tax tree for health care. It's going to make it harder for anybody to save tax free for health care. This is going to raise health care costs, and it is going to make it harder for patients to really get control of their health care destiny. 
   And that is why this bill should be defeated. For this piece of policy alone, this bill should be defeated because it was not thought through. It was slammed in there at the last minute, and that is enough of a reason that on this day, on Tax Day, we should not be telling the American people, we're going to raise your taxes if you want to go buy health care. That's wrong, but that's what this bill does; and I think we should reject this bill for that reason alone.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, when the new majority came into power, they talked about being fiscally conservative. They talked about bringing fiscal responsibility back to the people's House. Well, that's not what we see here today, and that's not what we have seen for the last 4 months. 
   Last session, Mr. Speaker, we brought a bill that said if we are going to do emergency spending bills, let's clean these up. Let's not put pork barrel, unnecessary spending in emergency spending. We actually defined what an emergency is.     
   And then we set aside a reserve fund, $6.4 billion, to say we are setting this aside for emergency spending, and if we go over this amount, we have to scrutinize every dollar to make sure that it is truly an emergency. 
   What did the new majority do? To their credit, they carried these rules over into this session of Congress. Thankfully, they said, you know what? Let's not pork up emergency spending bills. Let's make sure that if it's really an emergency, it will get funded as an emergency. If it's not, it won't. 
   What happened the first time the pressure hit? They waived the rules. They waived the rules completely. And now the new budget resolution the majority is proposing gets rid of these proposals altogether. No more checks on emergency spending. All it takes is to waive the rules, stamp it as an emergency, and we can spend as much as we want. It's outside the budget caps. It gets added onto the deficit. And that's what is happening right here tonight. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, this bill right here violates the majority's own PAYGO rules by $5.8 billion. That's right. They are violating their own PAYGO that they put into place just a few months ago by $5.8 billion. They are adding $21 billion of nonemergency spending that were unrequested, that have nothing to do with the war on terror. And they have added $11 billion of congressional add-ons that have nothing to do with the war on terror, that were not requested. 
   The majority came out with their first spending bill, adding $6 billion on top of the deficit. Now they are adding $21 billion on top of the deficit with this unrequested, nonemergency spending. And in their budget resolution they are bringing to the floor, another $25 billion next year.  
   Fiscal responsibility is the last thing you could say to describe this bill. I urge rejection of this motion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Chairman Obey, Leader Boehner, and Mr. Lewis for bringing a bill to the floor that provides funding for our troops without restrictions on our commanders. 
   My hometown is under water, and I am glad this bill provides funding to address flooding and to help the victims whose lives have been turned upside down by this flood. 
   Likewise I am glad that this bill provides assistance to those facing unemployment since one of the largest employers in my district--GM--recently announced it is closing a production facility. 
   However, this bill is part of a very disturbing trend in how we budget and legislate--Omnibus appropriation bills. We are now resorting to two omnibus appropriations bills a year. We need to find a way to budget for emergencies, but my problem with this bill is not with the unemployment extension funding or the flood funding. These are temporary costs that have been included in emergency supplementals in the past. 
   My concern is with the permanent expansion in an entitlement program that we are adding to an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. Mandatory spending doesn't belong on an appropriations bill because mandatory spending is forever. 
   An expansion in GI benefits is a good idea. However, we have an increasingly bad habit of just adding spending on top of the $3 trillion we are currently spending annually. I congratulate the Blue Dogs for initially objecting to the fact that the GI benefits in this bill were not offset. I don't support their remedy--which is to raise taxes--but if we are going to expand entitlements, we need to find offsets. In fact, we cannot afford the entitlements we have, much less an expansion in them. 
   We are going to spend over $30 trillion in the next ten years; surely we could have found $63 billion in offsets. But we didn't even try. In fact, the cost of the GI benefits has grown in this final bill. 
   We just kick the can down the road. The problem is that our children and grandchildren will live at the end of the road and all we are doing is leaving them with a mountain of debt. 
   PAYGO does not exist. It is waived every time we have to make a choice. We are sent here to make decisions--to make choices--to govern. Like the floods, this bill takes the path of least resistance; it passes the buck--and the debt to future generations. 
   We shouldn't budget or legislate this way, but I'm going to vote for this bill because it funds the troops and provides one-time emergency funding for unemployment assistance and floods.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a roadmap for America's future, legislation to transform our Federal Government, to reform the Nation's health care entitlements, Social Security, and the Federal Tax Code. My legislation does three things: It fulfills the mission of health and retirement security for all Americans by making Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid permanently solvent. Second, it lifts the massive debt burden off of future generations. Third, it promotes solid, sustained economic growth and job creation, and puts the U.S. in a position to lead, not merely to survive in the global marketplace. 
   This is a real plan, with real proposals, with real numbers to back them up, and real legislation to implement it. I recognize that this is an ambitious proposal. Not everyone's going to agree with every part of it. That is fine. These problems are not Democratic problems and they are not Republican problems, and neither are the solutions. 
   We need to build bipartisan support for action in Congress. If nothing else, it is my sincere hope that this will spur Congress to move beyond simply rehashing the problem, to debating and implementing actual solutions for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I hate to have to come to the floor today to talk about how bad this bill is, but it's impossible not to do that. 
   This bill gives millions of dollars, billions of dollars in farm subsidies to millionaires. This bill takes all budget discipline in this Chamber and throws it out the window. It sweeps PAYGO under the rug.  
   Ninety-seven percent of the world's consumers don't live in this country. They're overseas. And the way we help farmers is to open up markets to their products overseas. This bill shuts that down. This bill makes it next to impossible for us to be able to open up markets for our farmers. 
   A farm bill ought to help the family farmer in tough times. This doesn't do that. This is corporate welfare. This is subsidies for multi-millionaires. In fact, you can still live on Wall Street, make half a million dollars and get farm subsidies under this bill. 
   This bill is not going to help agriculture. This bill is going to help corporate agriculture, not family farmers. 
   I believe that we should sustain the President's veto. And this is not always good to say it's bipartisan. And I hope, on a bipartisan basis, we support this veto and pass a farm bill that actually helps the family farmer and takes away these exorbitant subsidies to multi-millionaire corporate farming operations. 
   We ought to protect conservation. We ought to help the Third World raise themselves out of poverty, and we ought to open up markets for our farmers so they have more people to sell their products to. That's what a farm bill ought to look like. That's not what this farm bill does. 
   I urge a sustain of the veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, and I choose my words carefully when I say this, but this bill really, in my opinion, is a cynical attempt to make a campaign promise good. When I say that, I mean it's three things: number one, in the guise of budget reconciliation, the reason this bill is here so quickly to the floor, through conference so fast, out of the other body is they brought it to the floor through budget reconciliation. 
   What is budget reconciliation? It's a way of reducing the deficit, $752 million of savings for over $20 billion of spending. That's a cynical attempt to exploit the budget deficit reduction process to create a brand-new government program and an avalanche of new spending. 
   Why else is it cynical? It cuts student rates in half for 6 months, and then it doubles it 6 months later to try and shoehorn this bill into compliance with the majority's PAYGO. To try and say that they are paying for this bill, they give students, graduates, not students, graduates a cut in their interest rates for 6 months in half and then double it 6 months later. 
   It also, cynically, creates five new entitlement programs. What are entitlement programs? Entitlement programs are spending programs that go on autopilot. It has sunsets in these programs, but the most permanent thing in Washington is a temporary government program, especially a temporary entitlement program.     
   Take all this together, and assume that Congress, down the road, will not eliminate these five new entitlement programs once they've been established. Assume they won't just cut interest rates for graduates for only 6 months, but for longer, and you've got another 20 to $30 billion of spending out the door. 
   And lastly, Madam Speaker, this takes from the private sector and gives to the government. This puts onto the taxpayers' liability these liabilities. This says, instead of private firms that are out there processing loans right now that worked really well, my student loans came from these sources,  this says, no, we want the taxpayer to bear the burden. We want the taxpayer to be on the hook for these loans if they default. 
   Look, we have problems with loans all over. We have this meltdown in the mortgage markets with sub-prime loans, and we're saying, now, in Congress, let's put more liability on the taxpayer books? If it ain't broken, don't fix it. We have a system that works well. We have a system that helps students. 
   This bill does nothing to address the high cost of tuition. It cynically attempts to make it appear as though it makes borrowing a little less expensive for people after they graduate, and then it doubles the interest rate 6 months later. 
   For all of those reasons, Madam Speaker, the abuse of the budget reconciliation process, the increase of taxpayer liability, and the creation, irresponsibly, of five new entitlement programs, when three current entitlement programs right now are bringing us into a mountain of debt, a mountain, a legacy of debt to our children and grandchildren, the last thing we ought to do is create five new entitlement programs. 
   For all those reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote, Madam Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, let's just say what we're doing here. What this bill does is it prevents a tax increase. Now, we have different philosophies and we have different ideas on how to keep America moving forward between Republicans and Democrats, the minority and the majority. 
   What the majority is doing right here is they are waiving their own budget rules. They came in promising a new pay-as-you-go system, and here they go, as soon as the going gets tough, waive PAYGO. 
   I find it interesting that never during the course of this debate this year did the majority ever propose to reduce spending to offset this. They only proposed raising taxes. But here we are on the eve of the end of the year, preventing 19 million additional taxpayers from paying this tax increase. 
   Let's look at where we were at the beginning of this year. 
   Speaker Pelosi: ``After years of historic deficits, this new Congress will commit itself to a higher standard: pay as you go.'' 
   The majority leader, and I think he will be consistent and vote against this particular bill: ``Our budget strictly adheres to the pay-as-you-go budget rules that were reinstated in January by the new majority.'' 
   Our distinguished chairman of the committee: ``You've got to offset those tax cuts.'' So on and so forth. 
   Well, here we are and we are going to pass this by waiving PAYGO. 
   Now let me make it very clear, I disagree with the majority's PAYGO. The majority's PAYGO says let's just keep raising taxes. Well, two wrongs don't make a right. 
   This tax was never meant to be. This is a new tax increase on top of the Tax Code. It was never intended in the first place. This ought to be repealed, period. So I don't agree with this notion that this tax increase ought to just be replaced with some other tax increase, and that's the majority's position. They want the revenue from the alternative minimum tax, they just don't want to raise it through that tax so they have a different tax increase. That is bad economic policy. 
   At a time when economists are telling us we might be headed for a recession, at a time when they are saying a slowdown is on the horizon, the last thing the American people and the economy need is a tax increase. That's why this is an important bill. We have big tax increases on the horizon. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee is proposing an enormous tax increase, $3.5 trillion. They are proposing to get rid of all of those tax cuts that got us out of recession in 2003 in the first place, and they are proposing not to repeal the AMT but to replace it with even higher taxes on workers and small businesses. That is the wrong economic recipe for America. The right one is keep taxes where they are and control spending.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Committee on Appropriations for addressing language contained in the House State, Foreign Operations Committee Report regarding funding of recreational, sport  and trophy hunting in its assistance programs in Africa. The language included in the Manager's Statement accompanying the Omnibus Appropriations Legislation offers USAID the opportunity to come before the Committee and explain the need for these important conservation programs to continue. I support this effort and commend the Committee on this language. 
   I urge USAID to take advantage of this opportunity to come before the Committee and explain the benefits of these valuable projects as directed by the Manager's Statement. Conservation projects have made great contributions to wildlife management and have a great story to tell. The CAMPFIRE and the LIFE Plus Projects in Africa are just two examples of successful conservation programs involving controlled, regulated sport and trophy hunting that economically supports tribal systems in many areas of Africa. Without programs like these, millions of acres of properly managed conservation areas would fall prey to poachers, eliminating the economic value these lands provide. 
   Additionally, tourist hunting has proven to be a valuable tool for conserving wildlife and habitat for particularly threatened species such as the African elephant, white and black rhino, leopard, markhor, argali and others. Licensed, regulated tourist hunting provides tens of millions of dollars for the operating budgets of foreign wildlife departments, significantly reduces poaching, and creates incentives for local inhabitants to perpetuate biodiversity on hundreds of millions of acres where it is needed beyond the borders of protected areas. Without these programs, animals in this environment would be killed for food, over-hunted, and poached, placing the continued survival of these species in serious jeopardy. 
   The facts are that in the twenty-three African countries that allow licensed, regulated hunting, approximately 18,500 hunters generate over $200 million annually in remote rural areas. These conservation programs are extremely important to African tribal culture, not to mention the survival of the many animal species they protect worldwide. While I cannot support the overall bill, I thank the Appropriations Committee for recognizing this flaw in the Committee Report on H.R. 2764 and speaking to it appropriately in the Omnibus Legislation's accompanying Manager's Statement.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First off, Mr. Chairman, I would like to congratulate the gentlewoman from Michigan and the gentleman from Virginia. The gentleman from Virginia is a knowledgeable man who's very sincere, who understands the budget process, and I want to congratulate you for bringing a budget to the floor. It's not easy to write a budget resolution, and it's important to bring a budget to the floor that reflects your priorities. So first of all, to the CBC, I simply want to congratulate you and your staff for doing this because that's how a debate works here. It's not enough just to criticize; it's important to propose things. 
   Now for the criticizing part. I simply want to talk about the underlying Democratic Party budget. And there was a debate yesterday about this for a number of hours, whether there's a tax increase in the Democrats' budget or not. 
   Well, when we hear the Democrat chairman say that they are balancing the budget, that is what their budget does. It is certified by the Congressional Budget Office as actually achieving balance. So we need to accept the fact that their budget does balance. 
   There's only one reason, there's only one way that it balances. It does so by passing the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Now, here's what they do with their budget: this red line, which is what we call the Congressional Budget Office baseline, that is the line they use to show that they are achieving a balanced budget. The green line here says here's what the line would be if you don't raise taxes, if you keep the marriage penalty repealed, if you don't raise the child tax credit, and so on. This is the difference between the two budgets. 
   So when we hear our friends on the other side of the aisle say, We're balancing the budget and we're not raising taxes, they can't have it both ways. It's simply not correct. It's simply untrue. You can't, on the one hand, say you're balancing the budget, which by very definition requires by their math you raise taxes in order to achieve balance, and then not say you're raising taxes. 
   The question is this: What taxes are we talking about? Are these taxes that just hit wealthy people? No. Everybody who pays income tax rates will see a giant tax increase. All income tax rates will be increased under the Democratic budget. The per child tax credit will get cut in half, from $1,000 per child to $500 per child. That means every family in America will see a $500 per child tax increase. The marriage penalty will come back in full force. That hits people, on average, $1,400 for married couples. Capital gains and dividends tax, which is the tax on our pensions and our 401(k)s, that goes on. And the death tax comes back in full force. 
   The question before us now, Mr. Chairman, is this: We are almost going  into a recession. We are clearly in an economic downturn. Is this the time for a tax increase? I think the answer is no. 
   The other question is this: We have high prices. It costs a lot to fill the gas tank today. It costs a lot to send kids to school. It costs a lot of money for health insurance. Where I come from in Wisconsin, it costs a lot to heat your home. So the real question for this Congress here and for the American people is, Can you afford the Democrats' tax hike? Can you afford the massive tax increases? We are paying higher prices for everything in America today. Our paychecks for working men and women in America aren't going as far as they used to go. So at this time can we afford this tax increase? 
   We think there's a better way. And in 2 hours we will be showing the American people the better way we think we ought to go, and that is let's balance the budget, but let's do it not by raising taxes but by controlling spending. 
   The big problem I also see with the Democratic budget in addition to that it has the largest tax increase in history is that it doesn't think there is any waste in Washington.     
   They believe we should keep earmarking this place. They believe there is no room to find waste, fraud, abuse and inefficiencies in government. We disagree. We think that there is waste in Washington. We think that there is fraud in the way our taxpayer dollars are being spent. And we think we ought to say this earmark system is coming unglued. 
   This earmarking system needs to be cleaned up. All this pork, 11,000 pieces of which left this Congress last year, to the tune of $14.9 billion. Let's say stop it for this year and let's clean it up. Let's have a bipartisan commission, clean up the way Congress porks this place up. Save that money. Reduce the deficit. Make sure we don't raise taxes and clean up the way Congress spends taxpayer dollars. 
   By simply saying no to pork this year and banking that savings in this budget, we can make sure that that per child tax credit stays. We can make sure that people don't pay higher taxes by virtue of simply being married. 
   Those are the choices we have before us today. We in the Republican budget say no more pork. Let's protect paychecks, and let's make sure we are not taxing people for having children or for getting married. 
   That's the values we have in our budget. And we think we can go farther and say, let's reform government. Let's reform spending. Let's clean it up. Let's not raise taxes.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I don't know what kind of statistical contortion must have gone through producing that last chart. We just finished 52 consecutive months of job growth, the largest expansion in our Nation's history. 
   But more to the point is this issue of whether we are raising taxes here or not, because we need to be honest with the American people. The underlying Democratic budget, don't take my word for it, it raises taxes. Take the Senate's word for it. Because just this morning on a 99-1 vote in the U.S. Senate, they rejected the logic of this budget. They said we want to preserve the middle-class tax cuts, which they define as the kid credit and the marriage penalty and 10 percent bracket and some others. But they changed the budget by $341 billion to prevent $341 billion of the $683 billion tax increase from taking place. 
   So don't take my word for it, but the Democrats and the Republicans in the Senate. All but one person said we should not raise taxes as much as the House Democrats are raising taxes; let's raise taxes half as much. 
   So the point is this: our friends on the other side of the aisle can come up with reserve funds and senses of Congress and preferences and hopes and dreams and aspirations. But what counts is what you put in the budget. And if you are coming to the floor and saying you are balancing the budget, by the way this budget is written, it only does so by giving us the largest tax increase in American history. No sense of Congress, no empty reserve fund can change that fact. 
   Don't listen to me. Listen to the fact that the Senate looked at this same budget and said, that is not what we want to do. We want to preserve some of these tax cuts, and they just voted 99-1 to do just that. They decided to raise taxes half as much as the Democrats here in the House are doing. 
   So what really matters are budgets, because that is the numbers. They don't lie. This budget that we are voting on, this underlying budget, gives us the largest tax increase in American history. Let me read a few of them: 
   Some 116 million taxpayers will see an average tax increase of more than $1,800 per year. 
   More than 6 million low-income individuals and couples who currently pay no taxes will be no longer exempt. 
   A family of four earning $50,000 will see their taxes increase by $2,100. 
   Approximately 48 million married couples will face an average tax increase of $3,000 per year. 
   Low-income families with one or two children will no longer be eligible for the refundable child tax credit. 
   Roughly 12 million single women with children will see their taxes increase by $1,100 a year. 
   About 18 million seniors will be subjected to tax increases of more than $2,100 a year. 
   Tax bills for an estimated 27 million small business owners will increase by more than $4,000 each. 
   That is what the underlying Democratic budget does. It was rejected in the Democratically controlled Senate. It ought to be rejected in this House here today.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I wish my friend from Massachusetts would have stayed at the mike. 
   I simply want to ask if the Democratic budget balances the budget, if it achieves balance. Would the gentleman care to answer the question if the Democratic budget achieves balance in 2012?

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Reclaiming my time from the chairman of Financial Services, I'm not sure if he's on the same page as the chairman of the Budget Committee. The chairman of the Budget Committee is claiming that their budget balances the budget by 2012. I'll take him at his word, and actually it's correct. The Congressional Budget Office certifies that the Democratic budget does indeed balance in 2012. Here is how they certify it balances in 2012: by raising taxes. 
   They simply cannot say on the one hand they're balancing the budget, and then on the other hand not raising taxes. Because the only way their budget balances is only by raising taxes. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, don't listen to me. Listen to the 99 Senators who just voted this morning to validate everything I just said. Ninety-nine Senators, just a couple hours ago, voted for the Baucus amendment, the Democratic chairman of the Finance Committee's amendment, that said the tax increases in this budget are just a little too big; let's cut them in half. Let's reduce the tax increases by $341 billion. So it's only about a $300 billion tax increase. The Senate budget now has half the tax increase in it that this budget here does. 
   My friends, the Progressives, I want to compliment them because they're bringing a budget to the floor that reflects the principles that respect their values, and they are putting their rhetoric where their mouth is by bringing a budget to the floor, and I want to commend my Progressive friends for doing that. That's what we all should be doing. 
   You hear me criticizing the underlying budget. You hear me criticizing the Progressive budget. But we will be bringing our own budget to the floor in just a few minutes to show what we stand for; and what we stand for is controlling spending, is doing an earmark moratorium and saving that money. By just saying ``no'' to earmarks for a year, as our budget proposes to do, we can pay for making the child tax credit permanent, making the marriage penalty repeal permanent. Just those two things. 
   So at the end of the day, Mr. Chairman, it's about choices. It is about values. Do we want pork, or do we want more money in paychecks of Americans? Pork or paychecks? We are going to vote for paychecks. And the reason we're going to vote for putting more money in people's paychecks, for protecting their paychecks, is because people's paychecks aren't stretching as far as they used to. 
   You have high gas prices, high home health heating prices, high health care prices, high food prices. The last thing the American workers need today, the last thing American families need today is an average $3,000 tax increase. We shouldn't be taxing people because they're married. We shouldn't be raising taxes $500 per child. We shouldn't be making small businesses pay a higher tax rate than the largest corporations in America. Yet, that is exactly what the Democratic budget does. 
   It's what the Progressive budget does as well. It's what the Congressional Black Caucus budget does as well. It's a difference of opinion. It's a difference of values. We think Washington spends too much money. And my friend from California, she was right when she said it is about morals; it is about values. And we have different ideas. 
   We believe that the engine of economic growth, what makes America great, is its people, are the families, the workers, the small businesses, the entrepreneurs of America. 
   We also believe we have a moral imperative to make right by future generations. You know, my parents told me that the legacy of America is you leave the next generation better off. You make them safer, more prosperous, and will to them a higher standard of living. 
   We may sever that relationship because of the unsustainable past of our entitlement programs which each of these budgets makes worse. The Democratic budget, just in two programs, sends two programs, Medicare and Social Security, $14 trillion deeper in debt. That's wrong. That's giving our children and grandchildren a huge debt, a higher debt. 
   We think we need to go the other direction. We need to reform these programs so it can fulfill the mission of health and retirement security, but do so while still guaranteeing our children and grandchildren get a better future, a more prosperous future, a higher standard of living. That's why we should vote ``no'' on all of these budgets.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I thank the gentleman for all the work he has done on making us fiscally secure, being fiscally responsible, and bringing fiscal sanity to Congress. He's one of the leaders. 
   Mr. Chairman, the problem in Washington is not that we have too little tax money coming in. The problem in Washington is spending is too high. 
   Let me show you what this chart shows. It's a little complicated. The red line shows you the Democrats' line of higher taxes. The blue line shows you the revenue line that our budget will do, which is lower taxes. That's the difference of the marriage penalty, the child tax credit, income tax rates across the board, capital gains, dividends, the death taxes. The green line is the current spending trajectory that we are on. Let me describe what it looks like in just one program, as foreseen in the Democratic budget. 
   Under the Democratic budget, the Medicare program today has an unfunded liability of $34 trillion. What does that mean per household, per family? Three hundred thousand dollars. Right now, every family in America would have to put in $300,000 just to make Medicare secure, just to make Medicare viable and solvent. Under the Democratic budget, they increase that debt by $11 trillion in just 5 years. This 5-year budget says that in 5 years, by the time their budget expires, it will be about a $400,000 burden to every single household in America. You can buy a pretty darn nice house for $400,000. 
   Let me explain what this looks like across the board. And that's just one program where they're raising the debt by $11 trillion. This is the one that counts the most, Mr. Chairman. 
   For the last 40 years, the Federal Government has been pretty consistent in how much money it has had to tax to pay for the Federal Government. Washington had had to tax about 18.3 cents on the dollar for every dollar made in America. About 18.3 cents of the dollar made in America went to pay for Washington. Well, because of the baby boomers, because of their retirement, this isn't a Democrat thing or a Republican thing. It's just what's happening in America, because we are doubling the amount of retirees we have in this country, we're going from 40 million retirees to 78 million retirees. And these programs are what we call pay-as-you-go, where current workers pay a current tax to finance the benefits for current beneficiaries. 
   So I'm paying my payroll taxes and my income taxes for my mom, who's on Medicare and Social Security. That's the way the system works. And it works out well if you have an equal ratio of workers and beneficiaries, but we don't. The reason we don't is because our birth rates declined after the baby boomer generation. There's nothing wrong, nothing sinister about it. It's just that it is what it is. 
   And so we're increasing our tax-consuming generation. We're increasing the beneficiaries by 100 percent, but we're only increasing the taxpayers by 17 percent. That, in a nutshell, is why we have this fiscal train wreck. That, in a nutshell, is why we're staring at these enormous debts in our country's future. 
   What does that mean to the future of our country? What does that mean for our children and our grandchildren? I'll tell you what it means to my three children. My son Sam is 3, my son Charlie is 4, my daughter Liza is 6. By the time my three children are exactly my age, and I'm not the oldest guy around here, by the time they are my age, they will have to pay twice what we pay in taxes just to keep today's Federal Government going for them at that time. 
   Let me say it a different way. Instead of taking 18.3 cents out of every dollar made in America today, when my three kids are my age, they're going to have to spend 40 cents on every dollar made in America just to pay the bills to the Federal Government. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have real competition that we have staring us in the face. We have competition from India, from China. The age of the global economy is here with us whether we like it or not, it is here. You can't extend and give a prosperous Nation a higher standard of living to the next generation if we're doubling their taxes. If we say today it's 18 cents on the dollar and tomorrow it's 40 cents on the dollar, you can't give our children and grandchildren a chance at a great career at a higher standard of living in this new competitive era we're in. If we do go down this path, we're going to give more and more jobs to China, to India, to other countries. 
   So we say what we ought to do is do what our employers want us to do. The people that sent us here to Congress want us to fix this problem. They want us to fulfill the mission of healthy retirement security and do it without bankrupting future generations, and do it so we can stay competitive in a global economy so that we can pass a better future on to future generations. That's why this budget should be defeated.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman from Texas mentioned, we are not saying all earmarks are bad. Some of them are worthy. Some of them are vetted. Some of them fit within the proper role of the Federal Government. But a lot of them are bad. A lot of them are wasteful. A lot of them probably go outside of what most people think is the proper role of the Federal Government. 
   The point is we don't have all the answers on how to make it work right. That's why we think we ought to have a commission of an equal number of Democrats, an equal number of Republicans, the Kingston-Wolf Commission is what everybody calls it, to figure out how to make these things work right so that Congress can regain the trust and confidence of the American people. But in the meantime, let's say ``no'' to these earmarks for a year. Let's do a moratorium. That's what we do. 
   Do you know what we can accomplish by actually having a moratorium of earmarks for 1 year? By banking those savings, by saying ``no'' to earmarks for a year and carrying those savings in our budget, we can make sure that we're not going to cut the child tax credit in half; that we are not going to tax people for being married. We can make permanent the $1,000 per-child tax credit, the repeal of the marriage tax penalty. 
   Let me just read along this list of earmarks that we have: an ode to Tom Daschle, a nice guy, former Senate majority leader, a $1 million earmark to create a center for Tom Daschle in South Dakota. Or we could look at the Hippie Museum. This one's been pretty well known, $1 million to commemorate hippies at Woodstock. Or we can look at the sailing earmark, they call it, a 65-foot catamaran sailing around Monterey Bay. It sounds like a fun thing to do. Why should people in Wisconsin pay their Federal taxes to pay for that? Or we could take a look at all the lists and lists and lists that go on. One of my personal favorites is the ``ferry to nowhere.'' That came from our side of the aisle, $50 million for a Navy expeditionary marine craft, just a ferry to go to a peninsula that serves 40 people. 
   The point is, Mr. Chairman, we're not saying that Republicans are so much better than Democrats on all of this. We're saying Congress is broken in this area. Let's fix it. But in the meantime, let's save this money. Let's have a time out. Let's fix this problem so that we can regain the trust and take that money and do two really important things: let's not tax people for being married, and let's not raise taxes on American families by $500 per child. We can do those two things by simply saying ``no'' to earmarks this year. That's what our budget will do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield myself 6 minutes, and I'm going address the House in the well. 
   Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to start off by thanking my friends from New Jersey and South Carolina. They did put together a credible budget that adds up. We did, too. 
   Budgets are about priorities; they're about values; they're about what way you think the country should go on a fiscal ship. Let me walk through our budget and how it's different. 
   Number one, my friend from New Jersey and the chairman himself said that by calling our budget that makes today's tax policy a permanent tax cut, I want to thank them for saying that. By keeping tax rates where they are today, which is what we propose, a tax cut, then the opposite of that is a tax increase. They have proven my point. Their budget raises taxes. 
   Now, let me simply show you, Mr. Chairman. This red line is the baseline that the Democrats have chosen to adopt for their budget. This blue line is the baseline we've chosen on revenues to adopt for our budget. The blue line says, make the child tax credit permanent, repeal the marriage penalty forever, make the income tax rate not go up, keep the death tax repealed, keep the lowered tax rate on capital gains and dividends. What does the Democrat budget do? It raises taxes $683 billion on everybody, not just rich people. 
   What do we do on the alternative minimum tax? Here's what the Democratic budget proposes to do: It proposes to patch it for a year by swapping it out with another tax increase. Then, by 2009, about 30 million people are going to get hit by it; 2010, 31 million people. On and on and on. We propose to make sure no new people get hit by the alternative minimum tax, then we phase it out completely. That's point two of what our budget achieves. 
   Point three, and I think you're going to hear this a lot, we cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cutting here, cutting there. You hear this sort of legislative gobbledygook about function 920. Well, as we looked at the Democratic budget, we really couldn't find any savings, but we did, we found a sliver of savings in the budget. Where was that sliver of savings kept? Function 920. 
   What matters in a budget resolution are two numbers, the discretionary number, the 302(a) we call that, we do that, and the direction to the committees, we do that. We do it just like the Democrats did it. That's how we wrote our budget. But there's a difference. You may not be able to see this. For those who are watching on TV, you may have to zoom in. The CBO baseline is the red line. The Republican substitute is the blue line. Not a huge gap of difference in spending. We are simply saying let's not spend that money as fast, and by controlling the growth and the increase in spending, we can make sure we don't raise taxes on the American people. We can repeal the alternative minimum tax. That's the difference in values between the two of us. 
   Let me give it to you in a different way. What we Republicans are proposing to do is, instead of spending $15.82 trillion over the next 5 years, let's instead spend $15.32 trillion over the next 5 years. Don't spend 15.8, spend 15.3. What's the difference? We're not cutting the child tax credit in half. We're not bringing back the marriage tax penalty. We're not raising every single income tax payer's tax rates across the board. We're not raising the tax on pensions and 401(k)s by raising the tax on dividends and capital gains, and we're not going to keep taxing people when they die. At the end of the day, though, what are we doing for our children and our grandchildren? That's what we should be talking about in budgeting. 
   Budgets are moral documents. There is a moral imperative before this country, before this Congress, and that moral imperative is, what are we doing for future generations? In just one program, in just one program, the Medicare program, one of the most important programs in the history of the Federal Government, the Democrats' budget proposes to increase its debt by $11 trillion. The debt for Medicare right now stands at $34 trillion; that's the unfunded liability. What are the Democrats doing by doing nothing, by going 5 years with blinders on? $45 trillion. That breaks down to $395,000 per household, each household would owe to make Medicare whole. 
   What are we doing? We're reforming the program. We're making it work better. We're giving it changes that are needed so that we can make it sustainable, so we can save the program for the baby boomers. 
   We lower the Medicare debt and unfunded liability by $11 trillion to 23. The Democrats raise the debt to Medicare alone by $11 trillion; we reduced it by $11 trillion. At the end of the day, it's about priorities. 
   We also call for a 1-year moratorium on earmarks. We're simply saying, let's just take a time-out from pork for a year in Congress. What do we achieve with that? By not doing earmarks for 1 year and by saving that money in this budget, we can make sure we don't raise taxes on every household by $500 per child. We can make sure we don't return to the days of taxing people when they're married. Just those two things can be accomplished by saying ``no'' to earmarks for a year, having a time-out, saying let's have Democrats and Republicans from both parties from both the Senate and the House get together and figure out how to clean up this system and, in the meantime, save the money. So we don't tax people for having kids and we don't tax people for being married. 
   At the end of the day, you're going to hear all this rhetoric about cuts, about devastation, about how wrong it is and how immoral it is. We're simply saying, instead of spending $15.8 trillion, spend $15.3 trillion. We're still increasing spending, but let's not increase it as fast as Washington has been spending it so we can save that money, so we can make sure we don't raise taxes on Americans. That's what our budget does.

Not true, not even anywhere in our budget. You know what? Medicare goes up, spending goes up. Education? Spending increases. I don't know where these cuts are coming from that he's talking about, but that's not in our budget.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to make three points. 
   The gentleman's revenue chart makes our point. After the dot-com bubble, we went into recession and revenues went down. After the tax cuts, and his own chart makes the point clear, revenues went up. 
   Point number two, this budget, the Democratic budgets, has the single largest increase in the national debt in any given year in the history of the country. 
   Point number three, Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman just acknowledged more or less, their budget raises taxes. We don't believe we should be raising taxes at a time when people are paying a lot just to live in a time when we're about to go into recession. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina, the vice-ranking member of the Budget Committee (Mr. Barrett).

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Reclaiming my time, my point is the Democrats' budget, the Spratt budget, has the single largest increase in national debt in any given year, which comes from largely foreign governments these days. 
   My other point was I understand why my friends on the other side of the aisle are so dismissive of these tax cuts in 2003. Only three Democrats who are here today voted for them. All but three of them voted against them. They voted against reducing the marriage tax penalty. They voted against expanding the child tax credit. They voted against lowering tax rates across the board. They voted against lowering dividends and capital gains and repealing the death tax. 
   I simply would say that, as this chart shows you, even after all of those tax cuts, look what happened. Receipts went up. Four straight years of income tax receipts increased. Do you know why? People went to work. They got jobs. They paid taxes. Economic growth, even at those lower tax rates. 
   At this time, Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence).

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I will just take 30 seconds for myself. 
   I would simply say our budget does not have the veterans fee increases. That is in the President's budget. That is not in our budget. 
   Also, our budget does not cut Medicare and Medicaid by a half a trillion dollars. Under our budget, Medicare and Medicaid increases every year, one year after the other. We simply think it should not increase as fast as it is because we want to make it more solvent. 
   Third point, they say this is a new vision budget that they are proposing. All they are really doing is bringing us a CBO baseline and slapping another $280 billion on top of it. That's what their budget is. The problem is that the CBO baseline requires the largest tax increase in history. That's what we don't support. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the new Member from Georgia, Dr. BROUN.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, I would like to say thank you to a few people. I would like to take this moment to recognize the hard work of the minority staff of the Budget Committee. 
   I want to thank Austin Smythe, our new staff director; Chauncey Goss, Pat Knudson, Charlene Crawford, Tim Flynn, John Gray, Jim Herz, Charlotte Ivancic, Angela Kuck, Paul Restuccia, Jon Romito, Stephen Sepp and Clete Willems; and our interns, Sigurd Neubauer, Dustin Antonello, and Ryan Michaels. 
   I am very fortunate to have very bright, very talented, and very dedicated coworkers on the Budget Committee. I also want to thank the chairman for being a gentleman and for his staff for being professional as well. 
   I have a problem with the budget the chairman has brought to the floor. We have a different vision. It's good that we have these choices. We owe the American people a choice. We owe them two different visions to choose from in this country. 
   That's what's good about elections. Lately, the differences have been muddled. I'm glad we are making them more clear. What do we want to do with our budget? 
   We believe that we should do a few things. We should balance the budget, number one, and we shouldn't raise taxes. We think that it's really tough for people to afford just the cost of living today. You are filling up your gas pump at the highest prices you have ever paid before. You are paying health care costs the highest you have probably ever paid before. Food prices are up $70 a month for the average family these days. 
   The last thing the American taxpayer needs is a big tax increase, an average of $3,000 per family per year. That's what the Democrat budget has. 
   Now, the Democrats like to say they have this policy document in their budget. On page 48, it's the policy that we don't want these taxes to go up. Then they say, later on, but we are balancing the budget. 
   The first 27 pages are ones that matter in this budget, the numbers. They can't have it both ways. They can't look the American people in the eye and say we are balancing the budget and we are not raising taxes, because  the only way they balance the budget, you can bring out all these left-of-center experts that tell you otherwise, but according to the numbers, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the only way they balance the budget is by enacting the largest tax increase in American history. 
   So the question is, at this time of economic uncertainty, at this time of job loss, at this time where we possibly could go into a recession, at this time of high prices of living, can we afford the Democrats' tax hike? I would like to know. I would like to get e-mails and calls from people to know, can we afford this? 
   What is our vision? Our vision is to balance the budget without raising taxes. The key thing is we have got to save money. We are not even proposing to cut spending. We are saying instead of spending $15.832 trillion over the next 5 years, let's spend $15.32 trillion over the next 5 years. Instead of growing spending at 5.2 percent, let's grow it at 3.8 percent. 
   In that, we are saying let's put a down payment for reform on our children and grandchildren so we can make Medicare and Social Security more solvent, so we can say to the seniors of this country we want Social Security and Medicare to last for you and for our kids. 
   But we also say, this Congress is broken. Most people get that. We don't call earmarks congressional initiatives or investments; it's pork. If we just do away with the pork for 1 year, we can put a down payment on making sure we don't have our taxes increased. For 1 year, we can make sure we don't raise taxes on everybody who has children by $500 per child. We can make sure we are not going to tax people simply because they are married if Congress just says ``no'' for pork for a year. 
   So what's the question? Do we want pork or paychecks? More money in workers' paychecks or more pork up here in Washington? 
   I agree that earmarks are necessary and are a function of this branch of government. It's out of control. It's broken. It needs to be fixed. 
   Let's stop them for a year, fix this problem so that it has the integrity and the faith that the American people deserve. While we are doing that, let's balance the budget without raising taxes. That is what our budget does. 
   Yet you hear this same old thing in Washington every year. What they always say is, if you are doing anything other than spending as much as they want, you are cutting spending. If you are not throwing all this money at new programs, you are cutting spending, you are hurting the veterans, you are hurting children, you are hurting people, you are doing this, you are doing that. We are simply saying we need to control our spending in this town. 
   You see, Washington doesn't have a tax revenue problem. Plenty of money is coming in. Washington has a spending problem. We have got to get our handle on that spending. 
   By controlling that spending, by growing it at a slower pace, by putting a down payment on reform, by making Medicare more solvent, we can do those things while we balance the budget without raising taxes. 
   That's the choice. We can have their plan with the largest tax increase in history, more and more and more spending, more earmarks, more pork, less money in our paychecks, or we can have our plan: control spending, balance the budget, keep more money in your paychecks. 
   Because you know what? Paychecks aren't going as far as they used to. They don't cover as much groceries, as many gas tanks. They don't cover as much of health care bills as they used to. We believe it's the people's money; they believe it's Washington's money. That's the basic difference at the end of the day. 
   We believe people ought to keep more of their own money because it is their money. They believe it's Washington money, and they want more of it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the event conducted by the bipartisan Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus yesterday. 
   Mr. Speaker, last year the Democrats won the Congressional Shootout, the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus trophy, between sporting clays, trap and skeet, and the Democrats thought that there was a realignment occurring in Congress, in America. They thought they were on a good run for a long time. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to say this year that the Republicans reclaimed the trophy and won the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus Shootout this year. The realignment was very short-lived. 
   In particular, Mr. Speaker, I would like to, on behalf of my co-chairman Mr. Kind from Wisconsin; the vice chairmen, Mr. Pearce from New Mexico and Mr. Boren from Oklahoma, I would like to give particular note to the people who really shot straight yesterday.  
   Top gun: Congressman  Hayes only dropped a few clays all day. 
   Top Republican: Congressman John Kline, Minnesota. 
   Top Democrat: Congressman Bennie Thompson. 
   Top Sporting Clays: Congressman Mike Ross. 
   Top Trap: Congressman Don Young. 
   And Top Skeet: Mike Thompson. 
   All together, a good bipartisan effort, but more to the point, the Republicans reclaimed the trophy and reversed the realignment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First off, Mr. Speaker, I would like to celebrate the fact that we are here in this well talking about this motion to go to conference, and I want to compliment our chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Spratt, the gentleman from South Carolina. And I mean this in a very sincere way. 
   The budget process doesn't work if you don't have a budget, and I want to compliment the gentleman from South Carolina for making it 2 years in a row for actually bringing forward and getting through a budget resolution. It looked like it wasn't going to happen. We won't be supporting it, but the fact that the budget chairman is keeping the budget process intact speaks very good to this institution, good to the process, and I want to compliment the gentleman from South Carolina for doing that. 
   Now, on to the motion to instruct. Everyone agrees, Mr. Speaker, that we need to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. But frankly, if we really want to move forward with greater energy independence, we should increase our petroleum supply by increasing our domestic production of oil. The motion accomplishes just that. 
   The Republican motion calls on the conferees to increase the receipt levels in the final budget resolution by expanding leasing in Federal areas in the West, in the Outer Continental Shelf and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in an environmentally sound manner. 
   Yesterday, the House voted overwhelmingly to suspend the purchase of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a means to increase oil supply and reduce gasoline prices. It's unclear whether this will have any impact on oil prices, much less gas prices. 
   This motion would accomplish that result. It would, No. 1, increase domestic oil production and put downward pressure on oil prices and gasoline prices; No. 2, it would reduce our reliance on foreign oil; and, No. 3, it would reduce the deficit. 
   More than a year ago, the Democratic majority pledged to bring gasoline prices down. On January 4, 2007, the day the Democratic majority took control of the House, the price of gas was an average of $2.33 a gallon. Today Americans are paying an average of $3.76 per gallon to put fuel in their cars. Just 2 days ago in Kenosha, Wisconsin it was $3.95. It's $4 in some areas. This is an increase of at least $1.43 a gallon. 
   Republicans are seeking to tap into America's great natural resources in an environmentally sound and effective way to provide the consumers the relief at the pump that they deserve, while reducing our reliance on foreign oil. 
   This Republican motion is a step in the right direction to enhance our energy security and put in place a long-term plan to provide relief at the pump. These are the steps we need to take to assist families, communities, small businesses, those that are suffering with soaring prices of oil and gasoline. 
   With that, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I will yield myself 30 seconds simply to say, using the chairman's argument, then there's no money in this budget for veterans, no money in this budget for science, no money in this budget for education if you use that line of argument. There's only money for discretionary spending in here. 
   A budget resolution is a series of numbers, and we're saying, let's adjust the numbers to accommodate the policy we're talking about here, drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Outer Continental Shelf, the Intermountain West. 
   At this time I'd like to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished ranking member of the Commerce Committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton).

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of the time. 
   I'll begin by stating what I said in the beginning, which is, as a person who believes in having a strong and intact budget process, I want to compliment the chairman for getting us to a Budget Resolution, for doing it 2 years in a row. It's not an easy accomplishment. So on behalf of the institution, it's important that we pass these budget resolutions.     
   The problem is we're not going to pass a good budget resolution. The reason the gentleman's budget resolution achieves a balanced budget is because it contains the largest tax increase in American history. It cuts the child tax credit in half. It repeals the relief for the marriage penalty, raises income taxes across the board, raises capital gains and dividends taxes, brings the death tax back in, and puts us on a path for the largest tax increase in American history by replacing the alternative minimum tax. So, yes, the gentleman's budget does balance because it only increases spending by $280 billion while it increases taxes by $683 billion. That's how the gentleman balances the budget. 
   But more to the point here, today the House voted to waive PAYGO to give farm subsidies to millionaires. Tomorrow the House is going to support PAYGO. They're going to enforce PAYGO to raise taxes on small businesses. 
   So this is what we're doing here in this Congress. Whenever it's time to keep PAYGO in place to control spending, it's out the door. It's waived. It's swept under the rug. It's baseline shopping, number cooking, gimmicking, cliffs. But whenever the time comes to raise taxes, that's when we enforce PAYGO. 
   Mr. Speaker, PAYGO doesn't exist. PAYGO is not in place. It is not being enforced. It is a sham. The only thing that PAYGO does today is give the majority an excuse to raise taxes. It doesn't cut spending. It doesn't reduce the deficit. It just raises taxes to fuel more spending. 
   Watch what happens tomorrow. Today millionaires get agriculture subsidies because we waived PAYGO; tomorrow, taxing small businesses to create a new entitlement program. 
   But to the point of this motion to instruct, what we are trying to achieve with this motion to instruct is to try to make this budget a little bit better, a little bit better by talking about the issue of the day, which is people are not being able to spread their paychecks as far as they were before. They can't get as much out of their paychecks because of $4 gasoline. 
   Why do we have $4 gasoline? Because we don't have an energy policy in this country. And what we are simply saying is one of the reasons is we have so much supply we're not getting: 16 billion barrels at ANWR; 2 trillion barrels in oil shale in Wyoming and Montana; 86 billion barrels in the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   Let me say that one more time: 16 billion barrels in Alaska, 2 trillion barrels in shale in the Intermountain West, and 86 billion barrels in the Outer Continental Shelf. All off-limits. 
   If we just did ANWR, according to the CRS, the Federal Government would see a surge in revenues, no new taxes, not even cutting spending, $191 billion; $191 billion, according to the CRS, from just doing ANWR. That's the smallest of all of our reserves. Think what we could do with $191 billion. We could reduce the deficit. We could create a Manhattan Project for research and development for renewable energies to put fossil fuels out of business. 
   But, no, we're doing none of this. So this is the economic equivalent of shooting yourself in the foot, of cutting off your nose to spite your face. This is not an energy policy. 
   This is a bad budget resolution that raises taxes on the American workers  and families and businesses. The worst time we should be raising taxes is when we are possibly in an economic recession, and the last thing we ought to be doing is raising taxes on people. Furthermore, with high food prices, high gas prices, we shouldn't be raising people's taxes. That's what this budget does. 
   So to try to make it a little bit better, let's get some of our own oil and gas from our own country instead of being so reliant on foreigners for it. We're giving the wrong people our money, people who are not our friends overseas. 
   So pass this motion to instruct. Make this budget a little bit better, and open up production so we can actually truly do something to lower the price of oil and make us less dependent on foreign oil.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I say this regretfully, but this bill is an absence of leadership. This bill shows that we're not leading, that America is not leading, that the new majority is not leading. 
   Why do I say that? The new majority brought this bill to the floor and they waived PAYGO. They swept PAYGO under the rug and they're violating PAYGO in two places in this bill alone. They'll say, we're trying to conform with the Senate PAYGO rules. Well, that does so at the very expense of the House PAYGO rules. What I find interesting is, right after this bill is passed they're bringing up the new budget resolution, which if that passed before this bill passed would violate the Senate PAYGO rules. How convenient. 
   The point is this: We're sweeping money under the rug; this bill is hiding $23 billion in extra costs, it's not even measuring the amount of payment increases and price increases that are in here. But where this is really a loss in leadership is, I don't think the American taxpayer, who is having a hard time making ends meet today, who is stretching their paycheck really far with high gas and food prices, likes the idea that we're going to give couples earning $2.5 million subsidies for growing agriculture. Why are we giving agriculture subsidies to multimillionaires? This does not reflect the values that the taxpayers sent us here to achieve. 
   More to the point, Mr. Speaker, this will hurt the family farmers. That's what a farm bill ought to be about, helping family farmers, not corporate farmers. But by doing it this way, we're making it harder to open up markets for our family farmers so they can sell their corn, their beans, their dairy, and all their other products in foreign markets. Ninety-seven percent of the world's consumers don't live in this country, they're in other countries. We should open those markets for their products. 
   This bill, with its huge subsidies, closes those markets, it hurts the Third World from being able to lift their life out of poverty, and it wastes taxpayer dollars. And all you have to do is look at the rule that passed that says, ``Waive PAYGO one more time. The rules don't apply. Let's hide all this extra spending.'' 
   This, among many other reasons, is why people should vote against this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Clause 10 of rule XXI, the so-called pay-as-you-go point of order says that it is not in order to consider a bill if it increases the deficit if applied today over a period of fiscal years 2008 through 2013 and the period of fiscal years 2008 through 2018. The effect on the deficit is determined by the Budget Committee relative to the most recent baseline supplied by the Congressional Budget Office ``used in considering a concurrent resolution on the budget.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, according to the Congressional Budget Office relative to its March 2008 baseline, the Farm Bill will increase the deficit by $2.9 billion over the period of fiscal years 2008 through 2018. But if using last year's outdated 2007 baseline, CBO states that it would decrease the deficit by about $100 million over that same period, 2008 through 2017. 
   Mr. Speaker, under clause 10 of rule XXI, which baseline provided by CBO is the most recent and should therefore be used by the Budget Committee in order to determine pay-as-you-go compliance, the March 2007 baseline or the March 2008 baseline?

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. And I want to just thank you for all the leadership you've shown not only on this issue but that you've shown throughout your career. You fought the income tax in Tennessee. You're here fighting for lower taxes here in the U.S. Capital, and I want to thank you for all the leadership you have shown. And it's a pleasure for me to join you with this. 
   I thought, given the comments recently by our majority leader about this year's budget, it would be fitting to go through the budget that we're talking about. 
   The majority leader just said, in one of the publications printed here, that we don't need a budget conference report. Now, that's happened in the past. Under Republican leadership, when the Republicans ran the majority, there were a few times when the Republicans were unable to pass a budget. And you know what happens? No priorities are set. What happens when a budget is not passed, when a budget is not agreed to between the House and the Senate, is that only spending occurs or tax increases. And so there's no chance of fiscal discipline. There's no chance of putting us on a path to balancing the budget, to making sure we get rid of the deficit and pay down the debt. There's just spending. And 1 year into the majority, 1 year into the majority, they're now showing us that just 1 year in the majority they can't pass a budget.     
   They don't have a plan to get us to a balanced budget. They don't have a map for the fiscal future of our country. But they can come to the floor with spending bills. They can come to the floor to spend more money. And in fact, they do have a plan. And this budget is not necessary to raise taxes. 
   So I would like to talk about exactly what it is that they have been proposing, what it is our partners on the other side of the aisle have proposed. And if you take a look at what they proposed this year, it is the largest tax increase in American history. The biggest tax increase before this was back in 1993. That was a $241 billion tax increase. 
   This tax increase that they're proposing now is a $683 billion tax increase. Now that is a big number. People probably want to know what does that number mean? It sounds big. It is going to do a lot. 
   Well, here is exactly what they mean when they are talking about a $683 billion tax increase. They want ordinary income taxes to go up across the board. So for people who got an income tax rate cut, that is every income taxpayer in 2003, they are going to go up across the board. We are now going to make small businesses who file their taxes as ordinary income taxpayers at about a 40 percent tax rate. 
   What is interesting is the people in the top tax bracket. We hear a lot of people running for President saying, we want the rich people to pay taxes. Guess what? Seventy-five percent of those who file in the top tax bracket are small businesses. They are not Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. They are small businesses who pay their taxes as individuals because that's the way small business taxation occurs in America. 
   What's more to the point is the fact that 70 percent of our jobs in America come from small businesses. So they're saying, not only do we propose to raise income taxes across the board for all income taxpayers, also on the engine of economic growth and job creation in America is small businesses. They're also saying, we want to raise taxes on capital gains and dividends. Those are the taxes that affect the value of our 401(k) plans, our IRAs and our pensions. 
   They also want to bring the death tax back into full force so that you pay taxes not once, not twice, not three times while you are living, but after you die as well. They also want to bring the marriage penalty back. We actually repealed the marriage penalty in 2003. They are proposing that it comes back in so they can spend that money on more government spending programs here in Washington. That hits taxpayers an average of $1,400 per married couple. 
   They are also proposing to cut the child tax credit in half from $1,000 down to $500. That means a tax increase of $500 per child. And they are also proposing to get rid of the lower income tax bracket, which is a 10 percent bracket, to a 15 percent bracket.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. That's right. And what the majority is basically proposing is they are going to deem this budget resolution. They are going to simply say that this is the resolution that we deem to be the case, and this is how we are going to manage the fiscal affairs of this Congress in this session. So we're planning on a big tax increase, and we're expecting it to happen because this is our plan, and now we're going to start spending the money. 
   And I want to be fair to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. They did bring a budget to the floor that does balance the budget. It does reach a balanced budget by 2012. The way and the method that it reaches a balanced budget by 2012 is this $683 billion tax increase. They only increased spending by $280 billion. But they increased taxes by $683 billion. So by raising taxes even more than all their spending increases, they are actually hitting a balanced budget. 
   But take a look at who gets affected by this. I mentioned the actual tax policy that they're proposing with their big tax increase to fund some of their spending increases and to actually hit a balanced budget. But let me just say who is going to actually be affected in America by this. One hundred sixty million taxpayers will see an average increase of more than $1,800 per year, $3,000 per taxpayer in Wisconsin, more than 6 million low-income individuals and couples who currently pay no income taxes will no longer be exempt. A family of four earning $50,000 will see their taxes increase by $2,100. Approximately 48 million married couples will face this average tax increase of $3,000 per year. Low-income families with one or two children will no longer be eligible for the refundable tax credit. Roughly 12 million single women with children will see their taxes increase by $1,100 per year. About 18 million seniors will be subjected to tax increases of more than $2,100 per year. And the tax bill for an estimated 27 million small business owners will increase by more than $4,000 each. These are real people, real Americans, really hardworking people struggling to make ends meet. 
   And these are real tax increases at a time when people are having a hard time just to make ends meet right now because of all these high prices, you see the 
   price of food going up, groceries, gasoline, health care premiums, across the board. 
   I just did a telephone townhall meeting the other night. So many constituents said, Congressman, my paycheck is not stretching as far. People's paychecks aren't going as far as they used to go. Inflation is before us. The consumer price index just reached a 4.3 percent increase. And so what we see happening right now is with all these price increases in gas, groceries and health care, people's paychecks are not going as far as they used to go. It is eroding the standard of living of people. 
   We are possibly going into a recession. And the last thing we ought to be doing right now is raising all these taxes on all these hardworking Americans. We shouldn't be raising taxes on seniors. We shouldn't be raising taxes on people who get married. We shouldn't be raising taxes on parents with children. We shouldn't be raising taxes on small businesses. 
   What we should be doing in Washington is controlling our spending appetite. And that's the problem. That's the problem with this budget that has passed the House. That's the problem with the budget that the other side of the aisle is planning. They don't want to control spending. They don't want to cut spending or even control it. They want to increase spending. 
   In order to hit their commitment of a balanced budget, they will increase taxes even more than that. My fear is that this will take this possible recession we are going into and make it even worse, because people are having a hard time making their paychecks stretch as it is today. 
   Take a look at what Republicans believe and at the budget we passed. This is just a simple graph. The red line is the line of revenues that the Democrats chose to pick on their way to a balanced budget. The green line is the path that we brought with our budget, the Republicans. What does that line do? It says that we are not going to raise taxes. We are not going to raise taxes on income, on families, on people with children, on seniors or on small businesses. And we're going to repeal this alternative minimum tax. And we're going to balance the budget faster and better by cutting and controlling spending. Because if you take a look at the real problem in our fiscal situation, it's really spending that drives our problems. 
   And if I could just mention this one thing before I yield back to the gentlelady because I think we ought to have a conversation here, take a look at where we are today. And this chart is fairly confusing, but if you take a look at it, the blue line is the line that we want to be on, which is not raising taxes. The red line is the line that the Democrats are trying to propose, which is all these tax increases, the $683 billion we just articulated. The green is the future trajectory of spending. 
   So even if you take all these Democrat tax increases, that will only give you a temporary balanced budget. Because if you don't address spending in Washington, if you don't address our entitlement programs, the spending path that we are on will swamp any level of taxes. We're going to go into permanent deficits and massive debt. 
   So this notion that we can have a lasting balanced budget by just raising taxes is wrong. This notion that we should just raise taxes and increase spending is dangerous. And the reason that notion is dangerous is because spending is already out of control. And it is on a path that is really dangerous. 
   If I could just briefly mention this, the budget resolution that the Democrats brought to the floor on just two programs increases the debt by $14 trillion on just two programs. By saying we are not interested in controlling spending, by saying we are not interested in controlling and reforming government or fixing our entitlement programs, just the debt to Social Security and Medicare goes up by $14 trillion under the Democrat's budget. That's just two programs. 
   Every year we don't do anything to fix, save and make solvent Social Security and Medicare, we go another $2 trillion in debt just in those two programs. Our friends on the other side of the aisle are saying, instead of taking care of this $39 trillion debt we have with these two programs, we're going to raise it to $53 trillion. And that's wrong. 
   We believe that the way to fix our fiscal problems is to let Americans keep more money in their paychecks. It's to protect their paychecks, stop the pork barrel spending, control spending, reform government and reform our entitlement programs. Because we owe it to the next generation to leave them better off than we were left off. That's what my mom and dad told me growing up, that the whole point of America, the legacy of this country, is that you leave the next generation safer and more prosperous with a better chance at a better standard of living. 
   But for the first time in the history of our country, we have a real serious chance of severing that legacy, of discontinuing that tradition. Because if we give our kids and our grandkids the kind of debt that they are right now slated to get, and if we say for the next 5 years, as our friends on the other side of the aisle are now saying, we're not going to do anything to help that, we're not going to do anything to fix that, we are, in fact, going to add to  the problem. We are going to raise taxes, increase spending and make it even worse for our children and grandchildren. We are going to sever that legacy. And our kids and our grandkids will not have a higher standard of living. They will not have a better government. They will not have more freedom in their lives. And they will not have more money in their paychecks. 
   And if you want to just bring this point finally home, this is the chart that the General Accountability Office has given us. This shows us that what is unique about our budget and our fiscal history is that for the last 40 years, our government has been remarkably same in size. The Federal Government has had to take 18.3 cents out of every dollar earned in America. That is 18.3 percent of gross domestic product. So 18.3 cents on the dollar earned in America for the last 40 years is what Washington had to tax to pay for the Federal Government, to pay for everything, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, national defense, the Department of Education and the Department of Commerce. 
   But what is happening is the baby boom generation is retiring. And the first baby boomer retired just a few months ago. She was a retired school teacher in Maryland who started collecting her Social Security benefits. And behind her are 77 million more retirees. And so the problem for our country is with what we call a pay-as-you-go system, where current workers pay their current taxes to support current beneficiaries, that works out fine if you have an equal number of beneficiaries, retirees and workers. But we are doubling our retirees. We are going from 40 million retirees to actually 78 million retirees. But we are only increasing our workers in this country by 17 percent. So there is about 100 percent increase in the retirees in this country in one generation, but only a 17 percent increase in taxpayers. 
   So what does that do for our children? Well, I can tell you what it does for my children. My son, Sam, is 3 years old. My son, Charlie is 4. And my daughter, Liza, is 6. And by the time my three kids are exactly my age, exactly my age, they will have to pay 40 cents on the dollar just to keep today's Federal Government going for them at that time.     
   That is exactly right. By the year 2040, today's Federal Government, which costs about 20 percent of GDP, 20 cents on the dollar, we are in deficit and raising about 18.8 percent, it is going to cost 40 percent. And that is if we do nothing. 
   That is what it is all about. If we do nothing and we let government go on as it is, add no new programs, take none away, our government will double in size within one generation. So my children, instead of sending, like we are, about 18.3 cents on the dollar to Washington to pay the bills, will have to send 40 cents on the dollar to Washington to pay the bills, the bills we are giving them, the debt we are giving them. 
   That is unsustainable. You can't win globalization. You can't compete with the likes of China and India. We are having a hard time doing that right now. You can't compete with the likes of China and India and Europe and Japan when you are taking 40 cents out of every dollar just for Washington, before you get to local government, State government, gas, groceries, healthcare. This is the future we are consigning our children and grandchildren to. And the budget that is before us today, the budget that the Democrats passed on the floor just this last moment, says, you know what? Here is our answer. Do more spending, more taxes. Make the problem worse. Increase the debt to two programs by just $14 trillion. It is irresponsible. It is wrong. It is going to sever this legacy to our children and grandchildren. 
   We need to leave them with a better country, a safer country, a more prosperous country, one where they can compete and thrive and survive. I don't want to just have my children survive globalization. I want America to win globalization, to shape globalization, to make sure that our kids can have careers that they like, that they love, that they enjoy, so they have a higher standard of living. 
   But in fact that is not what is going to happen if we don't get our fiscal house in order right now. If we sign on to these tax increases and these spending increases, what we will do in the short run is we will make the recession worse. We will take more money out of the paychecks of working Americans at a time when they are having a hard time staying afloat right now. We will put more debt on to the backs of our children by building up all the spending in the baseline around here. 
   We need to say no to spending sometimes around here. There is one little easy piece of spending that I think we could say no to, and that is earmarks. Earmarks are what we call pork-barrel spending. Our budget, the Republican budget, not only balanced the budget by controlling spending and kept taxes low, but our budget said for one year, let's just have Congress say no earmarks for a year. No more pork for one year. A pork-free diet in Congress for just one year. 
   Do you know what we can accomplish in our budget by saying no earmarks for one year and keep banking that money, carrying out those savings? We can make the per-child tax credit permanent, make it stay at $1,000. We can permanently repeal the marriage tax penalty and prevent that $1,400 average tax increase on married couples from happening, by just saying no pork for one year and saving that money. That is what our budget does. 
   So the question on just the earmarks is, is it pork for Members of Congress, or is it paychecks for working Americans? We chose paychecks. Our friends on the other side of the aisle are choosing pork. That is wrong. So when you take a look at the short run, more pork, less money for people's paychecks. Higher taxes, less economic growth, more job loss, higher taxes on small businesses, on seniors, on families, on married people, on children, on people with children. 
   What you are seeing is they are going to increase the debt. They are going to increase the already unsustainable path that we are on and this unsustainable debt we have today. This is why we take this seriously. This is why we come to the well of the House to say we need to get our fiscal house in order, and the other side is recklessly spending with abandon. 
   Now, I want to say this as a Republican: Our party did not do a good job on this either as well in many instances. There are ways in which we should have done better. And that is why it is important for those of us who see what is going wrong to fix it. That is why it is important for us to have proposals to fix these things. 
   So nobody is perfect in Washington. Republicans did too much spending, but Republicans look like fiscal scrooges compared to the Democrats today. They look like they are the austerity Congress compared to the Democrat Congress today, because the Democrat Congress today is putting no limits on anything. They are saying bring a budget to the floor and just bring up more spending, bring up the taxes, and let's just let our children and grandchildren pay the bill. That is wrong. 
   So I want to thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for her courageous leadership on this. It is not easy to say no to all of the people that come looking for spending. Most people who come to visit their Congressmen and their Congresswomen say we need more money for this, we need more money for that. Every time you say yes to that, it is more money out of the paychecks of working men and women in America. This Congress chose less money for paychecks, more money for Washington. 
   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for being strong and being a leader on this and for fighting those kinds of instincts, and being a voice in the wilderness for fiscal discipline. I appreciate that.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I have explained this to constituents at home in Wisconsin and they are just dumbfounded. They think that if you come to the floor and bring an amendment to eliminate wasteful spending, let's just say we did an amendment to get rid of the $50 million Rain Forest Museum that is being built in Iowa City, Iowa. You could come to the floor and say, you know what? We probably shouldn't be spending our taxpayer dollars on this $50 million Rain Forest Museum, this rainforest in a bubble in Iowa. Let's not do that. We could pass that amendment and that $50 million couldn't go to that Rain Forest Museum. But by the way the rulings of our Congress work today, that $50 million won't be saved. It will be spent somewhere else in the government.     
   Most people think, if you actually go and eliminate wasteful spending, you actually save the money, but that's not the system. It gets spent somewhere else by the rules, somewhere else in the Federal Government.

Vote after vote after vote, on all these taxes, and our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats voted time over again to raise those taxes on individual tax rates. 
   They voted specifically to cut the child tax credit in half. They voted specifically to bring back the marriage tax penalty. They voted specifically to raise income tax rates across the board, to bring back death taxes, to raise capital gains and dividends taxes. They did this so they could pass a budget that increased spending.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I hope the people of Tennessee realize a big reason they don't have an income tax imposed upon them is because of MARSHA BLACKBURN. You led that antitax fight in Tennessee to prevent a new income tax from being imposed on the people of Tennessee. And now in Congress you have led the fight up here to see that they can have the same kind of deductibility of their sales taxes as those of us who come from States that have income taxes have that deductibility. 
   So I want to thank the gentlelady from Tennessee for being a champion of the Tennessee taxpayer. I am a Badger. I am a Wisconsin fan. I am a Packer fan. I am not a big Titan fan or a Volunteer fan, but I am a MARSHA BLACKBURN fan because you fight for taxpayers. We need more people in Congress fighting for taxpayers, just like we have champions like the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Diaz-Balart, and Mr. Conaway from Texas. Texas has a lot of people who fight high taxes, but MIKE CONAWAY is one of the guys leading here. 
   I am glad we got together to set the record straight on the budget and on the fiscal path that we are on in this country, and set the record straight for what future lies before our children and grandchildren if we don't take our responsibilities here seriously and change our course.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I rise in opposition to this rule, Mr. Speaker, for many reasons. Number one, this has become common practice for the new majority. But the farm bill reauthorization calls for massive new entitlement spending, no serious reform, and it makes a complete mockery of the PAYGO process. Number one, this is not a fair rule. 
   An amendment that I offered on a bipartisan basis with Mr. Blumenauer from Oregon to cap farm payments, which was made an order in 2002, which received 200 votes, was denied.     
   So based on the lack of fairness on this rule, I urge that it goes down. 
   But what about the substance of this bill? This bill extends farm commodity programs with no real reforms. At a time of record-high prices and prosperity for many farmers, this extends the commodity programs at 5 years with no reform. The payment limit is a sham. It has thin window-dressing payment limits on commodity programs while actually removing the payment limits on the marketing loan program. It has an anticompetitive tax increase in here which will raise taxes on American businesses that are owned by foreign companies: Nestle, Case New Holland, Chrysler. This will tax jobs out of America, and it increases entitlement spending. 
   And the only reason this bill ends up adding up on paper is because of a bogus $4.7 billion timing shift. CBO has already told us that this bill will spend $5 billion more than it pretends to spend simply out of the timing window within which it spends. What that means, Mr. Speaker, is on paper they are showing savings. In reality and in real life, they are spending over the limit, and they are breaking the budget by at least $5 billion. 
   And what is worse, Mr. Speaker, is this engages in the worst form of protectionism. This bill raises taxes on our taxpayers, raises prices on consumers, and it does so at the expense of people in the developing world. It hurts people in the developing world from lifting their own lives up out of poverty and despair. 
   So while we had a chance to have a good, bipartisan farm bill that had reform, that brought the market reform to bear, that could have helped the family farmer, we are saying no. 
   The farm bill ought to be about helping the family farmer in tough times, not giving million-dollar checks to big farmers, not giving checks out at good times. Unfortunately, that is what this bill does in addition to the phony PAYGO and shifting of $4.7 billion around like Enron accounting. 
   With that I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment for a number of reasons. Number one, it's high time we reform our agricultural programs which are Depression-era. This is a modest amendment from the original aggressive reforms. It puts in place the reforms that the USDA experts said that we ought to put in place for the safety net. 
   Let me just address what the safety net really is. Should we or should we not give million-dollar checks to farmers making $1 million? Should we have a farm program that helps the family farmer at a time when they're struggling? Should those payments go to farmers when they're making record high prices, when they're doing well? Or should these programs go to them when they're hurting? That's what this amendment does. 
   This amendment also pays for itself; no budget gimmicks, no timing shift, no tax increases. It actually reduces the deficit by $2 billion in 5 years and $14 billion over 10. It actually boosts conservation. It actually boosts nutrition. 
   Let me just address the payment limit. This bill right here says we will allow farmers to have aggregate program payments that are at least 12 times the poverty rate. Isn't that high enough? The average poverty rate for a family of four is $20,500. This amendment says let's allow the farm payment to a family of four be as high as a quarter of a million dollars. Yet the committee's bill says, no, that's not good enough. It has to be unlimited in some senses or a million-dollar AGI for others. 
   Madam Chairman, let's get our priorities straight. Lets have a farm bill that doesn't distort our trade posture in the international community. If we pass the base bill, it hurts us internationally to get better trade agreements and open markets for our farmers. If we pass the base bill, it hurts us from helping people in the developing world lift their lives out of poverty. 
   If you vote for the Kind-Flake amendment, you will help us internationally open markets to farmers, you will preserve a modern safety net that helps farmers when they need it and the family farmers when they need it, and you will save money for the taxpayer, you will put savings in nutrition, you will put savings in conservation, and you will help reduce the deficit. 
   This is a responsible amendment. It's a responsible bill. It is the right way forward, and this is what really, truly, needy family farms need. We don't need to be cutting checks in the seven-figure range for people with AGIs, adjusted gross incomes, of $1 million. We need to say 12 times the poverty rate's enough. That's what we need to say, and by voting for this amendment, that's what we are saying. 
   Help the family farmer, help conservation, help nutrition and reduce the deficit. Vote for this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I appreciate the Chair's indulgence and I will just take a moment to explain what this amendment does, and then I will yield back the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Chairman, there is a recent troubling report entitled ``CDC Off Center,'' which was produced under the direction of Senator Coburn with a report in the Senate Government Affairs Committee. Instead of using its resources to fight life-threatening diseases like HIV/AIDS and cancer, the CDC has instead spent money on needless luxury items and nongovernment functions. 
   For example, the CDC's Office of Health and Safety recently provided its employees with a new, extravagant fitness center that includes such items as rotating pastel ``mood'' lights, zero-gravity chairs, and $30,000 dry-heat saunas. The CDC has also spent over $1.7 million on a ``Hollywood liaison'' to advise TV shows like ``E.R.'' and ``House'' on medical information included in their programming, clearly an expense that should have been covered by the successful for-profit television shows, not by our hard-earned tax dollars. They also further squandered taxpayer dollars in an office intended to help improve employee morale. This program, which currently costs $250,000 per year, has yielded just 98 complaints since it was created last year. At this rate it is costing taxpayers about $3,000 per complaint. Despite the program's lack of use, the CDC is planning to spend at least $1 million more to expand it. 
   In a time when we are facing increasing risk of bioterrorism and disease, these are hardly the best use of taxpayer dollars. 
   My amendment simply would ensure that the CDC would not be able to spend any more Federal funding on these three boondoggles described above. And it is my hope that we can get the CDC focused on doing its job, which is very important and they do a good job on that, and not on these kinds of boondoggles. This report shows dozen of examples of these abuses. 
   And I appreciate the Chair for his indulgence and the acceptance of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan).

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, typically I would talk about all the spending problems in this bill. I want to talk about that for a moment. 
   This bill includes $16 billion in non-war, non-emergency spending. It blows through the $6.45 billion reserve fund that the incumbent budget resolution has for emergencies. It completely puts aside the rules that govern whether or not and how we fund emergency spending. 
   We put in these rules last year, which to the majority's credit continued this year, that said you can't just tuck anything in an emergency spending bill. It actually has to really be an emergency. Well, they have put those rules aside. We have got $16 billion of this stuff in here. 
   But the real problem I have with this bill, Mr. Speaker, the real concern I have is the signals it sends. We are telling our troops, we are telling our men and women in uniform in harm's way in Iraq, you have got 2 months, 2 months of funding, but we are letting any Member of Congress open up the bidding war and put $16 billion of stuff in here to fund them for a lot longer than 2 months. We are giving NASA more money than they need. We are putting LIHEAP money in here even after the winter has passed. We are putting money for the Architect of the Capitol for tunnel maintenance. We are putting the minimum wage in here. We  are saying yes to every other constituency, yes to every other spending request, whether it has anything to do with Iraq or not, whether it is a true emergency or not. 
   Some of these things may have merit, but why are they in this bill? And, more importantly, why are we telling our troops 2 months and you're up? 
   Mr. Speaker, our troops need better than that. They need to know we are going to be there for them. The Iraqi people need to know we are going to be there for them. 
   I was there just a couple months ago. Millions of Iraqis are sitting on the fence, trying to determine whether they join us or join the insurgency. If we tell them we are leaving in 2 months, we are cutting off the funding in 2 months, guess what. Those millions of Iraqis aren't going to join us. They aren't going to democracy. They are going to be pressured for fear to join the insurgency. 
   This sends the wrong message to the Iraqis. It sends the wrong message to our enemies. And it sure sends the wrong message to our troops. 
   I urge defeat of this bill.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I simply want to rise to say that the bill that just passed, which I actually supported because I think it was the right thing to do constitutionally, and just good government, it violated PAYGO for 2 hours. So what we have here is a too-cute-by-half PAYGO fix. And it is my hope that when the majority brings new bills to the floor that the bills themselves will be fixed with respect to PAYGO. 
   This rule tactic that is being deployed, I think, denied the minority rights to have the kinds of motions to recommit that the minority traditionally has been given. 
   But more importantly, this really is a violation of PAYGO. It is fixed now because it was broken just a minute ago. It is a half-hearted attempt for the majority to submit to their own rules. The PAYGO principle of pay-as-you-go ought to apply every minute, every second, every hour. If you believe in it, don't make it just apply for 2 hours and then bring it back an hour later just because you want to deny the minority an ability to have an effective motion to recommit.

It was the Democrat Party in the Senate that made it temporary, that put in, because of a cloture vote, put the temporary nature of the tax cuts in. The tax cuts sunset in 2012 because of the Byrd rule and because we did not have sufficient numbers of the Democrat Party at the time vote for cloture so that we could make these tax cuts permanent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to echo the point he made. 
   Our chairman, the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina, came to the floor and accurately said both budgets, the Senate budget resolution and the House-passed budget resolution, balance the budget. That is correct. They do. It is certified by the Congressional Budget Office. There is only one reason and way and method how they balance the budget, though, Mr. Speaker: by raising taxes. 
   The House-passed budget resolution relies upon, requires, in fact, makes sure that it passes the largest tax increase in American history in order to balance the budget. The Senate-passed budget resolution relies upon, requires and ensures that the second largest tax increase in American history be enacted on the American people, on the American taxpayers, in order to achieve balance. 
   I have two major concerns with this budget resolution, Mr. Speaker. Number one, it is very bad economic policy. And number two, it is an enormous missed opportunity. 
   Why is this budget resolution bad economic policy? Inflicting the largest tax increase in American history on the American family, business, entrepreneur, on American taxpayers, is bad economic policy. And here is why: Back in 2001, where we realized we had 9/11, and in 2003, where we realized we had a recession, with the dot-com bubble burst, with Enron scandals, we had job losses to the tune where we were losing about 124,000 jobs a month. We had to act quickly to get people back to work, so we cut taxes across the board. We cut taxes on entrepreneurs, on families, on workers, on businesses, on capital. What happened: 7.6 million new jobs were created since then. We have been creating on average over 200,000 jobs a month since then. The stock market turned around. The savings portfolios of senior citizens which were eviscerated in the market crash came back. The Dow hit 13,000 last week, an all-time high. We saw business investment, from negative decline after negative decline for 11 consecutive quarters, turn around and hit all-time highs. More jobs were created. And what happened at these lower tax rates? Revenues came into the Federal Government at a much, much faster pace, at about a 25-year high. So we saw more revenues coming into the Federal Government, which actually brought the deficit down at these lower tax rates. 
   What this budget resolution does is it puts that economic recovery plan in jeopardy. By raising taxes on people and businesses and entrepreneurs, you are reducing job growth in America. You are raising the cost of capital. 
   We have a problem, Mr. Speaker, and that is we live in the era of  globalization. The oceans no longer separate our economy from the rest of the world. Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers don't live in this country. They are overseas. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we have got to wake up. Wake up to the fact that we have real competitive pressures. Countries like China and India, let alone Japan and Europe, are giving us real competitive pressures, real competitive challenges. And when we go back to the old adage of taxing, taxing and taxing, what we are going to do is tax more and more jobs overseas to these other countries. By taxing our economy and our businesses and our workers more and more than our competitors tax theirs, you know what happens? They get our jobs. That is a mistake. That is wrong. 
   America taxes capital more than any other industrialized country in the world except for one, Japan, and they just finished two decades of recession. So it is really bad economic policy to have all these tax increases. 
   You just heard the gentleman from Massachusetts talk about the reserve funds they have in this budget. They really want to make sure that they don't raise these taxes. So they put a reserve fund in the budget. And the reserve fund basically says, we don't want to raise these taxes; we would like to come up and pay for them, but our money is not there. 
   A budget is basically a page full of numbers, and numbers don't lie. The numbers in this budget require these taxes to go up, require these taxes to sunset; otherwise, they don't balance the budget. 
   You can't have it both ways. You can't balance the budget on the left hand and then say we are not raising taxes on the right hand. It is one or the other. So regardless of how many empty promise reserve funds you have in a budget resolution, the numbers don't lie, and the numbers say these taxes are being raised. 
   Now, as to the point that the sunset was put in by the Republicans, not by the Democrats, and we are simply letting this Republican policy manifest itself, and we are budgeting for it, that is not quite true, Mr. Speaker. And I remember being a member of the Ways and Means Committee and working on the conference committee at this time. When these tax cuts went through the Ways and Means Committee in the House, when these tax cuts passed the House floor, they were permanent. They never had a sunset in them. What happened? This arcane rule in the Senate called the Byrd rule was put in place. And the Byrd rule said for these tax cuts to be permanent, it needs 60 votes in the Senate. What happened? We had 52 Republicans voting to make them permanent; no Democrats would vote to make these tax cuts permanent. So the Democrats filibustered making these tax cuts permanent, and because of the Democrat filibuster in the Senate, these tax cuts were made temporary. The only way to get this tax relief to the American economy, to the American people, to get out of the job loss, to get out of the recession, was this temporary tax policy because of the Democrat-led filibuster by then Senator Daschle at the time in the Senate. That's why there's a sunset in this law. 
   We always kind of wondered at the time, why would they stand in the way of the taxpayer and make these tax cuts temporary? Why would they insist upon these sunsets? Well, now we know why. Because it is how they balance the budget because they plan on, bank for, certify, require, rely on these tax cuts going away. 
   The second reason I think this is a bad policy is it is an enormous missed opportunity, Mr. Speaker. The gentleman from South Carolina, who really is a gentleman from South Carolina, and I mean that sincerely, had a lot of good hearings in the Budget Committee. We have had a few in Ways and Means as well. We had all these experts coming to us from the left and from the right, from think tanks on the left side of the aisle and think tanks on the right side of the aisle, we had the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Reserve Chairman, the Treasury Department coming to us, all saying the same thing: Entitlements are growing out of control. The entitlement program problem is enormous. We are doubling the amount of retirees in this country within one generation; yet we are only increasing the amount of workers coming in behind them by 17 percent.     
   We have an enormous unfunded liability, about $49 trillion. It's a mind-boggling number. But when you take three entitlements, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, those three entitlements right there, Mr. Speaker, will consume 100 percent of the Federal budget by the time my children are my age. 
   So all these experts came to us and said, Do something. You're the Budget Committee, you've got to do something to control the growth of entitlements. It's going to bankrupt America. And if we don't do anything, if we keep the government we have today and do nothing to reform entitlements, by the time my children are my age, they will literally have to pay double the amount of taxes for that Federal Government at that time. 
   Let me say it one other way, Mr. Speaker. Since about 1960, Washington has funded the Federal Government by taxing the U.S. economy by about 18 percent of the economy. About 18 percent of the gross domestic product has been required to pay for the Federal Government. It's been remarkably consistent. Now, if you take today's government, add no new programs, take none away, and transfer that out to about 2040 when my kids are my age, just to keep today's government afloat at that time you will have to tax 40 percent of GDP, 40 percent of the national economy just to pay for that government because of three entitlement programs. 
   You can't compete with China and India by taxing our economy at 40 percent, let alone Germany and Japan. You can't prepare for globalization. You can't help people get careers for tomorrow and enjoy higher standards of living if we don't address our entitlements right now. 
   That is the biggest travesty of this bill, Mr. Speaker. This bill says we will do absolutely nothing, nada, zilch, nothing at all either in the Senate budget resolution or the House budget resolution to attack and reform entitlement programs, to attack this problem for 5 years. This budget says let's do nothing to fix our entitlement programs for 5 years. That means we accelerate and exacerbate the bankruptcy of Social Security, of Medicare, of Medicaid. How is that helping senior citizens if we push these programs faster toward bankruptcy? I think that's wrong. I think we need to fix these programs so seniors can better rely on these programs. 
   And you know what, Mr. Speaker? In Wisconsin we say this a lot, and I think people say it around the country, and prior generations always told this to me, my parents and my grandparents, they said, the thing about America, what's beautiful about America is that one generation works hard and leaves to the next generation a country that's better off. The dream of parents is to leave your children with a country that's better off so you can enjoy a higher standard of living. That is the beautiful legacy of America. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are at risk of severing that legacy. If we don't address these entitlements, if we simply go the old easy Washington route of simply raising taxes and raising spending and doing nothing to address this entitlement problem, we will really run the risk of severing that legacy and giving our children a lower standard of living than that which we enjoy today. 
   We have new competitive pressures from other countries unlike any we have seen before. Raising taxes on families and workers will not bring more prosperity to America. It will give jobs to other countries. Doing nothing to attack the entitlement problem in this country will only ensure that an unprecedented mountain of debt is befallen onto our children and our grandchildren, and they are going to have to pay far higher taxes than any American has ever paid in the past. 
   This, Mr. Speaker, is why I say vote against this rule and vote against this budget resolution, which includes and relies on the largest tax increase in American history and the biggest missed opportunity by doing nothing to reform entitlements over the next 5 years. 
   This could have been a bipartisan opportunity to fix these problems. Sadly, it's not.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   You know, I want to clear up a couple of facts. The other side has been saying this provides tax relief, reducing taxes for 10 million, millions of people. No, it's not. People's taxes are not going to go down. If this bill passes, 23 million people will not see lower taxes next year. They may not see a tax increase. 
   This is not about cutting people's taxes. This does not provide tax relief. This prevents tax increases on some and raises taxes on others. So let's be very clear here; what the majority is trying to do and what their new rules do is they say, if you want to bring a bill to the floor to address the alternative minimum tax, you better raise taxes, because that's the only legislation we'll accept. 
   What the majority is doing is they're saying, by not raising taxes on people, we're giving them a tax cut. Holy cow. That is new logic. We are simply saying, let's not raise taxes. That's it. Period. End of story. 
   This tax law was never meant to be. It was never designed to tax all of these people. We all agree on this. And so I find it kind of puzzling that we're bringing this bill to the floor, which we know will not pass law. The other body won't even bring it up for a vote, so it just shows how bound and determined the majority is to raise taxes, how bound and determined they are to put on this new glide path of going to taxing our economy, our society, our workers, our families more than we have in the history of our country.     
   They are saying, we don't like the alternative minimum tax, but we want those tax revenues. So instead of taxing people this way, we are going to tax people that way and get all this new money into the Federal Government. 
   Mr. Speaker, the problem in Washington is not revenues; the problem is spending. Both sides could do a better job on spending. I freely admit that. Let's focus on controlling spending and not raise taxes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we're setting a precedent here. This is new policy that we are embarking on here. And let me tell you what this means. We have always in the past done what we call a patch for the AMT. We have always said let's not let the alternative minimum tax hit all these new taxpayers. Let's prevent that tax increase from happening. Well, what is now happening is the majority is saying, instead of having this tax increase, let's have some other tax increase. That's what their PAYGO rule does. 
   PAYGO does not mean let's live within our means, but let's expand government's growth, let's raise taxes. And 73 percent of all of the pay-fors for the bills that have come to this Congress this year have been paid for with either budget gimmicks or tax increases. That's right. Of all the wish lists of spending that the majority has brought to the floor, 73 percent of those things were either budget gimmicks or tax increases. 
   This is a tax increase. What this is, is saying you cannot come to the floor of this Congress and prevent this new future tax increase; so we're going to make another tax increase. If you want to stop this tax increase, you've got to raise taxes. You just simply can't stop the tax increase. 
   Now, why are we doing this? You've got to remember, Mr. Speaker, that the AMT in 1969, when it was written, was to stop 155 multimillionaires from escaping taxes. That was the idea. No one, no one ever intended it to be what it is today. It was a mistake. No one planned the alternative minimum tax to tax 23 million people in the middle class this year. No one said let's tax 30 million people in 3 years, but that's what this does. The majority's budget includes it. The majority's budget plans for it. And more important than that, Mr. Speaker, the majority is saying we may not want the alternative minimum tax, but we want that tax revenue. And that is the dangerous precedent that is being set here. 
   This chart shows you where the majority is trying to head with taxes in America on families and businesses and entrepreneurs. The blue line shows you our average. For the last 40 years, the Federal Government has had to tax about 18.3 percent of our economy to run the Federal Government. We have had good economic growth. We've been the world's leading economic superpower. We have been the world's superpower. And we have done this by taxing our economy at about 18.3 percent. What the majority is trying to do is take us to an all new high. 
   There are only three times in our Nation's history where we have ever exceeded taxing our Federal economy by 20 percent. Two of those were during World War II. And the majority wants not only to tax us at 20 percent; they want us to go up to 21 percent and then on up to 24 percent with this tax plan. This is a down payment on the majority's planned and intended and budgeted-for $3.5 trillion tax increase over the next 10 years. 
   And here is what is wrong with that: not only is it morally wrong to take more and more money out of people's paychecks, by taking more of their freedom and sending it to Washington, but what is really wrong is that it lowers our standard of living. And that is what is at issue here. 
   For the last 15 years, we have watched Europe go down this dangerous path. If you take a look at the majority's plan to bring us to this ever-higher level of taxation, add the State government, and we are on our way to taxing 35 percent of GDP. That is where the countries of Europe are. 
   And what did Europe achieve over the last 15 years? Their per capita of GDP, our main measurement of standard of living, is a quarter less than ours. Their standard of living is 25 percent less than the American standard of living. Their unemployment rate averages 9 percent; ours is half that. 
   So if we want to go down the road of stagnation, of high unemployment, of a lower standard of living, vote for this bill. Put us on this path.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. That is exactly the point, Mr. Speaker. 
   At a time when Europe is telling us don't follow us down this path, look at the unemployment, look at the welfare dependency. We have got to get out of this. 
   We are following them. We're going into the hole they've dug for themselves that they are trying to get out of. That is the majority's plan. That's a dangerous plan. They are saying you can't even bring a bill to the floor unless it raises taxes. That's what PAYGO means. That's wrong. This is the down payment on a $3.5 trillion tax increase on every American income tax payer. That's wrong. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a difference between our two parties. This is a difference between our philosophies. We believe the genius of America is the individual, the family, the entrepreneur, not government, not Washington, not elites here trying to spend your hard-earned tax dollars. That is the difference. We believe we should keep government lean and we should keep government doing what it should be doing and not ever growing its role because when we do that, we sap the strength of the American entrepreneur, of our economy. 
   We need to give our children the gift that our parents gave us, and that is a higher standard of living. And we are at risk of severing that legacy, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 12 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, first off, I would like to start off this debate by paying a compliment to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt). The gentleman from South Carolina is just that. He is a gentleman. He is a good man, he is a man who has a tough job, and he is a man who I enjoy working with. 
   The key to this year's budget debate is not whether Congress should balance the Federal budget. Republicans and Democrats this year are agreeing that we need to balance the Federal budget. The key is about how we are going to get there. 
   Today, as this House debates both the Democrats' and the Republicans' budget proposals for fiscal year 2008, it will become clear that this is much more than a simple discussion about numbers and how they add up over the next few years. Instead, this is going to be a bigger debate about our different governing philosophies, about what kind of society we envision, about what kind of country we want to leave to future generations. 
   The budget that the Democrats have proposed is true to their philosophy. I give them credit for that. They believe that more government is better government and that the best way to solve the myriad problems we face in this country is to spend more and more and to tax our people more and more to pay for that spending. 
   The Democrats' budget reflects this philosophy by calling for the largest tax increase in American history. I will make this irrefutably clear throughout the course of this debate: They call for immense new spending and postponement of critical entitlement reforms for another 5 years. 
   If Congress passes this budget tomorrow, this will enshrine the raising of taxes to the tune of $400 billion on the American family, worker and business. And we are not just talking about raising taxes on the rich, as they would like to have us believe. We are talking about raising taxes on every single American income tax payer. This means raising marginal income tax rates on all taxpayers; eliminating the 10 percent bracket that has benefited numerous low-income individuals; raising the tax on capital gains and dividends and discouraging investment in our economy and saving for our seniors; slashing the child tax credit in half; reinstating the marriage tax penalty; reimposing the death tax; and eliminating the State and sales tax deduction for States like Texas and Florida. 
   Let me just show you where the lie is. It is not in the numbers. The lie is in the so-called reserve funds. They can give you all the words they want. They can say they put all these fancy words in this budget that says we don't want to raise taxes, we want this new spending. But what a budget resolution is is a bunch of numbers, and numbers don't lie, Mr. Chairman. 
   This budget requires, banks on, plans for, assumes, insists upon the largest tax increase in American history. Otherwise, they don't balance the budget. 
   So my friends on the other side of the aisle can have it one way or the other, but not both. They can say they are balancing the budget. But, according to their budget, they therefore have to raise taxes. Or they can say they are not raising taxes, at which hand they then are not balancing the budget. They can't have it both ways.     
   The line, the red line, which is the revenue baseline, does not lie. 
   Now, their revenue numbers show it. And they can bring in all the left-leaning think tanks that have been in favor of tax increases in the past and in the present to say that this isn't a tax increase, but come December 10, January 31, that is the last day people have a $1,000 tax credit. It is the last day married couples won't be taxed for being married. It is the last day the death tax isn't at zero. It is the last day income tax rates don't go up across the board. That is what happens. 
   They have also made more than $100 billion worth of additional spending  promises in this budget, if they are offset. That's what all these reserve funds are about; more money for this program, more for that program, more money for this program, maybe some tax relief for the middle class. We have a reserve fund for it. My friends, a reserve fund is worth less than the paper it's printed on because all it says is we have these priorities, these ideas, these things we would like to do, we have no money for it; middle-class tax relief, more money for SCHIP, farm programs. 
   But if we did come up with the money to pay for these programs, we would like to do it; but we don't have the money, so we're not doing it. That is basically what a reserve fund is. 
   What we really have here, Mr. Chairman, is a huge tax increase, a tax increase that will have the effect of significantly increasing the burden on individual taxpayers and small businesses and will completely ignore the positive growth impacts that these tax cuts encouraged since 2003. 
   Let's review some of the effects that low tax burdens have had on economic growth, on jobs. Before we provided tax relief in 2003, we were losing an average of 100,000 jobs a month. Since then, we have added 7.6 million new jobs; about 170,000 new jobs have been created per month since the tax relief. 
   The economy. Before tax relief occurred in 2003, the economy grew at an average rate of 1.1 percent. Now it has been 3.5 percent since then, faster than it has grown in the last three decades, on average. 
   Unemployment. When we passed tax relief, the unemployment rate was at 6.1 percent, now it's all the way down to 4.5 percent. 
   Business investment. When we passed tax relief, business investment had been down for nine straight quarters. Since then, business investment has been up for 15 straight quarters. That is where the 7.6 million new jobs got created. Unfortunately, the Democrat budget would ignore all of this, with immense tax increases that threatened to put us right back where we were in the recession of 2001. 
   And now on revenues. What they will tell you is that the revenues are the reason why we are in deficit. What they will tell you is that the tax cuts drove us deeply into deficits. That is completely untrue. On the contrary. If you take a look at this chart, the tax relief actually had the effect of increasing job creation and revenues coming into the Federal Government. 
   We had 3 straight years of revenue decline during the recession. The tax cuts kicked in. What happened? Revenues went up exponentially, to the point where we have had double digit revenue gains for the last 3 years, and as a consequence, the deficit has been going down. These surging revenues have been a key factor in reducing this deficit. 
   Mr. Chairman, the wrong way to balance the budget is to raise taxes. The right way to balance the budget is to control spending. We do not have a revenue problem in Washington. Money is coming in very quickly from taxpayers. What we have here is a spending problem. And the Democrats are making it worse because they are calling for all this new spending. 
   For all of their talk about reducing the deficit, all they have done since they came into the majority is to spend more and more money, and we are only into the end of March. First they passed the omnibus bill that added $6 billion in new spending. Next came the supplemental for the warfighters in Iraq and Afghanistan; they added $21 billion in unrelated and unrequested spending. And now their budget resolution adds another $24 billion in new spending next year alone. 
   For all the additional spending and gimmicks, the worst thing about this budget is not just the tax increases and the new spending, it's about what it does not include. This budget does nothing, absolutely nothing, to address our entitlement problem. This is what needs to be fixed, Mr. Chairman. 
   We had all these eyewitnesses, all these experts come from the left and the right that the majority called, from the GAO to CBO to other groups, all talking about the fact that our Nation is facing a fiscal crisis, that entitlements are growing out of control, that our primary responsibility in crafting our budget should be to address entitlement spending. Let me read some quotes from the Democrats' own witnesses. 
   The Comptroller General of the GAO has called the rising costs of government entitlements a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve came to testify. He said, ``Without early and meaningful action to address the rapid growth of entitlements, the U.S. economy could be weakened, with future generations bearing much of the cost.'' Even the Democrats' own witnesses from the Concord Coalition testified to the same. 
   They've heard all of these witnesses, they've heard all these warnings, and they have chosen in this budget to do nothing. There is not a single reform, a single dollar of savings from entitlements. Obviously, they seem to be unconcerned with the $4.6 trillion in liability that Social Security has, which grows every year by $600 billion; or the $32 trillion in liability that my children are facing that gets larger and larger every single year. 
   With this budget, they have simply accepted that we are going to continue to pile up massive amounts of debt to our children, and we are going to force them to pay 
   double what we pay in taxes today to sustain these programs. 
   This brings me to my final chart, a chart by the General Accounting Office. We know that if we fail to reform entitlements, the Federal Government will double in size by the year 2040. When my kids reach my age, this budget would leave them with the choice of either paying double our current tax rate, or accepting the fact that we just don't have enough money to spend on health care, defense, national security or education. 
   I believe this is an enormous missed opportunity by the Democrats. Yes, the Democrats balance the budget in 2012, and they should be commended for reaching that goal. But at what price are they balancing the budget? They hit balance only because they are imposing the largest tax increase in American history. We still will have all of the same problems though. 
   They are not reforming anything in government. They are not reforming any program. They are just calling for the American taxpayer to send more money in Congress so we can continue to spend too much money. And because of the path of big government and the tax-and-spend policies that the Democrats have chosen, this is going to be a very short-lived success. As soon as we get back to this balanced budget on paper in 2012, the year where their budget gets balanced on the backs of taxpayers, it won't be long before entitlement spending drives the Federal Government right back into deficits as far as the eye can see. 
   This is not a Republican and Democrat issue. The fact is every independent expert in America that watches fiscal issues knows that government is growing out of control. We have really important programs that need our attention, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, the three most important programs, in my particular opinion, in the Federal Government. Important programs, and programs people depend on, organize their lives around. We have to reform these programs in order to save these programs, yet they are doing nothing to do that. And because their budget does nothing to save these programs, they are hastening the day at which they go bankrupt. That is an abdication of responsibility. 
   No matter how you put it, Mr. Chairman, this is a tax increase. No matter how you put it, Mr. Chairman, a reserve fund, no matter what flowery language you can attach to it, no matter what left-leaning think tank you can have to say whatever you want, a tax is a tax. 
   In our budget, we make sure that these tax increases don't hit American families. We make sure the marriage penalty stays away. We make sure the child tax credit stays up. We make sure tax rates are down. We make sure the death tax goes away. What do they do? They insist upon, they require, they depend up all these tax increases. If they don't, their budget doesn't balance. They can't have it both ways. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, for the purpose of rebuttal, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I think we may set a record today on the floor on charts. 
   But, first, let me say, if you really don't want to raise taxes, if you are telling us that you have these words in your budget that says you don't want to raise taxes, you want middle-class tax relief, then why didn't you put it in your budget? 
   The fact is, Mr. Chairman, we gave the Democrats ample opportunity to put it in their budget to make sure that these taxes wouldn't increase. We had amendments in the Budget Committee to prevent the increase on the marginal tax rates, to prevent the elimination of the $1,000 per child tax credit, to prevent the elimination of marriage penalty, cap gains, dividends, State and local tax, bring back the death tax. We had all these votes to say, let's make it clear in the numbers: Don't raise taxes. 
   What happened? Party line vote after party line vote after party line votes, Democrats voted on every one of these amendments which put in the numbers the prevention of these tax increases.

   The gentlewoman from Oregon who just spoke, the tax increase in this budget would hit the average Oregon household with an annual tax increase of $2,751 which would affect 1,336,000 taxpayers in that State alone. 
   I would like to take a moment to compliment my colleagues on the other side on the veterans' portion of the budget. They do add more resources for veterans, to veterans' health care. They do meet the President's numbers on defense. This is a part of their budget that I would like to compliment them on. We, too, in our substitute, will add additional resources to veterans and veterans' health care. This is an area where I think they have made some improvements over the President's budget in their budget.

   I would simply say the gentleman from North Dakota represents a State that pays a lot of capital gains tax and farm income, death taxes. Under this bill, the average household of North Dakota will see a tax increase annually of $2,613, which had 244,000 taxpayers. In the State of Georgia, the gentleman just spoke, that State will see an average household tax increase per year of  $2,743, which will hit 3,132,000 taxpayers. 
   If this budget doesn't raise taxes, then why is it that the Democrats shot down every single amendment that was offered to prevent all of these tax increases? 
   If you really believe it doesn't raise taxes, then why would you prevent us from adjusting the numbers to make sure it didn't raise taxes? You can read any word you want. 
   You can read any word you want of these so-called reserve funds. At the end of each of these reserve funds, it says, well, we got to come up with offsets to pay for these priorities. We don't want to raise these taxes. We want to extend the child tax credit, but they are not paid for. Actions are louder than words. 
   More importantly, numbers are louder than words.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield myself 1 minute just to read some clarifying language, which is in the Democrats' budget. 
   At the end of these reserve funds, so called, for middle income taxpayers, it says we want to provide this tax relief, but only to the extent that such bills or joint resolutions in the form placed before the House in the Committee on Rules would not increase the deficit or decrease the surplus for fiscal years 2007 through 2012. 
   Then, in section 401, where they talk about these tax extensions as a statement of their policy preferences, they assume that the cost of such a policy is offset. What does that mean? That means they are not covering the tax cuts. That means if you want to extend these tax cuts, they would have to pay for them on top of raising these taxes. 
   What this budget resolution also does, if you simply merely want to extend this tax relief, that is past 2010, you would have to come up with more tax increases to do so. This prohibits the ability of Congress to simply extend this tax relief, thereby bringing these tax increases to a curve. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Barrett).

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I yield to myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   I want to go to the point that I mentioned a minute ago about who says what about what this budget does. Let me talk about the Congressional Budget Office. By law, that is what we use. 
   Here is what the Congressional Budget Office says: The year 2010, all of these tax cuts expire. I think we all agree with that. All of these tax cuts expire in 2010. But we are talking about marriage penalty, per child tax credit, death tax, capital gains dividends, income tax rates across the board, they all go up. 
   That is the red line. That red line shoots up because all of those taxes are increased. That is the line the Democrats are using to run their budget. That is the line the Democrats are using to finance their new spending. That's the line the Democrats are using to show that they get to a balanced budget. 
   The green line, the dotted line, that is the CBO line that says here is what revenues will be if you extend the tax cuts. That's the line we are using in our budget. We are balancing the budget by controlling spending. 
   So reserve fund, shmerve fund, that means nothing. What matters are the numbers. And the numbers, not by the Center For Budget and Policy Priorities, not by the Brookings Institution. The Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office shows us very clearly, black and white in the numbers, in the numbers in your budget resolution.

   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remaining time. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a very important debate. It is an important debate about our priorities as a country. It is an important debate about how we run the fiscal ship of state, but it is more important than that. It is an important debate about our future. 
   I related a story the other day in committee that I want to share again with my colleagues. 
   When I first ran for Congress in 1998, I was a 28-year-old young guy, single, no children. I remember at a Kiwanis Pancake Day, we have a lot of pancake days in Wisconsin. It is how we raise money for charities. I remember going up to a woman in line, not much older than me, and she had three little children. I asked her for her vote. I asked her to support me in my race for Congress. 
   She said something to me. She said, I do not think I am going to vote for you. I said, well, why not? She said, because I do not think you can relate to me. I said, well, why can I not relate to you? She said, because you do not have children and you do not know what it is like to have children; you do not know what it is like to think about their futures. I said, well, I was in a family. I know what it is like to be in a family. And you know, I did not understand what she was saying to me at the time. 
   You know what? Now that I have a 5-year-old daughter, a 3-year-old son and a 2-year-old son, I understand exactly what that woman was telling me. I understand exactly what it feels like to really, really, really care about the next generation. It is like your heart is walking around in someone else's body. I can only imagine what grandparents feel like. 
   So this debate is about numbers. It is about priorities, how much for the Pentagon and how much for veterans and how much for this program and that program. But it is also about what is that horizon we are looking for, what is that vision on the horizon and what are we doing for our kids and our grandkids? What legacy are we putting in place for our country? 
   The great, beautiful thing about America, the American Dream is that one generation leaves a better standard of living for the next generation. That was drilled into me by my parents, that they were working and thriving so that we would have a better life than they had. That is what our job in Congress is to do. 
   We have big challenges and our country has faced big ones before, the Great Depression, World War I, World War II, the Cold War. We have got three challenges right now hitting us simultaneously, the global war on terror, globalization, and this entitlement explosion, the retirement of the baby boomer generation which we are not prepared for. This budget is about all of those things, but let me talk about two of them. 
   Globalization: We have got new kinds of competitive pressures against us unlike that which we have ever seen before. No longer do the oceans separate us from competitive pressures. We have broadband and digital technology. We have competition from countries like China and India unlike any we have ever seen before, and it is something we have to respond to so that our kids and our grandkids can have that higher standard of living. 
   At the same time, we have got entitlement programs that are exploding before us. We have an enormous debt on our horizon that we have to address. 
   Now, you heard this talk about taxes, tax increases. This budget does unequivocally raise taxes. I will not belabor that point. 
   Let me show you three lines. The lower line here, the blue line, shows you what revenues would look like if we kept those tax cuts permanent. That is what our budget will propose to do. Do not raise taxes, keep the marriage penalty down, keep the kid credit where it is, keep income tax rates where they are, get rid of the death tax, do not raise taxes. That is the blue line.  
   The red line right here shows you what happens if we let the tax cuts expire as this budget proposes to do if you increase taxes. It shows you a $400 billion tax increase. 
   What really matters here is not the red and the blue line at the end of the day for our children and grandchildren, matters a lot, but at the end of the day what matters is the green line, the spending line. This is the line that is occurring right now under our watch. This is the spending trajectory of the Federal Government because of Republicans and Democrats, both of us. We are all in this thing together. This is the line that happens. 
   So if you do not address the spending, you are not addressing the real problem. That is why I really have a big problem with this budget. Not only does it have the largest tax increase in history, not only does it raise taxes about $400 billion, it does nothing to control spending. It does not reform our entitlement programs. If you want these entitlement programs to succeed, to exist, to continue, you have to reform them. 
   Let me show you one more chart. This is the Government Accountability Office. This shows you the trajectory we are on when you take a look at Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security, interest on the debt, when you take a look at all the discretionary spending. It shows you this: By the year 2040, that is when my kids will be exactly my age, by the year 2040, our Federal Government will be doubled in size. 
   Let me put it another way. If we want to have no new programs whatsoever, keep today's government in place, no fewer programs, no more programs, just today's Federal Government, the cost of that Federal Government when my kids are my age will be double what it costs today. 
   Let us put it another way. We have historically run our government, the Federal Government, by taxing about 18 percent of GDP to fund the Federal Government. Since about 1960, the Federal Government has had to tax the American people at about 18 percent of the economy and its output to fund the Federal Government. When my kids are my age, to fund today's Federal Government at that time it will require us to tax 40 percent of GDP. We will literally have to tax our kids at twice the rate we are taxing ourselves today if we do nothing to reform spending and reform these entitlements. 
   You cannot survive globalization if you are going to double the tax rates on every man, woman and child in America at that time. We cannot win when we are competing against the likes of China and India if we are going to crank taxes up like that. 
   So the real problem with this budget is not what it contains, the largest tax increase in American history. The even larger problem with this budget is that it contains no reforms. It contains no spending control. It includes immense new spending. 
   You have 12 of these reserve funds which are worth less than this piece of paper. They do not pay for anything, but the one thing they do say is we want to spend $115 billion in more money. We do not have the money for it, but if we can have the money for it, we would do it. The other reserve funds say we do not want these taxes to go up, but we are planning on having them go up. We would stop them going up if we had money to do it, but we really are not stopping these tax increases. 
   You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say you are going to balance the budget and not control spending without raising taxes. In order for your budget to balance, in order for the Democrat budget to balance, Mr. Chairman, they have to raise taxes, especially since they are not only not controlling spending, they are increasing spending. That is the way mathematics works. 
   But more important than all of this, Mr. Chairman, is the fact that we have to get our kids and our country ready to compete in the global economy. We are not prepared for that. We have got to do more to help them compete, and we do not do it by doubling their taxes.     
   We tax our country, our businesses and our capital more than any other country in the industrialized world except for Japan, and they just finished two decades of recession. We can't tax our way out of this problem. We will tax ourselves out of being the leading economic superpower. We will tax ourselves out of a good standard of living. 
   If we don't tackle this problem, we will have severed that American Dream, that American legacy, that legacy that says each generation should leave on to the next a better country, a better standard of living. That is what is really wrong with this budget. We can't keep spending or taxing our way out of these problems. If this budget achieves balance on paper, which I will clearly, freely admit that it does, it will only do so for a short period of time. 
   Because if you don't fix these entitlement programs, it will drive us that much deeper into debt, that much more in the deficit, just around the corner. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are the big three entitlements. They are very important programs. Health care for low income, health care for people in old age, retirement security. We all agree with that. We think that is the right thing. 
   But you have got to reform these programs if you are going to save these programs. You have got to reform these programs if people are truly going to be able to count on these benefits. Because if you don't reform these programs, you are driving the debt even higher. You are driving taxes up on our kids and grandkids even more. Not only will we not have programs to depend on for our livelihood when we reach the age of 65, not only will we not be prepared for the baby boomers, we will hit our kids with the biggest tax burden this country has ever seen. 
   We will lose our greatness, and we will not pass on this legacy of a better country and a higher standard of living to our children. I urge a ``no'' vote on this budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by complimenting the chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the committee, along with all the other members of the Foreign Affairs Committee for working in a bipartisan way to put together this compromise. 
   We heard a very good fulfilling debate about the merits of PEPFAR. I, too, agree that the PEPFAR program is a very worthwhile program. So we agree that this is the right thing to do. 
   The question is, should we more than double the authorization of this program? Now, the President's budget called for doing just that. And I think you can make a very good and compelling case that this program is so successful that it ought to be doubled. That's not what the underlying bill does. This underlying bill more than triples this program. 
   I have three concerns about this tripling of this program. Number 1, the spending levels set out in this authorization bill are higher than the recipient countries can even accept. They can't absorb all of this money. We know this from the studies in the field. So even if we hit these authorization levels, we know that the recipient countries cannot even accept all of this money. They can't spend it that fast. 
   Point Number 2, the Congressional Budget Office has told us that we couldn't even spend this money this fast. So why are we having this kind of an authorization level when our own Congressional Budget Office is telling us that it would take at least 10 years to spend down a $50 billion authorization? 
   And that brings me to my third point, and that is the budget resolution that passed the floor just 2 1/2 weeks ago. The Democratic budget resolution itself assumes the $30 billion level. The Democratic budget resolution assumes we're funding this at the President's request of $30 billion. In fact, the Democratic budget resolution has a lower level of funding for section 150, the Foreign Affairs program, than even the President's budget does. We don't know what cut they're talking about, but more to the point, why don't we defend the budget resolution that passed this very house 2 1/2 weeks ago? 
   Mr. Speaker, we support this program. I support this program. It's a good program. It has proven to work. By any metric, by any definition, it's impossible to deny the success of PEPFAR. 
   The question is, should we be tripling a program when we know full well it breaks the budget resolution, it purports to spend money faster than we can even spend, and those who are receiving this money can't receive it nearly as fast as we're proposing.     
   This recommit is not intended to kill this bill. This is a forthwith recommit. This recommit is very simple. It says, rather than funding it at $50 billion, let's fund it at $30 billion. That's the level called for on the Democratic budget resolution. That's the level called for in the President's budget. That's the level that independent experts have said can be justified. So this says go from 50 to 30 forthwith, that's all. 
   I want to compliment the gentleman, the chairman of the committee, the ranking member of the committee, all of those who worked in a bipartisan basis for this very worthwhile program, but this is a time when we have fiscal problems in America. We have a deficit. We have a looming debt. We need to show discipline in Congress. We should not be tripling funding for programs that we know the recipients themselves cannot receive at this pace and we know from our own independent budget experts that we simply can't spend at this pace. 
   Let's bring it back down to earth. Let's double it and keep it within reason. That is why we should pass this motion to recommit. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   As we look at this bill, which we received this morning, it still has the same policy, just a little different cosmetics. I don't think our constituents want us to vote for a bill that makes it easier for illegal immigrants to get tax-paid health care. This bill does that. 
   I don't think our constituents want us to vote for a bill where we spend our constituents's tax dollars to pay for insurance that people already have. This bill does that. 
   I don't think our constituents want us to vote to create a new middle-class entitlement. This does that. 
   This bill also is only one-half paid for. That's right, they only pay for half of this law, and they have an enormous budget gimmick that when you add it all together doubles the cost of this bill. 
   So if the goal here is ultimately to get universal health care so that everybody has insurance, which I think most of us all share, this is not the pathway to do it. 
   If you take a look at what it costs to fund 3.9 million people who are uninsured, that leaves us another 43 million people uninsured. At the spend rate, at the cost of that, if we want to fund everybody, it's another $400 billion. That would add $8 trillion to the debt we have for our kids and our grandkids. 
   By doing it this way, by creating an enormous new entitlement, you are making matters worse for the baby boomers. You are making this enormous cliff we have of entitlement spending that much deeper. 
   Madam Speaker, there is a better way to getting universal access to affordable health insurance. This is not the way. We believe in patient-centered health care, not government-centered health care. We don't think bureaucrats should be running health care, whether they are an insurance bureaucrat or a government bureaucrat. 
   We think patients and their doctors should be running and making health care decisions. Unfortunately, this bill does not do that. This bill puts the government squarely in the middle and says if you want health care, you got to get it from the government. That's not what we believe in. That's not what we should be doing. That's why we should be voting against this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We have heard all this talk about the vote that 203 Democrats took in H.R. 4680, motion to recommit; it is apples to oranges; it doesn't compare. Let me read the language so it is black and white and not a lie: 
   Noninterference by the Secretary. In administering the prescription medicine benefit program established under this part, the Secretary may not require a particular formulary, institute a price structure for benefits or in any way ration benefits, interfere in any way with the negotiations between benefit administrators and medicine manufacturers or wholesalers, or otherwise interfere with the competitive nature of providing a prescription medicine benefit using private benefit administrators except as is required to guarantee coverage of the defined benefit. 
   Mr. Becerra voted for it. Mr. Stark wrote it; 203 Democrats voted for it. Now it is the wrong thing to do. 
   Let's be really clear. This is a bumper sticker bill that doesn't work. The policy idea here that 92 percent of Americans want to see happen is that we do it just like the Veterans' Administration does. I wonder if those 92 percent Americans were told; at the VA you can't choose your doctor, you can't choose your pharmacy. Two thirds of the top named brand drugs that seniors use aren't even offered by the VA. You can't get them. Do you think 92 percent of Americans want that to happen for Medicare? Medicare beneficiaries ought to be able to choose their doctor; they should be able to go to their neighborhood pharmacy. 
   So why are we doing this? CBO, HHS, they all tell us this will do nothing to lower prices. This will do nothing to save the government money. 
   What has the current program done? It lowered the premium 40 percent in one year. It lowered the prices so much beyond our expectations that this new law which came into law in 2003 is $189 billion less than we expected it to be. That is real savings. 
   The next argument we hear is, well, we want the Secretary to use the negotiating power of Medicare, get the bulk of negotiations going. How many people would he conceivably be able to negotiate on behalf of? All the people in the PDP, 16.5 million. 
   Well, what are the prescription drug plans doing right now? You see, they don't just negotiate on behalf of Medicare; they negotiate on behalf of everybody they cover. Caremark, 70 million people they are negotiating on behalf of, including Medicare. Medco, 54 million people they are negotiating on behalf of, including Medicare. Express Scripts, 51 million. Wellpoint, 36 million. These plans have more negotiating power and leverage and strength than Medicare could possibly have. That is why they are getting better discounts. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.

We had a really rough winter in Wisconsin. We need to get back to work to fix those roads. It's also not a debate about whether the highway trust fund shortfall should be fixed. It should be fixed. It's about how we should pay for it, or if we pay for it. 
   I support fixing it in a responsible way, which I don't believe this bill does. Because of my concerns, I introduced legislation earlier this year that would have fixed this program, this deficit, in a fiscally responsible way. 
   In 1998, Congress passed a law called TEA-21 that gave the highway trust fund special protections in the budget process. This is what Bud Shuster, the chairman of the committee at the time, said about the bill: ``This is an historic piece of legislation, Mr. Speaker, because now the American people will know that the trust is being put back in the highway trust fund. When the average American drives up to the gas pump and pays his 18.3 cents Federal tax, that money is free to be spent. It is a guarantee. It is an ironclad guarantee. Should there be more revenue going into the trust fund, that money will be available to be spent. Should there be less revenue going into the trust fund, then we will have to reduce the expenditures. It is fair, it is equitable and it is keeping faith with the American people.'' 
   Madam Speaker, this bill moves from funding highways with gas taxes to relying on borrowed money. If the highway trust fund is going to get access to the general fund, as it is in this bill, then it should compete for these resources with all other discretionary programs.     
   It should be budgeted for, but that is not what is happening here. My fear is that this transfer will be just the start, that we will be back here for a fix in 2010 with a bigger shortfall because as CBO says, the highway trust fund has not just hit a temporary rough patch, it is permanent red ink going into the future. The current shortfall is between $1.4 billion and $3.3 billion, and then it gets bigger year after year, well over a $300 billion shortfall over the next 10 years. Undoubtedly, when we get updated numbers from CBO and OMB, the shortfall will get even bigger. 
   If highways are to continue to enjoy special budgetary status as trust-funded programs, then this general fund transfer should be offset or repaid. 
   I want to work with supporters of this bill to find a way that avoids an increase in the deficit that this bill would cause. If Congress decides not to offset this transfer, then Congress should revisit the budgetary treatment for highways and reform it such that highways compete for funding in the annual budget process just as all other government programs do. 
   I urge my colleagues to think about this. Let's come up with a funding mechanism that guarantees we fix this shortfall, and let's do it in a fiscally responsible way where we actually honor the integrity of the budget process.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we do have a crisis. Action does need to take place. This isn't the solution. This does not address the root cause of why we are in this problem. These companies, which are for-profit companies, have abused their trust of the American taxpayer, and we are not adjusting this. 
   If we're going to do this, then let's make darn sure we're not putting taxpayers at risk in the future. This makes it worse. This bill says you can continue to go on and make your profits and we'll still bail you out down the road. This bill says you can continue having these big multimillion-dollar bonuses for your executives and go make all of this money, and if you fail, we'll get you. 
   What this bill says, what Congress is saying today, is if you're big enough, if you're politically corrected enough, then we will privatize your profits and we will socialize your risk. The taxpayer will bail you out.  
   Mr. Speaker, as a representative of taxpayers, not shareholders, we should reform these institutions so we do have a liquid mortgage market, so we do securitize the secondary mortgage market, so people can get affordable homes. But let's do it so we don't have costly taxpayer bailouts. 
   This whole issue is about to put more than a trillion dollars of debt on to our books. And yet we're going to let them continue to leverage themselves and kick this can down the road. We should be more responsible with taxpayer dollars. We should address this crisis, reform these institutions, so that we're not down this path 5 years from now. 
   When I first came to Congress 10 years ago, I criticized these organizations. And everybody told me, you're wrong, they pose no risk. Well, here we are today. I just wonder where are we going to be in 4 years, in 5 years, with the passage of this bill? We're saying, let them continue doing what they're doing. We're going to give them explicit lines of credit from the Treasury. We're going to even buy their stock, and maybe hopefully, maybe just sort of, we'll have a regulator that will contain these institutions. 
   That is not responsible. We should reform these institutions now, either privatize them or publicize them, bring them into the government and make them government agencies, because, after all, the taxpayer is going to be left holding the books on this bailout. Mark my words. 
   We've got to fix this. This is irresponsible. This is not the right way to do it. What we ought to do is go back to the drawing board and make sure that this costly bailout isn't magnified down the road.
