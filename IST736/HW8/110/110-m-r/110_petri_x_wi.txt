<DOCNO>Mr. PETRI. (EXTENSION OF PROGRAMS UNDER THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 1965 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of S. 3352, to temporarily extend the programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965. I am pleased to announce that this is the very last extension of the Higher Education Act that Congress will have to pass during this reauthorization. It has been a long journey, but I fully expect that Chairman Miller, that senior Republicans MCKEON and KELLER and that the rest of my colleagues will be here on the floor later this week to pass a conference report. 
   Since 2003, we've passed over one dozen extensions of this law since it first expired. S. 3352 will ensure that vital Federal college access and student aid programs will continue to serve those students for the next 2 weeks who depend upon them while the final conference report makes its way to the President's desk. 
   I am excited that Congress is ready to pass the Senate proposals that will ensure that students and their families will have the ability to get higher education Pell Grants, to obtain Perkins loans and to gain additional transparency into the costs of college, especially as students are getting ready to head back to school in a few short weeks.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETRI. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Chairman, workers in this country should be able to go to work each day secure in the knowledge that all measures are being taken to ensure their safety. The tragedies at Sago, Aracoma, and Darby demonstrated that this was not the case in the mining industry. 
   That is why Republicans and Democrats came together during the last Congress in a bipartisan manner to enact the first significant mine safety reform legislation in generations. I believe that the requirements and studies in the MINER Act are making great strides in putting in place regulations and standards and in developing technology to protect mine workers. 
   Today, we are considering the Supplemental Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act (S-MINER). I believe that this legislation is flawed in many ways and could, in fact, undermine many of the needed reforms put in place by the MINER Act. 
   In my own State of Wisconsin, aggregate (stone, sand, and gravel) mining is a dominant industry. The safety hazards and appropriate safety procedures and equipment for this industry vary greatly from that of coal mining. In many instances, the condition of a stone, sand, or gravel operation is more similar to that of an earth-moving construction site than that of an underground coal mine. 
   However, the S-MINER Act takes a ``one size fits all'' approach and fails to take into account these differences. Many of the regulations and penalties mandated in the S-MINER Act will fail to improve safety in aggregate mines, while putting an undue financial burden on the industry. 
   It is important that Congress continues strict oversight of Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and related agencies as the MINER Act is fully implemented. As the recent Crandall Canyon disaster demonstrates, these reforms are vitally needed in the industry. However, today I am voting against the S-MINER Act because the bill is premature and overbroad.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETRI. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 
   Under current law, Federal Family Education Loan Program guaranty agencies are obligated to serve as lenders of last resort to borrowers who have been denied a Federal student loan by two lenders. The legislation we are considering today puts in place measures that will permit an entire higher education institution, rather than just individuals, to participate in the Lender of Last Resort program and also clarifies the Secretary of Education's authority to advance mandatory funds to guaranty agencies to serve as the lender of last resort. 
   The amendment I am offering today would simply require the Secretary of Education to review and revise as necessary the regulations concerning prohibited guaranty agency inducements to ensure that such agencies do not engage in improper inducements as lenders of last resort. 
   Currently, guaranty agencies are provided flexibility from the general lender prohibitions regarding inducements and exempted from others when they act as lenders of last resort. While this flexibility may be necessary, the bill before us would expand the role of guaranty agencies acting as lenders of last resort. And it's prudent to take another look at these regulations to be sure that students and taxpayers continue to be protected. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETRI. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6889, which would extend the authority of the Secretary of Education to purchase Federal guaranteed loans previously made under the Federal Family Education Loan, FFEL, Program and advance funds for lender-of-last resort loans. I believe this bill is premature and is merely a response to alarms raised by an industry that has continually benefited from government subsidies. 
   Earlier this year, the lending community expressed serious concerns that unstable credit markets would affect their ability to provide Federal student loans for the upcoming school year. In response, Congress approved the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008, which put in place several provisions to ensure that students and families had continued, uninterrupted access to Federal loans, regardless of what is happening in the credit markets. That measure gave the Secretary of Education the temporary authority to buy back loans from lenders participating in the FFEL program. 
   However, now almost four months after the emergency provisions were signed into law and one month into the fall semester, it has become clear that despite the credit crunch students are having little trouble securing Federal student loans. The New England Board of Higher Education and the New England Council recently released a survey of its region's financial aid officers that revealed ``students and parents experienced little or no problems accessing Federal student loans for this fall.'' Schools in my own State of Wisconsin have told me that students are encountering few difficulties in securing Federal student loans, and in fact, any disruption has simply resulted in some students to switching lenders. Recently, the State of Massachusetts called off a plan to provide public financing to a State nonprofit lender because only a small percentage of students were still looking for a lender. Over 2,000 lenders continue to participate in the FFEL program. 
   Furthermore, this year hundreds of schools, including Penn State, Michigan State and Indiana, decided it was in the best interests of their students to leave the Federal Family Education Loan Program, FFEL, and enroll in the Direct Loan Program because it is immune to the effects of the credit crunch and provides the exact same Federal loans to their students. In fact, the Direct Loan Program has seen a 47 percent increase over last year in the amount of loans originated. Schools are reporting they are happy with the transition to the program, and the Education Department has continually asserted that the Direct Loan Program is capable of handling the increased capacity. 
   Therefore, I find it alarming that just four months after passing the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008, and with widespread agreement that there currently is no student loan crisis, we have decided to extend until 2010 these authorities that provide government liquidity and financing to private lenders. While it is impossible to say these authorities did not help avoid a crisis, it's equally impossible to say private sector funds will not be available next year for student loans. I find it curious that today's action coincides with reports from the lending community that, despite the fact that there is no real crisis this year, one may exist in the 2009-10 school year. 
   While there is no doubt that the financial markets remain unsettled, the current authority for these powers runs through July 31, 2009. Washington is once again eager to extend temporary authorities. Instead of rushing to react to the ``alarms'' sounded by the lending community, I believe it would be more prudent for Congress to continue to monitor the situation in the student loan markets to determine if more action is really necessary before we extend another handout to an industry that has continually proven to work in the interests of their own pocketbooks and not for students and taxpayers.

   I rise in support of this measure, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  
   H.R. 3986, the John F. Kennedy Center Reauthorization Act of 2007, is a bipartisan bill authorizing appropriations for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for 3 years. Additionally, the bill authorizes a photovoltaic system for the main roof of the Kennedy Center. 
   The Kennedy Center serves an important role in our Nation. Not only is it one of the busiest theaters in the world, hosting millions of patrons each year to its seven stages, but it is first and foremost a presidential memorial for President John F. Kennedy. 
   Since its founding, the Kennedy Center has become one of the world's premier entertainment venue, featuring award-winning performances. 
   The funds we are authorizing today will go towards the upkeep and maintenance of the facility. These repairs are in line with the comprehensive building plan maintained by the Kennedy Center and created at the direction of Congress in 1994. 
   By supporting the regular maintenance and upkeep of the Kennedy Center, we can ensure that the center will continue to be a world-class venue well into the future. 
   I would also like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Norton, for working with us on this legislation. It was important for the Kennedy Center to report back to Congress before construction begins on the photovoltaic project to ensure adequate congressional oversight of the project. 
   I believe it is important the photovoltaic project be cost effective and appropriate for a presidential memorial. Thank you again for working with us.

   H.R. 3985 will level the playing field for all bus and motor carrier companies operating in interstate commerce in this area. The bill deserves support. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this important bipartisan bill offered by my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 
   The Over-the-Road Bus Transportation Accessibility Act of 2007 is an important bill for all people who rely on transportation by bus and motorcoaches. 
   H.R. 3985 requires that all buses and motorcoaches comply fully with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ``ADA.'' If not, the U.S. DOT will revoke the company's authority to operate on our interstates and highways. 
   H.R. 3985 will also require U.S. DOT and the Department of Justice to work together when an ADA violation is discovered. This will ensure that bus and motorcoach companies that violate the ADA will be held accountable for their actions. 
   It is important to note that this bill is not creating any additional ADA requirements. H.R. 3985 does not change what is currently mandated in the ADA. Bus and motorcoach companies will not have to change their business plans, unless they are not obeying the law. 
   This bill simply ensures that all carriers comply with the ADA, which is what they are supposed to do anyway. If a bus is not in compliance, it will not be on our roads. 
   H.R. 3985 will level the playing field for all bus and motorcoach companies operating in interstate commerce. Companies who have ignored the ADA will not have a competitive advantage over the good actors who have spent substantial amounts on lifts and other equipment to make their buses accessible.  
   I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETRI. (FAIR TREATMENT FOR EXPERIENCED PILOTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this needed legislation.  
   Since 1959, the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, has required commercial airline pilots to retire at age 60. 
   This mandatory retirement rule was initially put in place for safety reasons, although some have argued that the FAA had little scientifically backed data in 1959 to support the safety mandate. 
   In any event, the ``Age 60 Rule,'' as it is known, soon became accepted practice. 
   For many years the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, also required commercial airline pilots to retire at age 60. However, in November 2006, a new ICAO standard went into effect, allowing a pilot to fly up to age 65, as long as the co-pilot is under age 60. 
   This change in ICAO standard resulted in an immediate double standard. 
   Regardless of FAA's policy, as of November 23, 2006, foreign pilots flying into the U.S. are allowed to fly up to age 65, provided the co-pilot is age 60 or younger. Yet, U.S. pilots must retire as soon as they reach 60 years of age. 
   Clearly, we now have a fairness issue that must be addressed. 
   This new double standard has caused a groundswell of U.S. pilots close to retirement to push for a similar change to FAA standards. 
   In response to the change in the ICAO standard, the FAA announced that it would initiate an ``Age 60'' review and rulemaking process. The FAA no longer assumes that once a pilot reaches age 60 they are automatically unsafe. 
   All the groups involved have done excellent work to save not only their careers and the careers of their colleagues, but to keep the skies as safe as possible. 
   The FAA has forecasted that by 2015 the U.S. will have 1 billion passengers flying annually. We also are facing a pilot shortage in the near future. 
   Clearly, we must do everything we can to ensure that our most experienced pilots are able to continue to fly as long as safety is not compromised. 
   This legislation provides for additional medical and training requirements for pilots ages 60 through 65 to address any possible safety concerns. It is a well-thought-out bill, which evens the playing field while ensuring aviation safety. 
   I would like to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Mica, and the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, Mr. Costello, for all their hard work on this long sought after legislation. 
   This is a good, bipartisan bill, and I encourage members to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4343.  
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This resolution honors the heroic achievements of Captain Barrington Antonio Irving, the youngest pilot and first person of African American descent to fly solo around the world. 
   Captain Barrington Irving was born in Jamaica, as was pointed out, in 1983 and raised in Miami, Florida. His lifelong dream was to become a pilot, and this exceptional young man overcame great obstacles to make his dream a reality. 
   On March 23, 2007, after nearly 4 years of acquiring sufficient funds for his journey, Irving embarked from Miami, Florida, on a 24,600-mile flight around the world in an airplane rightly named Inspiration. At the age of 23, Irving became the youngest person, as well as the first African American pilot, to fly around the world when he returned to Miami on June 27, 2007. 
   During his 3-month journey, Irving visited with young people in 27 cities around the world encouraging them to enter aviation and stressing the importance of academics. 
   Captain Barrington Irving is an inspiration and an example that, through perseverance and dedication, anyone can overcome even the greatest obstacles and can achieve their goals. 
   I am proud to support this legislation. I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring this exceptional young man and commemorating his historic achievement.

   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Chairman, I join with my colleagues on the committee who have studied this matter in opposing the amendment before us. 
   Just this morning the Aviation Subcommittee conducted a hearing on our aging air traffic control facilities, some of which are in very, very bad condition, and this amendment would move us in the wrong direction rather than the right direction. The impact of the amendment would be, according to the FAA, that it would lose some $110 million in funds that have been programmed to modernize the facilities that it needs to maintain to keep our system moving. And this will expire if the amendment is adopted. 
   The average age of FAA towers is some 27 years and in route centers are 43 years. They need to spend some $30 billion over the next few years to modernize the facilities and maintain them. 
   And I realize that it's a well-meaning amendment, but it would set us back and delay the efficiency and mobility of our population, and could even result in some increase in risk in the system. 
   For those reasons, I would urge rejection of the amendment.

   First of all, let me say that there is no one in this body who pays more attention and is more hardworking in defending the interests of his constituents than Mr. Frelinghuysen, the author of this amendment. But the fact of  the matter is that it's not in the national interest to stop this study in its track. They're not doing it just because they want to. They're doing it because the Nation has grown. The system is at capacity. It needs to be redesigned to accommodate the movement of people by air through this New York region. If we don't do it, they will have to go by train, and that's almost at capacity. And the roads are congested. It will slow down our economy. It will impact and affect the growth of the whole region if this can't go forward.

   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I join in support of the resolution before us. It is appropriate and important that we honor the hardworking men and women who make our infrastructure the envy of the world. Investment in the Nation's highway, bridge and transit infrastructure has not kept up with growing demands on the system. Our Department of Transportation found that to maintain highway bridge and transit networks, governments at all levels would need to invest nearly $95 billion per year for each of the next 20 years, and to improve highway, bridge and transit networks, that level of investment would need to increase to nearly $154 billion per year. 
   Recently, the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission, a bipartisan commission made up of representatives from various transportation sectors appointed by leadership in both parties and from the executive branch, reported to the Congress that the United States needs to invest up to $340 billion annually for the next 50 years to upgrade the Nation's existing transportation network to a good state of repair and to build the more advanced facilities that our people will require to remain competitive with other emerging economic powers around the world. 
   We have neglected this work for a generation, and it will come back to haunt our children and our grandchildren, unless we begin the necessary investment and the necessary work, not just to provide the jobs, which is obviously important, but to provide the efficient undergirding of our economy, which will enable us to maintain our standard of living, improve it, and maintain our competitiveness as an international power. 
   Our committee, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has jurisdiction over our water transportation system, and that consists of 926 coastal and inland harbors maintained by the Corps of Engineers and some 25,000 miles of inland and coastal commercial waterways. If we don't keep our harbors and waterways operating efficiently, we obviously threaten our economic prosperity. To meet these needs, as well as the need for flood protection and environmental restoration, passing a Water Resources Development Act for 2008 is high on our committee's agenda. 
   According to separate studies conducted by the Congressional Budget Office, EPA and municipal groups, the current rate of capital investment will not keep our waterway treatment systems operational. State and local governments are spending nearly $10 billion a year in capital investments and waste water infrastructure, and most of this funding comes from local ratepayers.     
   However, to meet the needs of communities all over our country, we should be doubling that spending. We can't continue to take our modern wastewater treatment facilities for granted. Not only are they critical to protect our health and environment, they are important to protect our economy as well. 
   Public infrastructure plays an important role in enhancing our quality of life, improving our environment, and contributing to our economic prosperity. These systems, and the professionals, engineers, and administrators who maintain them, are sometimes taken for granted. So it is important that Congress recognize the contribution they make to ensure that America remains the world's premier economic power, and passage of this resolution will do that. I urge all Members to support House Resolution 1137.

   The resolution before us, House Concurrent Resolution 309, as has been pointed out, authorizes the use of the Capitol grounds for the District of Columbia's Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run to be held June 6, 2008. Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Department will serve as cosponsors of this year's event. 
   Special Olympics is an international organization dedicated to enriching the lives of children and adults with disabilities through athletics and through competition. The torch run is a special event that works with Federal and local police departments to run the Flame of Hope to Fort McNair, the site of the local Special Olympics games. 
   The torch will be lit in a ceremony recognizing supporters of the Special Olympics on the west steps of the United States Capitol. Nearly 1,200 police officers, Special Olympics athletes, and members of the public will be present for the ceremony torch lighting and the start of the run. Once lit, the torch will be carried by police officers to Fort McNair. 
   More than 26 police departments will join together to support the Special Olympics by raising money, carrying the torch, or running in support of the Special Olympics. Support of Congress has helped this special event hold an opening ceremony on the Capitol grounds that works with both Federal and local police departments to support the Special Olympics.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 339, which was introduced by our colleague, Representative Michael Burgess from Texas. The resolution expresses support for the goals of Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month. 
   Each May during Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month, State agencies and motorcycle organizations across our country conduct a variety of activities to remind all riders and motorcyclists to share the road. These activities also encourage riders to wear protective gear, never drink and ride, be properly licensed, and receive proper training. All of these important messages help motorcyclists and other motorists get ready for the busy riding season ahead. 
   In approximately two-thirds of fatal car versus motorcycle crashes, the driver of the car has been found to be at fault. Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month will help drivers of cars, trucks, and motorcycles remember that they must consider other users of the road as they use their own vehicles. 
   Additionally, this resolution recognizes the transportation benefits associated with motorcycling. Specifically, motorcycles are fuel efficient and decrease congestion while having little impact on our Nation's transportation infrastructure. I support this resolution, and I hope it brings attention to motorcycle safety across our Nation's highways as well as the benefits associated with motorcycling.

   The bill before us amends the International Center Act to allow the State Department to lease a Federal property in northwest Washington to nongovernmental entities. Currently, the International Center Act only permits the State Department, as has been said, to lease the property to foreign governments or international organizations. 
   The site is occupied by the international satellite service provider Intelsat, which was privatized by an act of Congress in the year 2000. Prior to its privatization, Intelsat was created as an international organization in the 1960s to establish the world's first global satellite system. 
   As an international organization, Intelsat leased the property for 99 years from the State Department in accordance with the International Center Act. The bill before us corrects an apparent oversight when Intelsat was privatized by this Congress. 
   The underlying statute requires a foreign government or international organization to occupy the property, and that was no longer consistent with the lease between the government and Intelsat after Intelsat was privatized. This bill would make the International Center Act consistent with the lease.

   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us, House Resolution 832, recognizes the Texas Water Development Board on its selection as the 2007 recipient of the Environmental Protection Agency's Performance and Innovation in the State Revolving Fund Creating Environmental Success Award. This award is given to one State in each of the 10 different EPA regions and highlights successfully designed projects that further the goal of clean water. 
   The Texas Water Development Board was created in 1957 to provide leadership, planning, financial assistance, information and education for the conservation and responsible development of water for Texas. Its mission is a vital part of Texas' overall vision, mission, and goals related to maintaining the State's natural resources, health, and its economic development. 
   To accomplish its goals for the State's water resources and for providing the portable water and wastewater services, the Texas Water Development Board provides water planning, data collection and dissemination, financial assistance, and technical assistance services to the citizens of the State of Texas. 
   The tremendous population growth that the State has had and will continue to experience and the continual threat of severe drought only intensify the need for the Texas Water Development Board to accomplish its goals in an effective and efficient manner. 
   The Clean Water Act State Revolving Loan Fund in Texas has awarded communities more than $4 billion in low-interest loans to finance 472 water infrastructure projects across the State of Texas. These projects serve approximately one-half of the population of that State, treat about 2 billion gallons per day of wastewater, and provide direct environmental and public health benefits to Texans at large. 
   In Texas, the Northwest Water Reuse Initiative consists of a $10.7 million project in El Paso County to deliver treated wastewater for reuse to agricultural, commercial, industrial and residential users from El Paso's Northwest Water Treatment Plant. 
   Texas also financed a wastewater reclamation initiative to deliver reclaimed water from the city of Austin's Walnut Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, the first step in the city's development of a transmission and distribution service, serving customers with reclaimed water.

   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 832 recognizes the Texas Water Development Board on its selection as a 2007 recipient of the Environmental Protection Agency's Performance and Innovation in the State Revolving Fund Creating Environmental Success Award. (PISCES) 
   This award is given to one State in each of the ten different EPA regions and highlights successfully designed projects that further the goal of clean water. 
   The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) was created in 1957 to provide leadership, planning, financial assistance, information, and education for the conservation and responsible development of water for Texas. Its mission is a vital part of Texas' overall vision, mission, and goals related to maintaining the State's natural resources, health and economic development. 
   To accomplish its goals for the State's water resources and for providing affordable water and wastewater services, the Texas Water Development Board provides water planning, data collection and dissemination, financial assistance and technical assistance services to the citizens of Texas. 
   The tremendous population growth that the State of Texas has and will continue to experience, and the continual threat of severe drought, only intensify the need for the Texas Water Development Board to accomplish its goals in an effective and efficient manner. 
   The Clean Water Act State Revolving Loan Fund in Texas has awarded communities more than $4 billion in low-interest loans to finance 472 water infrastructure projects across the State of Texas. 
   These projects serve approximately one-half of the population of Texas, treat about 2 billion gallons per day of wastewater, and provide direct environmental and public health benefits to Texans at large. 
   In Texas, the Northwest Water Reuse Initiative consisted of a $10.7 million project in El Paso County to deliver treated wastewater for reuse to agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential users from El Paso's Northwest Wastewater Treatment Plant. 
   Texas also financed a wastewater reclamation initiative to deliver reclaimed water from the City of Austin's Walnut Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, the first step in the city's development of a transmission and distribution system serving customers with reclaimed water. 
   This resolution recognizes the importance of Federal-State partnerships in addressing water resources needs in the United States and specifically the effective and efficient manner in which the State of Texas is managing its State Revolving Loan Fund Program.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETRI. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, and I'd like to share an alternative Republican viewpoint on the bill before us this afternoon. Traditionally, Republicans have stood for budgetary responsibility and competition to ensure a good return on taxpayer investment in Federal programs. I believe that this bill, while not perfect, is something that any Republican who stands for these principles should support. 
   For many years, I have spoken out against the excess subsidies that taxpayers pay to lenders in the guaranteed loan program. Government and private economists, including those in the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability Office and the Treasury Department, have all confirmed the significant inefficiencies in the program due to the arbitrary and capricious nature in which lender subsidies have been set over the last 40 years. 
   In fact, these scorekeepers have found that taxpayers spend $3 to $5 billion each year on unnecessary subsidies that could be better applied as direct aid to students. The status quo on lender subsidies is inefficient, wasteful and unacceptable, and I applaud the effort made in this bill to redirect these resources primarily as Pell Grants and interest rate reductions. 
   This bill also contains two other critically important provisions that  largely have been overlooked in this debate. First, it includes an amendment that I offered and which was unanimously adopted in committee to study and implement a pilot program using market-based reforms, such as auctions, to bring down the cost to taxpayers in the guaranteed loan program. The reason we find ourselves needing to redirect these subsidies in the first place is due to the fact that Congress set subsidy rates blindly and irresponsibly, not based on any market considerations. 
   As a free-market Republican, I believe Congress has no business setting lender returns. Other mechanisms, such as auctions, will actually capture market demands to obtain the optimal rate for taxpayers and for lenders. Given the tremendous waste, fraud and unethical relationships that have been uncovered in this program over the last 6 months, it's clear that the guaranteed loan program is fundamentally and structurally flawed. This study and pilot are key to comprehensively reforming this program to ensure it serves students and taxpayers. And I'd like to thank the chairman and the committee for their strong support for this important effort. 
   Further, this bill applies a small portion of the savings towards improving income-contingent student loan repayment. Earlier this year, I introduced the IDEA Act, H.R. 2465, to make key changes to our current, limited income-contingent loan repayment program. The bill would make this repayment model accessible to all borrowers and better address the growing debt burdens which our students are graduating with. Some of my colleagues may be surprised to learn that this repayment model was actually developed by free-market economist Milton Friedman as the optimal way for all students, no matter their income, to repay their student loans. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act includes several provisions included in my legislation to improve this program, such as a 15 percent cap on adjusted income payments and moving the floor from 100 to 150 percent of the poverty level. These are positive first steps towards implementing a viable income-contingent repayment program, and I hope my colleagues will consider cosponsoring the IDEA Act to develop a loan repayment system for the 21st century. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding me this time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, in September 2007, the House considered and passed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007, H.R. 2881, which reauthorizes the FAA for the next 4 years. 
   Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not come to any agreement on its bill and so we are here today considering a fifth extension. H.R. 6984 would extend the taxes, programs, and funding of the Federal Aviation Administration through March of 2009. 
   This bill extends FAA funding and contract authority for 6 months, funds the airport improvement program at $1.95 billion through March of next year, extends the war risk insurance program, extends the small community air service development program, and extends application of the rule for measuring highway miles to determine eligibility for essential air service subsidies. 
   The bill will ensure that our national aviation system continues to operate until a full FAA reauthorization can be enacted by the next Congress. As I have indicated many times since the passage of the House FAA reauthorization bill just over a year ago, we need to pass a long-term bill so we can meet the growing demands placed on our Nation's infrastructure. Modernizing our antiquated air traffic control system and repairing our crumbling infrastructure needs to be one of our top priorities when Congress reconvenes in 2009. In that connection, I would observe recent statistics which indicate that our friends in China are spending some 9 percent of their GNP on infrastructure. We here in the United States are spending about 2.5 percent, most of that on maintenance, and we are falling behind even in that regard. In 20 years, who is going to be better prepared to conduct a modern economy, somebody who is spending 9 percent of their GNP building first-class infrastructure, or someone who is barely maintaining what they already have? 
   We need to step up to bat. This bill will do us good in the aviation sector, but we have a big job ahead of us in infrastructure generally as a Nation. 
   Clearly, there is much work to be done. This 6-month extension gives us time to revisit the FAA reauthorization bill early in the 111th Congress. I urge our colleagues in the other body to take up a comprehensive FAA reauthorization package as early as possible in the next year. 
   I support this extension as the best alternative to keep the FAA and the national airspace system running safely until the 111th Congress can take up and pass a bipartisan, bicameral bill that the President can sign. We should all commit to quickly passing a 4-year bill as quickly as possible next year.

   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Chairman, I want to take this opportunity to highlight and express my support for a provision included in H.R. 3221 that would establish a solar demonstration project. 
   U.S. industry has begun to commercialize a number of devices such as solar light tubes, which use solar concentrators, reflectors and lenses, light fibers, and other technologies to direct natural light into buildings, tunnels and other enclosures to augment or replace light from traditional fixtures. 
   Sec. 4306 of this bill would establish a research and development program to provide  assistance in the demonstration and commercial application of direct solar renewable energy sources to provide alternatives to traditional power generation for lighting and illumination, including light pipe technology, and to promote greater energy conservation and improved efficiency. 
   This type of technology presents an economically feasible and affordable solution for the private and public sector to reduce its reliance on the electrical grid. This in turn will have positive effects on both the environment and our overall demand on traditional power sources. 
   I have visited a company in my district which is engaged in very innovative and cost efficient light technology, and there are many other such efforts around the country that are developing exciting new products. As we look to diversify our energy sources, we need to enact policies that make it easier to harness the power of the market and spur the entrepreneurial and innovative sector of this country. 
   If we get this right, the United States will gain an even greater competitive advantage around the world while becoming less reliant on other countries--all in an environmentally responsible manner. 
   When we go to conference, I urge that this important demonstration project be included in the final conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETRI. (EXTENSION OF ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE SUBSIDIES -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, in September the House considered and passed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007, and that legislation reauthorizes the FAA for the next 4 years. The following week, the House also passed a 3-month extension of the FAA programs. Unfortunately, the other body has taken no action on that extension bill, H.R. 3540; and, therefore, the authority for the FAA's essential programs and taxes were extended through November 16 as part of a continuing resolution. Regrettably, those FAA programs and authorities are not extended in the continuing resolution expired on September 30. 
   As it is unlikely that Congress will be able to send an FAA reauthorization bill to the President for consideration before this November 16, we have before us today S. 2265, as amended. The bill would extend eligibility for Essential Air Service subsidies, and in addition, as amended, would extend the funding and expenditure authority of the FAA through December 31, 2007. 
   The bill provides AIP contract authority at the budget year 2007 level through the end of this year; authorizes such sums as are necessary for the FAA facilities and equipment, research and development, and operations through December 31; and extends the authority to limit the third-party liability of air carriers arising out of acts of terrorism through December 31. 
   I regret that S. 2265 does not include a provision that would change the mandatory retirement age for pilots to age 65. However, this bill will ensure that our national aviation system continues to operate until a full reauthorization can be enacted. 
   There's much work yet to be done on the FAA reauthorization bill. We must work in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion to craft legislation that the President can sign. 
   I support this extension in order to allow us time to accomplish this important goal. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I am a strong supporter of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) that provides needed health care coverage to millions of children across this nation. It is vital to our nation's children and is in need of expansion in order to cover all eligible uninsured children. 
   In fact, this February I joined many of my colleagues in sending a letter to the Budget Committee requesting that the fiscal year 2008 budget include sufficient funding to maintain existing SCHIP caseloads, as well as make reauthorization of the program a high priority. 
   Unfortunately, I believe that H.R. 3162 takes the wrong approach and goes beyond what is necessary to cover uninsured children in America. Furthermore, the legislation puts seniors in my district at risk by making cuts to the Medicare Program. By trying to do too much in this bill, we have shifted our focus from helping our nation's children and now have a bill that has become mired in controversy. 
   I believe the Senate's stand-alone reauthorization legislation is a more reasonable approach. It focuses solely on strengthening SCHIP by implementing measures to expand the enrollment of low-income children as well as to improve the quality of health care that children in the program receive. 
   House passage today is not the final step in the legislative process, of course. While I cannot support the bill before us today, I hope that when a conference report is brought before us, it will be a reasonable compromise that provides needed expansion of SCHIP without the troublesome provisions of this bill. We need to reauthorize and strengthen this important and necessary program.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETRI. (FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. I thank my colleague from Florida. 
   All of us who are frequent travelers as we go back and forth to our districts know the strain that is on our air traffic system. We all hear from outraged constituents who have had enough of delays and of cancellations. The American Society of Civil Engineers periodically issues an infrastructure report  card. In 2005, aviation received only a D-plus. We're in a bad situation and it is only going to get worse. 
   Traffic is predicted to grow over 4 percent per year until we reach 1 billion passengers by 2015. Air cargo is growing at a rate of more than 5 percent per year. We have a general aviation community that is unique and more active than any other country in the world. 
   The bill before us increases Federal investment in aviation infrastructure with funding for the Airport Improvement Program which provides grants from the aviation trust fund for airport improvements, increased to a total of $15.8 billion over 4 years. The Facilities and Equipment program is increased to $13 billion. We also increase the cap on the level of passenger facility charges that an airport can impose for capacity and safety projects. This cap was last raised 7 years ago and the $4.50 then is now only worth $2.86 due to the incredibly high construction cost inflation. 
   One of the most important initiatives under way at the FAA is the modernization of our air traffic control system, known as NextGen. We must move away from an antique 50-year-old ground-based technology to a modern satellite-based system in order to increase capacity, lower costs and increase safety. The bill seeks to move this process along while instilling accountability. Congress will need to provide effective oversight to be sure the program stays on track and that we have the financial resources for this $15 to $20 billion multi-year program to keep it moving forward. 
   Madam Chairman, there are a variety of other provisions too numerous to enumerate which improve on safety, provide for noise mitigation and enhance other environmental initiatives. The mandatory retirement age for pilots would be increased from age 60 to 65. Passenger rights would be enhanced by ensuring that airlines plan for the care of passengers who are held hostage on tarmacs and will seek to avoid such occurrences by establishing a process to avoid clear overscheduling that inevitably leads to delay. 
   However, I am placed in the rather odd position of voting ``no'' on final passage for my subcommittee's bill. Though the base bill was put together on a bipartisan basis, two amendments were adopted by the committee which cause me grave concern for the long-term prospects of this bill. We have it on good authority that the bill will be vetoed if section 601 regarding contract impasse procedures is not revised. The current provision provides for changes in future impasse procedures, which I don't object to; but then it also reopens the currently imposed contract and includes back pay under terms of the 1998 contract. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the cost of this provision in 2008 is $179 million, and $477 million over the life of the bill. The FAA estimates a total cost as high as $1.9 billion over 5 years and $7.5 billion over 10 years. 
   Second, an amendment was adopted that would move express carriers from being covered by the Railway Labor Act to the National Labor Relations Act. This provision is really targeted at one company, FedEx. FedEx Express was organized as and still is an air carrier, in particular an express carrier. As such, it has been covered by the Railway Labor Act since its creation in 1971. Yes, it has trucks, but it is a fully integrated system which was reaffirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Some draw comparisons to UPS, another great and innovative company for which we all have the greatest respect and, yes, even affection. But UPS organized a hundred years ago as a truck company and as such is rightly covered by the National Labor Relations Act. I would note that other companies within the FedEx family such as FedEx Freight are also covered by the NLRA. These are two different companies with two different corporate structures, and I regret that this change is included in the bill before us. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairman Costello, and Ranking Member Mica for working together as best we could, sometimes working through basic philosophical differences. I thank the staff for the many hours they have put into helping to produce this bill. Finally, I appreciate the cooperation of the Science Committee for its contribution of the research provisions and the Ways and Means Committee for extending the aviation taxes that fund much of this program.  
   Madam Chairman, today we are considering H.R. 2881, which will reauthorize our aviation programs for the next 4 years. 
   Most of us here are experienced air travelers, as we fly back and forth to our districts each week. We all know the capacity crunch our air system is experiencing--both on the ground and in the air. All of us are dealing with outraged constituents who are tired of delays, cancelled flights, or being held hostage for hours at a time while a plane sits on the tarmac. 
   We need to invest and make improvements to our air transportation system: 
   Air passenger demand is predicted to grow 4.3 percent each year through 2015--resulting in 1 billion passengers annually by 2015. 
   The number of aircraft to be handled by air traffic control is expected to grow from 45.1 million in 2004 to 48.5 million in 2015. 
   Air cargo is growing at a rate of more than 5 percent a year. 
   According to the FAA and other experts, $9 billion to $15 billion in capital investment is needed per year. 
   Aviation is critical to our economic vitality. The commercial aviation industry is responsible for 8 percent of our GDP. It creates and sustains more than 10 million jobs. 
   For a sector that is so critical to our future, you would think a safe and efficient air transportation system would be one of our top national priorities. And yet, the American Society of Civil Engineers' 2005 infrastructure report card gives aviation a grade of only a D+. 
   The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007 will take important steps to address these problems. 
   It increases investment in aviation infrastructure, authorizing $15.8 billion over 4 years for the Airport Improvement Program (AlP) which provides grants to airports for needed airport expansion and development. The Facilities and Equipment program provides needed air navigation systems and funding is increased in this bill to $13 billion over 4 years. 
   While we need to expand capacity on the ground, we also need to do so in the air. The air traffic control modernization program, known as NextGen, will move us from a ground-based radar system to a satellite-based system. Rather than verbally direct every movement of every plane, air traffic controllers will manage traffic and become involved with specific aircraft only as needed. We will be able to handle the increasing air traffic that we know is coming without a huge increase in controllers. 
   H.R. 2881 also addresses the issue of passenger rights, as has been demanded by angry passengers who feel they have been abused. The issue of delays, flight schedules and flight diversions is a complicated one. The bill includes a variety of consumer provisions, including requiring airlines to have contingency plans on how they will respond when planes are excessively delayed, including ensuring that trapped passengers are properly cared for. The FAA must approve the plans and can impose civil penalties. The FAA administrator also is directed to work with airlines when there is clear evidence that the number of flights scheduled exceeds the maximum capacity of the airport--a situation that almost guarantees excessive delays. 
   In addition, H.R. 2881 will improve safety and enhance environmental protection. The number of aviation safety inspectors will be increased, funds for runway incursion reduction programs are increased and other safety programs are strengthened. 
   We are addressing environmental issues by requiring the phase-out in 5 years of noisy Stage II jet aircraft so those who live around airports can enjoy at least a little more peace and less noise overhead. 
   In an effort to increase fuel efficiency and decrease emissions, several innovative programs and pilots are established. For example, the Aircraft Departure Queue Management Pilot Program authorizes 5 airports to employ new traffic flow management technologies to better manage the movement of aircraft on the ground. The goal is to reduce ground holds and idling times--leading to reduced emissions and increased fuel savings. 
   The CLEEN Partnership is a 10-year cooperative agreement for the development and certification of lower energy, emissions and noise, engine and airframe technology. 
   One of the more popular provisions would raise the age at which commercial pilots must retire from the current age 60 to age 65. This will put the United States in line with international standards. In this day and age, age 60 retirement is really an anachronism, and we need to update and modernize this requirement. 
   While I support the vast majority of the provisions in this bill, and we did work together on a bipartisan basis to develop the base bill, I find myself in the odd position of having to vote ``no'' on final passage of our reauthorization bill. This is primarily because of two provisions. 
   First, section 601 of H.R. 2881 amends contract impasse procedures and also effectively  overturns a contract implemented last year. I agree that the current contract impasse procedures that were instituted in the 1996 personnel reforms needs to be revised. I will not oppose revising the impasse procedure. In fact, a binding arbitration resolution solution may be the right solution. 
   The problem is that the provision also reopens the currently imposed contract and includes back pay from 2005 until negotiations are completed. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the cost of this provision in fiscal year 2008 is $179 million and $477 million over the life of the bill. FAA estimates a total cost as high as $1.9 billion over 5 years and $7.5 billion over 10 years. 
   If we want a reauthorization enacted--and I do--this provision jeopardizes that goal. It has been made pretty clear to us that 
   including the retroactive provisions will invite a presidential veto. And we may even have a problem getting to conference, based on the comments of some Senators. 
   So when this bill passes today--as I expect it will--we need to realize that more negotiation and compromise will be needed to actually get a bill that can be signed into law. 
   Second, section 806 would amend the labor law that covers the employees of FedEx Express. This has been an issue that has arisen on occasion here in the Congress. The simple fact is that FedEx Express, since its inception in 1971, has been and remains an air carrier--in particular an express carrier. FedEx trucks are fully integrated into the air express activities--and even the Ninth Circuit Court has found this to be the case. 
   The press enjoys characterizing this as a FedEx versus UPS fight. It is not. No member wants to pick sides between two innovative and successful companies. But UPS is a motor carrier subject to the National Labor Relations Act. It has been for the last 100 years. The two companies have a very different corporate structure. 
   Some continue to make reference to 1996 law that ``changed'' coverage of FedEx Express to the Railway Labor Act. This is misleading. In fact, a conforming amendment in the ICC Termination Act of 1995 had the inadvertent effect of potentially changing the labor law that would apply to FedEx Express from the Railway Labor Act to the National Labor Relations Act. No discussion on this issue was ever held during consideration of the bill, and there was no conscious decision made to effect that change in the ICC Termination Act. The 1996 legislation--which was championed by former Democratic Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina--simply corrected that inadvertent error. FedEx has been covered by the Railway Labor Act since 1971. It is unfortunate this bill would ignore all that has gone on before. 
   In closing, let me commend my Committee leadership for working together under what has frequently been some difficult times. There are some issues that we simply disagree on, but we have tried to continue to work toward the goal of getting a reauthorization in place. 
   I also want to express thanks to the Science Committee for its contribution of the research title and to the Ways and Means Committee for the tax title. I am pleased that Ways and Means rejected moving to a user fee-based financing scheme in favor of the current more efficient fuel tax program. Taxes are raised for general aviation and corporate jets, and we should note that these groups are accepting and supportive of the increase, knowing that the system requires it. 
   Again, I am pleased that we are moving forward. We need to invest in aviation infrastructure. We need to modernize our air traffic control system to increase capacity and improve safety. We need to address the environmental challenge facing the industry today. We need to ensure that our aviation system remains safe. 
   The United States has always been the leader around the world in aviation innovation--but I fear that position may be threatened. We must continue to lead and set the standard for the rest of the world.

Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for giving me an opportunity to again express my appreciation not only to him but to the staff and to the chairman of our committee, Mr. Oberstar; the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Costello; all the members as well as members in the leadership of what is called powerful Ways and Means Committee around here and the Science Committee for their contribution to this bill. 
   The fact of the matter is that we have approached the bulk of our work in a strong bipartisan way. We worked on the underlying bill in that spirit. Unfortunately, there are several provisions that are controversial and would impede our ability to actually get work through the whole process and signed by the President that were added in the full committee. But let there be no doubt that our country needs to get this legislation passed to accommodate new investment in our aviation system. 
   We are at the brink of rolling out a new generation of technology to accommodate the growth, to increase efficiency and safety in that system, be it a 15-, 20-, maybe 25-year multimillion dollar system. Doing that will increase the capacity of the system. We will maintain America's lead in aviation on a global basis and having that framework in place so that the administrators and the industries involved can plan with reduced uncertainty, which is very, very important. We are already late with this legislation. The current program is scheduled to expire at the end of this month. We will probably be doing a short-term extension. But we do need a reauthorization to proceed in a way that can be brought to a successful conclusion and signed by our President. And we look forward to working through the process with our colleagues on the other side of this building and on the other side of this aisle.

   Mr. PETRI. Unfortunately, I can't support this amendment. While we have reached bipartisan agreements on many of the provisions, there are several that impose new burdens, new regulations and potentially high and crippling costs. For example, notifying a passenger when buying a ticket whether an insecticide has been used on the plane in the last 60 days before the flight is a procedural nightmare for airlines. Is it really a national problem that requires such onerous regulation? How many flights would that plane have taken and in what countries? It's just incredible.

   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment because it is both unnecessary and redundant. From June 2004 to June 2006, the FAA established an aviation rulemaking advisory committee consisting of government, industry and labor unions in order to update the current training requirements. The proposed rewrite of Federal regulations will address, among other things, the area of alcohol awareness training for flight and gate attendants. The FAA plans to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in The Federal Register before the end of calendar year 2007. 
   The FAA's current training requirements address the very issue of handling unruly and intoxicated passengers, both in the air and on the ground. This rulemaking will further strengthen FAA's already adequate training programs to a level that I am sure will meet the gentleman's expectations. 
   So the Udall amendment is premature. We should let the agency with the most expertise take the lead to do the best job of dealing with the problem which we all agree needs to be even better dealt with. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the Udall amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, having no other requests for time, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, this provision would gut much of the ongoing high-priority work of the Department of Transportation Aviation Enforcement Office by requiring most of its resources to be dedicated to consumers' complaints. 
   While I certainly agree that consumer complaint oversight is important, the dedication of so many resources to only one issue is just not right. This provision would force the Aviation Enforcement Office to stop other important aviation enforcement, compliance, and consumer information and education activities that have for years been a priority for that office. 
   This provision would do so by requiring the investigation of each consumer complaint regarding flight cancellations, overbooking, baggage, refunds, fares and related conditions, frequent flier programs and deceptive or misleading advertising. 
   Currently, the only investigations that have been required by Congress are disability-related complaints. Sadly, to comply with this provision, the Aviation Enforcement Office would have to discontinue enforcement and compliance work involving racial, ethnic and sex-based discrimination, compliance with the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act, public charter flight violations, and code sharing disclosure violations. 
   Compliance with this provision would also necessitate that the office end its enforcement of unrealistic scheduling, contract of carriage violations, other unfair and deceptive practices, air carrier fitness and unlicensed and unauthorized operations, insurance violations, and reporting violations. 
   In the opinion of the experts at the Department of Transportation, these areas of consumer protection are of great importance because they safeguard the whole pool of consumers by protecting against bad business practice trends, rather than prosecuting case by case. 
   In the area of consumer information and education, some of the most important matters that would have to be eliminated are preparation of the monthly air travel consumer report, updating of aviation consumer guidance material, conducting industry and public forums on disability issues, and participating and providing information of government, industry and consumer conferences. In addition, the Aviation Enforcement Office would have to cease all its rulemaking activities. 
   Everyone knows that with tight government budgets, you really cannot investigate every single case at the Federal level. Instead, you provide a forum to file and maintain complaints that are reviewed for patterns of abuse. You then pursue those cases that will do the most good for the largest number of consumers. 
   Again, this amendment, contrary to the intent of the author, would have disastrous effects on aviation consumer protection and enforcement of the aviation economic regulations that are currently on the books, and, therefore, I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   I support this rule to provide for consideration of H.R. 2881, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007. Aviation program authorizations expire at the end of this month, and it is essential that a new authorization is in place in the near future. 
   Fortunately, aviation has bounced back from the troubles experienced in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. While this is good news, it also is placing a strain on our air transportation system. And it is only estimated to get worse. 
   For example, 1 billion passengers are estimated by 2015, a 52 percent increase over the 2005 levels. It is estimated that the number of aircraft handled by air traffic control will increase from 45 million in 2004 to over 58 million by 2015. 
   Aviation is vital to our economy. U.S. airlines employed nearly 600,000 people in the United States in 2003. The industry helps to create and sustain more than 10 million jobs across our country and supports 8 percent of our gross national domestic product. 
   It's estimated that we need capital investments of $9 to $15 billion each year in order to accommodate this ever-growing demand. The FAA Reauthorization Act increases infrastructure investment, provides for continued progress in the modernization of the air traffic control system, increases safety, and enhances environmental protection. 
   It is essential that we get a good reauthorization program in place. While there are some provisions in this bill that I believe still need further discussion and negotiation, we need to move the process forward, and, therefore, I support adoption of this rule today.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETRI. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. I am happy to support the provisions in this conference report that put in place a number of reforms that will improve access to higher education, increase transparency in college costs, and provide more accountability in the Federal student loan programs. 
   One of my top priorities over the years has been to ensure students access to Federal aid and to provide greater budget responsibility to taxpayers with regard to the management of Federal student aid funds. This legislation incorporates several provisions aimed at protecting students' financial interests. 
   Furthermore, I strongly support the sunshine measures that will provide greater transparency about relationships between lenders and schools. I am pleased that the conference report also retains the language that I offered to provide greater fiscal accountability at the Department of Education by requiring a Department of Justice review of any settlement with lenders that exceeds $1 million. 
   The conference report also contains a critical first step toward the implementation of my Income-Dependent Education Assistance Act which would create a new direct consolidated loan for student borrowers that would be pegged to their income after graduation and collected by the IRS. 
   It also includes several provisions that Representative Grijalva and I first proposed in the House that would establish a strong national effort to improve the accessibility of instructional materials for postsecondary students with visual impairments and other print disabilities. 
   Though there is that much is positive in this conference report, I am disappointed that we failed to adequately address the problems that currently exist in the accreditation system. For many years I have argued that accreditation fails to protect the public interest because it is costly and intrusive and does not ensure educational quality. I believe the reforms included in this bill will do little to improve the system and may, in fact, have made it even worse. 
   Again, I want to thank my colleagues for working so hard over the years to reauthorize these important higher education programs. I support today's conference report and look forward to making further improvements in the future.

   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, introduced by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) on January 16, 2007, conveys the final interest retained by the United States in St. Joseph Memorial Hall in St. Joseph, Michigan. 
   St. Joseph, Michigan, is in the process of redeveloping an area of town that will link downtown with the beautiful lakefront district. Removing the deed restriction will allow St. Joseph to create a recreational, educational, and cultural district that benefits the entire community. 
   This redevelopment will make the city a more attractive place to work, live and play while improving the local economy. 
   H.R. 494 will allow St. Joseph Memorial Hall to be incorporated into these redevelopment plans. Under the current restriction, redevelopment of the area may be impeded by a deed restriction placed on the property by the Federal Government more than 70 years ago. The deed restriction on Memorial Hall has remained despite the fact that similar deed restrictions in the city have been lifted. If not lifted, limitations on this tiny parcel of land located in the center of the redevelopment will significantly jeopardize the city's plan. 
   The bill before us is a commonsense solution that will allow the city of St. Joseph to proceed with redevelopment. In the 109th Congress, the House recognized this as a sensible, simple solution and passed the same language in H.R. 4700. I support this measure, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, H.R. 1129, introduced by Representative RUSS CARNAHAN of Missouri, provides for the construction, operation and maintenance of an arterial road in St. Louis County, Missouri, over deed-restricted property and requires that county to restrict a nearby parcel of land for open space, recreation or wetland management. The bill allows construction of a surface road across property purchased with Federal funds. 
   Following the 1993 Midwest floods, this property was purchased for the purpose of clearing the floodplain of homes to prevent future flood losses. The bill requires St. Louis County to ensure that this project will not cause future flood damage. If there is flood damage caused by this project, the bill assigns liability to St. Louis County. This property will remain permanently ineligible for Federal disaster assistance. The Federal interest in reducing Federal disaster costs remains protected. 
   This project is not setting precedent. In the past, exceptions have been made to allow for road and public works development on deed restricted properties.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETRI. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Miller and our ranking member, BUCK MCKEON, for working together on this important legislation. As has been pointed out, the bill we are considering today will put in place additional measures to ensure continued access to Federal student loans. 
   During committee consideration I expressed concern with one provision in the bill that would permit an entire institution rather than the individual the authority to participate in the lender of last resort program. I urged the committee to consider clarifying the trigger mechanism for school eligibility in order to avoid a situation in which a guaranty agency is in essence the lender of first resort. I am pleased that the chairman included language in the manager's amendment that will be offered that requires the Secretary of Education, not the guaranty agency, to determine whether a school qualifies for institution-wide designation. 
   Furthermore, the manager's amendment requires institutions to demonstrate that a minimum number of students or percentage of students have been rejected by eligible lenders before receiving this designation. 
   These are two important changes, so I again thank Chairman Miller for including them in the manager's amendment and appreciate Ranking Member McKeon's assistance on this issue. 
   While the focus of the bill we are considering today is making sure contingency plans are in place should turmoil in the credit markets affect the availability of Federal student loans and the Federal Family Education Loan Program, we do have another Federal student loan program that is immune to effects of the credit market, and that is the Direct Loan Program. 
   Just this year, over 100 schools have applied to participate in the Direct Loan Program. Penn State University stated that it is moving to the Direct Loan Program because it will ``enable students to continue their education without worrying about whether and where their Federal student loans come from.'' 
   Currently, the Direct Loan Program accounts for about 20 percent of the student loan market. However, the Secretary of Education has stated on multiple occasions that the Direct Loan Program could easily double the amount of new loans it makes to students. 
   It is just commonsense that in times of market turmoil, instead of relying on untested fall-back measures in the FFEL Program, universities should also consider the Direct Loan Program. 
   I will conclude by emphasizing that to date, no student or college has reported problems accessing Federal student loans. Currently, the disruption is best described as forcing some students to switch lenders. The message from Congress to students and families should be that they should not panic and should continue to pursue Federal student aid in the upcoming school year. There are measures in place, and in this bill we are strengthening those measures, to ensure that students will always have access to Federal student loans.

Unfortunately, though, the other body has not come to any agreement on its bill, and so we are here today considering yet another extension. The bill before us would extend the programs and funding at the Federal Aviation Administration at current levels through the end of this budget year. 
   This bill funds the operations and safety initiatives of the Federal Aviation Administration; provides Airport Improvement Program contract authority at the budget year 2007 level through the end of September; authorizes such sums as are necessary for FAA Facilities and Equipment, Research and Development, through the end of the budget year; and extends the authority to limit the third party liability of air carriers arising out of acts of terrorism through March of 2009. 
   The bill before us will ensure that our national aviation system continues to operate until a full FAA reauthorization can be enacted. 
   We need to look at how to meet the growing demands placed on our Nation's infrastructure whether modernizing our antiquated air traffic control system or repairing our crumbling infrastructure. 
   We also need to produce more domestic energy and look for alternative fuel sources. 
   There is much work yet to be done on the FAA reauthorization bill. I urge our colleagues in the other body to take up a comprehensive reauthorization package so that we may get to conference. We must work in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion to craft legislation that our President can sign. 
   So I support this extension in order to allow us time to accomplish the important goal of coming to agreement on the comprehensive FAA reauthorization package.

   We want to be sure that we have a fair and impartial analysis of projects and that we don't set in place a procedure that inevitably leads to the largest projects getting built, not the most cost-effective ones. 
   The amendment is supported by many organizations, including the American Rivers, Taxpayers for Common Sense, and Republicans for Environmental Protection. 
   Up-to-date scientific engineering and environmental tools should be taken into account when looking at projects. As Representative Blumenauer has said, it is time to bring the Corps into the 20th and 21st centuries.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. English from Pennsylvania, for yielding, and I appreciate the hard work that he and members of his committee have done in this area. 
   I had the privilege of appearing before his subcommittee as we were considering the financing of this legislation. In fact, in September of last year, the House considered and passed a bill that resulted from that hearing, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007, which was H.R. 2881. It reauthorized the FAA for the next 4 years. On several occasions after that, the House passed bills to extend the FAA programs. 
   Unfortunately, the other body has taken no action on any of these measures; therefore, the authority of the FAA's essential programs and taxes were extended through the end of this month as part of the omnibus appropriations act. Regrettably, those FAA programs and authorities not extended in the omnibus expired on September 30. 
   Additionally, although the omnibus appropriation bill provided money, it did not extend the FAA's contract authority, and therefore as of December 31, the FAA no longer has the authority to make new obligations, including sorely needed Airport Improvement Program grants to allow airports to complete vital infrastructure improvement projects. The omnibus also included a provision that would prevent the FAA from spending any money of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund after March 1 of this year. 
   Without some congressional action to extend the FAA's authority on March 1st, the FAA will be facing a partial shutdown. It is unlikely that Congress will be able to send a long-term FAA reauthorization bill to the President for consideration before the February 29 deadline. 
   We have before us H.R. 5270. This bill would extend the funding and expenditure authority of the FAA through June 30 of this year, 2008. The bill also extends the taxes funding the Airport and Airway Trust Funds through June 30, provides Airport Improvement Program funding through September 30, and extends eligibility for essential air service subsidies and airport grant funding. 
   Ideally, we should be considering the FAA reauthorization conference report at this time. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Instead, we are considering the third short-term extension of the FAA's authority by the House. However, this bill will ensure that our national aviation system continues to operate until a full FAA reauthorization can be enacted. 
   There is much work yet to be done on the FAA reauthorization bill. We need to work in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion to pass legislation that the President can sign. 
   I support this extension in order to allow us time to accomplish this important goal.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETRI. (STUDENT LOAN SUNSHINE ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 890, the bipartisan Student Loan Sunshine Act, as a first step towards comprehensive student loan reform. The series of scandals that have surfaced over the last month have underscored the need for clear and explicit guidance on student lending ethics. These revelations of kickbacks, financial aid officer compensation, lavish travel, and aid office staffing are just a few of the egregious practices lenders have employed to buy access on preferred lender lists and manipulate the trust of both students and taxpayers. 
   In supporting H.R. 890, however, we must remember that these abuses are merely symptoms of a very broken system: the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program. The excessive subsidies made to student lenders through this archaic loan-delivery system cost taxpayers approximately $5 billion more each year than the comparable Direct Loan program. Indeed, the Office of Management and Budget, Congressional Budget Office, Treasury Department, Government Accountability Office, and other economists are all in agreement that the FFEL structure is hemorrhaging taxpayer subsidies. While this wasteful spending is inexcusable, it is even more appalling that none of these excess subsidies filter back down to students in the form of borrower benefits, but rather have been used to underwrite these unethical practices. 
   Let me be very clear, while the Sunshine Act is a positive first step towards reform, we must only consider it a stop-gap measure to limit further abuse of the FFEL program while we develop a comprehensive, structural loan reform. In the coming months, Congress will have another opportunity to consider changes to this nation's higher education laws. The real test of our resolve will be whether we settle for  yet another Band-Aid on a broken system or if we work to redesign this system to ensure that critical tax dollars in federal student loans provide the best return on our taxpaying constituents' investment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me not only in supporting this bill, but also working towards comprehensive student loan reform. Students and taxpayers deserve better, and Congress has the responsibility to deliver these critical reforms this year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Madam Chairman, my alternative market study mechanism, which is before us, this amendment would significantly advance our understanding of market-based reforms to the guaranteed student loan program that were begun last year during our consideration of the College Cost Reduction Act. This Congress has demonstrated significant interest in developing some type of comprehensive market-based reform in order to overhaul the guaranteed loan program and make certain that taxpayers' interests are better served. 
   Last year, I had the opportunity to offer an amendment in the Education and Labor Committee to the College Cost Reduction Act to study and pilot a market-based reform, such as an auction, to determine how the Federal Government may better determine lender yields to reduce wasteful spending in the guaranteed loan program. This amendment was adopted in the committee and included in the bipartisan House-passed bill last summer. 
   Well, I was pleased that an auction pilot was included in the final law. There is growing concern among reformers, the lending industry, and the administration that the Senate model which was adopted may have significant implementation and logistical challenges. 
   However, this bill presents us with an opportunity to further study and consider an effective market-based reform proposal. So the amendment before us would simply amend the current auction pilot evaluation language included in this bill to require the Secretaries of Education and the Treasury, in conjunction with the Government Accounting Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Congressional Budget Office, to evaluate the feasibility of an alternative market-based reform to the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The alternative should reduce Federal costs to taxpayers and use savings to increase need-based grants to lower-income students. 
   I'd urge Members to support this amendment to further our understanding of market-based reform options. The study would mark an important step toward fully understanding market-based reforms of the program and would build on reforms incorporated in the College Cost Reduction Access Act. And again I'd ask my colleagues to support an alternative market mechanism study amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETRI. Madam Chairman, we'd just say that it's important for us to get informed, knowledgeable advice as to how to operate the student loan programs, the direct program, and the guarantee program better. In the past, we've adopted pretty much a political-based approach of Congress setting the amount of the guarantee that private lenders receive for making student loans. In the reform act this summer, we cut that and tried to put in place a pilot approach coming from the Senate for a market-based mechanism. This would broaden the study; and, I think, would, in fact, be something that will end up saving the taxpayer money if it works. And if it doesn't work, we're no worse off. It's a study. 
   So I don't understand the reluctance to try to get the Treasury Department and experts in this area. We have auctions for loans weekly to finance the debt of our country. And we certainly can do a better job of pricing the guaranteed student loan program.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Madam Chairman, this amendment should be much less controversial than the one that just passed. As you're aware, the Federal Government runs two Federal student loan programs that provide the same affordable loans to American students: the Federal Family Education or Guaranteed Loan Program, and the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program. 
   In the past year, a significant amount of attention has been paid to the scandal-ridden and wasteful guaranteed loan program. Reducing excessive subsidies was the primary goal of the bipartisan College Cost Reduction and Access Act that was enacted last September, and we have seen some success. But this program was so embroiled with illegal and unethical activity between lenders and financial aid officers that sweeping new rules are included in this higher education reform act aimed at ending these relationships and providing much greater transparency for students and for taxpayers.     
   Given all of the abuse that's occurred in the guaranteed program, imagine my surprise when an amendment ended up being adopted which had the effect of targeting the direct loan program and a seemingly innocuous amendment to audit the direct loan program contained a series of reporting requirements applied only to the direct loan program which were designed to make it appear the program was performing more poorly than the tarnished guaranteed program. 
   I should note that despite the scores of improprieties documented in the  guaranteed loan program, the direct loan program has had no similar ethical abuses. Further, it has been scored as significantly cheaper by the Office of Management Budge, CBO and GAO, since its inception in the early 1900s. 
   Now it will be one thing if the amendment applied these new reporting provisions equally to both the guarantee and direct programs, and I'm encouraged that the author of the amendment, my respected colleague from the State of Georgia (Mr. Price), has indicated that that is his intent, and I'm hoping that we can, in fact, adopt this amendment to apply requirements to both programs. 
   But this language currently in the bill has the effect of undermining the direct loan program, boosting the guaranteed loan program's performance in comparison, and the amendment before us addresses the language. 
   Madam Chairman, what is good for the goose is good for the gander. The amendment would maintain the audit and most of the reporting requirements added to the direct loan program but would also require comparable audits in reporting for guaranty agencies in the Guaranteed Loan program. I have no doubt the direct loan program will pass the audit with shining colors, and I look forward to the report. I hope the same can be said of the Guaranteed Loan program. 
   I would ask support for the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Chairman, I just have to say, this is important, because, on the one hand, if you treat a direct loan as adding to the debt with no offset because it is a loan which will be repaid, the loan is an asset, there should be some offset, you can get a very misleading picture. If you are cosigning a note, you are liable on the note, and that's what we do when we guarantee these private loans. 
   So zero costs in the direct program and outlay. And it misleads, too, because unless you compare apples and apples, you can have a badly distorted picture.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, I plan to vote for this resolution, but to surge or not to surge, that is the wrong question. Just saying ``no'' is simple obstructionism. What we need is a new way forward to replace the old way that is not getting us anywhere. It has become clear that trying to establish a  multiethnic Iraqi democracy, while laudable, simply cannot be accomplished by non-Iraqis. 
   The fact is, Iraq has never been a unified country with enough common interest to foster the give and take of democracy. During the First World War, Britain seized the Mesopotamian region from the collapsing Ottoman Empire. Iraq was created out of three separate provinces to keep the Turks out while allowing the British access to the local oil. 
   Captain Arnold Wilson, the British civil commissioner in Baghdad, argued that the creation of the new state was a recipe for disaster. He warned that the deep differences among the three main communities, the Sunni, Shia and Kurds, ensured the new country could only be run by what he called the antithesis of democratic government.     
   After a rebellion in 1920, which resulted in the deaths of some 2,000 British soldiers and 8,000 Iraqis, the British, through the leadership of Secretary of War Winston Churchill, largely extricated themselves by choosing a Sunni to be king and strongman. 
   In light of this history, we should seriously consider that we have two basic options: 
   First, choose a faction to stabilize and rule the country through force, much as all of Iraq's previous regimes did, and that is hardly an attractive option. 
   Or, second, bring about a partition of the country, to form a loose confederation where the Shias, the Sunnis and the Kurds can each govern themselves while leaving the others alone. 
   Our enterprise in Iraq has been carried out with the best of intentions, and our men and women in the Armed Forces have performed with great heroism, skill, and honor. But we have to accept reality. We have a responsibility to help stabilize the situation, and doing so is in our national interest. 
   But I don't think it is fair to ask our sons and daughters to be policemen in a civil war. Sadly, it seems that most Iraqis do not embrace democratic government unless it is dominated exclusively by their own individual groups. 
   The Sunnis, the Shia and the Kurds are willing and able to establish law and order within their own ethnically homogenous areas. The efforts to push out other areas currently underway in Iraq are deplorable, but it is surely not unexpected given Iraq's history and desperate situation. 
   The sectarian militias have popular support because they have easily understood plans to establish security within their spheres for their own people. Instead of fighting the militias, we need to co-opt them. We need to help acceptable local tribal leaders, government leaders and religious authorities establish authority over their areas. 
   We also need to seek the positive involvement of Iraq's neighbors. Some of them may be meddling, or may be tempted to meddle, but at the end of the day, instability in Iraq means instability for everybody in the region. 
   Let's set about the task of helping Iraq's three main groups to regroup and stabilize their own territories so that we can withdraw to our bases and ultimately get out all together.

As it is unlikely Congress will be able to send a FAA reauthorization bill to the President for signature before the September 30 deadline, we have before us H.R. 3540, the Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2007, to extend the funding and expenditure authority of the FAA for the next 90 days through the end of this year. 
   H.R. 3540 provides 3 months of AIP contract authority at the budget 2007 level, authorizes such sums as are necessary for FAA facilities and equipment, research and development, and operations for 3 months and extends the authority to limit the third-party liability of air carriers arising out of acts of terrorism for 3 months. 
   Most importantly, the bill will ensure that our national aviation system continues to operate until a full FAA reauthorization can be enacted. 
   There is much work yet to be done on the reauthorization bill. We must work in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion to craft legislation that our President can sign. That's our task. That is what the communities involved and our constituents expect of us. 
   I support this clean 3-month extension, and I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee for drafting and introducing H.R. 3540, and look forward to working with them as we continue consideration of the FAA reauthorization bill.
