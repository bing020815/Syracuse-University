<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (HONORING MILITARY SUPPORT GROUPS -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me begin on a personal note. I just want to say what a great pleasure it is for me, Mr. Speaker, to manage this bill and the series of bills with my good friend from Guam whom I sit on the House Armed Services Committee with and the Natural Resources Committee with and whom I've been to Iraq three times with. I know of nobody that cares more about our military and men and women in uniform than my good friend from Guam, so it's wonderful to be with her in this particular venue today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1200, a resolution authored by Congresswoman BETTY SUTTON of Ohio. This resolution commends a large group of selfless and dedicated people, many of whom are volunteers, in organizations that provide support to the families and children of the deployed members of the Armed Forces, as well as to servicemembers themselves. 
   Our military families face extraordinary demands and stresses, Mr. Speaker, and challenges related to the service of their loved ones. To ease these burdens, military support groups provide a variety of crucial services ranging from financial and employment assistance to counseling and community support. 
   These military support groups take on various forms, whether they be Federal, State and local government efforts, or whether they are the many nonprofit, charitable and private efforts that have continuously and unselfishly supported the members of our Armed Forces and their families ever since September 11, 2001. 
   Among the approximately 1.8 million family members of the 1.3 million active duty personnel, the needs are many and supporting those needs is a matter of military readiness. 
   The support challenge is made more complex because virtually all the families of the National Guard troops and reservists reside in civilian communities spread across this Nation. Yet numerous agencies, Mr. Speaker, and groups have taken on the challenge to provide help and support, particularly during extended periods of mobilization and deployment. 
   Our military forces could not have sustained the stress of repeated deployments and combat without the outstanding assistance, dedication and outstanding work over the years of these military support groups. 
   Let me add on a personal note, if I may, Mr. Speaker, my grandfather and father were both career military personnel. And like many people in this Chamber, I have many members of my family, uncles, cousins, my own brother, who served at various points in the military. All of them would tell you that they have received valuable support for both themselves and their families repeatedly from private and charitable groups that are designed to support the men and women that wear the uniform of the United States. Our citizens do that, not simply because it's the expedient thing to do, but because it's the right thing to do, and it's an expression of the appreciation of the American people for the men and women who sacrifice to defend them that these sorts of contributions take place. Today's resolution is a fitting way to celebrate and thank such organizations. 
   I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1200. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I will try to be brief. 
   I want to, again, commend my good friend from Guam and say in the opportunities we've had to travel abroad I notice how fervently she seeks out servicemen and women from her country and with what great warmth and gratitude she's always received. And it's a reminder of what an exceptional place she represents and what exceptional people have chosen her from amongst themselves to defend them here. 
   I want to also express my personal appreciation for the types of groups, again, that were singled out in this resolution by our good friend, Ms. Sutton. Frankly, we all could sit here and name many, many groups in our respective districts that put American men and women in uniform ahead of everything else. I want to mention just one, if I might, Mr. Speaker. 
   In my home State of Lawton, Oklahoma, is where Fort Sill is located. It's the home base of the field artillery. And Fort Sill has a very unique organization called literally the Armed Services YMCA of Lawton/Fort Sill. It, for decades, has performed support services for family. Every year there is a huge breakfast and, frankly, a community drive to solicit private dollars to support its efforts to help men and women in uniform and service families. 
   And I've heard repeatedly, as I go down to these, instances where families would show up from deployment desperately needing things; you know, perhaps young families not able to furnish the apartments they were in, needing support. That support's always given generously by fellow soldiers, but more importantly, even by the men and women of Lawton, Oklahoma. 
   Again, I commend my colleagues for bringing this resolution. I urge its support. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (HONORING TOBY KEITH'S COMMITMENT TO MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend a great Oklahoman and American patriot, whose unceasing support for the men and women in our armed services has been a hallmark of his career. Country music star Toby Keith was born and raised in my hometown of Moore, Oklahoma, and is now a resident just south of us in Norman, Oklahoma, and has made it his mission as an entertainer to keep our troops entertained and to boost their morale as they serve this Nation in some of the most dangerous, remote places on the planet. 
   This resolution outlines Mr. Keith's commitment to our troops and encourages other entertainers to take into consideration Toby Keith's deep commitment to boosting the morale of our Nation's soldiers when supporting USO operations. 
   As many of you know, Mr. Speaker, Toby Keith is one of the most successful country music stars of the last two decades. His songs not only appeal to a wide variety of listeners but are also critically acclaimed. 
   On a personal note, I'll tell my friend on the other side of the aisle, he's actually a very good Democrat. But like all of us, I think he's an American and I'm proud to say an Oklahoman, far ahead of being affiliated with any political party. 
   Despite his fantastic success as a performer, I'm here to highlight the work Mr. Keith has done for the United Service Organizations. Since the founding of USO in 1941, thousands of celebrities have taken time out of their lives to visit service men and women who sacrifice their lives for the cause of freedom. These shows not only help to boost morale among our troops but also help to connect our Armed Forces to America when they are far from home, Mr. Speaker. 
   Since before the United States entered the Second World War, the USO has been the bridge between the American public and the U.S. military. These performances also remind the troops that we are all eternally grateful for the work they do. 
   Today, the USO delivers its programs and services at more than 130 locations around the world. More recently, the USO opened centers in Kuwait, Qatar and Afghanistan to support service members participating in Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom. The organization relies on over 25,000 volunteers, and servicemembers and their families visit USO centers 5.3 million times a year, Mr. Speaker. 
   Country music personalities have always been an essential element of the USO's entertainment. In the early years, performers like Gene Autry, another notable Oklahoman--actually Gene Autry, Oklahoma, is in my district as well, Mr. Speaker--Patsy Cline, and many other acts from the Grand Ole Opry have traveled around the world to entertain our troops. Today, performers like Neal McCoy and Lee Ann Womack have all gone to Iraq to entertain our troops. However, few celebrities have visited our troops fighting the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan with as much fervor and frequency as Toby Keith. 
   Mr. Speaker, Toby Keith has made six USO tours, including entertaining over 135,000 U.S. service personnel in Iraq, Afghanistan, Cuba, Germany, Belgium, Kosovo, Italy, and Africa. In fact, he has volunteered to perform at some of the most dangerous and remote locations in the Persian Gulf, including forward operating bases with populations of as few as 50 servicemembers that require Apache escort helicopters to reach. In many of these cases, these places and the garrisons literally haven't had entertainment in many, many months. 
   The USO also noted in our discussions with them, Mr. Speaker, that Toby's brought back valuable insight from forward deployed troops, including things they would request from the USO and the American public. As a result, the USO has developed a program called USO Delivered, which includes transportable USO centers for remote areas. 
   On April 28, 2008, while performing in one of these dangerous locations, Kandahar, Afghanistan, mortar fire disrupted one of Mr. Keith's concerts. Instead of packing up and going home, Toby Keith returned to the stage to finish the show. This attitude, that all troops no matter where they are stationed deserve our support, is what makes Toby Keith an exemplary patriot, and all entertainers should, and I'm sure do, take a good lesson from his dedication to our men and women in uniform. 
   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Keith's visits to the USO are not only places where he deserves recognition for supporting our troops. He also freely provides tickets to military personnel for all of his shows in the U.S., and servicemembers showing military ID are allowed to eat and drink for free at his restaurants. Toby Keith also reflects his deep admiration for the troops in his hit song ``American Soldier'' which hails the work that our Armed Forces do to protect us all on a daily basis. 
   Mr. Speaker, at a time when the thousands of Americans question the merits of our missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is essential that our service men and women know that we support their dedication to America, regardless of our political disagreements at home. Toby Keith has been a stalwart supporter of our troops throughout his career and deserves our recognition and our appreciation. Regardless of one's opinion on our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, supporting our men and women overseas is certainly something that all Members of this body encourage and support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on House Resolution 1255 and honor a true patriot. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (HONORING THE 28TH INFANTRY DIVISION FOR SERVING AND PROTECTING THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 390, as amended, which honors the 28th Infantry Division for serving and protecting the United States of America. 
   I am honored to pay tribute to the current and former members of the 28th Infantry Division, the Keystone Division, who have steadfastly and courageously defended and served this great country on our own shores and in distant lands.     
   With roots that date back to the Continental Army, the 28th Infantry Division fought valiantly in several campaigns during World War I, earning the title ``Iron Division'' from General John J. Pershing. 
   Again, during World War II, victory was won in hard-fought battles in places like the Huertgen Forest on the western front and in the Battle of the Bulge because of the tenacity and the perseverance of the brave soldiers of the 28th Infantry Division. These battles earned them another title, Bloody Buckets, this time given to them by German forces because of the fury of the 28th Infantry Division assaults. 
   More recently, the 28th Infantry Division has participated in Operation Desert Storm, deployed troops to oust the Taliban in Afghanistan, and has played a vital role in the successes of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Closer to home, Mr. Speaker, the Division has responded in the aftermath of natural disasters to provide aid and comfort to fellow Americans during hurricanes, blizzards and devastating floods. 
   It is important to note that the soldiers of the Division have distinguished themselves by earning 10 Medals of Honor, four Legions of Merit, and 258 Silver Stars for their outstanding service to the Nation. 
   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, the valiant service of the 28th Infantry Division has not come without enormous sacrifice. Throughout its history, the members of the Division have paid the price to ensure our freedom. Still today there are over 2,600 soldiers from the 28th Infantry Division missing in action in both world wars of the 20th century. 
   Mr. Speaker, if I did not also pay tribute today to the incredible families of these brave soldiers, who waited at home while their loved ones answered our Nation's call, I would be remiss. The entire Nation owes the soldiers and veterans of the 28th Infantry Division and their families a debt of gratitude. We are all proud of their service. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all Members to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I want to make a few brief remarks on the issue of energy because we seem to discuss that. And I have no further speakers at that point and I will be prepared to yield back to my friend from Guam. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think today in the discussion of three bills we've seen a terrifically orderly process of cooperation between the two sides as we have come together to honor and recognize Americans who have distinguished themselves in service to our country and in service to one another. And it's been a process that I think ought to epitomize all of our openings. Our problem, unfortunately, is we don't always have that process in this House. 
   We've known for many, many years that we had a very serious energy crisis. I believe former Secretary of the Treasury, John Connelly, first pointed that out as long ago as 1970 when we were importing about 24 percent of petroleum from overseas. Former President Carter called it the moral equivalent of war that we confront and deal with this crisis in the late 1970s. And there certainly have been fitful efforts by both sides of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, to try and come to grips with this problem over the years, but we all know we have not done it successfully. And I think perhaps that's because we have not done it together. 
   I would point to the efforts of two of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Mr. Abercrombie from Hawaii and Mr. Peterson from Pennsylvania, who have tried to work together to formulate a bipartisan solution to parts of this vexing problem as an example that all of us on both sides ought to follow, Mr. Speaker. I think if we did, we would do better. And I think we could come up with legislation that would genuinely make a difference because nothing is more important, aside from our physical security, than our economic security. And I think we all recognize we're at the point, Mr. Speaker, that that security is threatened by an overdependence on foreign energy. 
   We can go a long way, we can do a lot together. Sometimes when we work together we do do extraordinary things. So I would challenge the House that in the coming week, when we discuss this important issue, that that's, indeed, how we proceed, we bring bills to the floor, we have open debate, and we try to find common ground with one another. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 6, the so-called CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. I oppose this bill because in it our Democratic friends are putting America's security and economic vitality at risk. This bill is fundamentally a tax-increasing and job-destroying piece of legislation that will result in less energy independence, not more. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are several provisions within this bill that I take exception to. As one of the Representatives from Oklahoma, I would focus on a particularly onerous provision that will assist in the destruction of small American producers in the domestic oil and gas industry. 
   In 2005, the Republicans worked for and passed legislation with substantial Democratic support creating clear incentives for domestic production of oil. That policy contributes directly to our efforts to achieve energy independence in America. Today, the Democratic Party claims the oil and gas industry has become too profitable and believes this industry needs to be reined in by burdening it with increased taxes. This conclusion is wrong, and the end result will be increased reliance on foreign oil production, less energy independence here in America, and higher prices for every American consumer. 
   This legislation is based on the false premise that the oil and gas industry is too profitable. In fact, according to the Census Bureau and the American Petroleum Institute: ``The oil and gas industry earned 8.5 cents on every dollar of sales compared to 7.4 cents for all U.S. manufacturing, mining and wholesale trade.'' The API further states: ``For the last 5 years, the oil and gas industry has earned 5.9 cents compared to an average for all U.S. industry of 5.2 cents for every dollar of sales.'' This is hardly greedy or out of line with other U.S. businesses. 
   Mr. Speaker, the negative ripple effects of this tax on one of the most basic industries in America are dire; and this will affect the whole oil and gas industry, both large and small. Eliminating this tax break is certain to increase the price of gasoline, natural gas and heating oil, as the extra costs will be passed on to consumers. Consumers should oppose it for the same reasons they oppose taxes on imported oil and gas production: it will raise prices. Moreover, it will discourage domestic energy exploration, extraction, production, and refining, thereby making America more dependent on foreign sources of oil and gas. And it will harm State and local economies as smaller producers are forced to shut down marginal wells. Oklahoma has roughly 70,000 wells producing less than 10 barrels of oil a day, and these will be among the first wells to close down due to unsustainable costs in this tax increase. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6 will have profound and long-lasting harmful effects on our economy and our security. Overall, this bill takes our country in the opposite direction than the one in which we need to go. H.R. 6 is nothing more than a ploy by the Democratic Party to create political sound bites at  the expense of sound energy policy. Frankly, I hope my Democratic friends from energy-producing States do not feel compelled out of blind partisan loyalty to vote for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about the challenges we face as a Nation, and to urge the Members of this House to confront those challenges honestly and forthrightly. 
   As I do, I remind my colleagues that this House is not a debating society. It is not a place to merely score political points or rhetorical points. It is a place where we should confront the issues that face our country and then act accordingly. This responsibility rests not just with the Members individually, but with the majority especially. We come to this floor not just to speak, opine, and orate. We come here to set policy, to legislate and, most importantly, to act. 
   This resolution the majority, the Democrats, put before us today presents us with a choice; but after we make that choice, nothing will happen, nothing will change. We will have chosen to state our opinion, but we will refuse to act on that opinion. Some will see this as a tragedy; some, Madam Speaker, will see it as a farce. 
   This resolution is not serious. It is a political ploy rather than a principled position. It is sound and fury that signifies nothing. It is a cruel joke on those who sincerely want to leave Iraq before our mission is finished, and it is an affront to those of us who wish to succeed in Iraq. But while this politically motivated resolution achieves nothing, it does have real and lasting consequences. Passing this resolution will embolden our enemies, it will discourage our friends, and it will disappoint our troops. It will raise questions about our seriousness as a legislative body to anyone who actually pays attention to our proceedings, and it will lead our enemies to question our resolve and it will leave our men and women in uniform wondering why we are sending them on a mission in which we do not believe, but lack the political courage to cancel. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am surprised and disappointed that the majority party would bring a resolution to the floor which condemns an action directed by our Commander in Chief and his military advisers yet which neither forbids that action nor offers an alternative course.     
   If the majority party, the Democratic Party, was being honest with their supporters and with the American people, they would have a straight up-or-down vote on whether or not to fund the initiative ordered by the President. This is the way in which we should approach our constitutionally defined responsibility in regard to war and peace. 
   Madam Speaker, I have often voiced my respect for my Democratic colleagues on the floor, and as individuals I do respect and admire them. However, I neither respect nor admire the manner in which their leadership has chosen to frame the issue which they now place before the House. My friends on the other side of the aisle have abdicated the responsibilities of being in the majority. 
   They do not want to legislate. They do not want to act, they just want to state an opinion. But they are stating it in a fashion that will lead many to question our sincerity as Members of this House and to doubt the effectiveness of the institution which we all love, and they are now privileged to lead. 
   Madam Speaker, the majority in this body has the responsibility to do more than just criticize. So, I ask, what is their plan? We don't know. How will they achieve a stable Iraq? They won't say. 
   It is time for Democrats to step up and answer these questions. It is easy to second-guess the decisions of former Congresses and the President. It is easy to reconsider one's support and the support many in this Congress and in their majority have voiced in the past of placing additional troops in Iraq. But, what is easy isn't always right and certainly not in this case. 
   Let there be no mistake. Our soldiers are engaged in combat this very minute. Our military commanders have voiced support for the mission that they have been asked to complete. General Petraeus, our commander in Iraq, supports the surge of forces. Indeed he says he needs these additional troops to succeed. Moreover, the declassified National Intelligence Estimate makes clear the disaster that would result from failure in Iraq. 
   Madam Speaker, let us consider what will happen if the Democrats are successful in undermining the mission and the objectives of the surge. What would it mean? What effect would this have on our forces? What would be the implications for our Nation and the region? 
   Well, Madam Speaker, at a practical level, it would certainly mean that our enemies would know they have weakened the will and resolve of the American people. They would take this as a lesson and a guide for the future. At a tactical level, it would likely increase the level of insurgent activity aimed at destroying our forces. Additionally, it would also mean that, lacking reinforcement, our current forces would be stretched even further. 
   Strategically adopting this resolution would undermine the credibility of the United States. It will make the region more chaotic and dangerous than it is today. I remember many Members of the majority party calling for an increase in the size of our force in Iraq not so long ago. I remember numerous statements by Members from the other side of the aisle that said the alternatives to success were too horrible to contemplate. They were right, but now those concerns seem to be no longer operative. 
   I am under no illusions that we face an easy road ahead in Iraq. Quite frankly, it is the greatest challenge our Nation has faced in a generation. However, the alternative to showing resolve in Iraq is defeat in the central front in the war on terror. That will be disastrous for the Iraqis, threatening for our friends in the region, and dangerous for the security of our own country. 
   That is why this resolution is so disturbing. Democrats want to have it three ways. They want to criticize the President's plan, offer none of their own, and then refuse to let our side of the aisle offer a proposal for consideration by this body. A nonbinding resolution is no plan for the future. It is a plan for the next election. 
   In the next few days, I will continue to engage in this debate and outline what I believe to be the real challenges and choices that we face, and why we must support the surge in forces. I hope that in this debate my side persuades my colleagues to reject this resolution. 
   But if they are not persuaded, then I hope they will have the political courage to act, as opposed to just talk; that they will legislate as opposed to just debate. I hope they will discharge their duties as a majority by laying out and enacting their strategy, as opposed to merely criticizing the President and complicating a dangerous situation faced by our forces in the field

<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, everybody in this Chamber knows the right political vote on this package. The easy thing to do is vote ``no'' and hope the bill passes. Every Member knows there is no political upside to supporting this legislation. 
   It's also easy to say that something must be done--but something else. Well, we all have our own preferred  plans, Madam Speaker. The only problem is none of them get 218 votes. 
   I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are struggling to do the right thing. Lyndon Johnson used to say, ``Doing the right thing isn't hard; knowing the right thing to do is.'' This is certainly one of those occasions, Madam Speaker. But I am convinced unless we act, the stock market will take a nose dive, economic activity will freeze, credit markets will dry up, people will lose their jobs. 
   The real question is: Are we willing to gamble the jobs, the life savings, the retirement accounts, the homes and the businesses of the people we represent? Are we willing to risk the global, political, and social turmoil that will come if we have a prolonged recession or depression in the United States? Frankly, Madam Speaker, I am not.  
   Madam Speaker, everyone in this room knows the right ``political'' vote on this package. The easy thing to do is to vote no and hope the bill passes. Every member knows there is no political upside in supporting this bill. 
   It is also easy to say, ``something must be done--but not this.'' We all have our own schemes. Certainly I have my own five-point ``Tom Cole plan.'' I would suspend mark-to-market accounting rules, purchase preferred stock in institutions to protect the taxpayer, institute a private insurance program, limit executive compensation in companies that get Federal help, and raise the FDIC insured bank deposits from $100,000 to $250,000. There is only one problem with my plan, Madam Speaker, it cannot get 218 votes in this Chamber. 
   Madam Speaker, I know that my colleagues on both sides of this issue want to do ``the right thing.'' However, as Lyndon Johnson used to say, ``doing the right thing isn't hard, knowing the right thing to do is.'' I have struggled over whether passing this bill is the right thing to do. I do know that if it fails the stock market will take a nose dive, credit will freeze up and economic activity will grind to a halt. Some believe in time the markets will stabilize and correct themselves. I hope they are right. 
   The real question is are we willing to gamble the jobs, life savings, retirement accounts, the homes and the businesses of the people we represent? And are we willing to risk the global political and social turmoil that will surely occur if there is a severe and prolonged recession or depression in the United States? Frankly, Madam Speaker, I am not. 
   Madam Speaker, I am from Oklahoma, a state that has had more than its share of economic hardship over the years. My grandparents and parents lived through the Great Depression. They dealt with the hard times at home and the wars abroad that it spawned. My family and I lived through the 1980s when a banking and real estate collapse devastated Oklahoma's economy. I saw my State's per capita income fall from 98 percent to 79 percent of the national average. I saw hundreds of banks close, thousands of businesses fail, and countless families lose their life's savings. I do not intend to let that happen again for the sake of political popularity, ideological purity, or legislative perfection. 
   Madam Speaker, passing this bill is no substitute for long to structural reforms, appropriate legislative oversight, and the establishment of suitable levels of accountability and transparency in our financial markets. Those are issues we must confront in the next Congress. However, inaction in the face of the current turmoil in the markets is not an acceptable option. In fact, it is a huge gamble. 
   Madam Speaker, I know I will be haunted by this vote for the rest of my political life. I know I will have to explain it again and again to my friends. And I will be forced to defend it in every election against my opponents. And I know, having made this vote, I will have to make other tough votes to reform our economic and political systems. However that is far better than the lost jobs, the foreclosed homes, the depleted savings, the broken businesses, the devastated lives, and the dangerous world that I believe will be the consequences of a failure to act. 
   Madam Speaker, I will vote for this bill not because I wish to, but because I have to for the good of the people I represent. I trust that each of my colleagues will cast their vote in the same spirit, and I truly believe they will. There are no good choices here--but positive action is the right choice.

   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, our decision on Native Hawaiian recognition ought to be governed by two very basic principles: First, the concerns of the people of Hawaii, and second, the established principles of sovereignty of indigenous people under which this Republic has operated for over 200 years. 
   This bipartisan bill is supported by the Hawaii delegations in both the House and the Senate, which are Democratic, by a Republican Governor for the State of Hawaii, and by the Hawaii State Legislature, which has adopted bipartisan resolutions overwhelmingly in 2000, 2001 and 2005, by the National Congress of American Indians, and by the Alaska Federation of Natives. 
   Some are concerned that the establishment of a Native Hawaiian governing body is only a Federal issue. I would submit, as has been suggested, it's as much a State question as a national one, and we ought to respect, as conservatives, the wishes of people at the State level. 
   Despite what some believe or say, this is not about race; this is about the sovereignty of an indigenous people. The Native Hawaiian governing body, having the same characteristics as Native American governments, deserves Federal recognition. 
   Some sometimes say that Native Hawaiians should not be set apart as a separate category, yet our Congress has passed over 160 statutes addressing the conditions of Native Hawaiians and repeatedly recognizing the United States' political and legal relationship  and trust relationship with Native Hawaiians. 
   Again, despite what some say, this bill will not allow the Native Hawaiian governing body to establish gaming facilities in the State of Hawaii. It will not limit Federal control of Federal military facilities in Hawaii, and the Native Hawaiian governing body will not drain resources currently allocated to Native American tribes, Alaskan Natives, or threaten their interests in any way. Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, the NCAI actually supports this legislation. 
   I think fundamentally, as conservatives, we ought to allow the people of Hawaii to manage their own affairs as they see fit. We ought to respect the Constitution that we have, which recognizes the sovereignty of indigenous people. And we ought to support the passage of this very important and long-overdue legislation, H.R. 505. 
   And in closing, let me just add my congratulations to Mr. Abercrombie, who has labored long and hard for this legislation and has garnered significant bipartisan support, and I look forward to your success today.

<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (CODE TALKERS RECOGNITION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. I thank my good friend from West Virginia for yielding so graciously. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today in support of H.R. 4544, the Code Talkers Recognition Act, which would award the Congressional Gold Medal to Native American Code Talkers who assisted the allied powers in World War I and World War II to deceive and confuse our enemies in both conflicts. It's a particular personal pleasure to me, Mr. Speaker, because not only am I a Native American, Chickasaw, but my ancestry is both Choctaw and Chickasaw. My great grandfather had both tribes in his veins. And it's a wonderful treat for me to be able to participate in this. 
   I would also first like to thank my dear friend and colleague, Mr. Boren, who introduced this legislation and without whose hard work this bill would simply not be here today. He has worked hard and tirelessly to honor a group of Americans that deserve recognition. And I appreciate it so much, my dear friend. 
   To date only the famous Navaho Wind Talkers have received this prestigious award, and it's only right and proper, Mr. Speaker, that Congress finally recognize all of the Code Talkers that dedicated their service to the United States of America. As an Oklahoman and as the only Native American currently serving in Congress, I am very happy to be here before you today to participate in awarding this honor to these fine individuals and their tribes. 
   Native Americans have a long, complex and honorable relationship with the United States military. Native Americans have fought against and with the United States military throughout the entire history of our country. And despite the often egregious policies of our government towards Indian country, thousands of Native Americans from dozens of tribes have helped protect our homeland. Indeed the first allies of the United States in the Revolution were the Oneida tribe. There was the Seneca present with Grant when he accepted the surrender of Robert E. Lee. As a matter of fact Robert E. Lee called him the only real American present at the ceremony. And of course in the Plains wars in the West, Indians fought on both sides of the conflict. Indeed our first President, General Washington, once commented the only way to defeat Native Americans was to be allied with Native Americans against other Native Americans because they were formidable and elusive foes. 
   Over the course of American history, Native Americans have demonstrated outstanding valor on the battlefield. And they have consistently received awards and commendations for their outstanding service. Historically Native Americans have the highest record of service per capita of any ethnic group or demographic group in our country. There are currently over 190,000 Native American veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation awards the congressional medal to 13 individual tribes whose members assisted in this effort of defending our country. By using Native languages that were unidentifiable to the enemy forces in Europe and in the Pacific, the Code Talkers contributed to the victory of allied powers in both the First and the Second World Wars. Without their efforts it is clear that we would have lost countless additional lives and wars would have dragged on longer than necessary. Though most Native Americans did not even have United States citizenship in the First World War, there were a few. My tribe actually did. And we were pretty good negotiators. And most Oklahoma tribes got theirs a little bit ahead. But most tribes and most members who served in our Armed Forces were not citizens. They volunteered their service to defend their country despite that lack of citizenship. 
   It is estimated that more than 12,000 American Indians and about 600 Oklahoma tribal members served the United States military in the First World War. Despite the fact that most in the United States considered their heritage and their language to be obsolete in the first decade of the 20th century, these individuals volunteered for their country and helped turn the tide in one of the bloodiest wars in human history. 
   In 1917 a group of eight Choctaw serving in the Army's 36th Infantry Division trained to use their language in code. They helped the American Expeditionary Force win several key battles  in the final big push of the war. Other tribes continued to be recruited into the service of our country in later conflicts. Almost immediately after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and the United States entered the Second World War, the Army recruited members of the Comanche Nation, located in my district, to assist the Allied Forces. Throughout the war other tribes were also recruited to carry out these efforts. And throughout that conflict, the Axis powers could neither decipher the codes based on Native language nor significantly undermine efforts to communicate in that language. The use of these languages significantly improved the tactical efforts of the Allied powers. These efforts were certainly remarkable, Mr. Speaker, and the contribution of these men clearly deserves to be recognized by Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, Native American Code Talkers of the First and Second World War are true American heroes without whose efforts our troops would have certainly suffered greater casualties and would have certainly experienced slower progress in their efforts to end these conflicts. For too long our country has failed to recognize the efforts made by these great Native American citizens. It is time that we acknowledge and honor the contributions and service of these Native Americans who dedicated their service to our country by awarding them the Congressional Gold Medal. 
   I urge Members to honor these courageous men and their tribes and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4544.

   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Chairman, I want to associate myself very much with the remarks that my good friend from Oklahoma (Mr. Boren) made and certainly will be supporting his secondary amendment. 
   I also want to tell my good friend from North Carolina that I certainly recognize his motives and his seriousness, because I think it is a serious  issue, and I think he is to be commended for approaching it that way, and thoughtfully, and I know he has done so. 
   But I, too, share the opinion of my friend from Oklahoma that we are acting precipitously here. This is a matter in which, frankly, most of this body is not well informed. There are court cases underway in both the Federal and the tribal systems that ought to be allowed to play out. And if we are going to address this issue, we ought to do so in normal order through the committee fashion. 
   As Mr. Boren so ably pointed out, the unintended, and I know unintended, consequences of this amendment would be to actually deny benefits to people that are currently receiving them. And to begin a process, quite frankly, that has profound implications for everybody in Indian Country and for all tribal governments is one we ought to think about, I think, very, very deeply before we embark on it. But, again, that, in no way, leads me to question the motives of my good friend from North Carolina or the seriousness of the issue he raises. I very much accept that. 
   A final point I want on say on behalf, not on behalf, it is not my place to do that, but certainly I want to recognize that from the Cherokee Nation standpoint, they are the most racially diverse tribe in North America. There are thousands of African American Cherokees. In fact, there is every other race in that particular tribe. They see this as a tribal sovereignty issue. They do not see it as a racial issue. I certainly understand why some of my friends would have a different point of view. But I think, again, the matters involved here are so important and so deep that they deserve full consideration first in the courts and then in an appropriate legislative process in Congress. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to conclude by thanking my friend from Oklahoma for arriving at what I think is a very reasonable surmise. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee and having formerly served on the Rules Committee, I'm both disappointed and disturbed by the manner in which the rule has been reported to the floor. 
   Let's be forthright about this, Madam Speaker. The committee authorized an enormous number of amendments. But numbers alone do not translate into meaningful policy options and good debate on the floor of this body. 
   Let's look at a couple of things that the committee chose not to make in order. The committee did not make in order an amendment by Mr. Akin that addresses important concerns, including the evisceration of the Army's only modernization effort and reducing by $867 million the Future Combat System. 
   The committee did not make in order many of the amendments that were necessary to address the evisceration of our Missile Defense System and that, Madam Speaker, at a time when our intelligence tells us the North Koreans and the Iranians are continuing to develop dangerous missile capability. 
   With respect to the underlying legislation itself, Madam Speaker, Chairman Skelton was given an incredibly difficult job. He was not given enough money, in my opinion, enough authorizing authority to address all the needs that he faced. 
   Nevertheless, he and Ranking Member Hunter and their subcommittee chairmen accomplished some important things that we should not lose sight of. One good thing that was accomplished was the increase in the end strength of both the Army and the Marine Corps, something many of us have long advocated, something the President now agrees to and something I'm glad to see underway. 
   Additionally, the legislation included the Wounded Warriors Act, and also included my language to create a program for pre- and post-deployment neurocognitive assessments of our servicemen. I think that was a very good thing, and I appreciate the chairman for working with us on that. 
   The underlying legislation also addresses depot concerns and maintenance in a way that encourages me, that increased the amount of money in depot accounts. 
   And finally, I was happy to see that the majority continues to recognize, as we do, the importance of developing the non-line-of-sight cannon and remains committed to the new field increase. 
   With that, I still remain disappointed the rule did not allow the options.

   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, though I would have voted ``yea'' on the Internet Tax Freedom Act, it is not the vote I wished to have had. I along with 242 bi-partisan co-sponsors wanted to see the Internet Tax Moratorium made permanent instead of an extension for 7 years. Through negotiations in the House, members were told that the Senate would never agree to anything longer than 4 years. Then, we were forced to vote on a 4-year extension October 16, without the opportunity to add amendments to lengthen the ban--or even make it permanent. 
   Madam Speaker, today we are now voting on a Senate amendment to H.R. 3678, extending the ban for 7 years--3 more years than what we were told the Senate would agree to. Imagine what we could have accomplished had the democrat leadership had listened to the will of 242 members from both sides of the aisle asking to make this ban permanent.

   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Let me say to the gentleman that coming back to the Armed Services Committee from Rules is as close to a resurrection experience that I expect to have on this side of the veil. 
   I am particularly pleased to rise in support of this legislation, H.R. 5658,  the National Defense Authorization Act, and I am particularly pleased that it is named for my good friend and our distinguished colleague, Mr. Hunter, who served our country in so many ways, in uniform, in Congress, and certainly with great distinction and great fairness on both sides with both sides of the aisle as former chairman of our committee. 
   I particularly want to thank our current chairman, Mr. Skelton, who presides so professionally with such personal integrity and so thoughtfully over this important committee, and our staff, which does great work on a bipartisan basis. 
   This committee really does work the way that I think most Americans wish Congress worked, and I think it sets an outstanding example that I wish others would follow. 
   There is very much in this bill, Mr. Chairman, that is excellent. I am particularly pleased with the increase in family support, the focus on additional barracks, the additional money in the research, development, testing, evaluation and procurement accounts, the $70 billion set aside for continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a commitment to address the rest of the needs that our men and women in the field have. When we have forces deployed, whether we agree with the purpose or not, they should never, ever doubt our commitment to seeing that they have everything they need, fully and in a timely fashion, and this committee does its best to do that. 
   But there are some disappointments in this bill as well, Mr. Chairman. I am particularly disappointed, like my friend Mr. Akin, in the cut in the Future Combat System funding of $233 billion from the request that the President sent forward. We are going to regret that on some battlefield in some dangerous place at some point in the future. I am particularly disappointed that we did not in a serious fashion deal with Mr. Saxton's amendment that was offered.

   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am particularly disappointed that we did not deal in a serious fashion in my opinion with Mr. Saxton's amendment, which would have set a baseline of 4 percent of our GNP for future military funding. That is something we know we need to do. We know in this committee on a bipartisan basis that we spend too little. That is a mistake we have made on both sides of the aisle. It is a bipartisan mistake. 
   We cut far too much during the 1990s. History teaches us and our chairman often appropriately lectures us that contingencies will come that we do not understand and do not anticipate, and we know from the bitter lessons of history that if we have not prepared through sustained investment in our military, we can never make up lost ground with hasty and ill-thought out appropriations in the short-term. I wish we had done that. I hope we will do that in the amendment process. 
   But, Mr. Chairman, the perfect cannot be the enemy of the good, and this bill is very, very good and is a product of genuine bipartisan cooperation. So I am very proud to support it and very proud to urge other Members of the Congress to vote for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. I thank my good friend from Michigan for yielding. And I thank him even more for conducting what is an important and enlightening educational experience for the people of our country about the reality of high fuel prices and what is behind it. You do take a little ribbing occasionally if you're from Oklahoma. But we think that is generally jealousy, except from our friends from Texas, who have a very similar view of the world to us. 
   But let me talk a little if I can about what the current state of play is in energy prices. Today as you have had up on your sign, the national average price for a gallon of gasoline is $4.04. That is something I never thought I would live to see, and frankly, no American should have ever lived to see. You can now buy a barrel of light sweet crude for July delivery at $131.31, a nice round number, nice even alliterative number. Currently in my State, Oklahoma's price at the pump, and we are producers, in some ways we will we feel it even worse because we have been producing for over 100 years much more than we consume and exporting it to the rest of the country. And we are delighted to do that. But it is pretty tough when people in Oklahoma, a producing State that sacrificed, that frankly are delighted to have exploration and production, but they are paying $3.83 a gallon. 
   In January of 2007 when this majority, this Democrat majority took office, the price per gallon was $2.08 a gallon. That is a rise of $1.75, an increase of over 80 percent.     
   The country as a whole has experienced very much the same thing. The average price since the Democratic majority has come into power has gone up $1.67, an increase of 71 percent. 
   Now, that is not what our friends on the other side of the aisle expected to happen at all. As a matter of fact, let me read you a few quotes of what they told America as they came into the majority our energy future would be. 
   Our distinguished Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, said on April 18, 2006, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down the skyrocketing gas prices.'' She said a few days later, ``The Democrats have a plan to lower gas prices.'' 
   Our distinguished Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on the 4th of April, 2005, ``Democrats believe that we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with high gas prices.'' I would love to ``struggle'' to pay $2.08 a gallon. It would be a nice fight to have. 
   Our good friend and distinguished whip of the majority party, JIM CLYBURN, said, ``House Democrats have a plan to help curb rising prices.'' That is on the 26th of July, 2006. If this is the plan, we want them to go back to the drawing board and reconsider where they are at. 
   Four times since they have taken the majority they have voted to increase energy taxes; to increase energy taxes. Now, even people that don't like the energy industry can usually say, well, gosh, if you increase the tax, won't they pass that along to us in the price? It is an incredible record. 
   Now, every single energy bill the majority wants to reach the floor has reached the floor. Most of them have passed this body. Some of them have gone all the way to the President and been signed. As I recall, I don't remember anybody who actually vetoed any energy legislation that has actually reached the President's desk. So what we are seeing really is the product of the majority's legislative agenda. 
   What haven't they let come to the floor? What commonsense solutions that most Americans support haven't come to the floor? I am just going to list a few of them, because, as my colleague knows, there are many of them. 
   Our colleague from Texas, MAC THORNBERRY, has a wonderful bill, the No More Excuses Energy Act, H.R. 3089, that literally covers the gambit of things we ought to be doing. Not just oil and gas, but nuclear, solar and wind. It incentivizes production. That is the lesson that our friends on the other side have forgotten, that supply is really important to cost. They simply seem to have no conception of that. 
   There is a wonderful bill by Mr. Pitts of Pennsylvania, H.R. 2279, that will expedite the construction of new refining capacity on closed military installations in the United States. These are installations that have been set aside. They are safe. They are secure. Why in the world wouldn't we want to refine the product? If we have to import it, we at least ought to get the value-added portion of refining it. It is a crime that we should ever import a refined product. 
   Our good friend Mr. Blunt, H.R. 2493, has legislation that removes the fuel blend requirements and government mandates that contribute to unaffordable gas prices. We shouldn't have dozens and dozens of blends of gasoline. A few is enough. 
   Our good friend Mrs. Myrick has H.R. 6108, Outer Continental Shelf Exploration, which grants coastal states the authority to grant exploration up to 100 miles from their coastlines and allows States to share in that revenue. A commonsense solution. 
   None of this legislation, and dozens more, have been allowed to come to the floor. My friends on the other side love to blame Republicans, President Bush  and the energy industry for these kinds of problems. 
   I just want to conclude quickly with a story. I do represent a district that is one of the top 20 energy producers in the United States, so we are more than doing our part. I convened about a year ago, actually before this extraordinary rise in prices, a group of independent energy people that have spent a lifetime trying to provide energy to this country. 
   I asked them, ``Give me your suggestions. What can we do to increase the supply and stabilize and hopefully lower the price of a gallon of gasoline or heating fuel or electricity?'' They thought, and they had a lot of great solutions. 
   They said, ``Let's go drill in ANWR, in Alaska. That would be a wonderful thing.'' By the way, my good friend Mr. Young has a superb piece of legislation on that, H.R. 6107, that would actually allow us to drill there and invest some of the severance revenue in alternative energy supplies so we could both meet an immediate need and start looking for alternatives. 
   But they suggested that. I said, ``Well, you know, I am for that. I voted for that. The Republican majority passed it four times in the House and couldn't get it through the Senate because of Democratic obstruction, so we probably can't get it done.'' 
   Then they said, ``Let's do more exploration and production offshore. We have seen Katrina. That has worked well in terms of no spillage. We know we had 25 percent of our supply in the Gulf of Mexico. We could do more.'' I said, ``Well, I am for that, but we can't do that either.'' 
   Then they asked about additional refining capacity, and they asked about expedited permitting on non-park Federal lands. They just went through a litany of things. Alternative energy. Each one I would say yes, I am for that, but we can't get that through, particularly a Democratic Congress. 
   Finally at the end of this in frustration, one of my good friends said, ``Well, why don't you go back and ask those other Members of Congress who are opposing these measures just how rich they want foreign countries to be? Just how much they want to pay the people overseas that we are importing this petroleum from, or this gas, when we could actually do the production here? Because they are exporting thousands of jobs, billions of dollars, and they are jeopardizing our security.'' 
   Then the guy added in fairness, he said, ``By the way, we are all here giving you suggestions about how to lower the price of the product that we produce.'' 
   We have had a shameful exercise, in my opinion, in the last several days, particularly on the Senate side, where people that work to solve America's energy problems are brought in and interrogated as if they are the source of the problems, and the only frankly justification for that is the high prices. But when those people respond, they say, ``If you would just do the things we have asked you to do year after year after year, we could solve this problem.'' 
   So I am sorry I went on. You have been very generous with your time, and I appreciate that very much. But it is a frustrating problem when the solutions are sitting here waiting to be acted upon by this House and none of them are being dealt with at all.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, some of our Members believe H.R. 986 has significant negative implications on private property in Connecticut. Fuzzy language included in this bill may leave the door open for the Federal Government to use eminent domain to seize private property in this new designation. This is especially concerning because this is the same congressional district where the Kelo v. New Haven case originated. I remind my colleagues that many times the Federal Government uses just the threat of condemnation to frighten private property owners and to intimidate them until they become so-called ``willing sellers.'' We must protect our constituents from this wanton abuse of power by making our intentions clear in this legislation. 
   Resource Committee Republicans made numerous efforts in both subcommittee and full committee to insert language that would have protected property owners in Connecticut. The language was plain and clear: Congress would not empower the Federal Government to condemn land and pressure owners into selling. 
   Unfortunately, these efforts were rebuffed by committee Democrats. It is still unclear to our side of the aisle why the majority wants to expose property owners to the threat of eminent domain. The only reasonable conclusion is that they believe the Federal Government should and must confiscate private property. 
   Because this bill has been brought under suspension of the rules, the minority will not have the opportunity to clean it up before the full House. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill and stand up against this and other Kelo-style assaults on private property rights. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1337. 
   This bill, which I authored, provides for a water feasibility study to ascertain additional sources of water for the Central Oklahoma Master Conservancy District, which serves the cities of Norman, Midwest City, and Del City, Oklahoma. This bill provides limited Federal assistance, with the Conservancy District providing a local 50/50 match and demonstrating their dedication to this critical initiative. This legislation will help address and alleviate the water challenges facing these three cities. I would like to commend and sincerely thank all the parties involved in working hard to help see this bill pass into public law. 
   The primary source of water for the Conservancy District is Lake Thunderbird, completed in 1965 by the Bureau of Reclamation. Incidentally, since 1988 one of the cities serviced by the Conservancy District, Norman, Oklahoma, has on numerous occasions exceeded their annual share of Lake Thunderbird's supplies. As a result, Norman has been forced to pull additional water from its original water source used before Lake Thunderbird was built and create an emergency supply line from  nearby Oklahoma City. Recognizing that the projected demand on water supply will only increase as these three cities grow in population, the Conservancy District is taking proactive steps to find long-range solutions to their water needs. 
   In 2003, working with the Conservancy District and recognizing the water strain in central Oklahoma, Congress provided the Bureau of Reclamation with funding for an initial water study, which it completed in August of 2005. This appraisal explores and proposes much-needed viable opportunities to enhance the current and long-term water supply of the Conservancy District. I introduced H.R. 1337 both at the behest of the Conservancy District and in the same spirit that Congress previously funded the building of Lake Thunderbird and the appraisal investigation: to facilitate the long-term vitality and well-being of the citizens served by the Conservancy District and, as an extension, the vitality and well-being of Oklahoma as a whole. It is important to note, Mr. Speaker, that the Conservancy District provides waters for more than 175,000 residents, meaning that no fewer than one out of every four of my constituents stands to benefit from this study. 
   Mr. Speaker, I sincerely appreciate the chairman and ranking member's diligent work on this bill, and I strongly urge support and passage of H.R. 1337.     
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (NEW MEXICO WATER PLANNING ASSISTANCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1904 and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 1904, introduced by our colleague, HEATHER WILSON, directs the Secretary of the Interior to provide New Mexico with technical assistance and grants for the development of comprehensive State water plans and to assess the quality, quantity and interaction of groundwater and surface water resources in the State.  
   This legislation recognizes that States have primacy over groundwater but provides limited Federal assistance to help the State carry out its efforts and help water consumers. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (LAND GRANT PATENT MODIFICATION -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 2121 is a simple measure that updates a land patent reference to an outdated management plan currently being used by the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society. This 8-acre property was obtained in 1992 from the Department of the Interior under a land grant patent. Under the new resource management plan, the museum will be able to greatly improve its visitor access to wildlife areas and to expand its facilities to accommodate additional shipwreck exhibits. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The majority has adequately explained this resolution. We join with them in recognizing the 63rd anniversary of Big Bend National Park and hope this occasion will further highlight the need to secure our public lands from the ecological devastation caused by unfettered, illegal crossers and drug traffickers. 
   I urge colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2381 and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic bill manager has more than adequately explained this piece of legislation. The House has passed a similar version of this bill in the previous two Congresses. I am certainly happy to see that we are doing so again.

<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this bill because it is the wrong debate at the wrong place at the wrong time; and most importantly, it sends the wrong message. 
   It is the wrong debate because it serves no useful purpose. We know this bill will never become law. If it passes, it will be vetoed, and that veto will be sustained. We are wasting the time and trying the patience of the American people for no useful purpose. 
   It is the wrong place because it is what happens in Iraq, not here, that will determine the outcome of the current struggle. Our forces and those of the Iraqi Government are in a tough fight. We should reinforce them, not undercut them, and we should encourage the Iraqi Government, not abandon it. 
   It is the wrong time because it is too early to debate the outcome of the current effort in Iraq. I have great respect for the author of this bill, but it is General Petraeus's report and assessment that should guide our deliberations in this body. He has asked us to wait until September before he offers us an assessment of the progress and prospects of the current effort. Having given him a tough job, we owe it to him to adhere to the timeline he has requested. 
   It is the wrong message, most importantly, because it strengthens rather than weakens our enemies.     
   They know they cannot defeat our forces, but they can and they do believe they can outlast this Congress. This debate and this bill will only strengthen them in that belief. 
   By strengthening our enemies, we undercut the best efforts of our forces, the forces of Iraq and the Iraqi Government. The best way to undo the damage that this bill has already done is to defeat it, and I urge my colleagues to do so.

<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. I thank the gentleman from Michigan. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the debate over the last 2 days, really dozens and dozens of speeches, and, frankly, speeches of exceptionally high quality on both sides of the issue. I have listened particularly to the speakers who were here in 2002 when the momentous decision to go to war was actually made. Those who were opposed, I have admired because in their opposition in October of 2002 they were taking an unpopular position, but clearly one that they believed in, and I think they deserve our respect for that, even if I don't agree with that particular point of view. 
   Second, I have watched those who voted in favor of that tough decision, and I have watched as they have stuck to that decision because they believe the stakes are so important for the United States. They have done so even when public opinion has turned against their position. And I admire that. 
   Frankly, I have watched speakers who have changed their position, who were first for the war and now are opposed to it. It is easy to deride people in that position. But, quite frankly, I have watched them, and they are anguished in their opinions and their conclusions; they are sensitive, obviously, to the easy and cheap criticism of opportunism. And I particularly admire those, frankly, in my own party who have broken with their President and their party over a position that they believe in deeply. I don't agree with them, but I admire them. 
   What I don't admire is the Democratic leadership that has brought us a resolution which is divisive without being decisive. It orders no action. I have spoken on that at length before, and I am not going to go into it now. I want to instead focus on the issues at stake. 
   Like all of those elected in 2002, 2004, 2006, I was not part of the initial decision to go to war, and, frankly, I often think how fortunate I was to have been spared that responsibility. But, of course, none of us on this floor ever truly escapes responsibility. 
   My attitude toward this conflict reflects that of my district and, frankly, that of my father, who was a career noncommissioned officer in the United States Army. I recall once when he was talking about war, he summed it up pretty simply: When you are in it, win it. 
   That is what I have tried to do with my vote, my voice, my energy, since I have been elected to represent my district. I have done so because, frankly, in some areas I have seen progress. Removing Saddam Hussein from power was a good thing and I am proud that that was accomplished, and it would not have been accomplished without the valor and the professionalism of American men and women in arms. 
   I am pleased to have seen a Constitution formed in Iraq that is the envy of the Arab world. 
   I am proud to have seen three elections take place, all of which had increasingly high participation and had, frankly, higher percentages than vote in our own elections. 
   I was hopeful when I saw a coalition government formed that had Kurds, that had Sunnis, that had Shia, that had other elements in the Iraqi population. 
   I have been impressed with Iraqi forces that do stand and fight. And let's make no mistake about it: Most of the fighting and dying militarily is being done by Iraqis and they deserve our respect for that. 
   And, frankly, I think like all Americans, I was enormously relieved when I see actors like the late al-Zarqawi, people who would kill Americans anywhere, anytime, who are not from Iraq, being sought out with the help of Iraqis and killed far away from our shores. That is important, and that is something we should acknowledge. 
   I have also supported the war because I feared the consequences of defeat in Iraq. And, believe me, there are consequences to losing the war. These are real. 
   If we are not successful in Iraq, we will have an emboldened enemy. Not just the terrorists that we deal with, they are bad enough, but also the states that use terrorism as a tool of diplomacy. States like Iran, states like Syria, will draw comfort. 
   We will have demoralized friends in the region and around the world that wonder whether or not they can really count on us once we make a commitment. 
   We will see the death of an infant democracy, never a good thing for the lovers of freedom. 
   We will see a sectarian bloodbath in Iraq that will result in the death of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Iraqis. 
   And we will see a destabilized region in which the United States has vital interests and to which our own security is intimately tied. 
   I acknowledge that things have not gone in Iraq as I, certainly, and I think everybody, regardless of their position on the issue, would have hoped. There is no question that we underestimated what was required, not to defeat Saddam, frankly, that was done brilliantly, but to secure Iraq. 
   We have underestimated the persistence of and the difficulty the outside players would create for us. We underestimated how anxious people inside Iraq would be to settle old scores instead of to look ahead. And we have underestimated the impact of the divided loyalties of Iraqis themselves, where so often we see sect against sect, ethnicity against ethnicity, tribe against tribe. 
   But these difficulties and mistakes, regrettable as they are, do not change the consequences of losing in Iraq, for the region, for Iraqis, and, most importantly, for ourselves. 
   At this critical point, the President has offered a plan to avert defeat, and, if the Iraqis are up to the task, to turn the tide. It has an American military component, and that is what this resolution deals with. 
   But contrary to what I have heard on the floor, it is not a major escalation in forces. It is not an effort to allow the Iraqis to avoid the fighting. Nor is it an effort to win militarily. It is an effort to buy the time needed to create an environment in Iraq that will allow Iraqis to succeed politically. It will allow them to begin to push toward the reconciliation process and review the de-Baathification program. It will allow them to share power with one another. It will allow provisional elections to take place. It will allow oil revenue to be distributed more equitably. It will allow Iraqi units the time to train, stand up and continue to fight and fight more professionally and proficiently than they have.

<DOCNO>Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. (COMMITTEE FUNDING RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against the rule and the underlying bill as it is currently written. Frankly, my concerns are not about the global warming issue. It is about the ethics issue. 
   As a former member of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, I understand and appreciate the tremendously difficult job that we ask the staff and the members of that committee to face on a daily basis. It is common knowledge in this body that no one wants to serve on the Ethics Committee. It is a responsibility that no one seeks but, frankly, must be handled. 
   I think, frankly, everyone understands that there have been ethical lapses by some of our colleagues in the last few years. That committee has dealt with those lapses as best it could, handling a workload that is unpredictable, and it is by its very nature highly charged and occasionally and unfortunately partisan. 
   To do that job, the last Congress increased the funding for the committee by approximately 40 percent. Even that was probably not enough to handle the job which had been given to us by the House, but it is certainly not enough to deal with the new responsibilities that the majority has chosen to extend to that committee. 
   The majority party ran on a platform of ethics and made it a major issue in the last campaign, and frankly, it passed with strong, bipartisan support an ethics package as the very first act that calls, again, on Members to do more in the committee to supervise and do more. 
   Now the majority party is actually refusing to do what they promised; that is, they are refusing to fund the 41 percent increase in the underlying legislation that their own chairman of the Ethics Committee and the ranking member have jointly requested. 
   We have been able to find millions of dollars to fund the global warming effort, a select committee, a committee, frankly, that has no duties, no responsibilities, no legislative priorities, but it is an important committee, and I recognize the importance of looking at that extremely important issue. At the same time, we will not fund a committee that already has the smallest budget of any standing committee, whose responsibilities we have magnified, compounded and increased greatly. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle again made ethics a major issue in the last campaign, and frankly, they have threatened to make it a major issue in the next campaign. Fair enough. I think everybody should be scrutinized that is privileged to serve in this body, but if you are going to do that, you have to give the committee the financial resources to do the job that it is charged to do, and frankly, you have to provide the Members of this body with the services that they need to avoid inadvertently breaking the rules and becoming the target for political cheap shots, whether they are launched by one side or the other. 
   It is simply irresponsible to the Members of this body. I am not surprised that our friends on the other side of the aisle do not want to yield us some more time to talk about this simply because they are in an indefensible position. 
   Do the right thing: Vote against this hollow rule and give the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct the funding it needs to get its job done.
