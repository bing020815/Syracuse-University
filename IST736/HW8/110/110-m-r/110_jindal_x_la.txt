   Mr. JINDAL. Mr. Chairman, the 2005 hurricane season featured 14 hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the gulf coast and became the most costly natural disaster in U.S. history. The season's hurricanes were responsible for over $100 billion in damage and over 1,800 deaths. Both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated my home State of Louisiana. 
   On August 23, 2005, Hurricane Katrina was nothing more than a mass of organized clouds over the Bahamas, but later that day, the storm quickly intensified and headed toward the U.S. coastline. Late on August 25, the storm made the first landfall just south of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, as a category 1 hurricane. By early in the morning of August 28, Hurricane Katrina's winds reached a remarkable 175 miles per hour, a category 5 storm. Hurricane Katrina seemingly intensified overnight from category 3 to a category 5 hurricane. 
   Just before Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 29, NASA's QuikSCAT satellite mapped the storm's wind speeds. The data from the satellite helped forecasters describe Katrina's dangers in public information bulletins issued just before the storm slamming into New Orleans. Unfortunately, forecasting efforts may be crippled as data from the QuikSCAT satellite will become unavailable as the satellite's lifespan expires. 
   Measuring a storm's intensity and tracking its direction are critical to determining appropriate level of emergency preparedness efforts. Forecasters need alternate methods to measure intensity in order to convey potential storm damage. In addition to space-based monitoring platforms on which hurricane research and forecasting scientists rely, new research is now being conducted by NOAA that will allow forecasters to recognize rapid changes in intensity much more quickly.     
   The National Hurricane Research Initiative has been estimated to have an annual cost of as much as $300 million, but will accelerate and improve measurement of hurricane wind structure. The President's 2008 budget request calls for just $2 million in additional studies aimed at improving hurricane intensity forecasts, an area that the NOAA Administrator claims is one of the agency's key concerns.  
   The amendment that I offer to the appropriations bill would double the President's increase for NOAA's hurricane intensity research. The amendment adds an additional $2 million to improve NOAA's ability to forecast hurricane intensity and to provide better and more usable information for emergency managers and the public. The activities will aid NOAA's operational hurricane forecasters and improve understanding of hurricane intensity and changes in storm structure, especially on the gulf coast where residents are so sensitive about potential evacuations, it would be extremely helpful to have better and more accurate information about intensity as well as the direction of a storm. 
   The offset comes out of salaries and expenses in the General Administration for the Department of Justice. This account received $104.7 million, which is $6.9 million more than last year's funding levels. 
   My amendment will reduce errors in the 48-hour hurricane intensity forecasting. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JINDAL. Mr. Chairman, every summer an environmental phenomenon occurs off the coast of Louisiana, at times covering over 7,000 square miles off the Gulf of Mexico. This dead zone, or hypoxic zone, in the Gulf of Mexico is an expanse of oxygen-depleted waters that cannot sustain most marine life. This hypoxic zone is caused by excessive amounts of nitrogen pollution delivered to the gulf by the Mississippi River. 
   The dead zone has become a serious threat to commercial fishing, shrimping and recreational industries. The gulf produces approximately 40 percent of the United States commercial fish yield. The livelihoods of many thousands of people and their communities are at risk, as is the large marine ecosystem on which they depend. 
   My amendment provides resources to combat the development of hypoxia by directing $2.5 million in additional funding for the Environmental Protection Agency's Gulf of Mexico program. These funds will go to the five Gulf of Mexico coastal States, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, local governments, colleges, interstate agencies, individuals and nonprofit agencies. They are used to develop the techniques and science needed to restore and protect the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem and included projects to develop solutions to the dead zone in the gulf, improve water quality, and restore coastal areas. 
   The Gulf of Mexico program, with a recommended budget of $4.5 million, has again been provided with much less funding than the other great water body programs, for example, the Chesapeake Bay at $30 million, the Great Lakes at $25 million, the Puget Sound at $15 million and the Long Island Sound at $10 million. 
   With the growth of the dead zone and the dramatic loss of coastal wetlands, my amendment will help to make up for this disparity at a time when funding to develop solutions is needed more than ever. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. We must develop the techniques to restore and protect the areas of our gulf coast.

   Mr. JINDAL. Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that shifts funding within the EPA environmental program and management account. 
   Although the rules of the House prevent me from specifying in the amendment where the funding will go, it is my intention to increase by $2.5 million the funding for grants as part of the Environmental Protection Agency's Gulf of Mexico Program. Grants awarded under this program go to the five Gulf of Mexico coastal states (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida), local governments, colleges, interstate agencies, individuals, and nonprofit agencies. They are used to develop the techniques and science needed to restore and protect the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. They have been used for projects working to develop solutions to the dead zone in the Gulf, improve water quality, restore coastal areas, and educate others about findings to allow better informed decision-making. 
   The Gulf of Mexico Program, with a recommended budget of less than $4.5 million, has again been provided with much less funding than the other similar great water body programs. For example, the Committee has provided $30 million to the Chesapeake Bay program, $25 million to the Great Lakes program, and $15 million to the Puget Sound program. My amendment will help to make up for this disparity, at a time when grants to develop solutions in the Gulf are needed more than ever.  
   For example, it is imperative that solutions are found to the Dead Zone problem in the Gulf that are consistent with the economic well-being of the region and our inland states. The dead zone is an area off the Louisiana and Texas coasts in which water contains low amounts of oxygen. It is caused by excessive algal growth. The low oxygen causes fish and shrimp to leave the area, and it kills the marine life that cannot get away. Last year, the dead zone measured over 6,600 square miles, which is about the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined. 
   Another important area where solutions are needed is with restoring our coastal wetlands. Since the 1930s, coastal Louisiana has lost over 1.2 million acres, an area nearly the size of the state of Delaware. This area is critical to fish and wildlife, including endangered species, and to the people of Louisiana. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. The Gulf of Mexico produces approximately 40 percent of the U.S. commercial fish yield, and it provides critical habitats for 75 percent of migratory waterfowl traversing the United States. 
   We must develop the techniques to restore and protect the areas off our Gulf Coast. Increasing the allocations for grants will help to do that.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Jindal). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

<DOCNO>Mr. JINDAL. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JINDAL. I want to thank the chairman and I want to thank Ranking Member Bachus for their contributions to this legislation in trying to ensure that we do the right thing in New Orleans, that things can actually be better, that we do not have to return to the way that things were even before the storms. 
   Prior to hurricanes, thousands of New Orleans residents living in public housing often had to deal with horrific living conditions, poorly maintained units, out-of-control crime, drugs, gangs and more. It was not the living conditions that any human being should have to endure. We must ensure that the residents of Louisiana returning home following the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have access to safe, affordable and quality housing. 
   We now have the opportunity to rebuild a significant portion of our State,  and we must make certain that the mistakes of the past are not repeated. This includes ensuring that our public housing system does not force residents to live in unacceptable conditions, and replacing the old public housing units with safe, habitable and affordable housing for the future. 
   Mixed-income developments have proven to be successful when tried in other States and should be given a chance to succeed in New Orleans. 
   We must also ensure that the poor, elderly or disabled individuals coming back are given the tools that they need to ensure affordable housing opportunities. Our housing system must give individuals a range of affordable choices. We must ensure that our public housing system is not again overwhelmed with drugs and crime, but that it instead serves its intended purpose of aiding those in need of housing assistance with a safe place to live. That is why I am offering this motion to recommit. 
   Building upon the base bill, this motion to recommit gives priority in the awarding of housing units under the bill to individuals who are either employed or residents of households with people who are employed, exceed the number of legally required hours of community service that public housing residents may perform. Third, are individuals who are elderly or disabled. Fourth, who qualify for placement in housing to avoid having their families separated under existing Federal family unification housing rules. 
   The motion to recommit also seeks to ensure that public housing facilities in New Orleans foster a safer living environment for returning families by precluding availability of housing to individuals who have either been convicted of being drug dealers, have been convicted of a sex crime, have been convicted of a crime of domestic violence, or are a direct threat to public safety. This includes allowing a refusal to return if an applicant is a threat to a community through gang membership. Given the fact that New Orleans' murder rate on a per-capita basis now may be the highest in the Nation, I believe this motion to recommit should be supported. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must put the residents of public housing in a position to succeed. Allowing the old system to be put back in place is irresponsible and unacceptable; and especially when you consider the fact that we are in desperate need of workers to help us rebuild our community. We think this motion to recommit deserves every Member's support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. JINDAL. Madam Chairman, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee has funded the Center for Disease Control's Division of Tuberculosis Elimination at $150 million in this bill. Over the past 15 years, funding for this program has been level. There has been no increase in funding for this program since 1993. 
   Madam Chairman, every State and most major cities have TB control programs. Approximately 75 percent of the funds appropriated for this program are used in the States. 
   Funding for this program is critically important because just last year, in 2006, more than 20 of the 50 States had increases in TB cases. My home State of Louisiana, as well as most other States, have a large number of workers who travel the globe to share their expertise. Unlike tourists who stay in hotels in environments where TB exposure does not normally occur, Louisiana's oil and gas workers spend months working and living in environments among the local population where exposure can and does occur. TB exposure in these communities can result in many fatalities. 
   Another key issue for States and cities is the huge number of foreign-born students attending universities in the United States. More than half of the TB cases in the United States stem from foreign-born students who come here on student visas and often return home for summers and holidays, risking exposure in their home country. While risk of exposure is high for these students, their return to universities in the United States with the possibility of a latent TB infection creates the same problem seen in oil and gas workers. 
   If the disease is activated, the number of people exposed is tremendous. The last such case at a Louisiana university exposed 120 contacts in classes as well as in the dorms. 
   At present, there is no mandatory screening of this group, and no vaccine to prevent disease. The Georgia man whose case recently made headlines was exposed while volunteering overseas. As in his case, volunteers or overseas workers can return to the United States with a latent TB infection and activate the spread of this disease in the United States, later exposing family, friends and coworkers. No routine screening is performed, and no effective vaccine is available to prevent the spread of this disease. 
   My amendment is supported by the American Lung Association, American Thoracic Society, National Coalition for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, and the National TB Controllers Association. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. JINDAL. I won't take a lot of time. I just want to make one point. 
   I do thank the gentleman and the chairman for recognizing the good intent behind the amendment. I do want to point out that the offset still leaves in that account more money than what the President requested in his budget. The rationale for offsetting from that account is that, according to the administration there is a duplication of effort between the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, the State Department, USAID, and other agencies. So, even with the offset, we still leave more money in those accounts than the administration itself requested. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. JINDAL. Madam Chairman, the current bill provides $37.2 million for nurse education and retention at level funding from the last fiscal year. 
   Nursing is the Nation's largest health care profession, with an estimated 2.9 million active, licensed registered nurses. However, only 212,927 of these RNs received their licenses after 2000. 
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects there will be approximately 1 million new job openings for registered nurses by 2010. 
   In 1980, 26 percent of RNs were under the age of 30. Today, less than 9 percent of RNs are under the age of 30, with the average nurse being 46.8 years of age. 
   In 2004, the highest level of educational preparation for nurses was 17.5 with a diploma, 33.7 percent had an associate degree, 34 percent had a baccalaureate degree, and 13 percent with a master's or doctoral degree. 
   The number of full-time nursing faculty required to fill this nursing gap is approximately 40,000. Currently, however, there are less than 17,000 full-time nursing faculty in the system. 
   The average age of a nursing professor is 52, and the average age of an associate professor is 49. Retirement accounts for about 25 percent of the decline in nurse faculty. 
   In 2005, 81 percent of accredited nursing schools stated they needed additional faculty. Only 350 to 400 nursing students receive doctoral degrees each year. Given that 52 percent of nursing schools require doctorate degrees as a criterion for professorship, it is imperative to increase the number of student nurses receiving doctoral degrees. 
   Because of the faculty shortage of those both willing and skilled to teach, nursing schools turned away over 30,000 qualified applicants in 2005 and 16,000 in 2004 to entry-level BA nursing programs. 
   Madam Chairman, my amendment directs an additional $37.2 million for nurse education retention, which would double funding from fiscal year 2007 levels. This account targets the education, practice and retention in response to the growing nursing shortage. 
   And in anticipating a potential objection that the amendment doesn't specify this, it will be possible to fund this amount from other accounts while still providing increased funding for other accounts, for example, like Job Corps' construction and renovation or Job Corps administration. In other words, within the underlying bill, it is possible to fund this amount while still providing increases to other accounts. Other accounts have been increased. I simply would like to make sure that we provide additional funding to address the critical nursing shortage that we are facing in our country, to both improve access, improve quality and decrease the cost of our health care. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. JINDAL. The amendment actually increases and reduces funding, so it's more to indicate an intent. But as an example, what I offered as an example was it would be possible to fund this amendment from accounts, for example, from the increase in the Job Corps construction and renovation account, from the Job Corps administration account, from other accounts that have been increased, while still leaving increases in those accounts. 
   So, even though this amendment does not take money from those accounts, it could be funded in that way.

But, for example, the money could come from the Job Corps construction and renovation fund, which is currently funded at $12.9 million above the President's request, from the Job Corps administration fund, which is funded at $28 million above last year's.

   Mr. JINDAL. Absolutely. The amendment doesn't do this. But, for example, $7.9 million could be taken from the Job Corps construction and renovation fund. From the Job Corps administration fund, $14 million could be taken. From the community service employment fund, the remaining funds could be taken. In all three cases, it would actually leave more funding than was there in fiscal year 2007. 
   So, again, the amendment doesn't actually reduce those accounts by those three amounts, but the funding could be provided in that way, still leaving increased funding in those three accounts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JINDAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida for that generous introduction, for yielding time as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have heard now from I think every member of Louisiana's delegation. We have heard from both parties telling you how important this bill is for Louisiana's future. So many of us saw after the disastrous storms of 2005 Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, both storms, so many people wondered wouldn't it have been more effective to have prevented, to have defended against that damage in the first place? Indeed, we heard and recited numbers that are familiar to residents of Louisiana; for example, knowing that every couple of miles of healthy wetlands reduces tidal surges by a foot. We heard, for example, for years there have been projects in the works to raise the levees around New Orleans. We heard, for example, that for years there have been studies after studies on the Morganza-Gulf and other hurricane protection projects. And what we saw that awful year was incredible destruction, incredible loss of life. We also have learned, and we have seen, that every year Louisiana loses 30 miles a year off our coast. That year alone we lost 200 miles off our coast. Many of the Nation's best environmental scientists say that now is the time to act, not just for Louisiana but for America. 
   Louisiana is home to 30 percent of the Nation's fisheries. Thirty percent of the Nation's energy production comes off of Louisiana's coast. Investing in restoring Louisiana's coast is important for the people of Louisiana. But it is also important for the people of the entire country all over the United States. 
   Now, as we rebuild from the storms, I certainly want to thank my colleagues on both sides for their continued support, for their generosity. But that is the reason I stand today, to ask for your continued support by voting to override this veto of this very important piece of legislation. 
   In terms of Louisiana's ongoing recovery, passing the WRDA bill is one of our three top priorities, in addition to full funding of the Road Home program, as well as continued support of offshore revenue sharing so that we can repair our coast, repair our levees, make our people safe. I have heard several colleagues on this House floor, Democrat and Republican, talk about the need to encourage people to come back to south Louisiana and talk about the need to help businesses come back, help hospitals and medical offices open their doors, help schools reopen. Again, we are thankful for the help that has already been provided to make those things possible. More help is needed. 
   But all of that is dependent on making people safe. All of that is dependent on guaranteeing to the people of south Louisiana that they can be safe living and working in their communities. The WRDA bill takes a huge step forward, whether it is the 100-year flood protection authorization for the greater New Orleans area, whether it is the Morganza-Gulf project, whether it is the port projects. These are incredibly important hurricane and flood protection projects. 
   This is a bill long overdue. This House is accustomed to passing a WRDA bill every couple of years. This bill is over 7 years overdue. I would encourage my colleagues to vote to override the veto of this very important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JINDAL. Mr. Chairman, as witnessed in 2005, the response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita was hampered by failure of identifying needs, and delays in delivering support. In preparation for this year's hurricane season, FEMA has engaged each of the 18 hurricane impact States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Territories, in a focused effort to identify strengths and weaknesses in their preparedness capabilities. 
   FEMA used a gap analysis tool that was developed in coordination with the State of New York Emergency Management Office and the New York City Office of Emergency Management. This tool was successful in identifying vulnerabilities in New York, and it is now being implemented to provide FEMA, States, and local governments in the hurricane-prone regions of the country with a snapshot of asset gaps. 
   Although FEMA has not yet released its full analysis, the agency has found significant gaps and shortfalls in hurricane preparedness among the targeted areas.  
   Indeed, according to recent testimony before both the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees, FEMA Administrator David Paulison recognized Louisiana, in particular, as having a fragile state of recovery. He indicated that the State still needs assistance in finding shelter space in adjacent States, ensuring sufficient transportation resources to conduct timely and effective evacuation, positioning commodities, and caring for those with critical medical needs. 
   We are already now several days into the current hurricane season, and there is an urgent need to assist States and local governments in addressing their hurricane preparedness weaknesses. 
   It makes no sense to identify but not address these gaps. My amendment adds $5 million to the Disaster Relief Fund, specifically the Disaster Support Account, to enable FEMA to begin assisting these States and local governments by strengthening their preparedness capabilities. 
   The initiative would build upon a joint effort between State Emergency Management representatives and FEMA regional representatives to understand and bridge potential disaster response asset gaps in the critical area of debris removal, evacuation, sheltering, interim housing, health care facilities, commodity distribution, communications, fuel, or other vulnerabilities intrinsic to those areas. 
   The $5 million would be offset by a reduction in FEMA management and administration. The underlying bill allocates $685 million for this purpose, which is $17 million above the requested amount from the administration. 
   In my State, levees and floodwalls are still under repair and thousands of disaster victims are still housed in temporary travel trailers. Louisiana and other impacted States cannot afford to exacerbate vulnerabilities with shortfalls in emergency planning, communication and supplies. It is imperative that we provide the resources necessary to protect the lives of our citizens. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita demonstrated the awful consequences of not being prepared before the next natural disaster. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. JINDAL. I certainly appreciate the chairman's support. Based on his commitment, I would like to work with him. 
   My concern is in talking to FEMA, they didn't think that funds had been allocated to actually act on the gaps that have been identified. I know that in previous instances, we have used this account, the disaster support account, with the disaster relief fund, we have used that for support activities previously to support disasters; for example, the National Processing Service Center. 
   My intent was to make sure that there was actually funding to act on these gaps. Again in our conversations with FEMA staff, it had been expressed to us they hadn't identified funding to address these gaps. It is not important to me which fund it comes out of. I want to make sure that there is funding and that FEMA understands it is congressional intent for them to actually act on these gaps now that they have been identified.

   Mr. JINDAL. I want to thank the chairwoman, and I want to thank Ranking Member Chabot as well for their working together with me. I especially want to thank the committee for helping me with this legislation and for this underlying bill for all they are trying to do and all they are doing to help the small businesses in Louisiana recover from the 2005 hurricanes. 
   As my colleagues from Louisiana have already pointed out, prior to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, there were an estimated 347,436 small businesses in Louisiana. These businesses created jobs and income for countless families all across the State. More than 65,000 of the new jobs in Louisiana in the past decade were created by small businesses, and in 2004, over 97 percent of the 96,000 Louisiana firms were small businesses. The devastation caused by the 2005 hurricanes is unprecedented, with total losses, both insured and uninsured, approaching $140 billion. According to the United States Chamber of Commerce, over 125,000 businesses were disrupted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. In Louisiana alone, over 81,000 small businesses were damaged or economically impacted, with 18,700 businesses catastrophically destroyed by the storms. 
   As one example, in St. Bernard Parish, one of the Louisiana parishes hardest hit by Hurricane Katrina, only 370 businesses have reopened, far below the total of 1,400 businesses in operation before Katrina. The Nation's small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and when they are devastated by storms like Katrina, Rita and Wilma, we need to do everything possible to help them rebuild and recover. 
   I am offering an amendment today that builds upon a provision in the underlying bill by providing Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma disaster victims with the option of receiving a 4-year deferment period to pay back their disaster loans. Section 204 of the underlying bill extends the deferment period to future disaster victims. My  amendment simply applies this option to those severely affected by the 2005 hurricanes. These cash-strapped small businesses are truly in need of repayment flexibility. 
   My amendment allows the SBA to refinance the existing Katrina, Rita and Wilma disaster loans under identical loans, but with the added option of deferment of up to 4 years after the date on which the initial disbursement was made. This is a revised version of my original amendment that complies with all the budgetary and PAYGO rules. 
   By allowing small businesses that received certain small business loans to defer their repayment on those loans, we are freeing up money for these businesses to use for other purposes, such as rebuilding, expanding or continuing to hire new employees. The importance of small business as the gulf coast continues to rebuild cannot be overstated. It is critical that we help small businesses get up and running again and provide the job opportunities people so desperately need in these impacted areas. 
   I certainly urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Again, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their work on the underlying bill and their work with me on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JINDAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Marquis de La Fayette on the 250th anniversary of his birth. General Lafayette dedicated his life to the creation of democracy in America and France. Revered by many in both the new world and the old, La 
   Fayette became known as the ``Hero of Two Worlds.'' 
   At the age of 19, La Fayette invested his own funds and outfitted a frigate, sailing for America in 1777, where he joined the forces of General George Washington, with whom he established a lifelong friendship. 
   In 1781, the Battle of Yorktown, Virginia was a crucial victory by the combined American and French force led by General George Washington and the Marquis de La Fayette, over the British army commanded by General Lord Charles Cornwallis. The surrender of Cornwallis' army caused the British government to negotiate an end to the American Revolutionary War. 
   In my home state of Louisiana, the Marquis de Lafayette has an enduring legacy by having a leading parish and city named in his honor. Lafayette, Louisiana is one of the fastest growing communities in the South. Lafayette's energy, telecommuncations and agriculture industries are of national importance. 
   The parish of Lafayette Louisiana is the site of a year-long commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the birth of the Marquis de La Fayette throughout 2007. The 2007 commemoration includes exhibitions, festivals, music, conferences and lectures. 
   Known for its unique cuisine, music, outstanding hospitality, Cajun and Creole language and traditions, Lafayette welcomes visitors of all ages to this full year of events devoted to Louisiana's French heritage, and focusing on La Fayette, the ``Hero of Two Wodds.'' 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker I would like to thank Lafayette, Louisiana's City Parish President Joey Durel and his wife Lynne for their leadership of the 2007 commeration. May La Fayette's vision of democracy and freedom we enjoy today--be cherished always.

Appointed in July 1995, Father Calkins has led Mary Queen of Peace through a period of rapid growth and overseen the opening of Mary Queen of Peace Catholic School, which turned 10 years old this past August. 
   We are honored to have Father Calkins with us here today. He has shown remarkable leadership, especially as his parish and as our State has struggled through and is recovering from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I thank him for his dedication, his service to his parish, and to the residents of southeast Louisiana. 
   We welcome Father Calkins as well as the students and their chaperones from Mary Queen of Peace Catholic Church and School.

<DOCNO>Mr. JINDAL. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JINDAL. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Johnson, and Ranking Members Mica and Baker for their excellent work on H.R. 1495. 
   This legislation is critical to the entire country, but for Louisiana in particular it provides much-needed authority and direction for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to design and construct a comprehensive hurricane, flood, and coastal protection program safeguarding hundreds of thousands of lives and tens of billions of dollars in industry and infrastructure vital to our Nation's economy. 
   WRDA specifically allocates approximately $1.2 billion for actions to restore Louisiana's coastal wetlands over the next decade, including a plan for the closure and environmental restoration of the MRGO, the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal Lock, other projects like the Ouachita River levees and the Red River basin and several other projects throughout the State. 
   Among the critical projects included in the WRDA bill is the Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Protection project. This project is the best solution to protecting exposed areas in the bayou region of Louisiana. 
   I am very pleased that the administration softened its stance on Morganza to the Gulf, which will provide essential hurricane protections to those in Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes. When complete, this project will provide category 3 protection for 200,000 citizens and approximately $8 billion of public and private infrastructure. 
   Though I certainly would have preferred an unqualified endorsement for Morganza to the Gulf from the administration, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to ensure that Morganza and other important projects remain intact in the final bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1495.  
   I want to thank again the chairman, and ranking member, Mr. Baker, in particular, for their work on this bill.
