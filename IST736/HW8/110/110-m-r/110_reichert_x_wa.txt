<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, last night, I came to the floor and joined my Democrat colleagues in supporting meaningful ethics reform. As a former law enforcement officer, I understand as well as anyone the need to abide by the strongest ethical guidelines, and I agree with and commend my Democrat colleagues for presenting a rules package that brings much-needed transparency to earmarking process. 
   In the last Congress, I consistently supported greater public disclosure of Federal spending. I will be the first Member of this body to stand up and attach my name to earmark requests and justify the need for the expenditure. The taxpayers in my district and across our Nation deserve to know how the government spends their hard-earned dollars. 
   But I rise against title IV because I cannot stand and support a reform package that irresponsibly attaches a rule known as PAYGO that will almost certainly lead to higher taxes on these same hard-working taxpaying Americans. 
   Tax cuts unequivalently spur economic growth and create jobs. The tax relief Congress enacted in 2003 produced tremendous growth and a record high stock market. These tax cuts created nearly 6 million jobs across the Nation and 88,000 jobs in Washington State alone. 
   Again, I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we need more fiscal discipline. That is why I supported the balanced budget amendment in the last Congress and I hope to work to enact that in this Congress. But the way to reduce the deficit is to rein in spending and cut taxes, which has proven to increase revenue. It is not to raise taxes on families and small businesses, and I fear that this provision will do that. 
   I am deeply disappointed the earmark reform contained in this title was not attached to the ethics reforms that I enthusiastically joined my Democrat colleagues in supporting. While I support the earmark reforms that have been proposed here, I must urge my colleagues to oppose this measure so that we can work together to enact significant earmark reform.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (STOP THE SALE OF MURDERABILIA TO PROTECT THE DIGNITY OF CRIME VICTIMS ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, later today I will introduce legislation, the Stop the Sale of Murderabilia to Protect the Dignity of Crime Victims Act. And I will introduce that legislation with my good friend and former sheriff from Indiana, Congressman Ellsworth. 
   Before coming to Congress, I served 33 years in the King County Sheriff's Office. I have seen the pain on the faces of victims and victims families, unexplainable, unimaginable pain that covers their faces and their families for the rest of their life. 
   And, unfortunately, criminals today who are in our State and Federal prisons are using their fame and notoriety to make a buck. The Internet has become a gateway to an industry coined as ``murderabilia,'' where tangible goods owned and/or created by convicted murderers are sold for their profit. 
   Today, on the National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims, I'm privileged and honored to honor the memory of all victims. And my bill aims to shut down this business.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2642, SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule. Yesterday the Culberson-Reichert-Shays Iraqi reconstruction amendment was offered and subsequently ruled out of order before the Rules Committee. 
   The intent of this amendment was to allow for the recent gains in Iraq to continue and at the same time reduce the burden on American taxpayers. Since April 2003, United States taxpayers have spent more than $46 billion in reconstruction in Iraq. 
   This amendment would have allowed us to begin to reduce American taxpayer dollars going to Iraq for reconstruction. This amendment would have directed that U.S. taxpayer dollars going to Iraq, to come to Iraq in the form of a loan. It would have enabled the Iraqis to still have a steady flow of reconstruction funding should they be unable to draw down their own funds. 
   Now is the time, especially with skyrocketing oil prices, for the Iraqis to stand up and take responsibility for their own reconstruction. In order for the Iraqi Government to stand up their economy, they must take the responsibility, they must bear the costs for reconstruction of their own country, not the American taxpayer. I oppose this rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (SUPPORT FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support this morning of the funding levels included in the State and local law enforcement in H.R. 3093. This legislation reverses a dangerous downward trend in the Community Oriented Policing Services program, the COPS program. 
   Specifically, it increases the COPS budget to $725 million, which is a $183  million increase over last year. It also includes $80 million in additional money for the Byrne grant system. 
   I was the sheriff in Seattle up until 2 1/2 years ago for the last 8 years of my career. I was in law enforcement 33 years. As a sheriff, I used the Byrne Grant funds. I used the COPS money. We worked together with our communities. We worked together with business. We made our communities safe. It is a vital program, a useful program, a necessary program. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot have freedom, we cannot feel safe in our neighborhoods until we know we are safe, until we know our law enforcement is there to protect us. The COPS grant does that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to stand today with my good friend Mr. Etheridge in support of this amendment to the CJS appropriations bill. 
   Nearly 4 years ago the President signed into law the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act. This legislation, which was championed by the author of this amendment Mr. Etheridge, corrected a technicality in how public safety officers' benefits were paid. Specifically, the law allowed for families of those killed in the line of duty, by heart attack or stroke, to claim the benefit. It sounds simple. 
   I didn't have the opportunity to vote for this legislation because at the time I was the sheriff in King County, Seattle, Washington, completing my 33-year law enforcement career. During my time as a police officer, I saw firsthand the pain that a family endures when they lose a loved one. I have lost partners over those 33 years that I was in the Sheriff's Office in Seattle. I know that pain. It doesn't go away. 
   But yet they go out on the street day after day after day, and they put their lives on the line. Their families are standing there with them. Unfortunately, the families, who are dealing with this pain, and who are eligible for this compensation under the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act, are being stalled and denied by our government. 
   It took the Department of Justice almost 3 years just to issue a rule that would dictate how these benefits would be paid. On top of the 3 years, in the last 10 months, since the rule was issued, only 10 claims have been completed favorably, which averages to 1 claim a month. There are approximately 200 claims left, as Mr. Etheridge indicated, still in limbo. 
   I have seen the tears of these families. We just met with three families last week. Through the Federal Government's inaction and complacency, more tears will be shed. 
   This is absolutely unacceptable, outrageous. This amendment is simple. It will double the current funding for the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program. This amendment will take away the excuse that the Department of Justice does not have the people or the resources to process these claims. The issue of taking care of first responders, as I have said, is close to my heart. 
   Let's take care of the families. Let's implement a law that we put into the books years ago. Passage of this amendment will send a strong message to our Nation's first responders that we, the United States Government, truly stand behind them and their families. 
   Please support the Etheridge-Reichert amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, as a former sheriff of King County in Seattle, Washington, and a member of the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus, I am proud to offer this amendment along with my colleague from Connecticut, Congressman Murphy, to provide $5 million to fully fund the Court Training and Improvements Program, offset from the Department of Commerce departmental management salaries and expenses account. 
   The Court Training and Improvements Program enhances our courts' ability to keep victims of domestic and sexual abuse safe and to hold offenders accountable. It was authorized early last year as a part of the Violence Against Women Act but has not yet been funded. Mr. Chairman, this program must be funded. 
   I spent 33 years of my life working in law enforcement, and during that time I walked into many unpredictable domestic violence situations. Responding to a domestic violence call is one of the most dangerous calls a police officer can go to. Domestic violence cases have their own unique challenges, and we in law enforcement have had to learn specific strategies for how to deal with those situations. People are physically and mentally harmed and homes are torn apart. I have seen how domestic and sexual abuse not only affects spouses but the children, the families, and the lives of the entire community. Safe homes and families are the root of a safe society. 
   Statistics show that every year almost 1 million incidents of violence occur against current and former spouses, boyfriends, girl friends, and each year nearly 10 million children are exposed to domestic violence. We need to implement and fund every tool at our disposal to combat this terrible problem. 
   One of the key ways to reduce the impact of domestic violence is to ensure that our justice system has the tools to deal with these cases. Too often lives hang in the balance as judges and court personnel make decisions without an understanding of the dynamics of abuse and violence in relationships. Judges themselves have repeatedly cited a need and a desire for specialized knowledge and judicial education regarding sex offenders and victims. 
   The desperate need for trained judges and court personnel was recently brought to light in the tragic case of Yvette Cade. On the morning of October 10, 2005, Yvette was doused with gasoline and set on fire by her estranged husband while at work here in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. At the time of the attack, she had a protection order out against him, but a judge had dismissed her protection order 3 weeks before, saying she didn't need it. This judge had likened victims of domestic violence to buses that come along all the time. Cade's husband was recently sent to prison for attempted murder. 
   Better-trained judges are essential if we are to keep victims and children alive and hold abusers and rapists accountable for their behavior. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to improve our courts, protect the victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse, prevent future crimes, and ensure that perpetrators are appropriately punished. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (VIOLENT RADICALIZATION AND HOMEGROWN TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1955, the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007. 
   As the ranking member on the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence, I would like to commend, first of all and especially, Chairwoman JANE HARMAN, who has, as the chairman says, Mr. Thompson, really done a lot of work in this area and has been at the forefront of our intelligence community in working to protect our Nation. 
   I also want to thank the full committee chairman, Mr. Thompson of Mississippi, for all his hard work, and our ranking member, Mr. King of New York, who could not be here today. 
   This truly has been a bipartisan effort. It's one of those issues that all of us in this body recognize as so critical to the protection of our citizens and our country. This legislation is focused on addressing the issue of radicalization and homegrown terrorism. While terrorist recruitment and radicalization is a worldwide problem that must be combated globally, the United States cannot afford to simply focus on eliminating terrorists abroad. It is essential that we fully understand the future and the nature of the threat here in the United States from homegrown radicals. 
   In the National Intelligence Estimate on the Terrorist Threat to the U.S. Homeland released in July of this year, the Director of National Intelligence and the National Intelligence Council assess, ``The spread of radical Internet sites, increasingly aggressive anti-U.S. rhetoric and actions, and the growing number of radical, self-generating cells in Western countries indicate that the radical and violent segment of the West's Muslim population is expanding, including in the United States. The arrest and prosecution by U.S. law enforcement of a small number of violent Islamic extremists inside the United States--who are becoming more connected ideologically, virtually, and/or in a physical sense to the global extremist movement--points to the possibility that others may become sufficiently radicalized that they will view the use of violence here as legitimate.'' 
   Because of the freedoms of our society, and the interconnected world we live in, radical ideas spread easily. These ideas can come from overseas or from within the United States. They can come from within prisons inside of isolated religious or ethnic enclaves or on the Internet. These ideas reach people in the privacy of their homes, via the Internet, and can be similarly assessed by vulnerable individuals at schools, libraries and universities. 
   Unfortunately, our freedoms are being abused by individuals whose sole purpose is to destroy our way of life. While we have not seen radicalization to the extent witnessed in other Western countries like the United Kingdom, we have seen homegrown terrorist cells. 
   Prisoners in Sacramento state prison plotted to attack Jewish and U.S. military targets. Radicalized individuals plotted to destroy fuel tanks at JFK Airport in New York and aimed to create carnage at Fort Dix in New Jersey. 
   While clearly law enforcement and intelligence efforts are key to intercepting and interdicting these ideas and thoughts and efforts in our country, we need a strategy to ensure that  violent, radical ideologies are contained. Because of the nature of this threat, it is essential that we understand why individuals become radicalized and what we can do to prevent radical ideologies from taking hold and spreading here in the United States. 
   H.R. 1955 establishes a National Commission on the Prevention of Violent Radicalization and Ideologically Based Violence. The commission incorporates aspects of H.R. 1695, the PREVENT Act, which I introduced earlier this year. The purpose of this national commission would be to proactively get ahead of the radicalization problems so that as a Nation we can combat these radical ideologies before they become widespread within our borders. 
   In addition, H.R. 1955 includes provisions to help us learn from our international partners on how they are trying to prevent radicalization in their own countries. This issue is not new to many countries throughout the world such as the United Kingdom, and I believe it is critical for us to work with our international partners and learn from their past successes and failures.     
   Lastly, this legislation includes provisions that ensure privacy and civil rights are protected for all American citizens. 
   Again, I would like to commend Chairman Harman and Chairman Thompson for working with me and Mr. King on this legislation. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, I just want to reemphasize the words of Chairwoman Harman, who just spoke. This really has been a bipartisan effort; we talk a lot about that on the Hill here. And this committee, working with Ms. Harman has been, indeed, a pleasure, traveling across the country to various locations, holding hearings on this topic. 
   It is important for the American people to know and understand and realize there really is truly a threat here within the borders of the United States of America, and how important it is for all of us to work together because Americans working together keep this country safe and protect the freedoms that we have all enjoyed, for me, 57 years of enjoying the freedoms of this blessed country. And I want the same things for my children and my grandchildren. I want them to enjoy the same freedoms that I've had the opportunities to enjoy. In order for us to do that, both sides of the aisle have to work closely together to make sure that we pass the laws, the legislation that will accomplish that great feat. 
   In reminding the American people what has happened in the past 18 months in this country, the Sears Tower in Chicago in 2006; a New York-New Jersey PATH tunnel in July of 2006; Chicago-area shopping mall, December of 2006; passengers aboard a transatlantic flight from the U.K. to the U.S.; soldiers at Fort Dix in New Jersey; JFK Airport's fueling systems and others, these have been terrorist acts that have been prevented, and we need to continue that effort. Passing this legislation will accomplish that.

   Mr. REICHERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, as a veteran of the United States Air Force Reserve, I am pleased to rise in support of this resolution. It is our responsibility to provide for all of our veterans' needs, whether they are on the front lines of global conflict or in the communities to which they return in civilian life. 
   Our efforts must be proactive in their outreach and comprehensive in their scope. In a few short weeks, I will be holding a veterans resource fair to further assist Washington State veterans to discover new jobs and job training opportunities. I encourage all of my colleagues to conduct similar events in their districts. 
   We must forge partnerships between the public and private sectors to help veterans find jobs. I am proud to work with Labor Ready, the Nation's leading provider of temporary labor to support the creation of thousands of jobs and opportunities for jobs for National Guard members and reservists across this country. 
   This resolution is just one of many measures that we must pass in support of those among us who have made individual sacrifices to preserve our freedom. I hope that we will continue to work together in a bipartisan way to protect and promote meaningful benefits for our veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. I thank the gentlelady for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today as a cosponsor of this resolution to honor our law enforcement officers across this Nation. I was one of the 870,000 sworn law enforcement officers that are on the job today just a couple of years ago, until I came to this House. I have to be honest and confess that my heart still lies with my fellow officers and deputies in the King County Sheriff's Office in Seattle, Washington. 
   I was one of those officers who have been spit on, kicked, called every name that you can think of and maybe some that you can't think of, stabbed, shot at, threatened. All of those things happened in my 33-year career. 
   But I am here today alive and well to talk about those officers that sacrificed their lives. Some of those were my good friends. Two were my partners. One was an academy mate. One was my best friend. Murdered. Shot and killed. 
   Now, just last year the King County Sheriff's Office lost another dedicated law enforcement officer by the name of Steve Cox. Imagine you are Deputy Steve Cox and you are responding to a call on an early Saturday morning back in December. You really don't know what kind of a call you are going to. But then you hear that shots have been fired. Part of your job is to interview every person at the scene, so you start to interview these people. All of a sudden, in the middle of the interview, somebody pulls a gun, and before Deputy Cox could react, he was shot in the head and killed. He left behind a wife and a 1-year-old son. 
   These are things that happen every day on the streets of our great Nation. We owe such a debt of gratitude to the men and women who wear the badge, whether they wear a blue uniform or green, gray or whatever color it might be, who are there to protect us from those people on our streets who choose not to obey the laws of the land. 
   There are four people from the State of Washington who will be added to the memorial this year: Joselito Barber from the Seattle Police Department; Edwanton Thomas from the Brier Police Department; Dick Rhodes from the Kittitas County Sheriff's Office; and Deputy Steve Cox from the King County Sheriff's Office. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you can tell, this is very close to my heart. It should be close to each and every one of us. Every time we see one of the Capitol Hill police officers or the Washington, D.C. police when we are back here, please stop and say thank you for a job well done in putting their lives and their family's lives on the line for us every day.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (SAVING ENERGY THROUGH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Madam Chairman, as we all know, skyrocketing gas prices and the pain they cause is one of the most daunting issues facing this Congress and our Nation. 
   Today in the State of Washington, the price per gallon of regular gas was $4.34, while a month ago it was $4.02 and a year ago it was $3.11 in the State of Washington. It is hard to believe we are now in the position to yearn for the days of $3 gasoline. 
   My constituents are looking for some form of relief, an option to paying outrageous prices to fill up their cars only to sit in gridlock traffic. Mass transit offers relief; however, mass transit does not succeed if the public is not convinced that it is a convenient alternative to driving their cars. 
   The Transportation Research Board studied the accessibility of transit services to suburban commuters, and has identified strategies that improve customer acceptance and the use of transit services. The study found that acceptance and use of transit services are clearly influenced by the availability, convenience, and the cost of commuter parking at rail stations and at park-and-ride lots for commuter buses. 
   Increasing commuter bus park-and-ride availability directly increases transit ridership in these routes. According to Sound Transit, a local transit agency in my district, once parking lots are 80 percent full at commuter bus stations, the public perceives them to be completely full and they continue to drive by, bypassing an opportunity to ease the pain of high gas prices in an environmentally friendly way. 
   Expansion of these facilities incentivizes transit systems and the communities they serve by increasing their suburban park-and-ride lot capacity and increases the use of transit. 
   Like every community, people in the Puget Sound region of Washington State are parking their cars and taking transit more often. In my district alone, the number of people who rode Sound Transit's buses and trains in 2007 increased by nearly six times the nationwide increase. 
   A few bus ride examples. In the first quarter of 2008, the express bus service connecting two suburbs of Seattle, Lynnwood, Washington and Bellevue, Washington, grew by more than 31 percent over the first quarter of 2007. Ridership on Sound Transit service between Everett, Washington and Bellevue, Washington is up 24 percent. And between Federal Way, another suburb of Seattle, and the Microsoft campus in Redmond, it is up 12 percent. Those are some great examples of mass transit working in my district. 
   I urge you to support my amendment. My amendment will simply allow bus park-and-ride lots the same Federal funding as commuter rail park-and-ride lots receive in this bill. 
   Join me in giving Americans a choice on how they go to work, go to the grocery store, or move about town other than painfully paying at the pump to fill up their cars. This amendment will ease congestion, help the environment, and save commuters from high gas prices. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are here to, and I am honored to be here to support H.R. 1284, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2007. It sounds awful cold and mechanical when you rattle it off in that way, but it means a lot to the people who serve this country. 
   I was, as my good friend Mr. Miller said, I was in the Air Force. I served 33 years in the King County Sheriff's Office in Seattle, Washington, and I had friends who were wounded in the line of duty, partners who were wounded, partners who were killed and sacrificed  their lives to protect their communities. I, myself, was nearly mortally wounded in serving our community as a sheriff's deputy. 
   I know what it means to have a community come behind you. I know what it means to have a family stand with you. I know what it means to have your friends, your relatives, and your local government to be there with you. 
   Our veterans deserve to know what that feeling is. They need to know the United States Government and Members of Congress are standing with them. We are soldiers here fighting with them, providing them with the benefits they need, the tools they need, the things they need to do their job, the things they need to do to protect their families, the things they need to have to provide for their families. 
   Two weeks ago I stopped and visited a marine in a Seattle VA hospital. This marine was wounded in the neck with a .22 caliber bullet. I stood in awe at his courage as he lay paralyzed from the waist down, and I asked him what his plans were for the future, and that I was honored to meet him, and sorry that he was wounded in battle. 
   He looked at me and smiled and said, Why feel sorry for me? Don't. I volunteered for this work. I want to protect America. You know what he said his plans for the future was? To go back to Iraq. He said, I will walk again and fight next to my brothers and sisters on the front lines. 
   I met another soldier at Madigan Hospital, the Army hospital in Tacoma, Washington, a soldier who was standing near someone who blew themselves up, a suicide bomber. He is now suffering from a blood viral infection. He has been treated for over a year at Madigan Hospital. I said the same thing to him. I am honored to meet you. What are your plans for the future? 
   He said, I will heal. Don't feel sorry for me. I am going back to fight with my fellow soldiers. 
   This cost-of-living increase seems mechanical to us as we sit here in this House floor. It means a lot to the soldiers that are fighting and dying for this freedom of our citizens, of all of us here today. 
   I am so proud to be here to stand before you and support this legislation. 
   One of the other things that we must do, not only pass legislation that helps them provide for their families and for themselves and their future, you must reach out and make sure that those veterans who are out in our community, 624,000 veterans in the State of Washington, know what benefits are available to them. 
   On March 31, we would hold a veterans fair just across the water from Seattle, Washington, and invite every veteran in the State to be there so they can learn how we can help them and we can honor them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the State of Washington, and I rise in strong opposition to this closed rule. This rule gives the House no opportunity to engage in meaningful debate about this important issue. 
   I am disappointed that the majority did not make in order a substitute amendment I cosponsored to consider the bipartisan legislation that was unanimously approved by the Senate last year. 
   Let me be clear: I strongly support mental health parity. That is precisely why I am so concerned that the bill before us today could derail our efforts to pass mental health parity legislation altogether. 
   While the House bill could reduce access to care for the mentally ill, decrease the affordability for health care coverage, and even close a hospital in my State, the Senate measure represents some of the very best that can come from bipartisan collaboration and compromise. It reflects the interests of mental health advocates and providers while also respecting the rights of States like Washington to enact mental health laws that go beyond the Federal standard. 
   Mr. Speaker, I came to this House, this body, a little over 3 years ago. My previous profession was in law enforcement for 33 years, so I came here in a little bit different way than most Members of the House of Representatives. So today I make the statement not as a Republican but as a citizen of the United States of America. I am standing here today as an American saying that we need to stop the partisan bickering and we need to come together as Democrats and Republicans and we need to address this issue of not having opportunity, not having a voice, to share in the decisions that are being made in this House. It is time that we come together. 
   The Senate bill that passed unanimously needs to be considered on the House floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, today I join my colleagues and friends and the entire State of Washington in mourning the loss of former Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn. She was my predecessor here in the House of Representatives, represented the Eighth District of Washington State. I'm shocked and saddened by the news of her death today, and my condolences go out to the family: her husband, Keith; her children, Bryant, Reagan, and Angus; their wives; and the grandchildren, who meant so much to her. 
   And today as we were on the floor voting, Mr. Speaker, the news was presented to the Members of this body by a good friend, a longtime friend of hers, Doc Hastings is his nickname, from Central Washington. He had known Jennifer for over 30 years. And as Doc Hastings announced the news of her unexpected death, you could hear the sadness. You could hear the sadness. You could hear the gasp as the air went out of this room. 
   Jennifer Dunn served this House for 12 years. She was a well-respected Member of this body. She was in leadership in the Republican Party, one of the first females in leadership in this House. She was one of those Members who reached across the aisle; who worked with all; who had a dedicated, compassionate drive to represent the people of the Eighth District. She served with passion and the heart of a servant. 
   I first met Jennifer Dunn back in 1997 as I became the first elected sheriff in King County, Seattle, Washington. And I had the opportunity to travel back and forth between Washington State and Washington, D.C. to meet with our delegation. And Jennifer Dunn was always so gracious in allowing me time as the sheriff to come in and present the issues that were facing us in King County law enforcement. 
   She was very proud of the fact that she helped start the school resource officer program with grant funds. She was very proud of the fact that she helped acquire funding for the so important fight against methamphet-Ðamines that really are the scourge of this Nation today. She helped plant the seed of an effort in Washington State that still goes on today in the form of the Washington State Meth Initiative, people meeting today, deciding how to spend the money the Federal Government still provides as a result of her efforts in fighting the deadly addiction that meth causes in our communities.  
   But one of the things that she was most proud of was her effort in passing legislation that led to the Amber Alert system that we have throughout this Nation that, as everyone knows across this country, has saved many lives, lives of our children, our most vulnerable of citizens and victims. 
   So I am so honored and so proud to be the person who has been given the privilege to follow in such a great lady's footsteps. 
   Jennifer Dunn, we will all miss you. Our prayers and thoughts go with the family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, as a former member of the Air Force Reserve, I am pleased to rise in support of this important veterans outreach measure. We must continue to ensure that all of our veterans are aware of and receive the benefits that they have earned and deserve. These grants will help our states connect veterans with the many benefits for which they are eligible but may be unaware are available to them. 
   But it is not just our states' responsibility to conduct this outreach, and I encourage all of my colleagues in the House to use the privilege of our offices to help veterans obtain needed benefits and services. In March, I held a Veterans' Resource Fair in my district. I brought 45 service providers together under one roof to help more than 350 veterans register for benefits, find jobs, and resolve pressing case work issues. I will hold another in just a few months time. My office stands ready to assist any one of you in conducting a similar event for the veterans in your district. 
   We must work to support the men and women who made individual sacrifices to preserve our freedom not just on Memorial Day, but on all days. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, and I hope that we will continue to join together to promote and protect meaningful benefits for our veterans. I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment to fully fund ICE's request of $26.4 million for its 287(g) program. Let's just get down to sort of the cop's nitty gritty here. 
   Just 2 1/2 years ago, I left the King County Sheriff's Office as the sheriff in Seattle, Washington, an 1,100-employee organization with a $110 million budget. I started in 1972 as a 21-year-old police officer in a patrol car for about 5 years. I worked in the jail, and I worked as a property crimes detective, and for the most part of my career, I was a homicide investigator. I worked with all kinds of communities. 
   All the different diverse communities that we serve across this Nation exist in King County, Seattle, Washington. I understand the theory of the Community Oriented Policing program. We implemented that program in the King County Sheriff's Office. It is one of those programs that really comes natural to a police officer working on the streets in their patrol car. They want to connect with their community. They want to be friends with their community, as mentioned earlier by my colleague across the aisle. 
   Part of the Community Oriented Policing program is to make friends and engage in conversation and build relationships, but it is also our job as law enforcement officers, local law enforcement officers across this Nation, to enforce the law. Sometimes we make friends doing that. We save lives doing that. But sometimes we make enemies. 
   In the process of making friends and making enemies and protecting our neighborhoods, we also build partnerships with those communities, but we also build partnerships beyond that. We build partnerships with the Federal Government. We build partnerships with the FBI, with the U.S. Attorney's Office, with DEA, with ICE, with Border Patrol. I could go on and on and on with the Federal agencies that join in concert, in partnership, with local law enforcement every day. 
   In Federal task force organizations, like the Joint Analytical Centers, the Joint Terrorism Task Forces, the HIDTA, High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas, the Violent Offenders Task Force, the VICAP Program, and I could go on and on and on with Federal agencies and Federal programs and Federal task forces that come together; it is about partnerships between local law enforcement and Federal law enforcement. And it is about training, joint training, with each of these agencies so that we can get our job done, that we can protect this country. 
   I understand that. I worked as a partner with the Federal agencies when I wore a police uniform on the street. I worked with as a partner with Federal agencies as I wore my suit and tie and my uniform as the sheriff for 8 years in King County. These partnerships are essential. They create a seamless web, a seamless web of sharing information across all spectrums of the Federal, local, State law enforcement. 
   There is no undermining of the local police department when partnerships are created with the Federal Government. It is an uplifting and exciting experience to work with all of these agencies and train together to finally learn what each one of us does and what we can bring to the table as a team as we protect our country. 
   So Homeland Security now, as a fairly new agency with 22 departments, is another one of those agencies that we have to work with, and ICE is one of those. 
   This training program creates an understanding. It helps police officers understand and respect civil liberties. It helps police officers understand and respect civil rights. It helps police officers at the local level in training with the Federal Government understand and respect the diverse communities that we serve. Why would we not want to have our local police officers participate in training that helps give us a broader understanding of the diverse community we serve? 
   It makes no sense to me to be against increasing this budget to what ICE has asked for. It makes no sense at all. If we are truly interested in civil liberty, civil rights and respecting each other's diversity, we would want this training. 
   Let's make a point clear: This is voluntary. This isn't mandated by the government. Every police department and Sheriff's office across the country can volunteer for this program. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, this is a great program. I commend the gentlewoman from Virginia for bringing this forward. I fully support this amendment, and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of it.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, as the ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence, I rise today to offer an amendment that would restore a cut to the Department of Homeland Security's intelligence function. 
   This bill cuts the analysis and security's intelligence functions. This bill cuts $8 million from that account from last year, and this bill cuts the analysis and operations account by $8 million from last year, and is $23 million below the administration's request. 
   I simply do not understand why we would be cutting the intelligence funding. Let's be clear about this. Intelligence is what we use to prevent terrorist attacks. Good intelligence helped prevent the recent plots against Fort Dix and against John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. The Department of Homeland Security intelligence had a role in both of these cases, and, in fact, in the JFK plot the Department of Homeland Security was sharing classified intelligence with the private sector for more than a year before the threat was made public. 
   My amendment attempts to strike an appropriate balance between response, recovery and prevention. This legislation, in its current form, includes cuts to intelligence and yet significantly increases response and recovery programs. 
   While all are important to homeland security, I think we can all agree that it is better to prevent a terrorist attack than be forced to respond to one. According to the Department of Homeland Security, this bill would reduce the Department of Homeland Security's intelligence support for border security, terrorist travel, and human smuggling. It would severely impact the Department's ability to assess these threats, and would harm their efforts to focus on homegrown terrorism and violent extremism within the United States. 
   My amendment simply adds $10 million for analysis operations to that account to help restore the Department's intelligence functions. This would eliminate the cut and provide a modest $2 million increase from last year. 
   The terrorists only have to be right once, but to defend ourselves, we have to be right every time. Intelligence is the most sound investment we can make as a Nation to prevent terrorism. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding. 
   I want to just respond to a couple of points that were made. Part of this budget is classified, and we can say one thing, though, in open session, and that is that the Department of Homeland Security disagrees with your assessment. For instance, your report states that the Office of Operations and Coordination has significant unobligated balances. According to the Department of Homeland Security, as of June 7 of this year, OPS has obligated 63 percent of fiscal year 2007's funding and 99.9 percent of fiscal year 2006 carry-over funding. 
   So let's just be real about this bill. If you are serious about intelligence, why are we cutting it by $8 million over last year's budget, $23 million over the suggested administration's budget? 
   This is what it does: It will reduce our ability to deploy personnel to the southwest and northern borders to support border enforcement efforts. It will reduce our ability to identify and assess threats to the security of the Nation's land, air, and sea borders. It will reduce our ability to analyze the threat of homegrown terrorism and domestic terrorism. It will reduce our ability to provide an alternative perspective to terrorist threats. It will reduce our ability to collect intelligence and support those intelligence owners and operators of the Nation's critical infrastructure. And it will reduce our ability to analyze terrorist travel trends and methods. 
   I have 33 years of law enforcement experience in the Seattle area, was the sheriff of Seattle before I came here, now serving in my second term in Congress. I understand the balance between response and prevention. I understand the balance of civil liberties and protection of the public against criminal activity. I understand the balance there. This bill puts this balance way out of whack. 
   One million dollars taken from management in the Secretary's office, $11 million taken from the Under Secretary's office. They still receive a $79 million increase. The committee's recommendation in this report remains intact; therefore, civil liberty funding and privacy, counternarcotics funding levels remain intact. They are not part of our offsets. Also not a part of our offset is CBC.

   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the decision made by the United States Air Force to choose a foreign company for their new refueling tanker. The recent Air Force decision to give the KC-X tanker contract to Airbus jeopardizes our national security. We should not send a contract that could potentially be worth more than $40 billion to a foreign company when we have a viable American option. 
   Additionally, Airbus is a company that receives European government subsidies. Boeing, with the support of the government, is currently fighting Airbus at the World Trade Organization on the basis that they have an unfair advantage from these subsidies. What message does this send when our own government is fighting these subsidies on one hand and rewarding them with a $40 billion contract on the other? 
   The Tacoma News Tribune recently said, ``The Air Force's job was to make a business decision. Now Congress has to make a policy decision, and there's room for legitimate debate.'' Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly agree.

   Mr. REICHERT. Madam Chairman, as the former sheriff of King County in Seattle, Washington, and the cochairman of the Congressional Children's Health Care Caucus, I am proud to offer this amendment supporting emergency medical services for children. 
   I am pleased to be joined in offering this amendment by Congressman Matheson, and to have the support of Congressman King from New York, both of whom have been outstanding leaders on this issue. 
   Our amendment will provide $2.5 million in additional resources for emergency medical services for children's programs offset from the Department of Labor's General Administrative Account. This vital program provides grants to States and medical institutions, to expand and improve emergency care for children who need treatment for life-threatening illnesses or injuries. 
   This modest funding increase will help a program that has been nearly level funded for the past 6 years. It will better serve those who provide emergency care for our children. 
   Children, as everyone knows, are not small adults. The illnesses and injuries that bring them into emergency rooms vary significantly, and they often need equipment that is smaller than what is used for adults, and medication in much more carefully calculated doses.     
   Although children account for 30 million annual visits to the emergency rooms, many hospitals and emergency management agencies are not well equipped to handle these patients. According to the Centers for Disease Control, only 6 percent of the United States emergency departments have all the supplies they need to handle pediatric emergencies. 
   Emergency Medical Services grants have been awarded to all 50 States, the District of Columbia and five territories. They have been used to train first responders to buy pediatric equipment for hospitals and to establish and improve standards for emergency care for children. Other grants have been used to create pediatric treatment guides for school nurses to test best practices and to incorporate pediatric care into State disaster plans. 
   Madam Chairman, this is a simple amendment with a significant impact on emergency care for our children. I urge all my colleagues to join in supporting this important measure. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 691, which commends the Wings Over Houston Airshow for its contribution to the appreciation, understanding, and the future of the United States Armed Forces, the City of Houston, and Ellington Field. 
   Mr. Speaker, for 23 years, the Wings Over Houston Airshow has been delighting aviation enthusiasts and future pilots from around the world with spectacular flying in the skies, and with historical and educational displays on the ground in Ellington Field. 
   This top-rated aviation event, which is sponsored by the all-volunteer Gulf Coast Wing and West Houston Squadron of the Commemorative Air Force, honors the spirit of the courageous and valiant American military flyers of the past and those who take to the skies today to ensure our Nation's freedoms. 
   The Wings Over Houston Airshow showcases the United States Air Force, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard, and increases the awareness and appreciation for active duty members and the veterans of our Armed Forces. 
   But more important than the air show's entertainment, the Wings Over Houston Airshow has awarded $10,000 to $15,000 in scholarships per year to students who are pursuing an education in aviation and in aerospace. In total, this organization has provided over $100,000 to young men and women who have entered into careers in both military and civilian aviation. 
   The Wings Over Houston Airshow celebrates America's aviation and aerospace history and the courageous military pilots whose sacrifices have ensured our freedom. I am confident that the Wings Over Houston Airshow will continue to ignite the enthusiasm for flying in future generations of American aviators. 
   I strongly urge all Members to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 640, as amended, a resolution that honors the sacrifices and commitments of the men, women and families of the United States Transportation Command. U.S. TRANSCOM was established in 1987 as one of the nine U.S. unified commands. TRANSCOM is tasked with coordination of people and transportation assets to allow our country to sustain forces whenever, wherever and for as long as they are needed. The men, women and families of TRANSCOM have done an extraordinary job of supporting this Nation and our national defense over the past 20 years. 
   I would like to take a moment to share a story with you that exemplifies the incredible capabilities of this unique organization. On an early morning in July, one of our sergeants was on a raid in Baghdad and found himself the victim of a brutal attack that resulted in a severe head injury. The soldier was immediately transported to Balad Air Base in Iraq for treatment. The wonderful people at the 332nd expeditionary medical group, whom I met on a recent trip to Iraq, examined this wounded soldier and determined that he needed to be quickly returned to the United States for a level of care that they could not provide in the field. 
   This is the point where the amazing men and women of the U.S. TRANSCOM went into action. A C-17 crew was just getting ready to start their day making normal cargo runs around the theater. As they arrived for duty, they were told of the wounded soldier. They immediately began planning the mission to get him the critical care that he needed. While U.S. TRANSCOM deals with urgent requests almost daily, this one was different. The C-17 crew was notified that due to the nature of the sergeant's head injury, they would have to keep the cabin pressure no higher than 4,000 feet on the flight home. They were also told, by the way, that it wouldn't be prudent to land anywhere on their trip as the pressure changes from climbing and descending could trigger bleeding and the patient would possibly lose his life. In order to make the flight home at a lower than normal altitude, the C-17 would need to be refueled twice along the way. The folks at U.S. TRANSCOM coordinated for the air refueling support over Turkey and England. As the flight was en route, this refueling took place. The extraordinary skills and capabilities of U.S. TRANSCOM personnel brought that flight safely to the ground at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, in record time. The wounded soldier was under the care of a neurosurgeon at Bethesda less than 24 hours from the moment of attack. 
   Now, that miracle is pretty impressive. But there are a few other details that you should know about this story. First of all, the C-17 was a McChord Air Force Base, Washington, airplane, where I happen to serve. It was flown by an active duty crew from Charleston Air Force Base. The doctor who cared for the patient while in flight is a reservist from Langley Air Force Base. The nurse is also a reservist, but he is from MacDill Air Force Base in Florida. The rest of the critical care team is a part of the Air National Guard. The entire mission, Mr. Speaker, was being controlled from Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, by the Tanker Airlift Control Center. That is what U.S. TRANSCOM is all about, bringing together the mobility assets needed to support our war fighters to the medical service that they need. 
   This is why I am proud to support H.R. 640. The men, women and families of U.S. TRANSCOM have served this Nation well. As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of U.S. TRANSCOM today, let's send them a strong message and support this legislation.

This elite fighting team and force traces its beginning to the Navy's World War II  frogman training facility in Fort Pierce, Florida, where this museum is located. During World War II, the Navy trained thousands of volunteers as combat demolition and underwater demolition experts at Fort Pierce. The brave men who mastered these difficult and dangerous skills set the standard for today's SEALs to attain.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support our troops wholeheartedly and without reservation, but I cannot support a resolution that simply opposes a new strategy without offering any alternative plan to win. There is too much at stake.     
   Let us just think about where we are today as a country, about the global war we are in with people with intent to kill Americans and how that affects our strategy in Iraq. When considering this, we must consider our Nation's history and other difficult times of war. 
   There have been many bleak moments in America's history, battles we have been engaged in where American victory was far from certain. 
   In 1942, hell bent on dominating the world with his ideology, Adolph Hitler and the Third Reich systematically marched through Europe, taking the most basic freedoms from the Jewish people and killing millions. The United States entered World War II reluctantly and we were not ready for the hurdles we faced. 
   Don't forget, there were times when victory was far from certain. The outlook was grim. Many Americans and Europeans alive today can remember how bleak those times were as the war drug on and on and on. But we didn't give up. We persevered, because we knew there was too much at stake. 
   Eighty years before World War II, in 1862, President Lincoln faced a war that most believed could not be won. He faced vocal and unrelenting criticism for his resolve to win the Civil War. When the war began, Lincoln called for 74,000 troops for 90 days; 74,000 troops for 90 days. And history has showed us that Lincoln greatly underestimated the resources needed, because, as we know, over 620,000 soldiers were killed during that war. 
   At a time in our history when it might have been politically expedient to win the Civil War without first achieving victory, President Lincoln pressed on, constantly seeking a new strategy, until he found one that worked because so much was at stake. 
   Perhaps some of the resolve Lincoln displayed came from lessons he learned 15 years earlier when he entered a smaller battle. In 1848, Abraham Lincoln was an often criticized young  freshman Member of this body, the House of Representatives, and was facing a difficult point in his career. Lincoln criticized the reasons President Polk gave for getting us into the Mexican-American War, a war that began before Lincoln came to office, a position that I can identify with today as I stand here. 
   Then-Congressman Lincoln voted for a resolution that stated the Mexican-American War was ``unnecessarily and unconstitutionally'' initiated by President Polk. Lincoln thought the war was nothing more than a political move to grab land from the Mexican people. 
   My friends, it is legitimate and in fact our duty to question the reasons why our country goes to war, and Abraham Lincoln showed us that. However, he also showed us something else. Abraham Lincoln made an incredibly important distinction that we can learn from today.

   I am very pleased that part of the language that I have been working on, along with other friends here in the House of Representatives, works to make sure that our returning veterans have a job, make sure that their families are taken care of. 
   I was in the Air Force Reserve for 6 years. That was a long time ago. I was never called to active duty. I worked for the sheriff's office then, and even back in the early 1970s, as I served our country in the Air Force and served our community on the streets as a police officer, I never had to worry when I served my one weekend a month or my 2 weeks every year that my employer would get upset with me and say, You know what, we can't support you here as you support our country and our troops across the world serving our country; we need you here every day. In fact, it was just the opposite. The sheriff's office said, We are proud to have you as a member of the Air Force Reserve. We are proud to have you come back and serve with us and have you continue to serve in the Air Force Reserve. And when I became sheriff later on in 1997, and after 2001, still serving as the sheriff in King County, we made sure that our Guard and Reserves had a job. 
   And I could see it in the eyes of their spouses and their children and the rest of their family, because they felt loved, they felt cared for, they felt comfortable to know that when their loved one returned, they had a job. 
   Imagine for a moment that you started a family, you started a business, you have employment, you have a profession, and all of a sudden it is taken away. When you return, it is gone. Your family has no job. You have no income. You are looking at maybe selling your house, selling your car. Health insurance might not be available. All of these things are things that our veterans in the last few years had to deal with upon their return. This bill fixes that. 
   We are able to help them make sure that they have employment when they return from serving our country and keeping us free. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. What an honor it is to be here again today to speak on behalf of our veterans across the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Kind motion to instruct conferees and the need for increased conservation funding in the farm bill. 
   Our farmers are eager to share in the cost of protecting our environment, but currently two out of three farmers are turned away by the USDA due to insufficient funding when they apply to participate in conservation programs. As a result, we continue to lose thousands of acres of valuable farmland, grasslands, wetlands, and private forest lands. We also fall further behind schedule in our efforts to clean up rivers, lakes and streams. 
   We cannot and should not ask farmers to choose between their bottom line and smart, sensible preservation of the land they protect. The House-passed version of the farm bill contained a landmark increase of $5.7 billion in authorized conservation funding. This money supports programs that protect our most sensitive and ecologically important lands, keeps soil and nutrient pollution out of our rivers, lakes and streams, and safeguards wetlands. 
   Since the conference committee is weighing various priorities as they try to bring the farm bill process to a close, it is important they know that Members of this House feel that conservation should be at the top of the priority list and that we maintain what the House has already passed. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this motion and to support the inclusion of the necessary conservation funding in this farm bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I support the troops wholeheartedly and without reservation, but I cannot support a resolution that simply opposes a new strategy without offering an alternative plan to win. There is too much at stake. 
   Many of you know that I was a cop in the Seattle area for 33 years. I was the sheriff for 8 years. And as the sheriff I had an opportunity to attend a remarkable ceremony. Every year a group of naturalized American citizens gathered to remember the circumstances of their arrival in the United States. 
   The group is comprised of police officers from Vietnam, men that fought side by the side with our American soldiers. These Vietnamese officers assumed the greatest risks, risking their lives and endangering their families, to join the United States in their fight for freedom. 
   When the United States pulled out of Vietnam, there were dire consequences for these brave men who risked everything to fight for the United States. The officers were rounded up. Some were imprisoned for 15 years or more and some were executed. 
   Those who managed to flee and escape death made their way to the United States. They left everything in Vietnam, and made new lives in the United States. And they were able to enjoy the freedoms that they had fought for, but not in the country that they had hoped for. 
   Let me just take a moment to set the stage for this ceremony. As the sheriff, I sat down at a round table with many of these Vietnamese soldiers and police officers. They came in their uniforms that they brought along with them, those that were able to escape, those that spent 15 to 17 years in a prison camp where they were beaten, where they were tortured, where they lost their freedom. They lost their dignity, but they never gave up hope. 
   When they came here to the United States of America and they come together on this evening to celebrate their freedom, and the American flag is brought into that room, those men stand at attention and they salute. But you know what else they do? They cry. When the American flag is brought in, they cry because they lost their freedom. But now they know what it is like to have it back. It is a dramatic scene. 
   If we leave too soon in Iraq, what happened to these Vietnamese officers could certainly happen to those Iraqi soldiers who bravely fought side by side with our troops today. I don't use this example as a way of comparing this conflict with Vietnam, as some have done. I believe that the two wars are very different. I use it because it could happen again. 
   I never want to attend an event where former Iraqi soldiers are attending a similar ceremony. The fact is that we are engaged in a global war with people intent on killing us, killing Americans. And regardless of how we got into Iraq, Iraq is now the central front of this war. 
   I understand that there are many who think we should not have entered Iraq. We now know there was faulty intelligence that led us into Iraq and to make that decision. But the war is upon us nonetheless. I am elected to deal with what is happening now. 
   The consequences of declaring an end to the war in Iraq without victory would be felt for decades. Our enemies around the world would be emboldened. Iran and al Qaeda would declare victory. Our allies in Iraq would certainly face bloodshed and our allies around the world would question our resolve to help protect them. 
   Our troops are clear about their dedication to their mission; they want to succeed. American soldiers dutifully responded when we asked them to go to Iraq and oust a dictator, establish an infrastructure, and train the Iraqis so that they are able to protect themselves. 
   Now we must do what the troops have asked of us. They have given us their service, and in too many cases they have given us their lives. We must give them the opportunity for victory. 
   Our current strategy in Iraq is failing. And yet failure is not an option, not only for the United States' security, but also for the security of the Iraqi soldiers and police officers that still fight today, side by side with our troops. 
   In November the American people told us that they wanted a new strategy, not because they wanted to lose, but because they want to win. And now we have a new strategy before us. Is this new plan going to work? I don't know. No one in this body that will vote on this resolution, this nonbinding resolution, knows whether or not this plan will work. 
   But what I do know is that we first must find a way to achieve victory. And simply saying ``no'' to a plan without offering an alternative won't work, and it sends a terrible message to our enemies and to our soldiers. This is an historic war. America is engaged in a war for our freedom on a scale that we have never experienced before. 
   I understand the dissension, the questions, and the uncertainty. I understand the cost is high and the way is unclear. As a cop, I have lost partners, I have lost friends in the line of duty. I know the pain that causes. I understand the loss. It is sad. It is tragic, and you never forget. But we must remain focused, ladies and gentlemen. Please don't let those sacrifices be in vain. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this resolution and let us send a message to our enemies and our troops alike, we will always support our young men and women who put their lives on the line for freedom and  that we will give them what it takes to succeed in the missions that we have given them.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (INDUSTRIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3775, the Industrial Energy Efficiency Research and Development Act of 2007, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The industrial sector of our economy is currently the largest user of energy. According to the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, the industrial sector consumed 32 percent of the Nation's energy in 2006. While the industrial sector has made impressive efficiency gains since 1980, more is needed and more can be done. 
   The Department of Energy currently runs the Industrial Technology Programs, ITP, whose mission it is to improve the energy intensity of the United States industrial sector, whose industries include aluminum, chemicals, forest products, glass, metal casting, mining, petroleum refining and steel. The ITP program engages in partnerships with industry to conduct research and development into energy efficiency technologies, as well as demonstrating those technologies and transferring them to the marketplace. The program has been very successful in its efforts with over 140 projects reaching the commercial market. 
   The ITP also conducts energy assessments, to help industrial manufacturers of all sizes, through both its Save Energy Now and university-based Industrial Assessment Centers, IACs. The Save Energy Now program completed 265 assessments that identified energy savings of more than $585 million per year. 
   The IACs serve a dual role, aiding small and medium-sized business to reduce their energy costs and the training of university students who will take the efficiency knowledge they have learned and apply it in the workforce. 
   The bill before us today will ensure that ITP's beneficial work will continue to help the industrial sector reduce its cost, which not only helps them remain globally competitive while allowing them to keep their operations in the United States of America. Further, the ITP aids our country's goal of reducing our dependence on foreign sources of energy by improving this critical sector's use of energy. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CHEMISTRY WEEK -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 751, supporting the goals and ideals of National Chemistry Week, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   This year marks the 20th anniversary of National Chemistry Week, a concept that was first introduced in 1987 by the American Chemical Society to educate Americans about the contribution chemists and chemistry have made to our society. We first celebrated National Chemistry Day on November 6, 1987, with a parade in Washington, D.C. Because of the overwhelming enthusiasm for the day, 2 years later the  concept was expanded to celebrate National Chemistry Week. 
   The National Chemistry Week program is designed to reach out to the public, especially elementary and secondary school children, to foster an appreciation for chemistry. The theme of this year's celebration is, ``The Many Faces of Chemistry,'' which is designed to educate the public on the many different types of careers in chemistry and the many different ways chemistry has contributed to our society. 
   As a part of the activities for this week, the American Chemical Society has chosen to honor chemists working in the fields of biosensors, cosmetics, food, nutrition, dye, materials, natural products, and environmental processes, as well as chemists who work as teachers. These varied fields contribute to our society on a daily basis. 
   For instance, biosensors may be used to test air quality, drinking water quality, help dentists find cavities, and test for biological and chemical weapons. Material chemists may work on ways to help make new products that are less harmful to the environment, such as making threads and plastic out of renewable biological materials. Nutritional chemists may develop products that contain more vitamins and minerals in an effort to make people healthier and fight malnutrition throughout the world. 
   National Chemistry Week is intended to honor all of these contributions, as well as encourage our Nation's schools to cultivate the finest scientists, engineers and technicians from every background to ensure we remain globally competitive. 
   This week, more than 10,000 National Chemistry Week volunteers from industry, government, and academia will reach out to educate millions of children across the country. I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring them and these activities through the passage of this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3776, the Energy Storage Technology Advancement Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Electricity is the lifeblood of our country. Without reliable electricity, our country would not be the world leader that it is today. Therefore, anything that can be done to improve and secure the reliability of the electric grid should be supported and encouraged. H.R. 3776 aims to do just that by focusing research and development on ways to store energy which would not only assist in reliability, but also efficiency of fuel use and security of not only our grid but also, in a broader sense, of our country. 
   Energy storage would allow for the enhanced use of renewable energy such as wind and solar. 
   Currently, the ability of wind energy and solar energy to contribute electricity to the electric grid is tied to when the wind is blowing or when the sun is shining, therefore, making these sources not as reliable as conventional sources of energy such as coal, natural gas and nuclear. With energy storage, excess generation that is unable to be used at the time of generation can be stored for use at a later time. This allows for wind and solar energy to be potential sources of base load generation. 
   In addition to energy storage for stationary sources, there is also a promising field of energy storage for vehicles, the most recognizable example being batteries that would be used in plug-in hybrids. Plug-in hybrids would allow for a further decrease in transportation fuel consumption from conventional hybrids, thereby increasing our national security by decreasing our reliance on foreign sources of oil. 
   H.R. 3776 addresses the battery obstacle by including a research and development program into batteries and battery systems and a demonstration program to prove the viability of the R&D. 
   Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee and sponsor of this bill for recognizing the importance of energy storage to our country's energy future and also for including portions of Ranking Member Hall's energy storage language that was included in H.R. 2483 and cosponsored by several members of the Science and Technology Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (NATIONAL POLICE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, it's an honor and a privilege for me to be a servant of the people in the House of Representatives. 
   I came to this office through a rather unusual route. My first career was in law enforcement. And we are here tonight to recognize National Police Week, and especially National Police Memorial Day on Thursday. 
   My 33-year career in law enforcement started in 1972. I was a 21-year-old police officer, a sheriff's deputy with the King County Sheriff's Office. I worked patrol for 5 years. I worked as a property crimes detective. I worked as a homicide detective. And I've worked as a lead detective on a serial murder case. I've worked as a patrol sergeant, SWAT commander, a hostage negotiator--just about every aspect of law enforcement that you can think of I've been fortunate enough to experience--and finally, my last 8 years as first elected Sheriff in King County in almost 30 years. And here I stand today, in my second term in the House of Representatives, to talk about law enforcement. 
   I feel I have, as you might guess, some knowledge about what police officers do and what dangers they might face. And this week especially is an important week to stop and think about what police officers across this Nation do. I think that sometimes we take them for granted, the brave men and women who serve all across this Nation to protect us each and every day. 
   If you think about your life, think about my life and what we do each day by getting up in the morning, preparing breakfast, going to work, going to school, feeling safe, coming home from work, picking up your children from school, we sort of take those police cars for granted that we see patrolling our neighborhood. And Sunday, this past Sunday we celebrated Mother's Day, an opportunity for families to get together with their children and grandchildren, as I did on Sunday with my three--actually, two of my children showed up, and some of my grandchildren were there, but an opportunity for us to come together and celebrate the contribution that mothers make to this Nation. And we did it safely in our home. 
   But at the same time, I remember, as I was sitting there this Sunday, and most holidays, really, reflect back on my career and think about those days I was in a police car, as I drove around the neighborhoods that I was patrolling and recognizing that all of these families were together on this special day, Thanksgiving, New Year's, Christmas, Mother's Day, Father's Day, all those days that bring families together that I was driving around in my patrol car in those communities, all the cars parked at these homes, it was my job, and my partner's job on either side of me in the districts that they patrolled, to keep them safe while they enjoyed that day. We take that for granted. I think we take our freedom for granted. 
   I once spoke at the University of Washington not too long after taking this office and I was talking to a group of students, 400, 500 students or so, and really was emphasizing the importance of freedom and how much that we need to embrace our freedom and recognize that freedom isn't free, not just the men and women who are serving here as police officers in our country, protecting us each day here at home, but those men and women who are protecting our freedom all around the world in our armed services. 
   And as I was a little bit passionate about freedom and about how important it is for us to recognize that if 
   we don't guard freedom it will slip through our fingertips, a young lady in the class raised her hand and said--and they still call me Sheriff, by the way--Sheriff, I don't understand why you're talking about freedom so much. We have been a free country for years, and we're going to continue to be free. That really struck me, that one comment by that young college student, because she really pointed out what I had believed for a long time, that people in this country are taking our freedom for granted. 
   Success in our world today, success in our communities today, it really depends upon what our police officers do. Remember your police officers out there who are balancing, protecting your neighborhoods every day. I was the sheriff during WTO. We had 40 to 50 thousand people who were rioting in the streets of Seattle in 1999. 
   Now, there is a great balance that had to take place there as we tried to bring peace to the city of Seattle during those riots. Before the riots began, people were saying, let's go to Seattle and listen to people speak and express their freedom of speech. And then as people arrived and some decided to create havoc, people were a little bit nervous because crimes were being committed, the rights of other people were being trampled upon by those who felt that their freedom of speech was more important than others who were trying to express their freedom by going to work, coming home, leaving and going and moving and shopping and doing the things that we do every day. 
   So at one point what we had to do in WTO during those days was to shut the city down. Certain segments of the city of Seattle were cordoned off. There was a curfew placed on the city of Seattle on the citizens. So freedom was lost. If you think about freedom on a continuum, you have the ``freedom to'' and the ``freedom from.'' ``Freedom to'' is the police officers that raise their right hand and say, I swear that I will uphold the Constitution of the United States, that I will protect your rights provided to each and every citizen of the United States of America. And on the other end of the continuum you have the  ``freedom from.'' We promise that we will do our best to keep you from becoming victims of crime. Well, in WTO you saw that balance sway. Freedom was being expressed, people were expressing their freedom more vocally than they should have. It got out of control. Chaos ensued. Police came in. Freedom was taken away. The balance in the continuum of freedom was unbalanced. 
   But in America and in Seattle, as peace was restored to the city, the curfew was removed and certain areas of the city that were closed off were now open once again for people to move about the city. This is America, where we recognize that we can't keep people from moving where they want to move and go where they want to go. It's a free country. 
   So the police have a tough job. Imagine being a police officer, 50,000 people rioting in the streets and you're one of the police officers standing in line trying to protect America, protect the citizens of Seattle. And I saw this happen. One of the police officers, the sheriff's deputies standing his post shoulder to shoulder with the rest, as I was standing behind him, was standing stoically in the face of thousands of people screaming and yelling and protesting. And one had a stick in his hand and reached over and hit the police officer, the sheriff's deputy over the head with that stick. And the sheriff's deputy didn't move, just stood there. And they moved the crowd along. It's a tough job to balance freedom and protection of America, but our police officers do it every day. 
   Let's take a moment to talk about and think about National Police Week. This is a week where we celebrate and appreciate and remember the efforts that all of our police officers put forth each and every day. And boy, I could tell you some stories, I would be here all night, about my experiences on patrol and some of the things that police officers see and the dangers that they face. 
   More than 56,000 police officers are assaulted every year. Every 53 hours a police officer is killed in the line of duty here in the United States. I've lost some friends over my 33-year career. I want to share their stories briefly. And as you can tell, it's emotional, memories that come bubbling up as I remember those days. 
   My best friend by the name of Sam Hicks, he and I were working homicide together. We were tracking down a killer. He went out one night with another friend of mine because they got a tip on where this killer was. And as they went out in search of this killer, they found him. They began to follow him. And the killer and his brother ambushed my partner and shot him in the chest with a .308 Winchester rifle and took his life. He left behind a wife and five children. That was June 1982. 
   Two years later, a good friend of mine who was a classmate in the academy--in fact, we rode together every day to the police academy in 1973--Mike Rayburn, a great public servant, excellent police officer, dedicated, committed to his job and his family and his community, was working a special unit in Seattle. He knocked on a door, the door opened, the man opened the door and thrust a World War II sword through the crack of the door and into Detective Rayburn's body. He fell and died. 
   These are only two stories of two special friends. There are many people who are touched by the loss of a police officer, mothers and fathers, sisters, brothers, spouses, sons and daughters, grandparents, neighbors and friends. It's a job we should respect, we should thank them for, praise them for, not take for granted, and always remember them. 
   I'd like to pause in my presentation for a moment and yield some time to my good friend who is a judge from Texas, Congressman Ted Poe.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (NATIONAL POLICE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. I thank my good friend from Texas, and it's good to have others in Congress who understand the role that law enforcement officers across this country play and the important work that they do to keep us all safe. And the judges were a great partner for us in keeping our communities and neighborhoods safe. 
   I want to thank you for your years of service in law enforcement and thank you for being here tonight to share some of your thoughts with us on National Police Week. 
   Some of the things that you mentioned I want to touch on. 
   We, as Americans, cannot really talk about success and freedom in America and being free in America until we know our children are safe and we know our children and family are secure. One of the things that I think is important is to have people in Congress who understand law enforcement. And for those police officers out there listening, I assure you that there are people here who understand and appreciate so much what you do. Some of us have been there. 
   The judge touched on a number of police officers injured in the line of duty. I was one of those in a domestic violence call in the mid-1970s, back when I was much younger and had dark brown hair. But in the middle of trying to save the wife of a deranged person, her husband, I was in the battle for my life. This man had a butcher knife and was trying to slit the throat of his wife, and I was able to grab her and push her out a bedroom window but suffered butcher knife wounds to the side of my neck. 
   I also understand the need for support, for the community to come around us and support us and be there for us when we need them to stand up and tell elected officials: We need more police officers. We need technology. We need more help. We need you to be there for us and support us with budget increases, not budget cuts. We need you to make strong laws in your local communities, your cities, and your States and your counties that help us do our job, that help us protect American citizens from criminals, from being victims, and also to protect our rights. 
   The United States has some serious problems that we need to address, and I don't think they're being addressed the way they should be. People know that we have a gang problem. People know that we have a drug problem. People know that we have child predators on the Internet, sexual predators on the Internet, preying on our children. 
   I want to share a few facts with you. Gangs are increasing. We used to think about gang problems, drug problems, and those sorts of things as inner-city problems, inner-city crimes. These crime activities now are spread across the Nation, as you can see by this map. This is an indication of the gang problem across our country. The white dots you see are where gang activity exists today, and it's pretty much maintained the same level over a number of years. The red dots indicate increases in gang activity. The blue dots, which you don't see many of, indicate a decrease. Now, if you can't see this fully on your TV screen at home, please feel free to go to our Web site and check your neighborhood, check your city, check your State to see what condition your neighborhood is in as far as increase in gang activity and drug activity. 
   Today there are 25,000 gangs operating in more than 3,000 jurisdictions in the United States. Gang membership has escalated to 850,000 members. 
   Even more alarming, gangs are increasingly targeting our young kids. They're not recruiting kids from college, young men and women from college. Yes, they are, but this isn't their target age. They're not just recruiting kids from high school. They're not just recruiting kids from junior high school or middle schools. But they're also targeting our kids who are in elementary schools. The average age of a gang recruit today is seventh grade. That's an 11- or 12-year-old child being recruited into a gang in some city across the United States of America now, today, tomorrow, and the day after.     
   What are we doing? According to a 2001 Department of Justice survey, 20 percent of students age 12 through 18 reported that street gangs had been present at their school during the previous 6 months. More than one-quarter of the students in urban schools reported a street gang presence. Eighteen percent of students in suburban schools and 13 percent in rural schools reported the presence of street gangs. This is not just an inner city problem. This is a problem that is spread across this country. It is in suburban schools. And  it is in the suburban neighborhood that I live in in Washington State. 
   Gangs threaten the freedom and security of our communities in many ways. They are directly linked to the narcotics trade, human trafficking, ID theft, assault, murder and a host of other crimes. There were over 631 gang-related homicides in the United States in 2001. Gangs readily employ violence to control and expand their drug trade. 
   Now I have personal experience too, of course, with that but more on a personal level rather than a professional level as a police officer. I want to talk about the impact of drugs on children and families. I am the proud grandfather of six grandchildren. Two of my grandchildren are adopted. They were foster grandchildren, foster children of my daughter and her husband, who were drug-addicted babies. They came into my daughter's home and her husband's home when they were about 2 1/2 months old. Little Briar is 6 years old and doing fine. He was 2 1/2 pounds when he was born, a little meth-addicted baby. Little Emma is 5 years old. She was a crack cocaine, heroin, meth and alcohol-addicted baby. 
   Think about that for a minute. Drug-addicted babies. Gang members who are promoting drugs and selling drugs to young teenage girls on our streets who then become pregnant and give birth to drug-addicted babies. 
   I hope that everyone watching understands the impact of what I just said. Do you know what happens when a meth baby is born? Have you ever thought about the pain they go through? When they are born, they have no idea they are hungry. In fact, they don't know how to eat. They don't know how to suck on a bottle. The poison from the meth escapes through their bottom. So they put the babies on their belly in a fetal position with a warming light over the top of them. The poison, as I said, escapes through their bottom. But you can't put any ointment on them because it holds the poison against the skin. You can't use baby powder. It does the same thing. It creates more pain. 
   So what do you do with a meth-addicted baby? You let the baby suffer for 2 or 3 weeks and let the drug escape through the bottom while the baby feels intense burning and pain during that period of time. Briar went through that. Emma, as a crack cocaine, heroin and meth-addicted baby had additional issues to deal with. Today these children are in a good home. They have a chance at a good life and to be productive citizens in this country. 
   But ladies and gentlemen, those are the kids that we need to protect. Those are the kids that our police officers are out there every day trying to prevent them from becoming drug-addicted babies, trying to prevent those young girls that we see out there from becoming mothers of drug-addicted babies, trying to prevent those young men out there from becoming fathers of drug-addicted babies and then disappearing into the streets. 
   So we have to say enough is enough. We have a crisis on our hands. Gangs, drugs, sexual predators, Internet sexual predators, gangs on the rise, organized gangs, 850,000 gang members. Congress needs to stop talking about these issues and needs to act. We need to act today. And during this Congress, the majority has been silent on this issue. And as I said, I understand as a sheriff, as a police officer in a uniform driving a police car, and as a detective, I needed the tools then to do my job. I know there was a fight in the battle in the budget arena at the county council level, at the State level and at the Federal level to find us the tools that we needed. But every day we went out and we did our job with the tools that we had. 
   One of the things I wanted to point out today is that we have, as Republicans, presented over 103 pieces of legislation to help police officers get the job done. I have to tell you that as a cop, because I still see myself as a cop trying to be a legislator, trying to find the way to stop the craziness and the violence in this country, where are the people of the United States who need to push their representative, who need to call their representative, who need to e-mail their representative, who need to be pounding on the front door and demanding that we do something about gang violence in this country, that we do something about stopping the recruitment of our grade school kids and junior high school kids into gangs? 
   Of the only six bills that we have out of the 103 that the Democrats have agreed to accept, and they have actually passed, three of those are resolutions. While we support resolutions and the statements that they make in support of police officers, in support of stopping crime and protecting our citizens, we need real action. 
   To address the gang epidemic in our suburban communities, I have introduced legislation, H.R. 367, the Gang Elimination Act, that would identify and target the three international gangs that present the greatest threat to the United States and create a gang most-wanted list and develop a national strategy to eliminate the gang epidemic plaguing our neighborhood. This bill has not seen the light of day. I even testified in front of the committee. That bill has not even seen the light of day. 
   Why not? Is it because it is a Republican bill? Is it because the majority doesn't support the job that police officers are out there trying to do every day? Why are we not providing the tools that our cops need? I ask that question every day when I come to work in this body. 
   Crime is on the increase. Violent crime is on the increase. Gang activity is on the increase. Drug addiction is on the increase. More drug-addicted babies are being born. The pediatric interim care center that Briar and Emma were taken to and treated and foster cared out and finally adopted by my family has increased their capacity to now nearly 45 babies that they can hold within that facility. And it's not enough. They need more space. 
   So I would ask the majority, please consider the other 103 bills. Let's bring the Gang Elimination Act to the floor. Let's bring these other 103 bills to the floor. Let's act on these today. Let's help the police officers out there in our country that need our help today. Let's not wait another minute. I demand that we have action here in Congress in helping our police officers. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security 4 years ago, the department has made significant steps in ensuring the safety of the American people, specifically with regard to preparing, equipping and training our first responders, protecting our skies, and securing our borders and ports. 
   In my home State of Washington, we have almost 2,000 people working for the Department of Homeland Security, including 178 members of the Coast Guard, 337 Immigration employees and Custom Enforcement officers, and 1,282 Transportation Security Administration employees. Many of these men and women put their lives on the line every day to ensure that another 9/11 attack does not occur. 
   In addition to protecting us from another terrorist attack, the Department of Homeland Security employees thwart human smuggling networks and disrupt the international drug trade. An example of these efforts is in 2005 a discovery of a tunnel between the United States and Canada that would have been used to smuggle drugs into the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is easy to come to this floor and come together in a bipartisan way and pass a resolution to say that we support the men and women who work in the Department of Homeland Security. It is easy to talk about morale. It is easy to criticize the men and women who protect our children, protect our neighbors and protect our communities and are out there every day. We need to show by action. 
   We need to support them in our legislation that we pass that provides them with the tools and the resources they need to do their job. I was in law enforcement 33 years in the Seattle area. I know that when I made a life-and-death decision, I had the support of my administration, I had the support of my leadership. 
   Our men and women who work for the Department of Homeland Security need a strong leadership. And our strong leadership can be supported by people right here in this body, by supporting them again with their resources and the tools that they need. 
   Mr. Speaker, the employees of the Department of Homeland Security have a tough job, a very tough job. They not only need our strong words of support here today, and the support that we bring with our vote in supporting this resolution, but they need our respect, and our admiration each and every day as they are out there protecting our country, our children, and the future of our grandchildren.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for allowing me time to speak this afternoon. I also want to take a moment to congratulate Chairman Thompson on bringing this legislation forward. 
   And I do rise, Mr. Chairman, in support of H.R. 1401. A number of the speakers already have touched upon how the world has changed since September 11, but sometimes we say those words and, really, the heart and the meat of those words don't really touch our hearts. And if I could just take a moment to share a story with you. 
   As I was traveling through my district a few months ago along the freeways just south of the city of Seattle, I looked up at one of the traffic advisory boards. Usually what you see on those advisory boards are traffic alerts: take a different route; traffic accident ahead; severe hazard is ahead; exit freeway; blocked freeway ahead. Those are the things that we are used to seeing on our traffic advisory boards in the Seattle area. 
   But on this day, as I looked up at the traffic advisory board, what it said was, SEA-TAC Airport security alert. No gels, no liquids allowed on planes in carry-on luggage. 
   That, to me, just struck for a moment at, really, the true change that has happened since September 11. Freedom has been impacted by the attack on the United States of America. And as we look at protecting our homeland, it is so important for our protection to be coordinated by law enforcement, by local law enforcement, for grant money to be directed toward local law enforcement and partnering with the Federal system, partnering with the Department of Transportation, partnering with the airport and the rail and security people who protect our railways, highways and airports. All of those have to be brought together and in conjunction with the private sector. That is the duty of local law enforcement to bring people together, to make our neighborhoods and communities safe. 
   But, as I support H.R. 1401, as reported unanimously by the Committee on Homeland Security, I am in strong opposition to the manager's amendment that is up for consideration today. 
   Under the version of this legislation, Mr. Chairman, approved by the Committee on Homeland Security, the Department of Homeland Security would be responsible for distributing rail and public transportation security grants. Unfortunately, good policy has given way to politics. And in the manager's amendment, we see the responsibility for administering these grants has shifted from the Department of Homeland Security to the Department of Transportation. 
   In a statement by the National Sheriffs' Association on this legislation, the association writes: ``Specifically, the National Sheriffs' Association, sheriffs and law enforcement officials have a vested interest in protecting national and homeland security and, in order to do so, it is paramount that an obvious and central entity exist to which sheriffs can turn to for support and assistance. Thus, the National Sheriffs' Association believes that allowing the Department of Homeland Security to maintain the primary role in the assessment and the distribution of grant monies concerning rail security will help maintain such a necessary and efficient Homeland Security infrastructure.''  
   Let me repeat that last part, please: ``Allowing the Department of Homeland Security to maintain the primary role in the assessment and distribution of grant monies concerning security will help maintain such a necessary and efficient Homeland Security infrastructure.'' 
   In addition to this ill-conceived move, the manager's amendment makes another critical error in determining who is eligible for the $2.4 billion of funds for rail security. Again, the version of this legislation reported out of the Committee on Homeland Security allowed State, local and tribal government entities, as well as railroad carriers, to apply for these grants. Risk-based, threat-based. The manager's amendment allows eligible railroad carriers only to apply for these grants. 
   Mr. Chairman, as a former sheriff of a major metropolitan area, I understand local law enforcement plays an important role in protecting our Nation's transit and rail systems. A cynical person might say that the manager's amendment serves as nothing more than a $2.4 billion earmark for Amtrak, though I am sure that that is not the overt intent of its author. 
   While the manager's amendment has made some improvements to this legislation, specifically, the whistleblower provisions, I remain in strong opposition to the dangerous changes the amendment makes to the grant portion of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, last year as chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, I oversaw many of the committee's accomplishments in addressing recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Among them were the successful passage of the 21st Century Emergency Communications Bill, the Faster, Smarter Funding Act, and comprehensive bipartisan FEMA reform legislation. My subcommittee, as well as the entire Homeland Security Committee, was successful last year because of our willingness and ability to work across the aisle to find solutions to problems. As a result, I am disappointed in the way that H.R. 1 is coming before the House today. 
   I remain a strong supporter of certain aspects of this legislation, such as the language that makes first responder funding risk-based. Unfortunately, I have many concerns about other language included in this bill and believe that H.R. 1 would be better public policy had the bill been considered in committee and a rule allowed for an open amendment process. 
   This legislation, Mr. Speaker, includes a new grant program that is intended to make grants to local law enforcement to pay personnel costs of officers serving in intelligence fusion centers. As a former sheriff of a major metropolitan county encompassing the City of Seattle, I certainly agree with and understand the need for this authority. 
   One of my major goals in Congress is to continue to fund local law enforcement as their responsibility grows and grows to protect this homeland. So I support the direction of the this bill. However, as it is written, the language in this bill is unclear as to whether or not it may not apply to all police agencies, all Sheriff's departments, across the country. This problem could have been resolved if we had a bipartisan bill, and I would have been glad to work with my friends across the aisle on this issue. 
   In addition, I have grave concerns for section 408, which includes the TSA personnel management provision. This provision removes the flexibility of TSA to move employees where they are needed most. This provision was not a 9/11 Commission recommendation and has no place in a bill that is described as enacting those recommendations. Including this provision without hearings or examining its potential impact is irresponsible. 
   Last summer, during the U.K. liquid explosives scare, the Department of Homeland Security was able to retrain and rapidly deploy TSA officers to address this new threat. Section 408 of this legislation would remove that authority. This provision warrants a full debate in committee and also on the House floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL MENTORING MONTH -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to recognize January 2008 as Mentoring Month and I am proud to offer my support to H. Res. 908, Supporting the goals and ideals of National Mentoring Month. 
   The history of mentorship nationwide and in my district is a rich one. In Washington State alone, there are approximately 190 organizations specifically dedicated to placing young people into formal mentoring relationships. These organizations spent approximately $30 million in 2006 to forge and maintain those relationships--much of that money coming from private citizens. Most important, all that work has amounted to approximately 29,000 young people in Washington State taking part in a positive mentoring relationship. 
   One organization in particular that has had a tremendous and lasting impact on many disadvantaged youth in my district is Big Brothers Big Sisters. In 2007, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Puget Sound provided more than 2,500 children with mentoring matches and has a vision to provide successful mentoring relationships for all children who need and want them, contributing to better schools, brighter futures, and stronger communities for all. 
   Many of us know personally or have heard first-hand the heartbreaking accounts of young people who veered off the path of success or, because of a variety of circumstances, never even knew where to find that path. Mentoring can be a promising approach to enriching the lives of disadvantaged children and youth by discouraging juvenile delinquency, improving school attendance and performance, and by providing positive adult role models. 
   A young man from my district, Lorenzo, is a shining example of the unique way in which mentoring enriches the lives of our youth. Lorenzo moved to Washington State from West Samoa in 2006, and immediately received mentoring help from Ken--an individual who has consistently given of his time to mentor and nurture young people in my home community. Ken helped this young man through the discomfort of transitioning into a new environment, through the academic process, and into positive relationships with his new peers. Upon graduating from Kent-Meridian High School--my alma mater--Lorenzo gained admission to Central Washington University and is a wonderful example of the power of responsible and caring adult guidance. 
   Today, as Congress recognizes January 2008 as National Mentoring Month, I encourage all citizens, businesses, public and private agencies, religious and educational institutions to support mentoring and give young people in our community the gift of time and friendship through Big Brothers Big Sisters of Puget Sound or other mentoring programs throughout Washington State and our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. We must continue to open markets to encourage American companies to innovate and compete with their global counterparts. This grows our economy and creates jobs. 
   I am proud to represent a district in Washington State that integrates our Nation's leading technology innovators with a vibrant and highly productive small business community. Opening new global markets gives them incentives to improve their products, produce more goods, and employ more American workers. I have seen these job-creating effects firsthand, with trade accounting for 1 out of every 3 jobs in my State. 
   The Peru Trade Promotion Agreement will level the playing field and increase market access for American and Peruvian companies. It will grow our Nation's economy by more than $2 billion. 
   I hope that the passage of this agreement finally advances our broader trade agenda in Congress. I am disappointed that it has taken more than 5 months since the bipartisan deal reached in May--and over 1 year since the Peru Free Trade Agreement was signed--for this measure to finally come to the floor. 
   We cannot allow important pending agreements with Colombia, Panama, and Korea to languish as the Peru measure did. I urge my colleagues in the majority to stop the delays and pass these free trade agreements. Let's advance the trade measures needed to grow our economy, create jobs, and improve our relations with global partners.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 26, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Madam Chairman, I would like to thank our colleagues for their crusade in offering real reform for the American people. I am proud to be a part of this unique coalition of Members in support of this amendment. 
   Why is a Member representing a suburban area of Seattle taking such an interest in the farm bill? The farm bill isn't just for farmers. It's funded by and affects every one of us across America. 
   The underlying bill leaves American farmers and businesses open to challenges from the World Trade Organization. Trade is critical, crucial to our State and our farmers. One in three jobs in Washington State is linked to trade. This amendment is a critical  step to bringing us into trade compliance so that our farmers and businesses have access to markets around the world. 
   Currently, 19 congressional districts receive 50 percent of Federal farm subsidies; 348 congressional districts would benefit positively from this amendment. Every district in my State would benefit. The Washington Post referred to farm subsidies as Federal giveaways that cost all Americans but benefit few. 
   This amendment funds many other American priorities; $1.2 billion to promote healthy food choices, $3 billion more to conservation programs, and $1 billion more to support fruit and vegetable producers. 
   This amendment saves money, brings us closer to trade compliance. It does all this without raising taxes. In fact, it saves taxpayers $2 billion. 
   We can't continue business as usual. Our taxpayers deserve an equitable balance. The time is now for reform. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this critical amendment.

   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I am the proud sponsor of House Resolution 1180, which recognizes the important contributions of women to science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and the health of many industries that have created new jobs, boosted economic growth, and improved our Nation's competitiveness. 
   Congress must continue to educate the public about the important role of women in society and recognize the key accomplishments of women in scientific fields. Furthermore, we must encourage more young women to pursue careers in science and technology fields by adequately funding STEM education in our schools. 
   Much is being done in the Pacific Northwest to achieve these goals. Seattle's Pacific Science Center remains an educational force in our region and continues to inspire students' interest in science. Similarly, the Museum of Flight recognizes the success of female aviation pioneers and helps young women discover career possibilities in the world of aerospace. 
   I am pleased that the Science and Technology Committee quickly brought this measure to the floor in a bipartisan manner, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (21ST CENTURY GREEN HIGH-PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Madam Chairman, today we are considering legislation to improve the conditions of our elementary and secondary schools. Yet nothing in this bill addresses the issue of class size and the overcrowding that plagues our schools and hinders the learning environment of our children. 
   There are 50 million students in our public elementary and secondary schools, and enrollment is expected to continue to increase. By the year 2100, our public and private institutions, from pre-kindergarten, through college, will accommodate an estimated 94 million American children and young adults, an increase of over 40 million over the current school population. 
   Our schools are already severely overcrowded, with many forced to accept twice their capacity and open portable classrooms. According to a 2000 report from the National Center for Educational Statistics, 36 percent of schools had to use portable classrooms to accommodate growing student populations. 
   I've also heard reports that some schools are requiring and asking students to actually sit on desks and on teachers desks due to the overcrowding in classrooms. This is not an environment for learning for our children, and they deserve much better. 
   Since students in overcrowded classrooms lack quality one-on-one time with their teachers, their academic skills suffer. Research shows that smaller class sizes significantly increase the amount of learning that takes place, reducing disciplinary problems and improving teacher productivity. 
   Smaller classes also particularly benefit students from low-income or disadvantaged backgrounds. For example, lowering class sizes in Tennessee closed the achievement gap between black students and white students by 38 percent. 
   According to the U.S. Department of Education, ``A growing body of research demonstrates that students attending small classes in early grades make more rapid educational progress than students in larger classes, and that these achievement gains persist well after the students move on to larger classes in later grades.'' 
   One of the most well known conclusive studies on class size is Project STAR, the only large-scale controlled study of the effects of reduced class size that was conducted in 79 elementary schools in the State of Tennessee. According to the results from this study, 72 percent of students graduate on time in smaller class sizes, versus 66 percent from regular class sizes. Children in smaller class sizes complete more advanced math and English courses, and the drop-out rate is at least 4 percent lower in schools with smaller classes. 
   Our children deserve the individualized attention and instruction afforded by small class sizes. As we consider legislation today to usher our schools into the 21st Century, we should, at the very least, consider how new technologies and building designs can accommodate smaller class sizes, which is what my amendment would do. 
   My amendment is very simple. It provides that local education agencies may use a grant for modernization, renovation or repair of public school facilities to help reduce class sizes. Students and teachers deserve better than shared and portable classrooms. It's time we do something to help ensure our students receive the individualized attention they need, to help teachers in maintaining an orderly classroom. 
   In addition to building new modern schools with minimal environmental impact, we should build schools for the 21st Century equipped with technology and modern equipment that accommodates small class sizes that are safe for teaching and encourage learning. 
   Madam Chairman, this amendment is simple. It is straightforward, and has been endorsed by the National Education Association. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the rule and the manager's amendment that was made in order under this rule. This manager's amendment will significantly weaken legislation that gained bipartisan support in Committee on Homeland Security and passed 26-0. 
   As the chairman of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee last Congress, we were able to pass into law comprehensive interoperability legislation. This legislation, titled the 21st Century Communications Act, created the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications and elevated the importance of emergency communications within the Department of Homeland Security. In addition, this legislation accelerated the development of national standards for emergency communication equipment. 
   Unfortunately, the Rules Committee has approved an amendment that would remove many key provisions and severely weaken this legislation. This amendment removes language that allows interoperability funds to be used by State and local agencies to develop standard operating procedures, training, and exercises.     
   It is important for our first responders to have this equipment, but it is also equally important that they have the training to know how to use the equipment. Allowing this amendment on the floor that removes this provision will reduce the first responders' effectiveness due to a lack of training and planning. 
   We saw what happened during Hurricane Katrina when there was a lack of training, a lack of planning and a lack of communication. It was disastrous. It cost lives. 
   Next week is National Police Week. At a time when we are supposed to be honoring and supporting our first responders, and especially our law enforcement officers, across this Nation, we are limiting their abilities to protect themselves and to protect this Nation. I know this from firsthand experience. This is a problem that has been in existence for over 35 years, the lack of first responders to communicate. I responded to a call in 1974, not able to get on my radio, having to run across a yard and tackle a kid that had a rifle aimed at three other police officers, because I couldn't get through and talk to the communications center. 
   Today, eliminating this provision will create that same situation across this Nation. It's unthinkable. It's unconscionable. It should not be happening. This should be a bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. REICHERT. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, in today's global, highly competitive economy it is imperative that we create new opportunities for our children and ensure that all students, no matter their age, income, or race, have access to quality, affordable education. I am pleased to rise in support of this important legislation and I'd like to thank Chairman MILLER and Ranking Member MCKEON for bringing this bipartisan bill to the floor so that we may finally make the dream of college a reality for all children. 
   Last year, an overwhelming majority of my colleagues joined me in supporting the College Cost Reduction Act, which the President signed into law. This was a good first step to addressing the rising cost of college but today we have an opportunity to do so much more. 
   Education is the lifeblood of a free and democratic society. We have a responsibility to the future prosperity of this great Nation and the rest of the world to ensure that our children have access to the very best education possible--which means controlling costs, strengthening our standards, promoting excellence, and creating new opportunities for previously disadvantaged children. Increasing the maximum Pell Grants and making them available year-round will go a long way towards accomplishing this goal. 
   Finally, Mr. Chairman, if we are to remain a global economic leader we must continue to invest in science and math education. The foundation of innovation lies in a motivated and well-educated workforce equipped with science, technology, engineering, and math skills. While the U.S. is supporting math and science, the rest of the world is not standing still and many countries are working hard to build their own innovation capacity. 
   Our inability to provide our students with a premiere or even a basic education in math  and science is a threat not only to our economic security, but also to our national security. The Hart-Rudman Commission was convened in 1998 to take a look at threats facing our country's national security over a 25-year period. The final report, released in early 2001, received national attention after 9/11 because it stated that the number one threat facing our country was terrorism, and it predicted that an attack was likely to take place on U.S. soil. But what is not as well known is that the report stated the second biggest threat to our national security was our Nation's inability to educate our own children in math and science. It called for a ``recapitalization'' effort. Our Nation has benefited and has been living on the intellectual capital that was driven to our shores by Nazism, Communism and poverty in the 20th century. But now, in a global economy, we can no longer rely on the world's minds coming to our country. And this trend coupled with our own deficiencies in education has created a crisis that, according to this report, reaches national security proportions of the highest magnitude. 
   A great real-world example exists in my own district in Washington State, which exemplifies the importance of science and math education. My district is home to several high-tech companies, including Microsoft. In order to ensure the continued success of Microsoft and other similarly situated companies, we must take steps now to fix our failing math and science programs to make certain they're able to hire the very best and brightest and we don't have to rely on a failing immigration and visa program to coax highly skilled and trained workers from overseas. 
   I believe we need to continue to emphasize math and science throughout a child's education. During a speech before the National Governor's Association at their 2005 Achieve Summit, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said, ``In math and science, our 4th graders are among the top students in the world. By 8th grade, they're in the middle of the pack. By 12th grade, U.S. students are scoring near the bottom of all industrialized nations.'' The need for serious attention and improvements to our math and science education is clear. I am happy to see the committee begin to address this need today through scholarships, grants, and incentive programs to encourage students to pursue careers in math and science. 
   Every parent wants their child to grow up to have more opportunities and a better life than they had. Providing our children with access to a higher education is integrally linked to the future economic, social, and cultural health of our democracy. I urge all my colleagues to stand up for our children and their future and join me in supporting this legislation.

   I visited the veterans hospital in Seattle again recently and talked at length to one soldier about the quality of care he has received. I was relieved to hear that from the time he was wounded in Iraq to his treatment at Bethesda and his time at Seattle's VA Hospital, the care that he received was excellent. Unfortunately, this is not the case in every hospital for every soldier. 
   I will soon be visiting Walter Reed to speak with soldiers there and make sure they are receiving the excellent care that they deserve. I am encouraged by the efforts to hold accountable those responsible for the appalling conditions at Walter Reed. 
   This issue transcends party lines and requires an immediate response by all parties. This is about young men and women who have sacrificed much for our country and for our freedom. We owe it to them to correct this injustice.
