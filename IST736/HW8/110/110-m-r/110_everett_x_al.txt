<DOCNO>Mr. EVERETT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, my friend from Michigan. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H. Con. Res. 63, the Democrats' nonbinding resolution that does nothing to improve the outcome of the war, but does much to hurt the war against terrorism. 
   The resolution claims they support the troops. However, regardless of what the previous speaker said, they refuse to protect the money our troops must have while they are in harm's way.     
   If we wanted to have a meaningful debate on the real issues facing this country, we would take up Congressman Sam Johnson's bill that opposes any effort to cut off or restrict funding for our military. 
   But that is not the debate we are having today. Instead, we are debating a nonbinding resolution that, in my mind, can only hurt our troops who are on the battlefield as we speak, and this resolution can only give comfort to those who wish to kill Americans. 
   Making Iraq a secure place is difficult because of deep-seated religious and ethnic divisions. This is highlighted by the murderous acts of Saddam's dictatorship that killed so many thousands. In addition, al Qaeda and local terrorists along with hostile foreign governments, including Iran, have both encouraged and funded the current violence in the hopes that Iraq will not follow the path to democracy. They must not be allowed to succeed. 
   Any American lives lost in the defense of our Nation is one too many. Yet we must not turn from our task of defeating terrorism before the job is done. President Bush is the Commander in Chief and intends to reinforce American troop strength by 21,000 soldiers to help Iraq's new government finally control violence and restore order. While I believe the decision to increase troop strength in Iraq could have been made much sooner and in greater numbers, it today presents the only viable option to bringing order to the country and laying the foundation for Iraqi Government control of that nation's security. 
   Iraq's government is taking new steps to control the violence from all ethnic groups and made it clear that  our abandoning them at this stage would guarantee failure for democracy in Iraq. And it would ensure a tremendous setback in America's battle to deny terrorism a foothold and give them more chances to continue to kill Americans. Pulling back now with no viable plan to stabilize Iraq would be a disastrous action. This sentiment was expressed in the most recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you know, the NIE is the intelligence community's most authoritative written judgments on national security issues and is designed to help us develop policies to protect U.S. national security interests. Specifically, this report states: ``Coalition capabilities, including force levels, resources, and operations, remain an essential stabilizing element in Iraq.'' In addition, it goes on to say: ``If coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate, we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi Government, and have adverse consequences for national reconciliation.'' 
   While America must not be in Iraq indefinitely, we should not leave without ensuring that the terrorists that are there are put down. To do otherwise would be terribly shortsighted and would ultimately embolden our terrorist enemies who have made no secret of their desire to continue to kill Americans. 
   As a member of the House Armed Services Committee and Intelligence Committee, I have monitored the developments in the war on terrorism, including those in Iraq. I met with President Bush in the White House to discuss the military mission in Iraq shortly after he outlined his strategy for Iraq in early January. We explored what would happen in Iraq, the Middle East, and America if we withdrew from the fight before Iraq's democratic government is strong enough to maintain the peace. Our conclusion was that Iraq would become a sanctuary for terrorists and a base from which they could launch future attacks against Americans. 
   Some Members have tried to claim that the war in Iraq has nothing to do with the war on terrorism. That is the only way they can justify this nonbinding resolution, and that is pure nonsense. 
   We have the greatest military on the face of the Earth, one that no other military dare stand before lest they be destroyed. The only thing that can defeat us is the lack of will. And may God help us if we lose the will to defend this great Nation against terrorism.

<DOCNO>Mr. EVERETT. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Madam Speaker, in the years since I was first sworn in to office in 1993, our Nation has faced a number of major challenges that required tough and courageous decisions. I have always believed public service to be the noblest of calling. I still believe in the concept of ``citizen statesmen'' as envisioned by our Founding Fathers who recognized that private citizens motivated to serve in Congress were vital to the future of our Nation. I came to Washington not as a politician, but as a businessman ready to make tough votes for the good of the country. I believe my final vote to pass the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act is such a vote. 
   The impact of nearly a decade of granting home loans that were doomed to fail has reached a crisis point in our economy. The combined weight of hundred of billions of dollars in low value mortgages has created an economic aneurysm that is beginning to burst and usher in the collapse of our financial markets and take with it many American jobs. The national media have repeatedly spun this dilemma as one that solely afflicts ``Wall Street.'' This is simply not accurate. 
   Many Americans believe this is a cry of Chicken Little and that it is not their problem, and we should let the markets fail and let the consequences fall as they may. However, if we allow our markets to fail--no one will be insulated from the impact. Our whole economy is underpinned by the availability of credit. Without access to credit, banks fail, businesses are forced to layoff workers or close altogether, and even people with good credit cannot get loans for cars, college, new homes, or other essential needs. We are already seeing that universities are having trouble accessing their funds, municipalities are experiencing losses in property taxes since mortgage banks can not pay on foreclosed homes, and lack of availability of bonds for infrastructure and other local needs. Soon our farmers will be getting ready to start planning for next year's crop--and there is fear they will not have access to the credit necessary to plant next year's crop. We have already seen food prices increase over the last few years, and that pain will have been nothing if farmers do not have the necessary credit. 
   As a conservative Republican, I believe in a free market and less government intervention. However, these are extraordinary circumstances that will impact all of us. Many Americans might not have felt the effects directly yet and hopefully they will not because of the action being taken today. This legislation includes safeguards to protect taxpayers, not making the total amount of funds available at once, ensuring that there are no golden parachutes, and holding executives accountable. 
   I cannot leave office taking any position that is counter to the best interest of our Nation. I would have preferred to not have the Federal Government intervention, but failure to act to shore up our economy would allow far greater damage to millions of average Americans and hundreds of thousands of Alabamians. I have been honored to serve the Second District these 16 years and would never have thought one of my last votes in Congress would have been on this type of legislation. Very few things are easy in politics, and I have thought long and hard on this difficult issue, and I believe that voting in favor of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act is the necessary thing to do.

<DOCNO>Mr. EVERETT. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AS AN INDEPENDENT MILITARY SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 207 recognizing the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force. Sixty years ago today, the National Security Act of 1947 established what we know as the premiere Air Force in the world. Since that time, thousands of airmen have served our Nation with pride and honor, and I am proud to recognize their service today. 
   The mission of the U.S. Air Force is to deliver sovereign options for the defense of the United States of America and its global interests--to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace. Air Force aircraft, tankers, and cargo planes play key roles in nearly every combat operation our Nation undertakes. Additionally, their capabilities in space have become critical to air, land, and sea combat operations and are a benefit to our entire Nation.  
   For the past 60 years, Air Force aircraft, missiles, and satellites have kept our Nation safe. While the many technologies and advancements have certainly contributed to our national defense, it is the most prized resource of the Air Force--its airmen--that truly make a difference for our Nation and the world. As a member of the Air Force Caucus, I am pleased to recognize the service of both current and former Air Force personnel on this 60th anniversary. 
   As we consider this resolution, our Nation's airmen are serving in every corner of the world, including many in Alabama's Second Congressional District. I am proud to represent Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, home of Air University, along with the 42nd Air Base Wing, the Operations and Sustainment Support Group, the 908th Airlift Wing, the 754th Electronic Systems Group, the Air Force Logistics Management Agency, and the newest squadron in the Air Force, the 100th Fighter Squadron. The 100th Fighter Squadron is special because it was the squadron of the famed Tuskegee Airmen during World War II, and I am pleased that this squadron will call Montgomery home. 
   Air University is a major component of Air Education and Training Command and is the Air Force's center for professional military education. Air University provides the full spectrum of Air Force education, from pre-commissioning to the highest levels of professional military education, including degree granting and professional continuing education for officers, enlisted and civilian personnel throughout their careers. 
   Air University's Professional Military Education programs educate airmen on the capabilities of air and space power and its role in national security. These programs focus on the knowledge and abilities needed to develop, employ, command, and support air and space power at the highest levels. Additionally, Air University conducts research in air 
   and space power, education, leadership, and management and contributes to the development and testing of Air Force doctrine, concepts and strategy. 
   This year the Air Force also celebrates the 25th birthday of Air Force Space Command. As Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I am privileged to work with some of the finest in the Air Force on a set of programs that I believe will only become more important to our future security. Our world is becoming increasingly dependent on assets and platforms in space, and America's Air Force is meeting the challenges of the 21st Century security environment. 
   During the cold war, Air Force U-2 reconnaissance aircraft kept us safe by keeping watch on the Soviets. I am proud to note that I served as an Intelligence Analyst supporting this platform from 1955-1959 in West Germany. These aircraft performed a number of critically important missions and made a vital contribution to our National defense. 
   Air and missile crews manning nuclear bombers and ICBMs provided our Nation with a powerful strategic deterrent. These capabilities were a major component of our ``Peace Through Strength'' policy that enabled the United States to win the cold war, and I think it is appropriate for Congress to recognize the dedicated service of countless numbers of airmen who protected our Nation during this time. 
   As the Air Force ushers in its next 60 years, we can be assured it will be postured to meet new challenges in air, space, and cyberspace. As a member of the Air Force Caucus, I am proud to provide for the needs of current and future force. Although the service is the youngest of the branches of our Armed Forces, there is no question that the Air Force has made, is making, and will continue to make an extraordinary contribution to our nation's defense. 
   As a nation, we are indebted to the Air Force for its commitment and sacrifice. I congratulate Secretary Wynne, General Moseley, and the entire Air Force team for 60 years of dedicated service and defense of our freedom.

   Mr. EVERETT. Members, it is my sad duty to notify the House that a former colleague, Bill Dickinson, passed away last night at age 82. Bill represented Alabama's Second District prior to me, from 1964 to 1992. He served as the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee during the Reagan military build-up years.

<DOCNO>Mr. EVERETT. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment for many of the reasons that have already been stated. I believe that the Iranian intent is clearly demonstrated. It continues to enrich uranium, install advanced P-2 centrifuges, has not answered IAEA's questions about previous weaponization activities, and continues to defy U.N. Security Council sanctions. 
   North Korea's intent is also clearly demonstrated. In July 2006 it launched six short-range missiles (Scuds and NoDongs) and one longer-range Taepo Dong 2 missile. In October of 2006 it tested a nuclear device. 
   The Tierney amendment terminates European missile defense with a $341.2 million cut. This sends a terrible signal to our allies. The amendment also demonstrates a lack of U.S. commitment to collective security, after NATO recognized a missile threat in April 2008, unanimously endorsing substantial contributions of the European missile defenses. The amendment sends a message to Iran that we don't take missile threats or nuclear enrichment activities seriously.  
   Our key allies, Israel, Japan and NATO are pursuing missile defense capabilities in partnership with the U.S. to address growing missile and nuclear threats. This is critical that we do not accept a cut like this. 
   Finally, Mr. Chairman, the bill reported out already reduced it $719 million. The Nation's missile defense system has shown remarkable improvement over the years, with 34 of 44 hit-to-kill intercepts since 2001. 
   So why in the world--as a matter of fact, I will state it differently. I think it would be crazy to accept a cut like this.

<DOCNO>Mr. EVERETT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking member, a combat veteran from Vietnam and a great American.  
   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to pay tribute to my ranking member and chairman, and to the service of all men and women who are serving in the Armed Forces and those who have prior service, many who serve in this distinguished body. And thank goodness. I say thank goodness, because I find that in this body we have too few people who have ever worn a uniform, but we have an awful lot of opinions about how to wear a uniform. 
   We have heard from many of these Members on both sides of the aisle. Some served in Vietnam, some in the first gulf war, and some in the war that we are currently fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. They cite their firsthand experience in serving our country as justification for why they believe we cannot afford to lose the war or why we should not support the Commander in Chief's reinforcement proposal or, in some cases, why we should bring the troops home immediately and cut off funding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I respect every Member in this Chamber who has served our country with honor and distinction. Each of them brings a different perspective to the debate. However, today I would like to bring another perspective to the debate, and it is that of Army pilot Keith Yoakum from Coffee Springs, Alabama, in my district. Chief Warrant Officer Yoakum was killed February 2 in Iraq when the Apache helicopter he was flying was forced to land during combat operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   While his death is a tragedy, his family is taking comfort in the fact that Chief Warrant Officer Yoakum was doing what he loved, defending the country that he loved. This Army aviator was proud of what he was doing in Iraq, and told his father that there was no other place he would rather be until the war was over. 
   Much of his pride came from his ability to protect our guys on the ground using his Apache helicopter who were executing the dangerous missions of ridding the neighborhoods of those who wanted to kill his fellow troops as well as innocent Iraqis. However, equally as important was Keith Yoakum's belief that he was making a difference in this fight to make this world a better place for his daughters to live. 
   Chief Warrant Officer Yoakum is not alone in his belief. The hundreds of soldiers that I have visited with share his view of this war. Whether it was during a solemn sendoff of our brave men and women or an emotional welcome home ceremony, the soldiers I talk to believe in this mission and that we must prevail in this war. 
   They recognize the dire consequences if we don't succeed in Iraq. If we withdraw prematurely, the terrorists will have an unchecked sanctuary from which they can launch attacks to kill more innocent Americans, similar to what existed in Afghanistan prior to our toppling the Taliban regime in Operation Enduring Freedom. To abandon our fight against the terrorists is to have failed to learn the lessons of 9/11 and to revert to a policy that allowed two decades of escalating violence. That policy resulted in the death of thousands of Americans, as was so well documented by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton). 
   Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we defeat this enemy, whose sole desire is to kill Americans anywhere, in any way they can. Today the theater is Iraq. But if we retreat from this war, as those on the other side of the aisle have advocated, then we will fight them in the cities and in the towns. Either way, this war will be fought. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have a guest essay from my hometown newspaper, the Dothan Eagle, from a war veteran by the name of Wayne Wood, and I would like this complete essay entered into the Record after I speak. But first I want to quote a couple of things from it. This is, as I said, from a former combat veteran, Wayne Wood. 
   ``As I watch the current debate over the war in Iraq, I remember sitting in the day room at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, with my buddies and watching the collapse of South Vietnam and Saigon in 1975. I was thinking of, and I know my buddies were thinking of, all the guys we knew who'd gone over to fight for the Vietnamese who didn't come back. We cursed the ARVN soldiers as cowards because they would not stand and fight for their country. We were angry that the sacrifice of these good--no, great--Americans was in vain. 
   ``It was only years later that I learned, to my dismay, that it wasn't the ARVN who betrayed my fellow soldiers' blood, it was their very own elected representatives in Congress who voted to cut funding for the defense of the Republic of South Vietnam. 
   ``We are being told the Iraqi situation is unwinnable. We were told that we had lost the war in Vietnam. 
   ``After Tet in 1968, Walter Cronkite, `the most trusted man in America,' went on the air and said so. Americans said, `If Walter says we've lost, it must be so.' 
   ``Now, our media, and others, some in this body, ``tell us the same thing. We are being told of how hopeless the situation is in Iraq. What about the American people? What are the American people supposed to think? 
   ``But the picture I got from former students who have served in Iraq tells another story. They are frustrated that the good things that are happening in Iraq aren't being shown, that the people only see the bad. There's a genuine fear that they won't be allowed to finish the job. Their sacrifice would be in vain. 
   ``From a distance, the situation as shown looks grim. But as a soldier who has seen war up close, I know war is a grim business. I remember the words of Marine General Julian Smith, speaking of the Battle of Tarawa in World War II: `We were losing, until we won.' '' 
   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Wood has a number of other examples here, and that is the reason I will include the letter for the Record. 
   No Comparison Between Vietnam and Iraq Wars  
   As I watch the current debate over the war in Iraq, I remember sitting in the day room at Fort Sill, Okla., with my buddies and watching the collapse of South Vietnam and Saigon in 1975. I was thinking of, and I know my buddies were thinking of, all the guys we knew who'd gone over to fight for the Vietnamese who didn't come back. We cursed the ARVN soldiers as cowards because they would not stand and fight for their country. We were angry that the sacrifice of all those good--no, great--Americans was in vain. 
   It was only years later that I learned, to my dismay, that it wasn't the ARVN who betrayed my fellow soldiers' blood, it was their very own elected representatives in Congress who voted to cut funding for the defense of the Republic of South Vietnam. 
   We are being told the Iraq situation is unwinnable. We were told we had lost the war in Vietnam. 
   After TET in 1968, Walter Cronkite, ``the most trusted man in America,'' went on the air and said so. Americans said, ``If Walter Cronkite says we've lost, it must be so.'' 
   Now, our media tells us the same thing. We are being told of how hopeless the situation is in Iraq. What are the American people supposed to think? 
   But the picture I get from former students who have served Iraq tells another story. They are frustrated that the good things they see happening in Iraq aren't being shown, that the people only see the bad. There's a genuine fear they won't be allowed to finish the job. Their sacrifice would be in vain. 
   From a distance, the situation as shown looks grim. But, as a soldier who has seen war up close, I know war is a grim business. I remember the words of Marine Gen. Julian Smith, speaking of the Battle of Tarawa in World War II: ``We were losing until we won!'' 
   Yes, I get saddened when I read the casualty reports and see the pictures of the dead in the Army Times. No one knows better than a soldier that if a nation goes to war, it owes it to the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines to fight to win so their sacrifice isn't wasted. I think of my own son in uniform. I can only pray for him and be proud that he has ``stepped up to the plate'' to serve his country, particularly in time of war. 
   Today, politicians and pundits just know we are losing in Iraq. Walter Cronkite and others just knew we'd lost the war in Vietnam after TET. If only we had known that Ho Chi Minh and General Giap didn't know they'd won. 
   They were about ready to throw in the towel after TET until the anti-war people in America told them otherwise. Well, we left Vietnam and millions of people died in Southeast Asia in the turmoil caused by the power vacuum. Who can tell what might happen if we withdraw from Southwest Asia. 
   In 1975 it didn't matter to most of America. The deaths were far away and the Viet Cong couldn't cross the ocean to attack us. Nor did they care to. 
   Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury today. We fight an enemy who will stop at nothing to destroy us and our way of life. If we leave Iraq, they will follow us home and it won't be millions of Cambodians or Vietnamese dying in the killing fields of Southeast Asia, it will be Americans in the streets  of our cities. Can we afford to be so smug in our knowledge? 
   We may not like the president. We may not like war. We may not like this war or the way it has been conducted. But now that we're in it, this is one war we cannot afford to lose. 
   In one thing I heartily agree with U.S. Sens. Edward Kennedy and John Kerry: America can certainly not afford another Vietnam in Iraq.  
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, and I urge my colleagues on the other side, if we are not going to cut funding from this war, then bring up Congressman Sam Johnson's amendment that says we will neither cut nor restrict funding for this war. I ask my colleagues to stand with Chief Warrant Officer Yoakum and the thousands of other soldiers who believe in their mission and want to see it through to completion, and vote against this resolution. It can only do harm to our troops and bring aid and comfort to the terrorists.

<DOCNO>Mr. EVERETT. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by recognizing the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) and my great friend from California (Mr.  Hunter) for their work on this bill. I also want to recognize the fact that the gentleman from Missouri, this is not his first bill but it's his first Defense bill as chairman of the committee, and I congratulate him. 
   I rise in support of this conference report to accompany the Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act. 
   The bill includes funds for European missile defense interceptors and radars and encourages the administration to seek a reprogramming request once agreements with host countries are reached. 
   The bill establishes policy to defend against Iranian ballistic missile threats and seeks greater missile defense cooperation with Israel. It also authorizes an increase of $65 million for the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense. The bill authorizes GMD, THAAD, and KEI at the budget request, and airborne laser funding is increased to just $35 million below the budget request.     
   In the area of military space, the bill requires the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence to develop a space protection strategy. The importance of space to the economy and to modern-day warfighting is often overlooked. In light of the Chinese antisatellite test last January and other threats to space, we must place a greater priority on the protection of our Nation's space capabilities. 
   Within the area of atomic energy defense activities, the bill reflects general bipartisan agreement, particularly in its authorization of the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program cost and design activities. 
   And finally, Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't recognize the gentlelady from California, who chairs the Strategic Forces Subcommittee. She demonstrates skillful leadership in her first year as chairman, and I want to congratulate her. This bill would not be what it is without her leadership. 
   I also must recognize my fellow subcommittee chairmen, Members on both sides of the aisle, and their staffs. I think this subcommittee handles some of the most difficult policy decisions in the House Armed Services Committee, and I want to express my appreciation for their hard work in protecting our Nation's security. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to have a colloquy between myself and Chairman Skelton. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you know, the government has eliminated the use of non-GSA-approved lock bar file cabinets and outdated mechanical locks for storage of classified information in accordance with national security policy. However, under current Federal regulations, contractors are not required to phase out this old equipment until 2012. This results in less robust security and more government spending to protect classified information handled by contractors. 
   Although the Department of Defense has taken measures to meet these requirements internally, it is evident that the defense contractor community is behind the implementation of the required locks and safes. The committee has taken an interest in this matter of securing classified information now for several years. Rather than wait another 5 years, I believe DOD should have a plan in place to ensure that contractors are in full compliance with the regulations.

<DOCNO>Mr. EVERETT. (NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Madam Chairman, I thank my good friend Mr. Hunter for yielding to me and thank him for his work and leadership on this legislation. And I would be remiss if I didn't thank the chairman of the committee, my good friend, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton). 
   Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1585, the fiscal year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act. I would like to congratulate the chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Tauscher), on her first mark as chairman. She has been cooperative and straightforward, and that I appreciate. The effort has resulted in a product where we agree on far more than we disagree. 
   This subcommittee tackles complex and often partisan issues, such as ballistic missile defense and nuclear weapons policy. This year's process has been further complicated due to the fact that our subcommittee allocation was cut by over $1 billion from the administration's request. 
   In the area of missile defense, the bill continues a policy set forth by this committee last year that places a priority on near-term missile defense capabilities. The bill increases the request for Patriot PAC-3 by $11.8 million to buy four additional interceptors and adds $78 million to the President's request for Aegis ballistic missile defense and fully funds the request for THAAD. 
   The measure also contains a reduction in funding for the proposed Third Site in Europe. I understand the chairman's rationale and her concern about moving forward without formal agreements with the host nations in place. However, I am pleased that my amendment was accepted during the full committee markup, which encourages DOD to seek a reprogramming request in the event that we reach agreements with the host nations in fiscal year 2008. 
   While I support most of the provisions in this legislation, like many on my side of the aisle, I remain concerned about the $776 million top-line cut levied on the Missile Defense Agency, especially when progress is being made in so many areas of these programs. Now is not the time to have a further reduction in funding or slow down the development and fielding of these missile defense elements that are critical to our Nation's defense and the protection of our deployed forces and allies. 
   In the time since last year's bill, we have seen a clear demonstration of the threat to our Nation, including North Korea's test of several short-range missiles and a longer-range Taepo-Dong-2 missile; Iran's continued development and test of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles; North Korea's nuclear test; and Iran's effort to continue uranium enrichment in the face of international criticism. 
   I understand the need to focus on near-term capabilities, but as we move the bill forward, we need to work together to identify the right balance between investments in our near-term systems and our future capabilities. 
   In the area of space, the legislation contains a provision I strongly support which places a priority on protecting our space assets and increases funding for space situational awareness and operationally responsive space capabilities. Consistent with previous bipartisan efforts to improve space acquisition, H.R. 1585 continues its emphasis on program execution. The bill reflects a measured approach to space acquisition that overlaps new modernization programs with continuing legacy programs. 
   H.R. 1585 fully funds Transformational Satellite, or TSAT, which has made significant progress in measuring and maturing critical technologies and following GAO's knowledge-based approach. It also supports Space Radar. Though the program details are classified, I believe Space Radar's all-weather, day-and-night, 24/7 surveillance and reconnaissance capability is vital for the protection of our forces and supporting intelligence users. 
   The measure reflects a bipartisan agreement on the Atomic Energy Defense Activities, particularly on RRW, the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. RRW has the potential to increase the reliability, safety, and security of our nuclear weapons stockpile and reduce the likelihood of testing. RRW funding is reduced but maintained at a level to allow NNSA to take a measured, knowledge-based approach by focusing on detailed design and cost estimates. 
   This is a good bill. We agree on more than we disagree, and I would urge Members on my side to support the bill.

   Mr. EVERETT. Madam Chair, you know, you can attack this a number of ways. Basically what the proponents of this amendment say is that they simply don't like missile defense. I would like to go to where the gentleman from New Jersey and the chairman of the committee went. 
   There have been 27 successful kills; ground-based missile defense, 5 of 8; Aegis, 8 of 10; THAAD, 3 of 4; Predator, PAC-3, 11 of 14. 
   A key theme of our bill is we should not proceed with some missile defense programs without robust testing, but testing and systems engineering are always the first to go when cuts are levied on programs. How can you test without money? 
   I think that is a point of their amendment. They know you can't test without money, and they are against testing and against the missile defense system. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. EVERETT. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I'd like to thank my good friend, Mr. Hunter, for yielding to me and thank him for his leadership and his friendship. 
   I was honored that when this subcommittee was originally formed, Mr. HUNTER asked me to be the first chairman of this subcommittee. It was a great pleasure and it's been a real love for me. 
   I would also say that Mr. Hunter has served this Nation and his constituents in California with great distinction. He's served this Nation with great distinction. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5658, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   I would also like to congratulate Strategic Forces Subcommittee Chairman Tauscher. This subcommittee handles some very technical, complex and sometimes controversial issues. Missile defense, space, and nuclear weapons are difficult issues to work through. But together, with the understanding and leadership of Chairman Tauscher, we have developed legislation where we agree on far more than we disagree. 
   This year's bill contains many sound measures that provide key capabilities to the warfighter and strengthen our strategic forces. 
   I am particularly pleased with the support this bill provides to national security space. The bill addresses many important issues including: continued awareness of the growing threat to space and emphasis on mitigating vulnerabilities; the need to war-game and exercise the loss of space capabilities; full funding for key acquisition programs such as advanced extremely high frequency, WGS, SBIRS and GPS-3, that reflect a measured approach to space acquisition; and protection of the T-SAT budget request, while the Department reevaluates architecture options after their decision to reduce this program by $4 billion. 
   The mark makes positive strides in the area of atomic energy defense activities by: adding funding to research enhanced surety for existing weapons systems; and directing the Secretaries of Defense and Energy to report on steps they are taking to enhance inventory controls for nuclear weapons. 
   I am disappointed the Reliable Replacement Warhead study wasn't directly funded. Our nuclear deterrent is aging, while the rest of the world's nuclear powers are modernizing theirs. The commander of U.S. Strategic Command testified that we are accepting significant future risks with our legacy Cold War stockpile.  
   The American public may not realize this, but the current administration has implemented the largest nuclear stockpile reductions since the end of the Cold War and has an extensive non-proliferation program to reflect the evolving proliferation threat. 
   A reliable, modernized nuclear stockpile that includes RRW holds the promise of allowing us to further lower our nuclear weapons numbers, while continuing to provide a strong deterrent for the United States and our allies. 
   Our missile defense deliberations proved the most challenging. While we agreed on many provisions, such as full support for Patriot PAC-3, Aegis and THAAD, there are a few provisions that the minority could not concur with. 
   I am deeply concerned about the 50 percent cut to European missile defense contained in the bill. I believe this sends the wrong signal to our allies and emboldens Iran.

   Mr. EVERETT. While Congress puts the brakes on this effort to protect the American people, our forward-deployed forces, and our allies, Iran has stepped on the accelerator. Iran continues to: expand its arsenal of short- and longer-range ballistic missiles, install advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium, and evade questions on past nuclear weapons research. 
   Our NATO allies recognize this threat and, in April 2008, provided unanimous endorsement of the European missile defense proposal. In a few weeks, the Czech Republic plans to sign agreements with the U.S. to host the missile tracking radar. 
   This is a critical time for the U.S. to continue its leadership. In addition to NATO, we have key allies such as Israel and Japan who are relying on U.S. commitments to missile defense. I am, therefore, disappointed that the committee would not accept my amendment to restore funding to this effort, particularly after significant progress is being made to meet the conditions outlined in last year's legislation. 
   As the Secretary General of NATO said at a speech on May 5, ``In tomorrow's uncertain world, we cannot wait for threats to mature before deciding how to counter them.'' 
   I also remain concerned about China's actions in space. According to the Pentagon's annual China military report, its undeclared and unexplained January 2007 anti-satellite test is only one part of a larger Chinese counterspace program to prevent the use of space. Thus, I was strongly disappointed and troubled that my amendment to direct an independent study to examine the feasibility of space-based defense concepts was not supported in our committee markup. Such a system might also provide another layer of defense against ballistic missile threats. 
   In the final analysis, there is far more in this bill that we agree on than disagree on.

   Mr. EVERETT. I would, however, caution Members from further reducing funding for missile defense. These programs have already been cut by over $700 million. Any further reductions to these important programs would have very detrimental effects to our national defense. 
   I think the programs in our subcommittee's jurisdiction are some of the most exciting things our Nation does. It is important that we not lose sight of the vital role our space, missile defense, and nuclear deterrent capabilities play in our national security. 
   I would like to thank the other members of the subcommittee and the staff for their hard work in making this bill a quality product. I intend to support it, and I ask the Members to support it. 
   Again, I would like to congratulate Chairman Tauscher for the work that she's done on making this a very good mark, and also I'd like to congratulate my good friend Ike Skelton for his leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. EVERETT. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2082, INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the conference report to the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The process and the substance of the bill fall sadly short. As one of the crossover Members who serves on both the Select Intelligence and the House Armed Services  Committees, it's critical that the House Armed Services Committee and Select Committee on Intelligence work together on national security programs that serve both the military and national intelligence. Regretfully, the Armed Services Committee's ranking member, Republican, Mr. Hunter of California, was denied any input into the joint programs that are shared by both committees. 
   On substance, I had hoped the bill would have improved from the House-passed measure in May. That didn't happen. The conference report includes even more politically charged provisions from the Senate bill that micromanage and politicize the interrogation techniques of the intelligence community. 
   In case anyone in the Chamber has forgotten, we're at war with terrorists. Should we really be publishing our interrogation manuals for the entire world and for terrorists to see? 
   On a positive note, I would like to mention two specific program areas that are important to both the military and intelligence communities: the U-2 aircraft and space radar programs. The conference report language keeps the U-2 and its critical intelligence capabilities flying until we are truly transitioned over to the Global Hawk. 
   And I am also pleased that the bill authorizes funding for space radar capabilities, though at a lower funding level than I would like. This is an essential capability that combat commanders and service intelligence chiefs have continuously requested. 
   Madam Speaker, we can do better than this, and I urge all my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. EVERETT. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the 2007 farm bill. The budget resolution that we were forced to work with was woefully inadequate for production agriculture. Moreover, the Ways and Means Committee, regardless of what the chairman says, included a tax increase on companies to pay for this bill. 
   I have great concerns for Southeast peanut producers, who grow almost 85 percent of all peanuts grown in this Nation. They are the number one losers in this bill. There is included, in the manager's amendment, an important new initiative that will not only help all peanut producers address rising input costs, but will ensure greater yields and better stewardship of the land through enhanced crop rotation. But the $10 million annually allocated for this program is not enough to ensure this program is successful.  
   The ``Farm Bill'' is called the farm bill for one reason--to address agricultural needs of our farmers and ranchers. However, the bill before us seems to forget the farmer and rural America--specifically at a time when many of them are facing difficult times. 
   I understand the financial constraints that we had to work on this bill. But in light of those constraints, significant funding increases were given to conservation and nutrition programs at the expense of production agrculture. Additionally, I oppose the last minute developments that have occurred to attach a provision to increase taxes to pay for some of these increases. 
   I strongly oppose these actions, they should not be in the Farm Bill, and overall it will hurt Americans. 
   I am also concerned over how this additional funding is being allocated. Specifically, $1.6 billion was specified for specialty crops--most of this money going to California--a state that is ranked 10th nationally in receiving federal subsidies. Additionally, $150 million was set aside in the bill for air pollution in California. 
   Secondly, conservation funding receives a $1.35 billion increase in funding. A significant amount of that money has been set aside for specific watersheds. In particular, the Chesapeake Bay Region is receiving $400 million alone for conservation programs for this watershed. 
   Historically, the Chesapeake Bay and other watersheds specified in the bill have received billions of dollars in the past for these efforts and should not be given special preference in this bill. Chesapeake Bay has received over $700 million annually for conservation programs addressing the watershed. Why do they need preference throughout the program when the rest of the nation is also addressing similar issues? 
   I am specifically concerned over the preference being given to several watersheds under the new Regional Water Enhancement Program. I was pleased that this new program was included in the bill--it is an issue very close and dear to my heart. I have been working on this legislation for several years and I am pleased that much of the language of my Farm Reservoir Act has been included in this program. This program will provide cost-share assistance to agricultural producers for projects like the construction of on-site reservoirs. It upsets me that specific watersheds were given priority consideration under this program. 
   Fortunately, an amendment during full mark-up was included to limit these watersheds in receiving no more than half of the funding. However, I believe that the Regional Water Enhancement Program should not be a place for ``earmarks'' but open to all regions of the country--all who are dealing with water issues that are important to their region. 
   For my part of the country, farmers in the Southeast are facing a devastating drought and farmers are faced with the loss of most--if not all--of their crops. Many ranchers are being forced to sell their herds since they have no feed for them. This program would help many of these farmers to build farm reservoirs that will help farmers during these difficult times and could help save many of their crops--a savings to taxpayers in the future in crop insurance and disaster payments. 
   Some would try and argue that my state is guilty of also receiving large subsidies that I have just spoken against. Many of you may be surprised to know that Alabama is in the bottom half of the nation in receiving federal subsidies--27th out of 50. I like to also point out that 72 percent of all farmers and ranchers in Alabama do not collect government subsidies.  
   These are the same farmers and ranchers that are struggling with severe drought conditions and are hoping for some federal assistance to help them get through these difficult times--whether through disaster payments or federal programs like the Regional Water Enhancement Act. However, a permanent disaster payment was not incorporated in this bill because there was not enough money. 
   All of the programs in the Farm Bill are important but to receive such a drastic increase while producers are struggling does not seem right. Claiming there is no money to include a permanent disaster payment program for farmers who face significant financial loss of crops due to natural disasters like hurricanes, drought, wild fires, disease, pests and tornadoes--is wrong! 
   I look forward to continually working with the Chairman and Ranking Member to address many of these concerns as we move forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. EVERETT. (RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the RESTORE Act, which reauthorizes the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance program. As a Member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, I am deeply troubled that the majority has determined to handcuff the ability of the Intelligence Community (IC) to collect foreign intelligence information. 
   Forgive me for stating the obvious, but ladies and gentleman, we are at war. We should be helping the IC in their efforts to protect Americans and fight the war on terror; this legislation needlessly ties our hands in collecting foreign intelligence information. 
   Here are a few of the problems with this bill: No liability protection for the telecommunications companies who have responded to the IC's call for help since the 9/11 attacks; extends constitutional (4th Amendment) protections for terrorists by requiring FISA court approval to monitor individuals outside the U.S.; new and cumbersome FISA court guidelines for IC operations; Justice Department audits of IC activities and operations; onerous and duplicative reporting requirements by the DNI; and the list goes on ....... 
    Mr. Speaker, under this legislation, the Majority has made it clear that our Intelligence agencies should be guided by the tenants of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) when monitoring terrorist activity. 
   This policy is reckless and I urge a ``no'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Hoekstra and Mr. Cramer. I can assure the American people that knowing the members on both sides of the aisle who serve on the Intelligence Committee and the staff who supports them, even though two Alabamians are leaving, the Nation will still be safe and in good hands. 
   I do rise in support of the Fiscal Year 2009 Intelligence Authorization Act. The process for this year's bill was much improved over last year; so for that, I thank my friend and chairman, Silvestre Reyes, and our ranking member, Mr. Hoekstra. It has been 3 years since we have had an intelligence authorization bill, and that has created a void in many important policy areas and in programmatic guidance for the intelligence community. 
   It is critical that we get a bill passed through the House and Senate that can be signed by the President, and I hope that can be accomplished before we adjourn this year. 
   I have a number of concerns about the bill, some of which have been detailed in the minority views of the committee report, but I would like to focus on a few of the joint programs that have military application as well. 
   With regard to the national security space systems, the bill falls short of fully addressing problems in our overhead architecture. As the report notes, ``National security space systems have been and will continue to be a cornerstone of the Nation's intelligence collection capability.'' 
   As Mr. Hoekstra pointed out, critical national security space systems are not properly funded in conjunction with a complete programmatic analysis that shows a way forward. This can be addressed and hopefully will be addressed in conference with the Senate. 
   As I wind down my career in Congress, this will be my last intelligence authorization work. The work we do here is fascinating and important to our national security, and I am pleased to have been a part of this for the past 6 years. As one of the crossover members from the House Armed Services Committee, I want to reiterate----

   Mr. EVERETT. I want to reiterate the importance of having members serve simultaneously on both committees. It is especially important to have a member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee serve on HPSCI in order to maintain a clear understanding of how the shared military and intelligence overhead programs operate so that the right hand, Mr. Chairman, knows what the left hand is doing. 
   I say again I appreciate having served over the years with the members of the committee. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is not  perfect, but it is a very good bill and it needs passing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Madam Chairman, I thank my ranking member, and I thank the chairman for the work they have done on this bill. And for many years, the chairman of the committee and I have worked closely together. 
   But, regretfully, I rise today in opposition to the Intelligence Authorization bill for Fiscal Year 2008, H.R. 2082. Actions taken in the bill regarding human operations, the irresponsible use of our intelligence professionals and the short-sighted steps to critical space systems justify a ``no'' vote on this legislation.     
   The bill slashes funding to HUMINT, or Human Operations, one of our most important intelligence collection functions in the global war on terrorism. Regardless of your position on the war, we cannot cut a primary intelligence function that is critical to protecting our troops in combat. 
   Like many, I have visited the front line, and we owe our brave American military the support they need to be successful in Iraq and Afghanistan. I also note that the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence has stated that HUMINT is his number one priority. 
   Remarkably, rather than focus on national security, this bill places an emphasis on global warming. In the middle of a war which has our intelligence community overloaded with real-world intelligence missions, this intelligence authorization bill carves out scarce intelligence resources for an environmental matter that should be the purview of another committee. 
   Madam Chairman, we have already had 13 Federal agencies looking at the effects of climate change. The administration has requested nearly $7.4 billion this year for climate change-related activities. Since 2001 the Federal Government has devoted $37 billion for climate change-related activities. We are in the middle of a war against radical jihadists, and the terrorist plot of the radical Islamists at Fort Dix earlier this week should be a sobering reminder for all of us. It is wrong and misguided for Congress to overburden our highly skilled intelligence professionals by shouldering them with this unnecessary science project. 
   Lastly, this measure gives our strategic threat little attention. While engaging in the global war on terror, the strategic threat has grown. Having the  ability to peer into areas that would cause us harm is vital to advanced warning, known as ``Persistent Stare.'' We need to pay more attention to the architecture of ``stare'' and ``persistence''; yet this bill provides inadequate resources. 
   For example, substantial funds have been added to a space-based infrared program, SBIRS, that cannot be wisely used. In fact, if these additional funds were obligated, the program would be sent into procurement before it is ready, likely to cause schedule delays and cost overruns. This funding add was poorly conceived and would cause the Defense Department to literally bite off more than it can chew. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my support for the Wounded Warriors Assistance Act. As a member of the Armed Services Committee and a veteran myself, this is an issue that I find of the utmost importance. 
   Following the public exposure of the problems at Walter Reed Hospital, it has become clear that changes are needed in order to provide our soldiers the level of healthcare they deserve. 
   With a growing number of servicemembers in need of medical attention, it is imperative that there is an adequate amount of staff at our military hospitals. By enforcing a minimum ratio of caretakers to servicemembers, this legislation will ensure that every soldier gets the personal attention that they need. In addition, service members will be assigned medical care case managers that would help them and their families deal with the administrative process involved with their care. This type of personalized care and assistance will help our wounded warriors with their recovery, and make an easier transition back into the field or civilian life. 
   Having spent years on the House Armed Services Committee and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have seen first hand the need for improved lines of communication between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Under the current system, there is no designated process by which military personnel become veterans; or for their medical and service records to move from one department to the other. This measure will streamline the transfer process by transmitting members' dismissal forms electronically to the correct agencies. 
   Another great concern of mine comes from the inconsistencies between the two departments' disability ratings systems. When given a different rating of disability as a member of the military than as a civilian, disparities are bound to arise in what benefits can be expected. Creating a single, standardized rating system will help ensure that both our military personnel and our veterans receive the best care that our government can provide. 
   In conclusion, I would like to thank all of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for their hard work on this legislation; and I strongly urge an ``aye'' vote for this important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. EVERETT. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EVERETT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to this attempt to override the President's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (H.R. 976). This bill expands a good program far beyond its original intent, and opens the door to government controlled healthcare. The SCHIP program was created 10 years ago under a Republican led Congress to fill a gap of uninsured, low-income children whose families fell into a salary bracket too high to receive funds under Medicaid. This bill, however, takes this money and gives it to adults, illegal immigrants, and children whose parents are currently making up to $82,000 a year. This bill would encourage more and more children to move from private health care to health care coverage from the Federal government. According to the Congressional Budget Office, as many as two million children would make this shift. 
   The Liberal spin machine has tried to frame the veto as ``anti-children'', while denying the American people the facts. This bill would cost the American people $60 billion over 5 years. This is a $35 billion increase over the current program, and is $30 billion more than the President said he would support. Even the funding sources of this bill have been hidden from the general public. This bill would add a 61 cent tax to every pack of cigarettes, which the Democrats claim will curb smoking among children. This line of thought, however, is intrinsically flawed by the fact that 22 million new smokers will be required to pay for the cost of this bill. How can anyone be anti smoking when they need the very revenue it creates to pay for the healthcare of children? In addition, in 2012, the funding for this program will all but disappear. After a 5-year campaign of signing up as many middle-class children, adults and illegal immigrants as possible, program funds will be cut by 80 percent. This will cause millions of children to be dropped from their healthcare programs, or require an even more extensive funding expansion and burden on the taxpayers. 
   While supporters of H.R. 976 claim the bill does not allow Federal payments for illegal residents, it severely weakens Federal law to leave those individuals a gaping loophole. Existing law requires documentation proving one's citizenship in order to be covered under Medicaid and SCHIP, however, this bill would merely require a name and social security number. According to Social Security Administration Commissioner Michael Astrue, a Social Security number would not keep someone from fraudulently receiving coverage under Medicaid of SCHIP if they claimed they were someone that they were not. 
   Two weeks after the President vetoed the bill the Democrat Leadership has decided to play politics and gamble on the health of these children before having this override vote. This stalling tactic has done nothing but shorten the time we have until this program expires. I am proud to sustain the President's veto and I sincerely hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle care about these children enough to create a bill that everyone can stand behind, as it was when the program first began. I urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to override the President's veto.

Jimmy Saxton had that great ability to just cut through all of the background noise and come to the real pearl that you need to make the kind of legislative decisions that we have to make in the House Armed Services Committee.

He would have been an outstanding person to follow an outstanding former chairman and ranking member, Duncan Hunter. And he has a lot of same attributes, looking out for the guys out there in the mud and walking the roads and wearing the gear in the 110, 115 degree heat.

   Mr. EVERETT. I thank my good friend, Mr. Hunter, for yielding to me, and thank him for his friendship, his counsel, and his undeserved kind words about me. He has been a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform, and this bill fittingly bears his name. 
   I want to congratulate the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Tauscher). She has shown great thought, candor and leadership in guiding the Strategic Forces Subcommittee forward. 
   I want to rise in strong support of this bill. This is a good bill. It provides vital resources for our armed forces, and strengthens our Nation's strategic forces. Our committee has worked well and worked together in a bipartisan, bicameral manner to produce this important legislation. 
   I am pleased that it restores $124 million for the European missile defense sites, and modifies conditions that would allow construction to begin. 
   Since May, both the Czech Republic and Poland have signed missile defense agreement. Iran continues to test longer-range missiles and ignore questions about their nuclear program. 
   The efforts reflects a shared commitment to our collective security. Therefore, I want to personally commend the Czech and Polish governments and encourage swift ratification of the agreements. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not recognize my fellow subcommittee members on both sides of the aisle and their staffs. We tackled complex issues such as space, missile defense and nuclear weapons, and do such with openness, diligence and professionalism. 
   Let me finish with this troubling statistic. China graduated 500,000 engineers. India graduated 200,000 engineers, and the United States graduated 70,000. We have some serious challenges ahead of us to maintain our technical leadership in space. 
   I would like my complete statement put in the Record.  
   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Hunter for yielding to me, and thank him for his friendship and counsel. Mr. Hunter has been a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform and it is fitting for this defense bill to bear his name. 
   I also want to recognize and congratulate the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Skelton, and especially the gentlewoman from California, Mrs. Tauscher. 
   She has shown great thought, candor, and leadership in guiding the Strategic Forces subcommittee forward. 
   I rise in support of the Ducan Hunter Fiscal Year 2009 National Defense Authorization Act. 
   This is a good bill that provides vital resources for our armed forces, and strengthens our nation's strategic forces. 
   Our committee has worked together in a bi-partisan, bicameral manner to produce this important national security legislation. 
   This bill makes some noteworthy improvements over the version passed by the House in May. 
   I am pleased that it restores $124 million for the European missile defense sites, and modifies conditions that would allow construction to begin. 
   Since May, both the Czech Republic and Poland have signed missile defense agreements. Iran continues to test longer-range missiles and ignore questions about its nuclear program. 
   These efforts reflect a shared commitment to our collective security. Therefore, I want to personally commend the Czech and Polish governments, and encourage swift ratification of the agreements. 
   We continue to endorse the development and fielding of near-term missile defense capabilities. The bill-- 
   Increases Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and THAAD by $120 million; and 
   Authorizes Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) at the budget request. 
   The bill also restores some funds to key future capabilities, specifically Airborne Laser, K-E-I and the Multiple Kill Vehicle. 
   I am disappointed that an independent study to examine the feasibility of space-based interceptors was not included in the agreement. With other nation's antisatellite pursuits and missile threats becoming more sophisticated, I  felt it was time to study the viability of such technology. 
   I remain concerned about the Department's performance in its missile defense testing and targets program. 
   I am, however, committed to working with them to ensure the conditions for success are in place, so we can build greater confidence in our defense capabilities. 
   In the area of military space, the bill funds key space modernization programs such as SBIRS, G-P-S-III, W-G-S, and T-SAT. We included a provision that requires the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence to review our communications bandwidth requirements--to ensure we have the capabilities in place to support our future weapons systems. 
   Within the area of atomic energy defense activities, the bill reflects broad bipartisan agreement. The bill-- 
   Adds funds for key nuclear surety and weapons surveillance activities; 
   Establishes a nonproliferation scholarship program for college students; and 
   Directs an assessment of how to increase the security of nuclear weapons around the world. 
   We also emphasize that the Department of Defense should pay greater attention to nuclear weapons matters, particularly in light of recent nuclear mishaps. 
   The next administration will be faced with tough decisions about our Nation's aging nuclear infrastructure, weapons systems, and workforce. I was disappointed that we did not fund the Reliable Replacement Warhead Phase 2a study. I ask my colleagues to take a hard look at this concept. 
   It has the potential to provide our Nation with a safer, more secure, and reliable nuclear deterrent, that may permit greater reductions in our stockpile. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not recognize my fellow subcommittee members on both sides of the aisle, and their staffs. We tackle complex issues such as space, missile defense, and nuclear weapons policy, and do so with openness, diligence, and professionalism. 
   As the Strategic Forces former chairman and now ranking member, I have had the great fortune to meet incredibly hard-working, talented space, nuclear, missile defense, and intelligence professionals. However, they need our help and continued support. 
   I heard a troubling statistic this morning: 
   China graduated 50O,000 engineers. 
   India graduated 200,000. 
   The United States only graduated 70,000. 
   We have some serious challenges ahead of us to maintain our technical leadership. 
   During my 16 years in the House, it has been an honor and privilege to work on the Armed Services Committee to enhance our nation strategic forces capabilities, strengthen our national security, and support our men and women in uniform.

   Mr. EVERETT. Duncan, before you leave, thank you very for those kind words, and, obviously, thank you for that beautiful picture. You are still welcome to come to my home down outside of Dothan, Alabama, and we will do the cabinet work there. Those cabinet saws are a little bit hard to move around. I am not sure I could get it all the way to San Diego. 
   I want to thank you for allowing me to be the first chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee. I think it is some of the most interesting work that we do. I am really proud of that committee, of the staff that supports that committee and the other members who are on it. We have all the missile defense, we have all the overhead stuff, satellites, and we have nuclear weapons. So it has been a really interesting committee, and I have you to thank when this committee was first formed that you allowed me to be the first chairman of that committee. So thank you very much. 
   I would be amiss if I didn't say that you have made great contributions to this country. You have always been straight up for the military. You have never let anybody push over our military and not provide them with what they needed. 
   I remember being in your office when we were having those tragic explosions on the roadsides that were killing and maiming our troops, and you had somebody from Lawrence Livermore there and you told them to get this problem solved and get it solved right now. If we have to go over there with welders and put this sheeting, steel sheeting on those Humvees, then we would do it. So I appreciate your dedication to the military. 
   You say you have been a one-note person. That is not true. We both know that. We have had a number of issues, for instance NAFTA, that we fought. We lost, but we fought that I thought very well. 
   I appreciate the dedication and all the years you have been contributed to this country and to the State of California. Thank you very much.

   Mr. EVERETT. Thank you very much. And I do love that committee. I love what it has done. We are the leading            
   users of space in the world. We have great assets not only for our military, but for our economy also. The global economy for space is some $220 billion, and growing about 18 percent a year. 
   I have problems though, and I know one of the things you have championed over the years is getting young people interested in engineering, math, science and things that we need in the space industry. I just point out that China last year graduated 500,000 new engineers. The United States graduated 70,000. So we certainly have to interest young people in this marvelous thing that we call space. 
   Thank you again for your kind words.

   Mr. EVERETT. Yes. Thank you very much, Jo. 
   First of all, thank you for arranging for this to happen. 
   Two of my favorite people and two of the nicest people I think I know in the House who I've never heard say an unkind word about anybody are Jo Bonner and Duncan Hunter. They're absolutely some of the top people who you could have leading this Nation and in this Congress. 
   As for my friend Bud Cramer, I appreciate those kind remarks that you've given. 
   Bud came here one term before I did. I've served with him now for 16 years, and we have an awful lot of things in common. The Alabama delegation, as he referred to it, is a small delegation, but it's large in its dedication to the State and to getting things done. A great deal of that, being able to operate from a small delegation that does a lot of very good things for their State and for the district, is because of Bud Cramer's ability to reach across the aisle and work with people. 
   Bud is correct. We have worked together. He is an appropriator and I'm an authorizer. Some of our key issues have been missile defense as well as  space. We've worked together an awful lot to make sure that that's represented well--and it is--up in Huntsville. In my estimation--and I've told Bud this before--in Huntsville, there should be one of our national labs. I mean what they do in Huntsville, Alabama for our missile defense and for our space activities is just outstanding. A great deal of that is because of Bud Cramer and his work on the Appropriations Committee and on the Intelligence Committee. 
   He is the chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee on Intelligence, and he has done an outstanding job of moving things forward that have to be moved forward in that committee. It is just a real honor for me to be able to be his ranking member on that. I, too, think that it's good that Alabama has two Members who are in leadership positions on that particular committee. 
   So, Bud, I want to thank you and I'll miss you. I've appreciated your friendship. I've appreciated your loyalty to this country, to the State and to your district, and I hope you stay connected. I know that you're one of the leading experts in a lot of these areas, and I really hope that you will stay connected to space. I certainly intend to stay connected to it. 
   Thank you very much, Jo.
