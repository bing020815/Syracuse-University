<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule which is a cynical attempt to cover political Members of this body who have chosen to elevate partisanship and politics above a real energy solution for American consumers and this economy. 
   Let me start by answering my good friend regarding the issues that he brought up and the things that he said. 
   First of all, the bottom line is that there could be 10 million acres or 20 or 50 million acres that could be, quote, ``given to or leased'' by oil companies. They don't want to drill every bit of acreage they have; they only want to drill where the oil is. Dry holes are not good for anybody. 
   Secondly, when you look at what the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is all about, it is there to protect this country. We should view that ANWR is also a strategic petroleum reserve here for the United States. There are 19 million acres in ANWR. Oil companies aren't after all 19 million acres, they are only after 2,000, just 2,000. That's where the oil is. 
   And perhaps number three, the gentleman needs to understand this, that energy companies are there to be in the business of providing energy. They are not there for any other reason. They are there to help the American consumer, to support our economy, and to  make sure that America is the greatest Nation on the face of this earth. 
   I am proud that we have the largest economy in this world and we use energy to make us more successful. We should not apologize or say it is a mistake that America utilizes energy. We simply need to make sure that what we are doing is having a comprehensive, across-the-board view, and not allowing drilling here in America and offshore is a national security issue. That's the side of the story that my friend did not tell this morning. That's why this bill is something we should oppose. 
   For the last 5 months, everyday consumers and our national economy have been suffering because of this Democrat majority's stubborn and mind-boggling unwillingness to increase the supply of domestically produced oil to reduce prices at the pump. And for over a year and a half, Republicans have been unified in a commonsense approach and a comprehensive approach to bringing down the price of gasoline for consumers, only to have that plan ignored by the new Democrat majority in favor of agenda that prioritizes scapegoats over solutions. 
   Rather than taking this opportunity to work in a constructive, bipartisan way to address the real domestic energy supply issues, they have let sky-high energy prices stand and continue for consumers. 
   Today, we are being asked outside of regular order and with no opportunity for Members to offer their own good ideas to bring down the price of gasoline, and we are spending only 40 minutes to debate a fig-leaf piece of legislation that releases 3 1/2 days' worth of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   The gentleman is correct, when there is more oil supply that is available, the price does go down. The gentleman is correct, there have been previous orders by the President to reduce the supply that is in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve directly for consumers. But 3 days' worth is all we are talking about. That is not a long-term fix. We need a strategic petroleum reserve that is called ANWR to make America competitive. 
   So rather than doing something that would be long term, all they are trying to do is something that would be a political, short-term fix. 
   Madam Speaker, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is intended to deal with natural disasters and national security crises, not preventable, man-made political disasters like the short supply of energy that we have today in America because of the Democrat Party no-energy strategy. 
   The world understands it. As a matter of fact, I was out on the west side of the Capitol just yesterday as Republicans were talking about our ability to go drill here in America and offshore. And whole loads, bus loads of Democrat staffers and others are out front saying, No drill, shame on the Republican Party. My gosh, I do understand that that is the policy of the new Democrat majority. We're working their plan. That's why gasoline is at $4 a gallon. We simply disagree in the Republican Party. 
   However, there is one small bright spot associated with this legislation, and it is by bringing it to the House floor today, the Democrat leadership is finally admitting there is a supply-side component to addressing America's energy concerns. My colleague was very plain and forward when he said: When we dump oil into the marketplace, the price goes down. Unfortunately, seriousness of purpose in dealing with the problem has not accompanied this long-overdue revelation--which is why we are here debating this do-nothing cover vote today instead of real solutions to our problems.     
   Yesterday I joined my Republican colleagues when we proposed a smart, innovative and comprehensive approach to addressing our Nation's energy independence solution, a problem whose guiding philosophy can be summed up by one simple principle, use less and find more. 
   Rather than just releasing over a weekend's worth of energy and calling it a day, like the Democrat proposal does, the Republican plan is to increase the supply of American-made energy in an environmentally sound way. This is what Republicans are pushing on the floor of the House of Representatives yet again today. 
   We believe our deep-water oil resources, ocean resources, could provide an additional 3 million barrels of oil per day as well as 76 trillion cubic square feet of natural gas. These are proven reserves. We should open the Arctic coastal plain, which could provide an additional 1 million barrels of oil a day. We should allow development of our Nation's shale oil resources, which could provide an additional 2.5 million barrels of oil per day, and we would increase the supply of gas at the pump by cutting bureaucratic red tape that hinders the construction of new refineries. 
   To improve energy conservation and efficiency, our legislation will provide tax incentives for businesses and families to purchase more efficient vehicles. It will provide tax incentives for businesses and homeowners who improve their energy efficiency. To promote alternative and renewable energy technologies, this legislation will spur the technology of alternative fuels through government contracting by repealing the section 526 prohibition on government purchasing of alternative energy and promotion of coal-to-liquids technology. 
   We will establish a renewable energy trust fund using revenues generated by exploration in deep ocean and on the Arctic coastal plain. We will extend permanently the tax credit for alternative energy production, including wind, solar and hydrogen, and we will eliminate barriers to the expansion of emission-free nuclear power production. 
   Speaker Pelosi and this new Democrat majority have the power to bring these already-developed commonsense solutions up for a vote at any time. Trust me, Madam Speaker, the Republicans are here to help. But what we want is real solutions. We want to drill now to save America. 
   Speaker Pelosi should choose to be with Republicans in a bipartisan answer, but, instead, this Speaker is choosing to ignore the American public in favor of a radical environmentalist agenda. I will be giving every Member of this body the opportunity to show where they really stand on energy independence during the vote on the rule's previous question. I encourage every single Member who agrees with me that this country needs to increase its supply of safe and reliable American energy to force this Democrat leadership to finally act by rejecting the cynical rule and the meaningless underlying legislation so that this House and the American people will be prepared for real legislation that will have a real effect at the pump. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, you know, I would love to cut a deal with the gentleman right now and say Republicans would be completely for this bill if you would do something for more than the 3 days' supply if we would really approach the emergency that the American people are talking about, and let's do something long term. We have already had President Clinton 12 years ago sign the pen that said we are not going to go after ANWR. We would have had that online now. 
   Why do we assume that in 5 or 6 or 7 years we are not going to need this energy? We are going to need the energy. 
   This new Democrat majority, to a Member, is withholding from the American people the opportunity to get prices down now. To say that we would raid the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for 3 days' worth of gasoline is laughable. It's laughable because the American people understand that what this new Democrat majority is all about is having the energy prices stay where they are. They see that the Democrat plan evidently is working, the Democrat plan to squeeze American interests out and to send the money overseas. 
   We have seen that now for 18 months. That's the Democrat majority's plan. They want to keep building Dubai. They want to keep giving the money to countries who do war against the United States and don't hold us in favor. They want the money and the business to be done overseas. They want the jobs to go overseas. That's really where this new Democrat majority is. 
   If it were the Republican Party and reversed, it would be about all the special interests that we're trying to give. But in this case, it is about the American consumer that sees that their prices are at a high level simply to make sure that this Democrat majority sends the money overseas because they really don't like the energy companies here in America. That's anti-American. 
   Madam Speaker, the Republican Party has great alternatives that are on the table today. We want a long-term comprehensive fix for energy, and we will continue to tell the American people, just as we are here telling our colleagues here today, that we recognize who has the capacity and the ability to bring a bill to the floor today to answer the problem. The problem is the lack of resources of supply in the gasoline marketplace, and it's extending also to high fuel prices that will be paid in the Northeast this winter, and it is the new Democrat majority that is responsible for that. This is their plan. They're getting what they wanted, and we will keep building Dubais and keep sending our money overseas as long as we cut off American jobs and American energy companies. 
   I think it's a bad thing for policy for this country. That's why the Republican Party has an alternative. I wish that it would be heard today on the board to where we could vote for it. 
   Madam Speaker, we reserve the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, let me agree with the gentleman. Psychology does have a lot to do with this. That's why Republicans, instead of trying to fall victim for a 3-day fix or for a long-term fix--so let's get into the psychology for just a second. 
   How about if somebody brought legislation to the floor that said, you know what? I think we ought to open up American deep-water oil resources, ocean resources, because we do understand there are war games that bipartisan Members of this House go attend to where we do understand that if international shipping where oil was concerned, if there was a bad mistake or a problem, that we would be in trouble.     
   So why don't we, as just a good idea, let's open up America's deep water ocean resources, which could provide an additional 3 million barrels of oil per day, but it doesn't end there, and 76 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. 
   Why don't we also bring to the table, let's open up the Arctic Coastal Plain, which could provide an additional 1 million barrels of oil a day. But there is more. 
   How about allowing the development of America's shale oil resources for an additional 2.5 million barrels a day? 
   So instead of having just a 3-day fix and arguing all these new issues that we bring up would take 10 to 20 years to bring to the consumer, not true. It can be done tomorrow. We could decide, and we should have decided 12 years ago. We should have decided last year. We should decide that today, what we want to do is to make available the resources of this country in the event, in the future, there really is a big problem. 
   So the Republican Party is here on the floor today with real live answers to real live problems that are happening every day. 
   And so once again, we will give this new Democrat majority credit. The energy prices are the way that the Democrat Party wants them to be. They do want prices to be high. They do not want a supply unless it is paid for by the government. And they are not for a long-term solution because it would mean that we would be using those big oil companies resources. 
   My gosh. We are going to hold the American consumer hostage. We are going to hold people in the Northeast who use and need this oil this winter hostage, when, in fact, when it is 100 degrees outside, we are saying, do this now; let's prepare. Let's be prepared for the future. 
   And instead, this new Democrat majority argues, time in and time out, not going to drill, not going to put any more supply in, and prices will simply continue to rise. 
   Madam Speaker, somebody will have to face up to the day of reckoning, and that day of reckoning is going to be when American consumers, in the dead of winter, are not only paying high prices at the pump, but also high prices to heat their home. 
   We are trying to do something today. We have been trying to do something for 18 months, and this new Democrat majority refuses, refuses to see the facts of the case. 
   We reserve the balance of our time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. You know, it's great to hear about this private meeting that took place in the year 2000, and to now learn about all the attributes of the meeting. 
   I would speculate, since I am sure the gentleman did, that ANWR would have been in that list of things that the President of the United States would have wanted, the consumers want, that ANWR would have been on there, that every place that we would drill economically, and ecologically, in a sound way, that that would have been on the table too. That is exactly probably what the President had in mind and probably what the energy companies had in mind. 
   Let's put American resources, jobs and national security to the advantage of the American people, instead of the plan to send all this money overseas to build Dubai. That is a mistake. 
   Madam Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana, Dr. Boustany .

   Mr. SESSIONS. Just so the gentleman from Massachusetts has an opportunity to call my bluff, I'll take him up on it. I'll take him up on it. 
   We do believe there is something immediately that can be done, and we've been asking for this for years and years and years because the fact of the matter is, as we've already heard, there is a lot of psychology. The gentleman from the State of Washington talked about psychology just a few speakers ago. Well, here is the psychology. If you bring your own oil to the table, the other side sees what you're willing to do and their oil's worthless because they cannot hold you hostage. 
   So what the Republican Party does want to talk about today is today, tomorrow, Labor Day, and moving forward. And that's why we're talking about bringing 3 million barrels of oil per day, 76 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 1 million barrels of oil from the Arctic coastal plane, and 2.5 million barrels a day from the shale that's in this country. Darn right we want to talk about today. 
   But the fact of the matter is that we've been talking about this for years, and now they make it seem like the debate just started today. The debate did not start today. The debate started back when President Clinton was in office. We asked for and passed a bill at that time, and the President said, ``No. You cannot have ANWR.'' 
   And now we get to today and they act like, ``Well, it just started. But Republicans don't want to talk about today.'' Darn right we want to talk about today. We want to talk about what has been talked about, that is the psychological effort as well as a today's efforts; and that's why the Republican Party is here yet another day. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady).

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this modified closed rule that shuts down debate in the House to every Member of this body, except the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, who has already had ample time and opportunity to modify this legislation, and to one token Republican amendment. 
   Two nights ago, in the Democrat Rules Committee, which over the last year has truly solidified its reputation as the graveyard of good ideas in the House of Representatives, we had a wide-ranging discussion from Members on both sides of the aisle about their  proposals to improve this legislation. We adjourned this meeting without reporting out a rule so that alternatives to subverting the Rules Committee jurisdiction, while sticking to the Democrat pay-for rule, could be studied. Unfortunately, when the opportunity came for the majority to make good on its campaign promises to run the most honest, ethical and transparent House in history by providing an open and transparent legislative process, Members of this House were, once again, silenced by the heavy-handed Democrat leadership. 
   While I am no longer surprised by the Democrat leadership's decision to allow politics to prevail over good government, I'm still disappointed, because as the sponsor of legislation to extend the TRIA program in the 108th Congress, I fundamentally believe that it has helped the private sector to stabilize our Nation's economy by providing a functioning marketplace for policyholders to acquire terrorism insurance and for insurers to provide it to them. 
   In fact, many of the positive aspects of this bill mimic policy proposals included in my legislation, and in legislation introduced last Congress by my good friend from Louisiana, RICHARD BAKER. Like these Republican bills, today's legislation would extend the current program, providing both policyholders and insurers with the certainty needed for long-term projects and our domestic economic health to move forward. 
   And, like prior Republican legislation, today's bill would eliminate the false distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terror. As we have learned from the London bombings and from the recent foiled terrorist plots in Germany and in New Jersey, no country is insulated from home-grown terrorism, which can be just as destructive and as costly as terrorists from abroad. 
   Other aspects of this legislation, such as the inclusion of nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological coverage, mimic past Republican proposals without including market-based modifications that our proposals also contained in order to make this coverage both taxpayer friendly and cost efficient. 
   Unfortunately, there's one proposal in today's legislation that is unprecedented and that I simply cannot support. Written in the Rules Committee, without any consideration or debate in the Financial Services Committee, and then self-executed by the rule so that it receives no up-or-down vote, this rule contains language that skirts recent Democrat promises to abide by their own self-imposed PAYGO rules by shifting the responsibility of funding TRIA onto future Congresses.     
   By including this mandate on future Congresses, which the Supreme Court has roundly rejected as unconstitutional, the market stabilization benefits of TRIA completely evaporate. 
   Rather than helping to provide insurers and policyholders with the certainty that they need to manage their exposure to the financial costs of terrorism, this bill simply kicks the responsibility down the road and by and large says ``we will let somebody else worry about that.'' 
   Rather than clearly signaling to the private sector what the Federal Government will spend in the event of another attack on the United States and what their own costs and responsibilities would be, this hastily drafted language, shoved in in the middle of the night, reintroduces political risk into this financial transaction by leaving these hard decisions up to the whims of a future Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think this Congress should do better and they can do better than this. Instead of closed rules and artful dodges of the PAYGO rule, I think that Members and their constituents deserve the openness promised by Democrat leadership. Instead of procedural trickery and inserting language of a mysterious origin into this rule without any minority input or open debate, I think that Members and their constituents deserve transparency, which was promised by the Democrat leadership. And, most of all, instead of leaving the hard decisions and potential costs of this program to future Congresses, I believe that Members and their constituents deserve a bill that deals honestly with one of the most serious problems facing the American economy. 
   Unfortunately, this bill provides none of these things and is a far less responsible approach to dealing with the real-world economic problems posed by terrorism to our country, more than past Republican proposals. In fact, about the best thing that can be said about this bill and the process under which it is being considered today is the fact that perhaps it will spur the Senate to provide the American people with a more serious proposal in dealing with TRIA so that all of the flaws of this legislation can be worked out in conference. 
   I oppose this rule and encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the gentleman for his fine remarks. As a matter of fact, I agree with him, that I do not believe that it is proper or correct to have a mandatory bill which requires mandatory spending, but discretionary funding that's available. And that is exactly what this new Democrat majority is doing. They are saying we would be absolutely required, mandatory, to spend the money, but discretionary as to whether we're really serious about providing that or not. And I believe that that is a serious question that comes under question today about the serious nature of the policy of this. 
   I don't attack the underlying legislation at all. The legislation does not bother me. I've supported this for years. That's what will be the underpinning of making our country stronger and better and preparing us for what may be in our future. But you can't require something and then not provide the money, especially under PAYGO rules that you had initiated yourself. 
   So this is simply a debate that the new Democrat majority is having within itself about whether they're really serious about their opportunity to bring to the table serious policy issues that face this great Nation.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman, once again, another speaker from our friends on the Democrat side, talking with us about how they are going to fix it. We appreciate that. 
   That is what we are asking for today. The best I can tell you is that the Republican Party is in favor of fixing it. We believe the best way to do it is on the floor of the House right now, because right now we could fix it where all the Members will understand what the ramifications are. The ramifications are either that we are going to say that terrorist attacks don't apply under PAYGO rules or that terrorist attacks would be in fine print, that now perhaps the Democrat majority wants to put in that all this spending applies but perhaps not under certain circumstances. I think we could craft a deal here. 
   But now what the gentleman is asking us to do is ``just trust me.'' Well, the first thing I would like to do is get a copy of the letter. It would be appropriate for me to ask for that. I know the gentleman, Mr. Ackerman, does not oppose my getting a copy of that letter. But what we are now being told is, ``now trust us that it will be brought back in a forum where there is debate, but it is either an up or down vote.'' We can't change that decision, nor can any other Member of this body change that. We have heard enough people talk today about how what is happening is wrong, should not happen, is bad policy. We ought to fix it today here on the floor if we are going to move forward and not say, ``trust me, trust me, wait for fine print or disagreement later.'' 
   I appreciate the gentleman, Mr. Ackerman. I thought it was not only very nice what he did but well spoken, and I appreciate the gentleman very much.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, you know, I do appreciate my good friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts, coming in and arguing, but his side has already given in on this point. They have already conceded that they don't like the way the bill is, the self-executing rule. There is already agreement on his side, ``Whoa, this is wrong. We don't agree with this. We will agree to fix it.'' 
   So, I love the gentleman from Massachusetts, he and I are very good friends, but they have already conceded that point. They have already said, ``We think there could be a better way to do it. We agree to fix it.'' So what did we say on this side? ``Thank you very much, Mr. Ackerman. We appreciate this. That is what we have been asking for. We are pleased that we got it.'' 
   I wish we had the agreement here today. I wish we knew what that deal was going to be before you brought the bill to the floor. That's why we held off in the Rules Committee for an extra day waiting for a better answer. Didn't get it, get to the floor. 
   I would say to my good friends on this side, if you want us to be a better minority, you are going to have to be a better majority. We took seriously what Speaker Pelosi said, ``honest, open, ethical Congress.'' We are still waiting for that through the Rules Committee. When she said, ``PAYGO is going to apply to everything,'' it implied that Republicans didn't do that. Then we took that at the surface of the words, not looking for fine print, not looking for how they are going to try and get out of it. So we are trying to make sure that we simply know what we are supposed to count on. 
   They have come to the floor today, and they have said, ``We are going to work on it.'' I am pleased we are going to do that. I am simply saying that it should have been done before it got here. That is sloppy. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I have no additional speakers on the rule. I yield to the gentleman from New York to run down his time, then I will make my closing statement.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so that I may amend the  rule to allow for the consideration of H. Res. 479, a resolution that I have not heard talked about today but the concepts are in that that I will call the ``Earmark Accountability Rule.'' 
   At the beginning of this Congress, a number of promises were made to the American people about the Democrats' supposedly new and improved earmark rules.     
   As the Congress has worn on, however, I have noticed that while the Democrats' rule changes definitely sound good, they have not really lived up to their promise and have not really accomplished much, since the majority has repeatedly turned their head the other way when it comes to their actual enforcement. 
   I acknowledge that the majority has given into the minority demands for enforcement of their own rules a handful of times when it comes to appropriations conference reports. Unfortunately, we continue to see non-disclosed earmarks in all sorts of bills, also. 
   This rules change would simply allow the House to debate openly and honestly the validity and accuracy of earmarks contained in all bills, not just appropriations bills. If we defeat the previous question, we can address that problem today and restore this Congress' nonexistent credibility when it comes to enforcement of its rules, like we have seen once again today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the ranking member from California for not only putting together this Special Order tonight, but also talking about the Rules Committee which I think is so important. I have had an opportunity to serve on the Rules Committee for 9 years. For 9 years previous to this, I have seen the Rules Committee as being part of the process to make sure that the agenda of policy is done properly by the Speaker of the House through this committee. I would like to note to the gentleman from California, as he remembers that, Republicans utilized this committee to make sure that we balanced the budget, to make sure that we had responsibility and the opportunity to make sure that the American people benefited from that which we did here in Washington, D.C. by cutting taxes. 
   Republicans balanced the budget when they said it was not possible in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001. We went in and we balanced the budget. We utilized the Rules Committee to make sure that we had responsible government. 
   I have now seen during the last 10 months that we have been in the minority that it is also true that the new Democrat majority utilizes the Rules Committee to do things that I don't think that the American people can completely understand, and that is that they want to raise taxes, they want to raise spending, and they want to make sure that what happens is that loopholes are there in place for them to do earmarks despite the debate that has taken place on this floor. 
   So I am pleased to join the gentleman from California tonight in summarizing that the Rules Committee is a very difficult place for all Members. It is a difficult place whether you are in the majority or the minority, but it is still the place where the political work gets done, and nothing has changed. The Democrat Party is still here to raise taxes and raise spending and to take away from the American people that which they earn, and that is called their hard-earned money.

Does the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee, as provided under clause 1 of rule X of the rules of the House of Representatives, include exploration, production, storage, supply, marketing, pricing and regulation of energy resources, including all fossil fuels, which includes legislation to lower the price of gasoline which has increased to over $3.60 a gallon under Speaker Pelosi's watch?

   Mr. SESSIONS. H.R. 3236, introduced by Congressman Boucher of Virginia, to promote energy efficiency improvements in buildings and appliances was reported by the Energy and Commerce Committee on August 3, 2007, and placed on the Union Calendar. 
   Would it be possible for Mr. Dingell, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, to call up this bill under his committee's jurisdiction to help the Speaker to implement her secret plan to reduce gas prices by diverting less of America's energy supply to buildings and appliances, or for any other membership of the Democrat majority to help their leadership to call up the bill?

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Vermont for yielding me this time to discuss the proposed rule for consideration of this omnibus package of legislation being returned from the Senate. 
   On behalf of the Republican Conference, Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this closed rule and to this entirely closed process which is being manipulated for the sole purpose of silencing 430 Members of Congress and denying the Republican minority a motion to recommit. 
   I want every single Member to understand what today's vote really does mean. It means a vote for this rule is going to give only Ways and Means Chairman Charles Rangel, Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank, and Speaker  Nancy Pelosi the opportunity to determine the shape of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, that means that for anyone who is tuning in to watch today's debate on C-SPAN who is not sitting in Harlem, New York City; New Bedford, Massachusetts; or San Francisco, California, your vote is being silenced by the new majority's rule. 
   A vote for this rule is also a vote to once again break the Democrat leadership's numerous campaign promises to provide this House with regular order, including the bare minimum that can be done to protect minority rights through the inclusion of a Republican substitute. 
   I wish I could say that this disavowal of last year's campaign promises is precedent setting. Unfortunately, breaking these promises to the House and to the American people has become all too common in what has officially become the ``most closed Congress in history.'' 
   What is precedent setting about this rule is that it directly contradicts the past statements of the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, Chairman Frank, who prior to today's rule had an unblemished record of at least asking for his party leadership and the Rules Committee to stick to their word. 
   In the past Rules Committee hearings, Chairman Frank has advocated allowing this House to debate amendments:

Mr. Speaker, for 17 months this new Democrat majority has led this country down their pathway of what they want, higher taxes, more spending, which has resulted in the gasoline crisis that we have today by cutting off supplies that would come to make America energy independent. And here we are now with a housing crisis. After all the years that we've had a growing economy, no wonder our country's in trouble. The new Democrat majority has taken over.

We have not even reached that point yet, and yet already we find out on the floor that the Democrat Party is willing to say we're in a complete crash equal to 1929. My gosh. Let's at least tell the American people the truth. 
   We can get over the problems that we have in this country, but let's not make things worse than what they already are. Let's not lie to the American people. Let's tell them the truth.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I will be asking each of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question to this rule. If the previous question is defeated, I will amend the rule to make it in order for the House to consider any amendment that would actually do something to reduce gas prices for consumers and to require the Speaker of the House to submit a plan for lowering gas prices. 
   Madam Speaker, back on April 24, 2006, over 2 years ago, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi released the following statement, which I quote: ``Americans this week are paying $2.91 a gallon on average for regular gasoline, 33 cents higher than last month and double the price than when President Bush first came into office.'' 
   Madam Speaker, most Americans would consider it a blessing if they were only paying $2.91 per gallon of gasoline. And the only thing that they really can't afford is the Head-in-the-Sand Democrat Congress's refusal to consider to do anything to help America achieve its energy independence. 
   In that same press release, Speaker Pelosi went on to claim, and I quote: ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' 
   Well, I'm not exactly sure what they are waiting for right now because even after passing the ``no energy'' energy bill through this House a number of times, the cost of the ``Pelosi Petroleum Price Increase'' continues to rise, with the average cost of a gallon of gasoline at over $3.60 now, hitting consumers at the pump every single time they fill up their cars. 
   By voting ``no'' on this previous question, Members can take a stand against high prices and demand to see this secret plan to reduce gas prices that the Democrat majority has been hiding from the American people since taking control.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule which is a cynical attempt to provide political cover for Members of this body who have chosen to elevate partisanship and politics above American consumers and our economy. 
   Today, both everyday consumers and our national economy are suffering. Mr. Speaker, we are suffering because of this Democrat majority's mind-boggling unwillingness to increase the supply of domestically produced oil to reduce prices at the pump. That's why we are suffering. We are suffering because the policy here in this body in Washington, D.C., and you can read about it in articles in virtually every single paper across the country, and that is the leadership of this House of Representatives does not want to get the right thing done so consumers can have more energy and oil at the pump. 
   For weeks now, Republicans have been unified in a commonsense and comprehensive approach to bringing down the price of gasoline for consumers, only to have every single one of those plans and votes on the floor of this House of Representatives ignored by the Democrat majority in favor of an agenda that prioritizes legislation like naming historical trails and gaming the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to prevent the development of increased energy production in New England alone.     
   They are going out of their way to make sure that commonsense legislation that will help the free market and the energy companies, who should be our friends, to provide what consumers need and to produce a better economy. 
   These priorities completely ignore the wishes of the American people and will do absolutely nothing to bring relief to millions of Americans who are really suffering as a result of high energy prices. I think that if the American people knew that the plan, or part of the plan, was to sue OPEC, they would laugh just like Members of this body have done. 
   Rather than taking this opportunity to work in a constructive, bipartisan way, to address these domestic energy supply issues that have led to sky-high energy prices for consumers, today we are being asked outside of regular order, and with no opportunity for Members to offer their own good ideas to bring down the price of gasoline, to spend a whopping 40 minutes debating a fig-leaf legislation that wasn't even released to Republicans until late last night. 
   Republicans have already put forth a number of smart, innovative ideas to bring down gas prices like H.R. 3089, the No More Excuses Energy Act of 2007, which would reduce the price of oil by opening new American refineries, investing in clean energy sources such as wind, nuclear, and captured carbon dioxide, and making available more American energy through environmentally sensitive exploration of the Arctic energy slope and America's deep sea reserves. 
   But, of course, we know we can't get close to that. We also have H.R. 2279, the Expand American Refining Capacity on Closed Military Installations Act, which would reduce the price of oil by streamlining the refinery application process and by requiring the President to open at least three closed military installations for the purpose of setting new and reliable American refineries in place.  
   H.R. 5656, which would reduce the price of oil by allowing the entire Federal Government, not just the Department of Defense, NASA and our intelligence community, to procure advanced alternative fuels derived from diverse sources such as oil shale, tar sands and coal-to-liquid technology. 
   H.R. 2208, the Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Act, which would reduce the price of oil by encouraging the use of clean coal-to-liquid technology by authorizing the Secretary of Energy to engage and enter into loan agreements with coal-to-liquid projects that produce innovative transportation and fuel; and, H.R. 2493, the Fuel Mandate Reduction Act, which would reduce the price of oil by removing fuel-blend requirements and onerous government mandates that contribute to unaffordable gasoline. In other words, red tape. 
   Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leadership have the ability to bring each and every one of these already developed commonsense solutions up for a vote at any time, but they have chosen to ignore the American public in favor of a radical environmentalist agenda, and each one of these bills is also the subject of a discharge petition that would force their consideration. Every single Member of this body, even though they may agree or disagree with Speaker Pelosi on whatever her agenda might be, can take a commonsense approach and come down and sign a discharge petition that would bring this legislation to the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   I encourage every single Member of this body who agrees that this country needs to increase its supply of safe and reliable American energy to force this Democrat leadership to finally act by joining me in signing each and every one of these. 
   It's simple, by the way, for the new Members, as you hear this, all you have to do is walk down to the very front, sign these discharge petitions, and we could, this afternoon, be debating and voting on commonsense ideas to bring down the price of gasoline. 
   Instead, this Democrat majority, led by Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, has chosen to bring up redundant legislation that has been overtaken by events before it can even be considered. The Bush administration has already announced that a new round of leases will be held for the National Petroleum Reserve, making today's restatement of current policy as useless as the restatement of the current ``use it or lose it,'' or, said another way, making energy companies drill dry holes. So, what we need is commonsense activities that would bring commonsense prices down for the American public. 
   Perhaps the most galling of all is the inclusion of section 5 of today's legislation, which forces cumbersome requirements and restrictions on the construction of any new pipeline from Alaska to the rest of the United States simply on behalf of big labor bosses. While the inclusion of this requirement is no surprise coming from the Democrat majority that wants to take away a worker's right to a private ballot so that big labor bosses can more easily manipulate the outcomes, it is disappointing that this Democrat majority would blatantly include this requirement at a time when we can see that it should be addressed to make life easier for bringing down the cost of gasoline for all Americans. 
   Today's bill is being brought forth by the Democrat leadership in a weak attempt and effort that does nothing more than restate current law and restate existing requirements that oil production on lands be developed while adding new restrictions to pipeline construction for the benefit of big labor bosses. I challenge anyone on either side of this aisle to produce a study other than the partisan and logically challenged report developed by the Democrat staff of the Natural Resources Committee that reapplying the so-called ``use it or lose it'' provision to the National Petroleum Reserve will create even one additional barrel of oil. This is a supply-side problem. This is a problem that the new Democrat majority has made happen, and this is a problem that the American people are asking each of us to solve. 
   So, the Republican Party is here on the floor of the House of Representatives on behalf of the American people asking all the Members of this body to please understand what we are doing. I think it's a cynical rule that we are debating now, as well as the underlying legislation. We need real legislation. We need to put the American people first. We are not just some country, we are America, and we can win. 
   Mr. Speaker, we reserve the balance of our time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I will take from those words that the gentleman from Vermont has no further speakers and would be interested in me closing at this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, since taking control of Congress in 2007, this Democrat Congress has totally neglected its responsibilities to do constructive things to address the domestic supply issues that have created today's skyrocketing gas prices, diesel prices, and energy costs that the American families are facing. And today, once again, they are proving to Americans that they have a failure of leadership and vision. 
   Mr. Speaker, we'll see what happens when the August break comes around and our friends in the new Democrat majority head home to find out how much home fuel prices are going to spike with home heating fuel, and we will find out what happens in September when we come back from the break. 
   So to avoid that, Mr. Speaker, today, I urge my colleagues to vote with me to defeat the previous question so this House can finally consider in July, as opposed to September, real solutions to the rising energy costs. If the previous question is defeated, I will move to amend the rule to allow for this House's consideration of H.R. 5984, H.R. 2208, H.R. 3089, H.R. 2493, H.R. 5656, and H.R. 2279. 
   Mr. Speaker, these may not be household understood names of bills, but in September, the new Democrat majority, after spending August at break, is going to find out they should have done something, rather than doing nothing. 
   Yesterday afternoon in the Rules Committee, hours before Republicans were even given a copy of today's legislation, the same amendment was defeated by the Democrat majority by a party-line vote. 
   While I do not have a great deal of hope that this Democrat majority will provide a better outcome than the one provided by my Democrat Rules Committee colleagues, the vote on this previous question will allow every single Member of this body, especially those Members of the much- and often-reported bipartisan working group on drilling, to stand up for real solutions to this energy crisis--it's easier to do it in July than it will be in September--not just ineffective restatements of current policy that do absolutely nothing to increase the production of American energy for consumers. 
   I encourage everyone that believes that a comprehensive solution to solving this energy crisis and achieving energy independence includes increasing the supply of American energy to join me and to defeat this rule and the previous question. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to place this motion and extraneous material in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, it is obvious that the gentleman made a statement saying gas prices have risen because of this private meeting. And now the gentleman has not only no clue what took place in the meeting, as I don't either, but now makes the leap of assumption that 8 years later that gasoline is going to rise in price. 
   The facts of the case are this. The facts of the case are that this Congress refuses to provide the energy companies, the oil companies, with what they need where they say the oil exists. And this Democrat Congress is refusing to help consumers. And since this Democrat Congress, this new Democratic Congress has taken over, prices have risen dramatically. 
   There is not some plan that exists. There is no secret plan. There is no plan because the plan that is happening is what the Democrat plan is. It's working exactly as the Democratic Party wanted. Prices are rising significantly. And that is their plan. What I think would be disingenuous is to say, oh, my gosh, we wish prices would go down. That is just disingenuous if you don't back it up with facts of the case of how that could be done. 
   To go to the emergency petroleum reserves would be a disaster. And it would be a disaster because that is there in an extreme national emergency. We've heard this morning, we can think of no reason why that would not be used. Well, there are people who can think of reasons. And it's called if a group of terrorists wiped out every tanker that was coming to the United States and our military did not have any energy or oil. That could be a good reason not to go to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, is the new Democrat majority does not intend to do anything to help the American consumer to get more oil supplies and thus reduce the price of gasoline.

   Mr. SESSIONS. The fact of the matter is that this entire body, on virtually every single piece of legislation, sees where the energy and oil issue comes up because the Republican Party is trying to get the new Democrat majority to change the rules that are hamstringing consumers all across this country. 
   And what we're trying to say, whether it be an appropriations bill up in Rules Committee or here today, is that the American consumers, the American people deserve and want this Congress to act. And all we hear are excuses. We hear about all this land that is available out there. There sure is. Oil companies don't want to drill dry holes. They want to drill where the oil is. And we are coming here to the floor, virtually every piece of legislation, every single committee in this House of Representatives is asking for the opportunity to be for the American consumer as opposed to some special interest group. 
   And what we're told is that we need to change the way we do business and we need to be more like Europe. Well, being more like Europe is not an answer for America. We're not just a country. We're the greatest nation on the face of this world. And we need the ability--and the American people are asking all over this country for the new Democrat majority to quit what they're doing and allow our free enterprise system and the oil companies to bring to bear those oil resources that we have. And arguing all day every day that they have all that land is not the right answer. 
   What is the right answer is we need to go offshore. And we need to be able to go to ANWR. The amount of the acreage is 19 million acres in ANWR. But all they need is 2,000 acres. They don't need the other 18 1/2 million. They need that 2,000. It is one-ninth the size of DFW Airport, my airport that I land at every week. That is all we need. We will not rest our case.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this modified closed rule and to the Democrat leadership bringing legislation to the floor of this House which will provide for an unprecedented intimidation of employees by union bosses under a fundamentally anti-democratic process known as ``Card Check.'' 
   Today, the Democrat leadership has scheduled a vote on the most dramatic change to our Nation's labor laws since the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which identified and disallowed the most egregious union practices of its day. And every single Member of this body will have an opportunity to answer very plainly and clearly whether they think our economy should be nimble and adaptive to compete with countries that present tomorrow's challenges, or mirror the politics of Europe which will continue to keep our former competitors on the continent from realizing the jobs and the economic growth of the United States. We do not believe the policies of Europe are the way to go. 
   This legislation will give every single American voter a chance to see whether their Member of Congress supports the private ballots, a right which is given to every single American voter for obvious reasons, or if they support government protection and special treatment for labor unions by silencing one side over the debate of unionism. 
   Of course, as we watch what is going on today across America, everyone will be tuning in to C-SPAN to watch this debate to see how we are going to answer a number of statements from the majority about how this legislation will provide fairness and will improve conditions for American workers. 
   What they will not hear from the other side of the aisle is an explanation about why 16 Democrat cosponsors of this legislation previously signed a letter to the Mexican government imploring it to use the secret ballot in all union recognition elections because it would ensure that workers would not be intimidated into voting for a union that they would not have otherwise had. 
   Madam Speaker, I could argue this sentiment even more. I would like to insert a copy of this letter into the Congressional Record, and I doubt that that body will get an explanation from these signatories why they believe it is a matter of fairness that Mexican workers deserve protection from coercion, while American workers do not. We will find out. Perhaps they will take an opportunity to enlighten us later today.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Dreier, I appreciate the opportunity for you to yield time to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am a little bit shocked and surprised with the reformers that have come to Congress, the brand-new Democrats who are talking about all these things that they are going to get done. Yet it seems to me that with the respect we would have for the voters who sent us here, that we would not be asked to approve and get ready to vote on things without even seeing the bills. 
   The new Democrat party, in their openness and trying to do things right, is asking Members of this body to vote for and approve getting rules to the floor without even knowing what the bills are about, the substance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this. I rise in opposition because I think it is a step backwards, not a step forwards. It represents less transparency and is a slap in the face for regular order to this House. 
   Section 503 of this flawed package rolls back the Sunlight reforms implemented by the Republican Party in 1995, and it creates a secret ballot in the Rules Committee for votes that are taken right upstairs, Mr. Speaker, where we would meet, where rules, as they are debated and brought before this House, Members always had to make sure that the votes that they were going to support would be recorded. That is not going to happen. There is no compelling reason for this bait-and-switch that has happened now by the new Democrats. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this. I think it is a step backwards, and it is my hope that the newest Members of this body will listen to what is being said, that their rhetoric about the openness and change in this body is simply a step backwards. What a shame. They thought they were coming to Washington to change things, and what they are doing is to make it more like central government that we are told what to do by a few people in the Democrat leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 976, CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, today is a defining moment for an insatiable appetite that the new Democrat majority has for spending, spending taxpayer dollars and going well beyond the mission statement of SCHIP. And that is what the day is all about. It is a defining moment with the new Democrat majority seeking a way to have single payer-funded health care for all America. And that is the road that we are defining and beginning again today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this completely closed rule that fails to even provide the minority with a motion to recommit, and to the underlying legislation that the minority did not receive until 6:30 last night. 
   When I came to the floor in the beginning of August to oppose the previous version of this legislation, I explained my opposition to the way that it had been brought to the floor without a single legislative markup. And, unfortunately, again today that fact has not changed. In fact, neither Republican leadership nor Republican members on the House Energy and Commerce Committee had an opportunity to participate in the crafting of the 250-plus pages of legislative language this entire House was provided with just a little bit more than 12 hours ago. 
   Despite the terrible process surrounding this legislation from start to finish, I would like to once again thank the Democrat leadership for one thing: By cramming this bill through the House for a second time, they are giving every single Member of this body another opportunity to go on record regarding which vision they have for the future of our Nation's health care system that they truly support. 
   The first vision for our future is to slowly shift away as many Americans as is possible into a one-size-fits-all Washington bureaucrat-run program. And, if nothing else, I congratulate the Democrat leadership for their clarity, because that vision is embodied in H.R. 976. 
   Rather than taking the opportunity to cover the children who cannot obtain coverage through Medicaid or the private marketplace, this bill uses these children as pawns in their cynical attempt to make millions of Americans completely reliant upon the government for their health care needs. 
   H.R. 976 also increases government spending and dislocates the private marketplace, leaving taxpayers holding the bag for these increased costs. This bill generally raises the income threshold for eligibility and allows States to qualify anyone receiving these funds, including childless adults and people making over $80,000 a year, despite the fact that this diverts these much needed funds away from helping our Nation's most poorest children. 
   It would also allow illegal immigrants and aliens to receive these benefits by forcing States to accept nonsecure documents as proof of citizenship for purposes of receiving these funds. I find it both ironic and unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that the party of Hillary Clinton and bureaucrat-run health care would float a proposal in which law-abiding citizens are made to show proof of insurance as a condition of employment, while this legislation would open the door for ineligible and illegal immigrants to receive federally funded benefits, no questions asked. 
   All of these problems exist on top of a current system which we know that some States already abuse. This bill grandfathers in New York's standard, which provides Federal assistance to those making four times the poverty level, and in New Jersey at 3 1/2 times, while allowing every other State to expand coverage to three times the current poverty level. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, the crowd-out effect created by this big government bill that replaces private insurance with a government program will not provide coverage to more kids. By the CBO estimate, it simply will shift 2.4 million children out of private insurance and into a Federal program that hurts doctors and hospitals by forcing them to deal with government bureaucrats that short-change both patients and providers by undercompensating them for medical services. 
   If Democrats were serious about ensuring that every American had access to inexpensive and high-quality health care, we would be talking about a different vision today for our health care, one that tackles the system's real underlying problems and revolutionizes our health care system to provide us  with better results. This other, Republican vision for improving health access to health insurance includes allowing families to have access to tax exemptions up to $15,000 a year for health care, not just those who work for large employers. 
   The Republican vision includes giving Americans the ability to purchase health insurance across State lines, because healthy insurance options should not be limited to the State you live in or your zip code. It also includes having Congress act to ensure that those who can't get insurance in the marketplace have access to coverage through high-risk pools and low-income tax credits. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am not here to oppose the idea of SCHIP. It was a Republican-controlled Congress that created SCHIP, and I support its original, true mission. But H.R. 976 is a camouflaged attempt at slowly siphoning Americans from insurance plans into a Washington, D.C., bureaucrat-run system. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we fail to address one of the most serious issues facing our Nation: how to make our health insurance system more affordable and accessible for all Americans. And by focusing on the wrong vision for our future, this bill does nothing to address either problem. It ignores the fact that our Nation has produced the greatest health care advantages in the world, many of which have come as a result of our competitive insurance market. 
   The American survival rate for leukemia is 50 percent; the European rate is just about 35 percent. For prostate cancer, the American survival rate is 81 percent; in France, it is 62 percent; in England, it is 44 percent. 
   Rather than trying to emulate Europe and its outdated socialized approach, we should be working on a vision to give every single American an opportunity to take part in our competitive insurance market. I encourage my colleagues to oppose this rule and the underlying legislation to drag America into a one-size-fits-all European model. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so that I may amend the rule to allow for consideration of H. Res. 479, a resolution that I call the ``Earmark Accountability Rule.'' It seems like we need a lot more accountability. We had to learn today that through a loophole that evidently we don't have to have all earmarks to be accounted for in the bills that come to this floor of the House of Representatives despite what we were told just a few months ago. 
   Last night in the ``Graveyard of Good Ideas,'' which is the Rules Committee, I made a motion that would have the Democrats enforce their own earmark proposal by allowing points of order regarding earmarks to be raised on this legislation. As expected, the vote failed along party lines with every Democrat member present voting to waive their own earmark rules for this bill. I am greatly disappointed in that outcome. So today I am giving the entire House, not just the nine Democrat members of the Rules Committee, whose word we are expected to take that this legislation contains no earmarks, an opportunity to correct that mistake. 
   This rules change would simply allow the House to debate openly and honestly about the validity and accuracy of earmarks contained in all bills, not just appropriations bills. If we defeat the previous question, we can address that problem today and restore this Congress' nonexistent credibility when it comes to the enforcement of its own rules.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, today, once again, we have a rule that is on the floor of the House of Representatives that is neither open nor I think passes the standard of accountability to the American people nor fairness that they spoke about. Last night, the Rules Committee and minority received this bill just 1 hour and 15 minutes before the Rules Committee was to meet. It involved no feedback from Republican Members, especially those who have jurisdiction over this from the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   I am disappointed. I am disappointed that, once again, we have to come to the floor of the House of Representatives after asking a straightforward question last night to the chairman of the Rules Committee, ``Are there any earmarks in this legislation? We think we found three,'' only to come to the floor today and find out, oops, no, we got a loophole, had to find a loophole. 
   This is crass. It is really politics over policy. I know many people want the United States House of Representatives to be higher in the polls. We are at 11 percent right now. People scratch their head and wonder why. Well, with the way that this House is running, not living up to their word, even the word in committee among colleagues who have been with each other for 9 years that I have been on the Rules Committee where a person looked right at me and said, ``There is nothing in that bill,'' I think we can do better.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple, straightforward, and fiscally responsible. It would prevent any taxpayer funds from being wasted on operating Amtrak's worst-performing long-distance route. 
   Under this amendment, which is supported by Citizens Against Government Waste, Americans for Tax Reform and the National Taxpayers' Union, the determination about what constitutes Amtrak's most wasteful route will not be a political one made by Congress, it will instead be determined by Amtrak's own most recent monthly report, and it will not take effect if the Secretary of Transportation determines that the line is critical to homeland security.  
   Amtrak's most recent performance report produced in March 2008 lists the Sunset Limited as Amtrak's worst performing long-distance route. And for the few lucky people who actually buy a ticket on this route, this journey constitutes a 48-hour ordeal from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Los Angeles, California. 
   Amtrak's report indicates that this route had an astonishing loss of 26.3 cents per seat mile, which is unsurprising given the length of the trip coupled with the lowest ridership of all of Amtrak's long-distance lines. 
   Right before I came to the House floor today, I went to Amtrak's Website and looked up how much a round-trip ticket on this line would be. The answer: an astonishing $522. For the purpose of comparison, a bus ticket for a similar trip leaving on and returning the exact same days, it would cost only $366, and riding the bus would take 19 fewer hours to complete the trip. 
   Back in 1997, Congress passed the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act which required that Amtrak operate without any Federal operating assistance after 2002. 
   Despite this decade-old, commonsense requirement that Amtrak cease their fiscal irresponsibility and mismanagement, without my amendment, today's bill would continue to waste taxpayer money by forcing American families to subsidize Amtrak's worst line. 
   Amtrak's net loss in 2007 was over $1.12 billion, an increase of 5 percent over last year. In March of 2008 alone, Amtrak's net loss was $96 million. These awful performance figures prove that the time has come to restore commonsense fiscal responsibility at Amtrak, and that the time has come to at least take a small step in helping taxpayers' hard-earned money not to be used on long, expensive routes with low ridership. 
   This amendment simply seeks to prevent further good taxpayer dollars from being thrown after bad by limiting the cost of Amtrak's number one least-profitable route. And if Members cannot support this simple, security-conscious amendment on behalf of fiscal discipline, I don't know if there is anything else that we can do to help not only this Congress be responsible, but also to be in support of American taxpayers. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this closed rule and to this seriously flawed underlying legislation. While the process involved with bringing bills to this floor is very slightly improved over this past January when the Democratic leadership bypassed long-standing bipartisan regular order and used their rules package to create a closed process that skipped even bringing their flawed stem cell bill to the Rules Committee for its consideration, it is still overwhelmingly flawed and directly contradicts widely reported Democrat campaign promises to run the most open and ethical Congress in history. 
   Yesterday, the Rules Committee met and the majority Democrats reported out two completely closed rules, one which will completely lock down this important debate today regarding the Federal funding of stem cell research upon which a great deal of honest and heartfelt moral and scientific disagreement exists on both sides of the aisle. 
   In this exclusive and rushed process, it feels very familiar for the Members. If it does, it should. Because, back in January, the Democrat leadership forced a similar hastily written and politically motivated stem cell bill through the House without any input from the Members. Their purpose then was the same as it is today: to attempt to score some political points at the expense of sound science, openness, and transparency, not to mention feedback from its Members. 
   Because they knew that their crass political move would never pass the Senate, today we are forced again to take up yet another flawed stem cell bill for political purposes under yet another completely closed rule that provides no Member of this body with the opportunity to amend or improve it. 
   Worst of all, rather than taking this second chance to work in a bipartisan fashion to create a bill that balances cutting-edge medical research with the serious ethical implications created by stem cell research, this rule simply advances the Democrats' cynical agenda to send a flawed bill to the President for his veto, despite the legislation not even achieving a veto-proof majority in the Senate. 
   Unfortunately, judging by their performance on recent supplemental funding measures for our troops, it seems like the Democrats need to be vetoed once or twice before they realize that they simply cannot pander to their liberal blogs. They actually need to work together to reach across the aisle to deliver workable bills that are in the interest of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, not only is this a bad way to handle this process, I think it is an embarrassment to the institution that the Democrat leadership would fail to work openly with the over 400 duly elected Members of this legislative body to find common ground that balances the multiple grave concerns surrounding this legislation. 
   This legislation forces taxpayers to fund research requiring the destruction of human embryos rather than seeking a middle ground on which researchers can be provided with the embryonic stem cells that they need to advance science while not violating the sanctity of life. 
   This legislation fails to specify whether these embryonic stem cells that will now be eligible for Federal funding can be taken from embryos that still retain the potential for implantation or if they would be taken from embryos that no longer have the potential for further cellular division. 
   This lack of clarity is not a function of a lack of ideas or debate on the matter. A compromise measure, introduced in the Senate by Senators Isakson and Coleman, already exists which provides for research only on those embryos which no longer have the potential for cellular division. 
   Here in the House my colleagues, including my friend from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey, also offered a thoughtful amendment that was rejected by the Democrat Rules Committee which would have provided for the Federal funding of pluripotent stem cells which can specialize in any bodily tissue but cannot develop into a human being.     
   And despite the near-certain protests to the contrary that will be made by some Members of this body, this legislation also fails to contain language to prohibit or even propose ethical regulations for cloning or egg farming. 
   Finally, rather than allowing science to progress based on merit, this legislation picks winners and losers in the research community by choosing which research methods would be funded. It diverts research funds from very promising areas, such as adult stem cells and cord blood, despite the fact that adult stem cells have already been proven to work over and over. 
   But don't take my word for it. James Thompson, the first scientist to derive stem cells from a human embryo, was quoted in The Wall Street Journal saying, ``I am not entirely convinced that embryonic stem cells will, in my lifetime and possibly anybody's lifetime for that matter, be holding quite the promise that we desperately hope they will.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this debate has been so politicized that the American public can no longer even hear above the political fray about the miraculous and leading-edge technologies and therapies being derived today from adult stem cells, amniotic fluid and human umbilical cords, all without the moral and ethical controversies created by this bill. 
   Treatments for injuries and chronic illnesses as diverse as spinal cord and heart tissue regeneration, bone marrow and vision therapies and diabetic management are all emerging as we speak, and this Congress should not be in the business of politically allocating scarce resources away from these technologies and methods as researchers continue to perform scientific miracles, such as creating embryonic-like stem cells without using eggs or destroying embryos, like the scientists at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have already accomplished in laboratory tests. 
   The point, Mr. Speaker, is that the process provided for under this rule does not allow for debate on the central issue: Does a middle ground exist that can provide scientists with the stem cells that they need to continue their cutting-edge research while at the same time respecting the sanctity of life? 
   Unfortunately, once again, the graveyard of good ideas in the House, the Democrat Rules Committee, has provided this body with a rule that allows none of this debate. Instead, Members of this body are being asked to vote up or down on a very blunt measure that fails to recognize the vast complexity of this issue. 
   This is no way to run the people's House, Mr. Speaker, and it is certainly no way to run a self-proclaimed most open and ethical Congress in history. I urge all of my colleagues to defeat this rule and the underlying legislation so that the House can have a real and meaningful debate on this issue and not allow something as important as the fate of stem cell research to be determined by bumper-sticker politics. This House does deserve better and the American people deserve better. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party, this President, is completely in favor of spending money in doing stem cell research. We, however, are not in favor of putting an olive branch out that is unproven, untested, and up to today has produced no results from embryonic stem cell research. 
   The real problem with it is that it takes someone else's stem cells and puts them into someone else's body and there is a rejection rate. We know what works best is when a researcher uses stem cells from a person's own body and puts them back into their own body. This is called stem cell research for adults. This is what will lead this country to where it needs to go. 
   We are simply saying, rather than spending Federal money on untested and unwise decision-making processes that have not led forth to any research that is meaningful, we should spend the money which will yield the best results. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment and extraneous material into the Record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 502, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this unnecessarily and uncharacteristically restrictive rule. On Wednesday night, despite the protests and objections of Republicans on the committee, the Democrat majority on the Rules Committee did its level best to solidify the committee's status as the Graveyard of Good Ideas in this House by passing out the most restrictive rule for a Legislative Branch appropriations bill in recent history. 
   Last year, when the Republicans ran the Rules Committee, we reported out a rule for consideration of the 2007 Legislative Branch in which we made in order all seven, that's seven out of seven, amendments submitted by Members of this body so that they could be considered and debated on this House floor. These amendments included four sponsored by Democrats and three sponsored by Republicans, making the rule and that process a completely inclusive and bipartisan product. 
   The year before that, the Republican-run Rules Committee, nearly half of the 11 amendments submitted in it were made in order under the rule, with both bipartisan and Democrat-  sponsored amendments allowed to be debated there on the House floor. 
   Madam Speaker, I wish I could claim to be stunned by the majority's enormous departure from the Republican-led precedent to increase inclusiveness and dialogue in the House on this particular appropriations bill which is, by convention, the only bill to come to this floor under a closed process. 
   However, rather than honoring this tradition, on Wednesday the Democrat Rules Committee produced the most restrictive and closed rule in recent history. Earlier this week, 24 Members of this body submitted thoughtful and earnest proposals to improve this legislation to the Rules Committee. Additionally, Members tried to have their constituent voices be heard also by the committee, but they were turned away at the door because their amendments were submitted shortly after the arbitrary deadline. 
   And out of these 24 amendments, only three were given the opportunity to be debated on the floor. In passing this rule, Democrats made a calculated decision not to make every single amendment in order like Republicans did the year before. They even voted to abandon the more relaxed standard of 2 years ago, when half of the amendments were made in order. 
   So instead of making 100 percent of their colleagues' amendments in order, or even 50 percent of the amendments in order, this rule makes only 12 percent of the amendments submitted in order. This seems pretty meager in comparison to the grand promises made during last year by Speaker Pelosi to run the ``most honest and open Congress'' in history. 
   Among the amendments rejected by the committee on Wednesday were two amendments offered by someone with more knowledge of the legislative appropriations than perhaps any other Member of this body, my friend and the former chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Georgia, Jack Kingston; an amendment by a Member of the Democrat majority, Mr. Cleaver of Missouri, that was made in order last year by the Republican majority, not this year; and a number of friendly taxpayer amendments by my good friend and colleague from Texas, the gentleman, Mr. Hensarling, that would have reduced the overall cost of this bill to the taxpayer. 
   Madam Speaker, I do understand that the majority Democrats outnumber Republicans and have enough Members on the committee to win every single vote in the Rules Committee. And I understand that, as the majority, it is their responsibility to run the committee and the floor as they see fit. So all things being equal, I will not take exception to their new, heavy-handed approach to shutting down debate. 
   However, the second-ranking member of this body, the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, crowed to the media on December 5 that Democrats would ``have a Rules Committee that would give opposition voices and alternative proposals the ability to be heard and be considered on the floor of the House.'' 
   Obviously, that is not happening. I believe every single Member of this body and, more importantly, the American people who send us here every 2 years have the right to know that when these grand promises are not being lived up to that those things will be noted on the floor. And they are, again, today. 
   So while my service in the Graveyard of Good Ideas in the House may prevent me from being surprised when these campaign pledges are broken on a daily basis by the Democrat majority on the Rules Committee at the direction of Democrat leadership, I hope that the American people are still shocked and appalled that promises delivered in November and December were promptly forgotten in January, and that they continue to be ignored today. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to send a message to this new Democrat leadership that this restrictive debate in the people's House is completely unacceptable. Join me in voting ``no'' on this rule so that the Rules Committee can live up to the standards set by the Democrat leadership and pass out a rule that allows for debate on the issues and ideas of every single Member of this body, not just the ones that the Democrat leadership find politically convenient. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, the Republicans are here today to say we believe the process should equal what the Democrats had said they would do. It did not. 
   Secondly, we have problems with the bill because of the more than 7-percent increase in spending over last year's level. We believe that that is excessive, at a time when we thought both sides agreed that fiscal sanity would be in order, especially in dealing with this body. So, the Republican Party is here today to say we think that is too much money. 
   Madam Speaker, I will be urging my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that I may amend the rule to make in order the very thoughtful amendments of my Democratic colleague from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver), which was made in order by the Republican-controlled Congress in the Republican Rules Committee last year. 
   The amendment would encourage House Members to lease hybrid and other more economical vehicles. In this time of high gas prices and our need, the national desire, the need to reduce the reliance on foreign sources of energy, this House should have at least have the opportunity to debate such a thoughtful amendment. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and the extraneous material printed just prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike section 213 of this legislation which, as drafted, would have the same anticompetitive effect as language already included in a number of the Democrat majority's other appropriations bills by preventing funds from being spent to conduct public-private competitions. 
   In this case, it would prevent funds from being used to allow the private sector to compete against the government for jobs at the Bureau of Prisons or Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated. 
   While this policy may be good for increasing dues payments to the public-sector union bosses, it is unquestionably bad for taxpayers and for Federal agencies because agencies are left with less money to spend on their core missions when Congress takes the opportunity to take competition away from them. 
   In 2006, Federal agencies ``competed'' only 1.7 percent of their commercial workforce, which makes up less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire civilian workforce. This very small use of competition for services is expected to generate savings of $1.3 billion over the next 10 years by closing performance gaps and improving efficiencies. 
   Competitions completed since 2003 are expected to produce almost $7 billion in savings for taxpayers over the next 10 years. This means that taxpayers will receive a return of about $31 for every dollar spent on competition, with annualized expected savings of more than $1 billion. 
   This provision, included by the Democrat Appropriations Committee, directly contradicts a number of legislative provisions recently passed on this issue by the House, including: The conference report for the 1997 omnibus appropriations bill, which specifically directed the Bureau of Prisons to undertake a prison privatization demonstration project; also, the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997, which directed the Bureau of Prisons to rehabilitate D.C. inmates in private prisons; and since 2001, every Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill has directed the Bureau of Prisons to contract for prison services. 
   I think the answer is clear, Mr. Chairman, that when the Democrats claim that these services are ``inherently governmental,'' despite numerous citations in the A-76 circular that these activities are exempt from this definition, and prevent competitive sourcing from taking place, that the Democrat leadership is clearly hearing from labor bosses that this bill represents another good opportunity to increase their power at the expense of taxpayers and good government. 
   In this time of stretched budgets and bloated Federal spending, Congress should be looking to use all of its tools it can to find taxpayer savings and reduce the cost of services that are being provided by thousands of hardworking companies nationwide. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense, taxpayer-first amendment to oppose the underlying provision to benefit public-sector union bosses by keeping cost-saving competition available to the government. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very simple. It would provide an additional $6 million to the FBI, and to reduce the Economic Development Administration account to offset this cost. 
   I think that Congress must do all that we can do to provide appropriate resources to the hardworking men and women serving at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Every day these brave public servants stand on the front lines of our Federal law enforcement efforts and on the domestic front on the war on terror, and they need and they deserve all the support that Congress can give. 
   Many of my colleagues know that I have a real and very personal appreciation of the organization of which my father served as Director of the FBI between 1987 and 1993. I have nothing but the greatest respect for all the sacrifices that these agents make on behalf of our country, and I am happy to be able to come to the floor today with this amendment to support that great work. 
   As the report to the bill notes, since September 11, 2001, the FBI has undergone a significant transformation. They are being asked to make hard choices about resource allocation as they track domestic terrorist threats, arrest suspected drug kingpins, and ensure that criminals, from bank robbers to corrupt businessmen to tax cheats, are brought to justice. 
   Even with an increase of around $500 million in this bill, the FBI's salary request still faces a deficit. While I wish this amendment could go further, I understand the constraints of the budget authority and the outlay rules that Congress must follow. 
   Regardless, I believe that this is an amendment that will send a clear and unmistakable signal to the men and women of the FBI that we support them, that we support their hard work, and that we support all that they are doing to keep us safe. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to show your support for these brave men and women. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this structured rule and to a number of provisions included in the underlying provision in its current form. I oppose this legislation because it substitutes the deliberate and long-studied recommendation of well-trained Forest Service professionals with a purely political congressional action by designating 27,000 additional acres, which are land in the Forest Service today, as wilderness, beyond the Forest Service recommendation of 16,000 acres in southwestern Virginia's Jefferson National Forest. 
   This means that despite having spent millions of congressionally appropriated tax dollars and investing tens of thousands in on-the-ground Federal employee hours on studying this issue, the Democrat leadership will simply override the Forest Service's well-reasoned decision to force this additional acreage into wilderness status. This also, despite the fact that many of the areas proposed in this legislation do not meet the standards of the 1964 Wilderness Act, including roads, utility corridors, mountain biking areas, and a Federal Aviation Administration tower. These should not be considered within wilderness area, and yet, today, that's exactly what is happening. 
   Today's bill makes private landowners to the area vulnerable to the Jefferson National Forest Plan ultimate goal of obtaining all private lands within these expanded wilderness boundaries, including 722 total acres of outstanding privately held mineral rights. 
   What is even worse is that thousands of acres in this proposed wilderness area are at high risk for wildfire and require mechanical thinning for proper fire risk mitigation. Many of these areas are next to the small communities that will be placed at even greater risk of catastrophic wild fires if this land is not managed properly.     
   So even as the threat posed by wildfires to American communities all across this country is fresh on our minds, as we watch with great concern and sympathy the unbelievable damage these wildfires are inflicting on Southern California, nonetheless, the Democrat leadership of this House has decided that the best course of action is to extremely limit and outright prohibit commonsense reduction activities across this Jefferson National Forest in Virginia. 
   Besides the private land owners and homeowners adjacent to this land, other losers created by this legislation include a number of animal species covered by the Endangered Species Act, including bats and bears. Currently, several of the proposed wilderness areas added by this legislation are professionally managed to maintain threatened endangered and sensitive species habitat. By passing the legislation under this rule, Congress will be preventing the Forest Service from using the equipment that they need to comply with the Endangered Species Act. 
   This makes no sense, Mr. Speaker. It makes absolutely no sense why this new Democrat majority throws aside not only the expressed opportunities that the Forest Service have given us to understand proper management, but they will override professionals who have studied this and do this for a living. 
   Perhaps worst of all, Mr. Speaker, because this draconian ``wilderness'' designation prevents any road or trails from being improved in these areas, a number of our Nation's most vulnerable populations such as the elderly and disabled will be effectively prevented from accessing and enjoying this piece of America under this bill. It absolutely makes no sense, Mr. Speaker. 
   I'm sorry we're having to be on the floor today to take this position, because the Republican Party is in favor of our national parks, is in favor of people utilizing our national parks, and we view these areas as very historic areas that we want to preserve and make right and keep them. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is bad public policy. I oppose this structured rule and the underlying legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from California's words about the tragedies that are occurring. Not only for the past few days, but also, as always, anytime there's a wildfire, people who get in the way, the brave men and women of the National Park Service and others who go to help fight those fires, I know the Nation is at this time very focused on the lives and the property and the effort that is going on in California. 
   With great respect, I too, join the gentlewoman from California for expressing our sincere appreciation for the firefighters who are trying to battle and save the property and the lives in California. 
   Mr. Speaker, for perhaps the same reason that the gentlewoman from California has come down to join in this discussion today, perhaps with an opposite result, I, too, am down on the floor to talk about how wise management of our natural resources, of our Parks Service, is important. You don't have to go back really as far as Teddy Roosevelt to understand what Teddy Roosevelt saw, that this great Nation had the abundance of beautiful woodlands, hills, mountains, streams, the acreage included within that, the beautiful animals, the birds, the fish, the wolves that were a part of our landscape. And that's why national parks were created. National parks were created with an opportunity for the Federal Government to have a chance to allow people to come and see this great country, to see the beautiful country that we had. 
   As a young man growing up and scouting, I remember well the opportunity that I had to not only visit national parks, but a chance to get what is called the Forestry Merit Badge. And even back in 1965 or 1966, when I was receiving this badge, I remember, this is not the term that was used, best practices, but one has become used as a term of best practice and that is, wise management of our forests to not only sustain them, but to protect them, and to protect the animals and all that lives and counts on that forest surviving. We've learned these wise management techniques, not just in scouting to get the Forestry Merit Badge, but we have learned them through the years. We've learned that sometimes unwise management and doing things to our park system, in fact, caused more damage than it did good. 
   I remember back with the fires that we had in Yellowstone, how the National Park Service said just let it burn, it is a fire created by an act of God. But they really, as a result of that, learned that they had to learn a better practice to save millions of acres and millions of animals that could be destroyed. 
   Well, part of that best practice is what the National Park Service is attempting to do right now and has been attempting to do in this national park today. It is against their recommendation that politically we override the best practices, the best thoughts and ideas that people have who manage our park system, who do see the balance, who are there every day with the careful consideration. 
   By designating this area, an extensive amount of area, as wilderness, it means that arbitrarily, we're taking something that would never qualify under the intended statutes and add it in. I think this is unwise. This is how you do have problems. This is how you do have fires that burn out of control when you're not able to come in and protect the forest properly as a result of this designation. This is how you have problems when you're not able to take care of the endangered species that are in there and properly protect them, because it will have that wilderness designation. 
   And so with great respect for the same purpose that the gentlewoman from California came to notify us and to remember what America's paying attention to today, the wildfires in California, I would say we need that same sort of vision to avoid what could be in the time of drought or in the time of misdeed because of perhaps a lightning storm, something that's an unintended consequence, and that is to take this area and to move it into wilderness means that it will not receive or be able to receive the same kind of regular work that happens to protect these wilderness areas and national parks from destruction of a fire. I think it's a bad idea. 
   I think it's also a bad idea any time politicians in Washington, D.C. for political purposes decide to overrule common sense. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 5 minutes to the ranking member of the Rules Committee, the gentleman from San Dimas, California (Mr. Dreier).

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close at this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so that I may amend the rule to have Speaker Pelosi, in consultation with Republican Leader BOEHNER, immediately appoint conferees to H.R. 2642, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for 2008. 
   Yesterday a number of news publications, including Roll Call, reported that the Democrat leadership intends to hold off sending appropriations bills to President Bush so that they can use an upcoming anticipated veto of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill to serve as ``an extension of their successful public relations campaign on the State Children's Health Insurance Program.'' 
   While the Democrat leadership plays politics on this issue, however, our Nation's veterans are paying the price. For every day that the Democrats allow the veterans funding bill to languish without conferees for their own political agenda, our Nation's veterans lose $18.5 million, which could be used for veterans health care, veterans housing, and other important support activities for veterans and their families. 
   I would like to repeat that. Every single day there is $18.5 million that is lost for our veterans and their families. 
   On October 18, the American Legion National Commander Marty J. Conaster, five national vice commanders, and all 55 Legion National Executive Committee members sent Speaker Pelosi a letter pleading with her to put partisanship aside and provide this funding now for our veterans and troops.     
   At this time, I will insert this letter into the Congressional Record.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this modified closed rule and to the underlying legislation. I also rise, regrettably, to report to the American people that, for the second week in a row, the Democrat leadership is bringing legislation to the House floor that benefits big labor bosses at someone else's expense. 
   Last week, American workers were the losers in the Democrat-controlled House when the majority leadership forced through legislation that would provide for unprecedented intimidation of employees by union bosses under a fundamentally anti-democratic process known as card check. 
   This week, the Democrat leadership has set its sights on one of their favorite targets, the American taxpayer. But the other losers in this bargain are far more shocking. They include local communities across the United States, small and minority-owned businesses, and the environment. 
   H.R. 720 would provide for an unprecedented expansion of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage provision of the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund or SRF. When the SRF was established, it applied Davis-Bacon only to the Federal portion of a Clean Water project. But today, in order to help big labor bosses pad their dwindling ranks, they would apply these same provisions to all non-Federal funds, such as loan repayments, State bond revenues, interest and State-matching funds. 
   Since the SRF program expired in 1995, no SRF project has been subject to Davis-Bacon. But today the Democrat Party wants to change that and to stack the deck in favor of big labor bosses whose ranks have dwindled to 12 percent in 2006 from their high of 35 percent in the 1950s. 
   I insert into the Record a letter from my colleague from Florida, JOHN MICA, to Rules Committee Chairwoman Slaughter and Ranking Member Dreier detailing the specifics of this unprecedented expansion.

   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her words, except I would like to let her know, I know she was not in the body last year, but this body did pass a minimum wage bill last year. It should be noted that the bill included exactly what the Democrat leadership wanted, and we took their bill exactly as it was for minimum wage. The problem that the Democrat leadership had was that it was a balanced approach, and that is the reason why it did not move forward in the other body and why the President never got it. 
   Mr. Speaker, what the Republicans did was to take the Democrat bill on minimum wage and add to that a balanced provision which would help small businesses who are bearing the burden of most of the brunt of the minimum wage and allow them the opportunity to offset those changes so that we can continue growing the free market economy. Small business is the engine of our economy. 
   It is also worth noting, since the gentlewoman brought it up, that this body this year did pass a minimum wage without those equalizing factors or benefits to small business, and that is why it got stuck in the other body and why this body is having to come back to correct it to make it a more balanced view, the same kind of balanced view that the Republicans took last year in order to pass the minimum wage. 
   I know the gentlewoman was not here last year, but those are the facts of the case.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the Rules Committee we had an opportunity to receive a number of amendments and have feedback from Members who were talking about these important water projects, and I found one amendment yesterday that was presented very interesting. It was rejected by the Democrats, but it says this: 
   ``This amendment quadruples the current penalty for dumping sewage into the Great Lakes to $100,000 per violation per day. The amendment also establishes a Great Lakes Clean-Up Fund within the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, and directs the sewage dumping penalties into this new fund to be spent on wastewater treatment options.'' Here is the interesting part: ``These provisions would become effective January 1, 2027.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, a colleague brought forth an amendment as a result of a discussion with a major mayor of a city on the Great Lakes. I have heard all sorts of conversations about how important clean water is. Yet the Great Lakes, which is an area of about 20 million people that need this clean water, wake up today to find out that someone was willing to come forward with an idea which, even if enacted, doesn't take place until January 1, 2027. 
   No, we are not going to do that in the Rules Committee. 
   So on one side the Democrat majority talks about how great they are for all this clean water. But when it really comes down to it, still 20 million people are being denied this opportunity to start this clean water revolving fund and direct that sewage dumped into the Great Lakes would be cleaned up and have higher penalties. Utterly incredible.

   What we are trying to do is get work done that is in the best interest of not only Americans who need these projects to complete things that have been done to their communities as a result of damage but also to move forward with more efficiency.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Los Angeles. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are here today as a result of the meeting in the Rules Committee last night where members of the Republican minority tried to speak about our desire to have more added to this ``simple resolution,'' as it is being called by the minority. And that it is, a simple resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, we implored upon the committee to make in order more amendments which would specifically speak directly to the needs of trying to provide direction and to work with the President of the United States on where we are in Iraq. In fact, on March 15, 2006, Members of both parties from this body supported the creation of a bipartisan Iraq Study Group to review the situation on the ground and to propose strategies on a way to move forward. 
   For more than 8 months, the study group met with military officials, regional experts, academics, journalists and other high-level officials. This study group included James Baker and Lee Hamilton as cochairmen. It included Lawrence Eagleburger, Vernon Jordan, Ed Meese, Sandra Day O'Connor, Leon Panetta, William J. Perry, Charles S. Robb and Alan Simpson. 
   Mr. Speaker, we believe that the things which were embodied within this Iraq Study Group report, which came out this last December, embody the kinds of things that the President of the United States is attempting to do now in Iraq. The President stood before each and every one of us as we sat in this Chamber just a few weeks ago and he outlined very clearly the changes that are taking place and his willingness not only to work with this body, but willingness to be more specific. 
   I would like to read some of the things from the Iraq Study Group report that we will not be hearing as the voice of the United States Congress. That is, that the United States should work to ``provide political reassurance to the Iraqi Government in order to avoid its collapse and the disintegration of the country.'' 
   America should ``fight al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations in Iraq using more special operations teams.'' 
   We should ``train, equip and support the Iraqi security forces.'' 
   And we should ``deter even more destructive interference in Iraq by Syria and Iran.'' 
   But there is more. The ``more'' is ``We could, however, support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad, or to speed up training to equip the mission.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is what this resolution, that is nonbinding, is all about is to politically neuter the President of the United States, and, I believe, our forces and our mission in Iraq. It is about trying to do something that is politics, rather than policy. 
   The Rules Committee last night heard from several of our colleagues, one of them Sam Johnson, who brought forth an amendment that would clarify that Congress and the American people support our troops and the funding for our Armed Forces that are serving in harm's way to make sure that we do not put that element at risk. 
   Our colleague from Virginia, Frank Wolf, brought forth the things that I just spoke about. He brought to the Rules Committee the recommendations from the Iraq Study Group, with this emphasis on providing American commanders in Iraq with the strategic and tactical means to support this war. However, my colleagues on the Democratic side have decided that what they  want to do is they want to have this be all about politics and not about policy. They are after a simple answer.  
   Last night, the Rules Committee met--and after hours of testimony from members from both parties, the Democrat members of the Committee voted along party lines to shut out every opportunity for amendment to the Resolution that the House will be considering over the next 3 days. 
   Our colleague from Texas, SAM JOHNSON, brought an amendment that would have clarified that Congress and the American people support our troops and that funding for our armed forces serving bravely in harm's way will not be cut off or restricted in any way. 
   Our colleague from Virginia, FRANK WOLF, also brought to the Rules Committee a very comprehensive amendment that would have made clear that Congress supports the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group--with its emphasis on providing American commanders serving in Iraq with the strategic and tactical means that they need for success and accelerated cooperation with Iraqi leaders to meet specific goals--as the strategy for moving forward to success in Iraq. 
   A number of other members also spent a large part of their evening sitting in the Rules Committee, waiting to share their ideas about how to improve this resolution--however, unfortunately the 13 members of the Rules Committee are the only ones who will have the benefit of hearing and debating these good ideas, because none of them were given the opportunity to be considered and voted on by the House. 
   Instead, today we are on the floor with a completely closed process to debate a non-binding resolution with no teeth and a serious logical flaw. 
   In 2 short paragraphs, without explicitly stating that funds will not be cut off from our troops serving in harm's way, the resolution asserts that Congress and the American people will continue to support and protect the members of Armed Forces who are serving in Iraq. This non-specific language is something that every member of this House clearly supports. 
   It also states that Congress disapproves of the President's plan to deploy 20,000 reinforcements to Iraq to bolster the mission and provide additional support to troops already serving on the ground. 
   This resolution gives no direction about how we should proceed in Iraq--instead, it settles for some generic language about supporting the troops without guaranteeing that Congress will continue to fund their efforts as they remain in harm's way--and it simply amounts to a vote for the status quo. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a serious debate for serious people. We all understand that the cost of failure in Iraq is too great to bear--it would embolden radical Islamic terrorists and give them a base from which to train and attack America for generations. 
   But with this resolution my colleagues on the other side of the aisle provide the troops with nothing: no guarantees that we will continue to fund their heroic efforts; no guarantees that Congress will heed the advice of the Iraq Study group--which notes on page 73 of their report that it would ``support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad, or to speed up the training and equipping mission.'' 
   Nor does it provide the American people with a clear picture of our direction in Iraq--it merely says ``no'' to the only strategy for success which has been put forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that Congress can do better than this nonbinding vote for the status quo in Iraq. I know that a number of my Republican colleagues tried to improve this legislation, but were denied the opportunity by the Democrat majority. 
   But I know that our troops serving in harm's way, and the American people deserve better than this simplistic resolution that provides no new ideas, outlines no strategy for victory, and makes no guarantee that we will continue to fund the efforts of our troops. 
   I am greatly disappointed in this resolution and the Democrat majority's efforts to prevent this body from considering amendments from thoughtful members to improve it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman, my friend from Ohio, for extending the time to me. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this once again closed rule, and to the underlying previously failed legislation that this Democrat majority is bringing to the House floor, without having made any substantive improvements to it since it last failed on this House on July 30, and despite an agreement during that time that they would work with members of the Republican Party to try and better the bill. 
   Like every other Member of this House, I'm concerned about the crushing economic impact that rising food and fuel prices are having on American families. That is why I strongly support the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's recent steps to increase transparency in the oil futures market and their continued vigor in enforcing existing laws governing U.S. futures markets, including the long-time prohibition against market manipulation. 
   My concern for the economic and retirement security of American families is also why I do support certain parts of this bill, including its increased data reporting requirements, and its authorization of at least 100 new full-time employees to increase the public transparency of operations in agriculture and energy markets, and otherwise monitor price manipulation and commodities futures market. 
   However, it is this same concern for American families and our American economy that forces me to oppose a bill that has the potential to destabilize commodity prices and dry up market liquidity at a particularly vulnerable time for our entire economy, instead of simply increasing transparency and improving enforcement. 
   While I disagree with his approach to improving our Nation's commodities market, the chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture and I do agree about several things. First, yesterday evening in the Rules Committee, my friend, COLLIN PETERSON, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, testified that he was not, was not bringing this bill to the floor because he thought that it would bring down the price of energy at the pump for American families. He does not believe it will. I don't believe it will bring down prices at the pump. And he's exactly correct. 
   This bill, like the no-energy sham legislation that the Democrat majority brought to the floor just earlier this week, this bill will do absolutely nothing, absolutely nothing to increase the supply of American-made energy that is the root of the high energy prices that are taking an enormous toll on American families and businesses. 
   Second, I agree with Chairman Peterson's assertion in his testimony yesterday to the Rules Committee that he did not believe this bill would actually become law. 
   So here we are, taking time on the House floor, when the American people need action by this Congress to do something about energy legislation that will be signed into law, that will include doing something about the price at the pump. And instead, Chairman Peterson said, I don't even think this bill's going to become law. We're not going to agree to this. 
   Like him, I do not think that this bill represents a serious attempt, which is what Congress should be about, especially as we near the end of the session, a serious attempt at providing legislative solutions to the very serious problems facing our economy, and that it is little more than a second opportunity this week for Members to claim, ah, but we're up there doing something, up there working 5-day workweeks. 
   We need to be doing something about addressing the high cost of energy. Without taking real and meaningful action to open up energy reserves, it simply will not happen. That's what the economy needs. We need to do something about the high price of energy. 
   If this were a serious attempt to solve our Nation's problems, Democrat leadership forcing this bill onto the floor would have made more than technical changes to the bill that failed just last time it was here, July 30, changes like the one proposed by my good friend and former CPA, MIKE CONAWAY of Texas, where he, in a colloquy with Chairman Peterson, talked about the need to create a common understanding of risk management needs which market participants should be eligible for in a bona fide hedge exemption. 
   Of course there was an agreement on the floor, talk is cheap, about, yes, we'll work with you. And, in fact, that never happened. Never happened. 
   And then last night, given an opportunity in the Rules Committee, the Rules Committee, once again, even seeing the agreement that was made and that the offer was not accepted, did not even want to make Mr. Conaway's amendment in order. A real shame. A real shame for a House where there was a promise of the most open, honest and ethical Congress in history. 
   Instead, this House is getting something that is even worse than nothing, a bill that the Democrat majority didn't even see fit to include in its first so-called energy bill this week, which is also bringing to the floor its record-shattering 61st closed rule for this Congress. 
   Open. Honest. Ethical. 
   Madam Speaker, yesterday we had a chance to help just correct that just a little bit and level the playing field. Mr. Conaway was slam dunked in the Rules Committee again, despite what was said on this floor about working with members of the Republican Party. Better idea, a better way to make the bill happen. 
   Madam Speaker, unfortunately, this kind of closed process and this kind of cynical, political motivated work product has become characteristic of what we have seen now for almost 20 months. The most honest, most open and most ethical Congress in history, as promised by Speaker Pelosi back in 2006, and it's no wonder that the American people are giving Congress historic low, record low ratings on approvals for the job that Congress is trying to do. 
   I think we ought to be serious about our work. I think we should not bring bills to the floor where the committee chairman, at the time he presents his bill to the Rules Committee, admits this is never going to become law. It's a shame. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this rule and the underlying legislation which the Democrats don't believe will bring down energy prices when they crafted this supposedly comprehensive energy package earlier this week, and which the chairman of jurisdiction does not believe is a good reason for doing so now. 
   The American people are hurting. Our economy is hurting. People back home want leadership in Washington, and once again, the majority party has failed. 
   I think we should deserve more from the leadership. I believe that the Democrat Party should not have a closed process. I believe running for political cover for a vote that will go nowhere is a mistake. But I do know it's for their vulnerable Members, Members who want to pretend that they're doing something. What a shame. 
   I oppose this process. I oppose this rule. I oppose the underlying legislation, and I hope all of my colleagues will do the same. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I extend myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this is why last night or yesterday afternoon in the Rules Committee there was a very polite discussion and a request made by Republicans in the committee once we recognized that there were some problems that took place that were unavoidable on behalf of the chairman of the committee, on behalf of notice to Republicans, on behalf of a colloquy that engaged Members on this floor where we realized, Oh, I'm sorry. That just didn't happen. And we will not say it was anybody's fault, but there was agreement that there was a problem. 
   This is where the Rules Committee comes into play. The Rules Committee is a body that should have the ability to look fairly and equitably at an issue and then make a decision. 
   I had a discussion with the committee. I have only served on the committee 10 years. But I have seen people bring legislation to the committee and ask for relief and receive relief. Normally, if we were in January, February, March, April, May, some other time, open rules are not always allowed or amendments aren't always allowed  because they seem to open up all other issues and ideas. 
   This was a very specific idea. This was an idea that was agreed upon that there would be a discussion, and the Rules Committee slam dunked the gentleman from Texas as well as Republican Members after hearing positive testimony from both sides, not even giving relief. 
   This is exactly what Republicans are talking about, and I believe the American people, that this Democrat majority and the Rules Committee, which set a record-shattering 61 closed rules--for any Congress a record--simply is so flatlined upon doing politically what they choose to do and by showing their power that there is not even a voice that's open. 
   What the gentleman has suggested to us today is that he knew of no other process for the gentleman to go through. Well, it's called an amendment that would be on the floor of the House of Representatives where our colleagues cannot only hear the issue but then get a chance to vote on it. 
   So today we're here without the ability to vote on it, but we have the gentleman, Mr. Conaway, and I would like to yield him 5 minutes.

Madam Speaker, last night on the floor of the House of Representatives, the gentleman, ZACH WAMP, came down to make a thoughtful argument about the predicament that this country is in with not having enough energy available at the gas pumps and that that has caused prices to rise very dramatically and that there really is an answer and something that can be done. I'm pleased to welcome the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp), and I'd like to extend him 4 minutes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his thoughtful comments. 
   Madam Speaker, since taking control of this House, this Democrat Congress has totally neglected its responsibility to address the domestic supply issues that have created skyrocketing gas, diesel, and energy costs the American families are facing. We heard the gentleman, Mr. Wamp, talk about how there were good ideas that should have been available, including a bipartisan working group and bipartisan legislation that, when it really came down to it, somebody put pressure on a whole bunch of our friends in the Democrat Party to then vote against even their own bill so that it was not bipartisan. 
   By going on vacation for 5 weeks over August, while I and 138 other of my Republican colleagues stayed in this body on this floor to talk about real energy solutions with American families, this Democrat majority has proved that they do not believe that the energy crisis facing American families and businesses is important enough to cancel their summer beach plans or book tours. They claimed they were going to come back and do something about it. However, enough of their Members must have heard from frustrated constituents over August who were tired of this shell game that the Democrat political leadership is pushing off on the American people. 
   We would think that it should warrant some kind of action. Because today we are considering yet another measure to provide their Members with political cover, we're going to see that there will be nothing that will be done. Even their own chairman of the committee said this isn't going to become law. It's not going to pass. We didn't even really know it was going to come up. No notice was given to Republicans till 3 hours before it was going to come to the Rules Committee, and perhaps worse than that, then people said, and Republicans didn't even present any amendments. 
   So today I urge my colleagues to vote with me to defeat the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, I will move to amend the rule to allow this House so that we can take up the measure that prevents Members from going home to campaign for reelection without actually passing an energy bill that will be signed into law. 
   Madam Speaker, we should do better. We should allow States to expand the exploration and extraction of natural resources along the Outer Continental Shelf. We should open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and oil shale reserves in this country, and we can do it in environmentally sensitive and prudent ways. We should extend expiring renewable energy incentives. We should encourage the streamlined approval of new refining capacity and nuclear power facilities. My gosh, if France can have 82 percent of their power from nuclear, why can't the United States get above where we are? 
   We should encourage advanced research and development of clean coal, coal-to-liquid, and carbon technologies, and perhaps more importantly, which is the sham about the entire Democrat leadership's bill is, we should do something about stopping the lawsuits which are creating a circumstance in courts to where none of these leases are able to move forward for production because they're in lawsuits, and the Democrat leadership did not even address this. It's simple. Consolidate and expedite the drawn-out legal challenges that unreasonably delay or prevent actual domestic energy production. 
   Why wouldn't we want, if we're going to pass this bill, to make sure that it would happen, when in fact every Member of this body knows that for every single, 100 percent, of all the leases that have been agreed to are wrapped up in court right now, in Federal court right now. Why not do something that would give relief to the American people? Why not say let's at least one of these opportunities take place for drilling, just one? How about 10 percent? No, it's got to be 100 percent, and the American people are going to learn what the Democrat Party already knows, and that is, that the Democrat leadership does not want any drilling. They want no drilling. 
   Senator Obama, I'm sure was correct. He is opposed to drilling so that America can be competitive with the world.     
   This requirement would finally force the Democrat leadership to take meaningful action. 
   If we were going to get what I just talked about, that would mean somebody who's in control of both Houses of Congress wanting to do something. And we stand here today, the Republican Party, once again, as we did all of August, asking for us to do something that will work to bring relief. It's a supply side issue. 
   So, Madam Speaker, here we go. A shell game, a Rules Committee that allows no good ideas--except their own that the Democrat leadership has; agreements, which were talked about on the floor, which, when it really came down to it, not sure we really want to live up to at all. There is always a bigger problem. Well, that's not what this floor of the House is for, that's not really what the Rules Committee is for. That's not what Congress is for. Congress should be about, especially in a crisis, coming to an agreement and working together. 
   I think we can do better. I think it's going to be something that the American people are going to have to decide what the tie is between Republicans and Democrats. I guess it's going to come to an election, where the American people are going to be told the facts of the case, and they will see what kind of action is necessary in Washington, D.C. 
   Madam Speaker, the Republican Party is again on giving the American people and this body notice that the Republican Party is for us doing the things which will bring down the price of energy, which will create long-term economic stimulus and opportunity for this country. Because we recognize that energy prices are too high and it impacts every sector of our economy--trucking, the food that's made, produced, the food that gets to marketplace, the opportunities for school systems to operate within their budget, the chance for American families who have to go to their job, many times who have to commute. 
   We need real action, not a slam-dunk Rules Committee that will set a record every time they go to meet for a new closed rule, not offering new ideas, not listening to the American people about the ability that we need to have to bring to bear American energy products. Instead, we get the same worn-out message of what's happened over the last 2 years where America has lost 14 percent more of market shares, where we have to go overseas to those countries that will produce and will drill. 
   The American people look up and find out now that this Congress says no, no drilling in Florida, and so other countries will come off our shores and take our energy.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, back on April 24, 2006, almost 2 years ago to the day, now Speaker Pelosi released a statement, which I quote, ``Americans this week are paying $2.91 a gallon on average for regular gasoline, 33 cents higher than last month, and double the price when President Bush first came into office.'' 
   Speaker Pelosi went on to claim, and I quote again, that ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.''     
   Mr. Speaker, the Pelosi petroleum price increase continues to rise, with the average price over $3.50, hitting consumers at the pump every time they fill up their car. 
   By voting ``no'' on the previous question, Members can take a stand against these high prices and demand to see the secret plan that Speaker Pelosi has to reduce gas prices that Democrats have been hiding from the American people since taking control of Congress 17 months ago. I for one would love to see it, but I am afraid that, much like their promises to run the most honest, open and ethical Congress in history, it simply does not exist.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from New York for yielding me the time for this important proposed rule for consideration of H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   Unlike my colleague, I rise in opposition to the structured rule, and I would like to quote a colleague whose opinions on these matters I respect to explain why. 
   On September 15, 2005, my Democrat Rules Committee colleague from Florida, Congressman ALCEE HASTINGS, correctly stated that the modified open rule under which the Coast Guard was last reauthorized was insufficient in living up to how this House should be run. 
   While that Republican rule permitted Members who preprinted their amendments in the Congressional Record to offer those amendments, he noted his disappointment ``that the preprinting of amendments was even required. Despite the majority's claim, this legislative process which they call open is actually restricted. It is not an open rule because every Member is not permitted to offer any germane amendment.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, as imperfect and insufficient as that rule may have been to Mr. Hastings in 2005 and his minority Democrat colleagues, today's rule pales and fails in comparison--despite the often-repeated Democrat promises to run the most open, honest and ethical House in history. 
   This rule, which is even more restrictive, makes in order a majority of Democrat amendments and strips every Member with a new, good and germane idea of how to improve this legislation of the ability to come to the floor and even to offer it. 
   While the Democrats on the Rules Committee may have been following the wishes of their committee chairman by reporting out this rule, they have once again directly contradicted their campaign promises of their own leadership to run an open House of Representatives, instead choosing to become the most closed Congress in history. 
   Mr. Speaker, while this rule and this standard of recurring policy of closing down the legislative process is bad for the House, the effect of this legislation is even worse for American consumers. It continues the same flawed ``no-energy energy policy'' that Democrats have followed blindly for the last 17 months. 
   A provision included in this legislation would essentially shut down the development of new LNG plants which seem counterintuitive given today's energy crisis. Natural gas is one of the most clean-burning fossil fuels, and passing this provision would only further reduce our energy supply while moving us further from energy independence for which Republicans have consistently advocated. 
   Time and time again this Democrat leadership has consistently promised to deliver a ``commonsense'' energy plan to reduce the cost of gasoline. However, since my friends on the other side of the aisle have taken control of Congress, the average price of a gallon of gasoline has risen more than a dollar, from $2.33 in January 2007 to just over $3.51 this week. 
   I have supported a number of this Congress's bipartisan efforts to reduce demand--like legislation to increase CAFE standards. But Americans literally cannot afford for Congress to continue to ignore the supply-side issues and problems associated with this overall issue. Specifically, that this Democrat majority continues to pursue a national energy policy that does absolutely nothing to increase our ability to produce more energy. Without a supply-side response, prices will continue to rise. 
   It is a fact that enough oil exists in deep waters off America's coasts and in our Federal lands to power 60 million cars for 60 years. Yet these domestic resources remain off-limits to exploration because of the Democrat policies that pervade this House. 
   In 1995, the Clinton administration vetoed the bill that would have allowed environmentally sound domestic exploration in Alaska. During this debate, opponents of the legislation argued that the benefits would be at least 10 years away and would not be worth it. Well, it is now more than 10 years later and the cost of crude oil has gone from just under $20 a barrel to nearly $120 a barrel and we are no closer to energy independence than we were 13 years ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope for the sake of American consumers, and for the sake of their paychecks, that it does not take this Democrat majority another 10 years to realize that now is the time that we should focus on ways to utilize our own energy resources. It is called energy independence. 
   For prices to fall, Congress should be considering legislation that increases supply and reduces demand, not legislation like today's, that simply reduces the supply of one of the planet's cleanest fossil fuels. 
   These are basic commonsense economic principles that should be part of a commonsense plan. I encourage all of my colleagues to recognize that now is the time to stop ignoring our untapped domestic supply. I oppose this rule.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, we just heard an argument. That is okay. I can understand that people want to blame President Bush for things. But the fact of the matter is that the pressure on this issue comes directly to the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party that absolutely cuts America off from being energy independent. They are the people, not OPEC, that have caused America to have to go to OPEC to get our oil. And in the time when there is competition for this oil because we don't produce our own here in the United States, of course you're going to pay more money. 
   To blame this on George Bush, when in fact it is the Democratic Party that has shut off America from energy independence, from the ability that it has to go, just one case, to the Arctic Wildlife Reserve to be able to get millions and millions of barrels of oil that reside within our own United States. We are the ones, as a result of the Democratic Party, that have to go to OPEC to buy the fuel we need. 
   It is an absolutely ridiculous argument to blame George Bush when in fact it was Bill Clinton as President who vetoed the bill which would have given us millions of barrels of oil back in 1995, available to consumers today. It is the Democratic Party and the ability from the Speaker, the current Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, to follow what we have with their public policy to make sure that Americans are paying more at the pump today. But you can't blame George Bush. 
   Let's put the blame where it really is, and that is America is not energy independent. We have to go to other places, we have to get oil, and the world wants the same thing from that marketplace. So rather than throwing insults at each other, why don't we do something about it.

   What we need to do is have a real live debate on this floor where we figure out that America should become energy independent. That means we would be able to not only produce the oil and the energy from this country, but we would be able to have the jobs that come from that.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing us to be on the floor this evening to talk about very important issues. 
   And of course the House of Representatives, in recess right now, is beginning to prepare for the funeral for our colleague, JO ANN DAVIS of Virginia, who passed away. Today, our colleagues came to the floor one by one to not only acknowledge the service that JO ANN DAVIS gave to the United States of America, but also in her representation of her congressional district JO ANN will be missed. JO ANN courageously fought cancer. JO ANN courageously went back home day after day, week after week, after serving the United States Congress, making sure that she talked about those things which she did in her job and her representation of people from Virginia, but perhaps more importantly, with the strength and character and courage that JO ANN, even in the midst of adversity, brought to this body was an inspiration to Republicans and Democrats alike. It is with a heavy heart that we all will miss her, and we say to her family, how much they know they will miss her, too, and to her constituents, they were well served. Mr. Speaker, we will miss JO ANN DAVIS from Virginia. 
   Mr. Speaker, tonight I come to the floor of the House of Representatives to talk about the things which I believe are important for so many people to understand, not just about what is happening here in Washington, DC between the two parties, the Republican Party and the Democrat Party, as we talk about public policy issues that are demanding on both parties, and certainly our President and the American people who want to, and do, recognize that America's greatest days lie in our future, but rather, not just understanding the philosophies which are talked about here, but they want to know more about them. What would those policies lead to? And tonight it is my intent, with several of my Republican colleagues, to talk about the Republican vision, the Republican vision that would be of a smaller, smarter,  commonsense government versus the Democrat agenda, which is ineffective, wasteful and intrusive government. 
   The Republican Party for so many years has been really the party of the free enterprise system, the free enterprise system which has made America the envy of the world, which has made the Republican Party and this great Nation to not only grow in stature, but to provide dreams, dreams to Americans and dreams for people around the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, just in March of this year, the Financial Times out of London put forth a pretty interesting editorial where they talked about that the EU, now 25 combined nations of the EU has a GDP that equals that of the United States of America, or at least where the United States of America was 25 years ago; meaning that Europe consolidated all of their resources to the EU, the European Union, to these 25 nations, and when they combine all that they have equal that of the United States GDP 25 years ago. 
   What is interesting is that they also look at the amount of spending that would take place within their medical system and within research and development in medicine, and both those lag 25 years behind the United States. 
   The United States of America has a strong and vibrant system, the free enterprise system, as a result of not just the United States Congress and tax cuts and making sure that we have the greatest health care system in the world, but it comes as a result of what you're going to hear tonight of a public policy that is ennunciated from a Republican vision. And certainly, as we look at what has made America great, you would want to look at, well, why has Europe lagged so far behind? I mean, after all, Europe could do the exact same things that America does. They have education. They have wonderful people. They have innovate ideas and opportunities. I would submit to you it is because of the public policy. And the public policy that they have in Europe really has three basic tenets that are entirely different than the United States has, our free enterprise system. And that was pretty much ennunciated by what you saw tonight; we're talking about health care, where it's a State-run program. This is what the Democratic Party is pushing for their public policy. They want a State-run, single-payer health care system, just like Europe. 
   We also see rules and regulations. Europe is completely covered up with rules and regulations that tell not only employers but also employees exactly how they will be treated. Forget the free enterprise system, forget innovativeness, forget the new opportunities that people might have to bring new products and services. You've got to look up the union rule book; you've got to find out what you can do. 
   And lastly, the third tenet that separates the United States of America from the European model is taxation. Taxes began as a battle point under Ronald Reagan here in this country. And we recognized that back under Ronald Reagan, and the President recognized it, that our taxes were not just too high, they were stifling innovativeness and the free enterprise system. They were stifling the ability that we had to grow our free enterprise system in favor of giving the money to the government, to grow the size of government. And as our President, Ronald Reagan, said, he hoped that he would change that to where America once again would be the shining city on the hill. In fact, that did take place. As we cut taxes, as we became prepared for the future way back when Ronald Reagan was President to be prepared today, and for the last few years, for America to propel itself forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Financial Times was right when they said in March that the European Union could not compete against the United States economically because of the three tenets that make the EU different, and that is, high taxes, more rules and regulations, and single-payer system for health care. 
   Tonight, you are going to hear members of the Republican Party talk about how that is virtually exactly what the Democrat Party agenda is for this great Nation. And tonight you're going to hear Republicans talk about smaller, smarter, commonsense government whereby we not only balance budgets, where we have tax reform, where we have health care that works on behalf of people to where we can maintain the greatest health care system in the world. We will talk about agriculture; the gentleman from the great State of Oregon (Mr. Walden) is here to do that. We will talk about intelligence and homeland security. And lastly, we intend to talk about education. 
   It is with great honor tonight that I am joined by a dear colleague who is from the State of Oregon, the gentleman from Oregon, and I would yield to him at this time.

And I'm going to let you amplify that, but as we in America looked at France, and just in the past few years as we looked at a closed system that they have to where they're not only having to have people to come through immigration to their country, they are not able to grow their economy, to be able to bring them into their economy so that they can be real positives. It's a closed system.

The fact of the matter is that every 2 years there is an election, but now, the year before the election, we have engaged in so much bashing of not only America but really how great America is. 
   What the gentleman talks about here would also be true with trade, about how America has found a way to find trading partners all around the globe to reduce tariffs. And if there is one thing, and the gentleman knows that I am a big scouter with the Boy Scouts of America. I teach merit badge classes back home. All of my scouters learn right off the bat, what is a tariff? 
   And they respond, it is a tax. We are reducing taxes and allowing countries all around the globe to be able to compete so that they better their own economic circumstances and end poverty in their own country. This is part of what that overall plan is. 
   Agriculture plays a key role in this.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I remember when the fires at Yellowstone were taking place, and I remember seeing how many of our friends who were environmentalists said, let it burn, let it burn, and yet I remember seeing the carnage that took place with wildlife and the millions of animals who not only lost their home but then would be thrust out in the cold as a result of the huge fire, when in fact I had learned from my being an Eagle Scout, and the gentleman from Oregon is an Eagle Scout, we learned in our forestry merit badges that healthy forests are those where you can come in and clear out those things that were from years of use, and come and clean the forest, and you could come and take sections so that you made sure that any fire did not destroy the whole thing. They would come and cut the forest and work with Mother Nature and then replant. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the last 5 or 6 years, and you can look at any National Geographic or perhaps the Discovery Channel and see where the people, the companies that grow trees, they have healthy forests. I think the healthiest forests are where private people and private companies own the trees, as opposed to the government, because the government has a policy of ineffective, wasteful and intrusive government in managing our forests.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I want to thank the gentleman from Oregon. There's only one thing you didn't mention, and that's the BTU tax that many of the new leaders of the United States Congress today, the new Democrat majority, right there with the BTU tax. They're back. What they are really saying is pretty simple: Don't use this electricity; sit in the dark. Don't go create something that is good or better, don't find a way to have less emissions; go and tax things. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for being here today. We have been joined also tonight by the gentleman, who is a dear friend of mine from Iowa, Mr. King. We are talking tonight, Mr. King, about the Republican agenda, smaller, smarter, commonsense government, versus the Democrat agenda, which is ineffective, wasteful and intrusive government. And perhaps the thing which I identify most, and particularly when I see you, is to talk about taxes and how important tax reform has been. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been said a long time ago that the Republican party is here as the bull dogs for the taxpayer, to make sure that efficiency occurs, to make sure that the original mission statement of what a program might be for, to balance a budget is important. I don't know if the gentleman heard or not, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics released new job figures of 110,000 net  new jobs in September. September 2007 is the 49th consecutive month of job growth, setting a new record for the longest uninterrupted expansion of the U.S. labor market.     
   Since August of 2003, our economy has created more than 8.1 million jobs and today has the lowest unemployment that sits at 4.7 percent. There is more good news. You see, if you have a country that produces great dreams for people and they can go make things happen, like jobs, we also learned last week that the nonpartisan CBO, Congressional Budget Office, said the Federal deficit came in at $161 billion for the just-completed fiscal year, down from $248 billion the year before. I think we are headed in the right direction. I yield to the gentleman from Iowa.

   Then along came a market-based idea which we had known and understood not just from watching President Kennedy who cut capital gains and President Reagan to talk about you cut taxes you get more money because of invasion, isn't it true what this brave Republican Congress did is they cut taxes because they wanted to spur the American economy for people to have jobs and be competitive with the world, and so families would have an opportunity to keep more of what they made rather than giving it to the government.

And aren't we in that circumstance as we speak now with the SCHIP, which is children's health care, where this new Democrat majority has brought forth a bill that, among other things, more than half of the people who would be new to this SCHIP bill would be people who are already on insurance, who already have private insurance, and yet they are demanding, no, no, we have to add them to the government side. 
   What we are looking at here is a $6 billion program that Republicans invented because we believe in helping children because we know if you take care of children, immunize them and do things when they are children, then when they are adults, they not only do better in school they grow up and are healthier. 
   We are taking this from a $6 billion program a year to a $13 billion program. And to fund it, it would require, under the Democrat majority plan, 20 million new smokers to pay for the darn program. Is that what you are talking about where you all of a sudden shift from people who figure out you can get the government to pay for everything, a government-run health care program?

   Mr. SESSIONS. The gentleman, as he makes the point about how important it is that we have a market-based, free enterprise system health care, is so true. 
   If you look at America and leukemia versus Europe, America's survival rate is 50 percent; Europe's is 35 percent. Prostate cancer, America's survival rate is 81.2 percent; France, 61.7; England, 44.3 percent. 
   My gosh, it just tells you that what America has is not only the greatest health care system in the world, and one that is of envy, but one that produces results. And of course it is more expensive, and of course it costs money, but if the free enterprise system would support this because we don't tax the ability that people have to buy their health care, which is what the Democrat party mandate is, that you've got to tax people that don't belong in a corporation, then what it means is that you've got a bunch of people that can't afford it. 
   So that's another point that comes back to your tax element about health care. You should not have to pay after-tax money on health care. It should all be pre-tax, but the Democrats insist that, if you don't work for a corporation, you should not get this opportunity because it's not something that you negotiated with with a labor contract.

Mr. Chairman, this Republican minority is intensely interested in making sure that we do the right thing for the country, but it should be noted that these bills should not be about economic development, they should be about solving water problems that we have with the dollars that are generated by the taxpayer to solve problems with water, with flooding and with the various elements of ensuring we have clean and better water that is available. 
   This should not be an economic development spending bill. I disagree with the gentleman from Ohio, and it is my hope that this body will recognize this economic development spending bill for what it is, as opposed to a water resources bill.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike section 105 of this legislation which as drafted would prevent the funds spent by this bill from being used to conduct public-private competitions or to direct A-76 conversions for any Army Corps of Engineers program, project, or activity. 
   This underlying language would present an enormous setback for competition in government sourcing, costing the Federal Government millions of dollars a year by preventing private sector contracting in the Army Corps of Engineers for everything from janitorial and food services to the engineering and design of locks and dams which private sector contractors have done competitively for years at the Federal, State, and local levels.     
   While this policy may be good for increasing dues payments to public sector union bosses, it is unquestionably bad for taxpayers and for Federal agencies because these agencies will have less money to spend on their core missions if the opportunity to use competition and private sector efficiencies is taken away from them. 
   In 2006, Federal agencies competed only 1.7 percent of their commercial workforce, which makes up less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire civilian workforce. This very small use of competition for services is expected to generate savings of $1.3 billion over the next 5-10 years. 
   Competitions completed since 2003 are expected to produce almost $7 billion in savings for taxpayers over the next 5-10 years. This means that taxpayers will receive a return of about $31 for every dollar spent on competition, with an annualized expected savings of more than $1 billion. 
   At the Corps, in 2006 three public/private competitions were competed, involving IT support, financial services, and public works. 
   The largest of these, dealing with IT support services, has a projected savings of $960 million over a 6-year period. By introducing competition and leveraging the government's size to reduce equipment maintenance and replacement, the government will now be able to save almost $1 billion, but without my amendment, similar future efforts will be impossible. 
   Mr. Chairman, in this time of stretched budgets and bloated Federal spending, Congress should be looking to use all of the tools it can to find taxpayer savings and to reduce the cost of services that very easily can be found in the Yellow Pages. 
   I insert into the Record at this point a letter of support for this amendment from the American Society of Civil Engineers and a letter of support for the amendment from the Council on Federal Procurement of Architectural and Engineering Services.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very straightforward. It would eliminate funding for the absolute worst performing line at Amtrak, the Sunset Limited, which runs from New Orleans to Los Angeles. 
   In 1997, Congress passed the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act, which required that Amtrak operate without any Federal operating assistance after 2002. Despite this commonsense requirement that they cease their fiscal irresponsibility and mismanagement, since Amtrak was supposed to be operating free of Federal subsidy, it has, instead, cost the taxpayers $3 billion in operating expenses. 
   Mr. Chairman, people tuned in on C-SPAN to watch this debate may be wondering what exactly this $3 billion in taxpayer funding is paying for. Well, in the case of the Sunset Limited, it is being used to subsidize the travels of a very few passengers who want to take a train from New Orleans to Los Angeles. 
   The trip is scheduled to take 46 hours and 20 minutes to complete, that is, assuming the train is running on time. This occurrence is, however, exceedingly unlikely. According to Amtrak's most recent monthly performance report, the Sunset Limited was only on time 11 percent of the time. This makes the Sunset Limited the third worst on-time performer for any of Amtrak's 33 routes during 2007. 
   Perhaps, Mr. Chairman, taxpayers should be happy when the train is not running, though, because when it is, the route loses an average of almost $30 million a year. This means that Amtrak and the American taxpayer lose $0.57 per mile for each passenger on this train. For 2006, it cost the Federal Government $524 per passenger on that route, more than revenue that was brought in. 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is the first step to instilling just a small measure of fiscal discipline at Amtrak. Failure to do so will only allow Amtrak to continue misusing and wasting taxpayer dollars. 
   This amendment is supported by the National Taxpayers Union, Americans for Tax Reform, and Citizens Against Government Waste. I hope that all my colleagues will join me and those taxpayer advocates in saving the taxpayers from throwing more good money after bad on the Sunset Limited. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, today on the floor of the House of Representatives we are considering the issue of mental health parity. Unfortunately, some of my colleagues have clouded this important issue with extensive and over-burdensome regulations. As a supporter of mental health parity it is regrettable that I can not support the bill at hand. With over 50 million adults suffering from mental disorders it is necessary that there is access to mental health services. The Senate has passed legislation on parity that will allow access to these needed services, and I applaud and support their efforts. 
   As a long time supporter of the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act, it is disappointing that this legislation was coupled in with the over regulated mental health parity bill. Congress has taken great strides over the last few years towards adequately protecting an individual's genetic information an encouraging lifesaving genetic testing. Attaching this legislation to the flawed parity bill puts those efforts to shame. Congress should take up the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act on its own and allow those, like myself, to vote in favor of the bill.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the gentleman for giving me this time. 
   I am shocked and stunned that we financed overutilization and that is why we are doing this. Yet we understand that utilizing these physician hospitals, these new hospitals, saved the government money and are all about patient choice and are all about making sure that people who utilize these new hospitals don't get infections, don't get sick, don't check into a hospital to have surgery where other sick people are. It is a concept that keeps America not only the leading health care provider in the world; it is done in an efficient and cost-effective way. I am surprised that we find out it is overutilization. 
   Mr. Speaker, rather than taking this opportunity to bring parity to our health care delivery system, the Democrat leadership today is using this legislation as a vehicle to restrict future health care choices for Medicare patients. That is what this is about. It is to further own the opportunity for Medicare patients to be able to get the choices that they want, and the Democrat leadership is taking that away. Instead of using this opportunity to focus on mental health parity, the Democrats have decided to pay for this bill by pushing patients and limiting their options that they can receive for their own care. 
   Mr. Speaker, we will be real honest about this. According to HealthGrades, which is a nationwide study to look at hospitals and how efficient they are and how safe they are, three of the Nation's top 10 cardiac programs and three of the Nation's top 10 programs for joint replacement are at physician-owned hospitals. And despite the fact that these physician-owned hospitals make up only 3 percent of the Nation's hospitals, they are among the most efficient and the safest hospitals for people, our seniors, to go in and receive care. What will happen here today is an absolute mistake.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise again today in strong opposition to this unnecessarily restrictive rule that completely closes down the legislative process to every single Republican amendment that was offered in hopes of bettering this bill before the Rules Committee. This modified closed rule is being offered by the broken-promise Democrat majority, is wrong on both process and on policy. 
   Yesterday evening, in the Rules Committee, the place where democracy goes to die in the House of Representatives, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) stated that he welcomed debating any substantive amendment so long as the committee did not make in order multiple amendments with similar goals. Despite the chairman's wishes to allow for a fair and open debate on substantive amendments to this bill, Rules Committee Democrats, once again, instead chose to further solidify our committee's growing reputation as ``the graveyard of good ideas'' in the House of Representatives by rejecting five times each time, along straight party lines, attempts to improve this rule by including substantive amendments offered by Republicans. 
   Chairman Frank also testified that no amendment had been offered to the legislation that reflected the administration's opposition to this legislation, an inaccurate statement that I would like to clear up. First, my good friend from Georgia, the gentleman, Dr. TOM PRICE, electronically submitted a timely amendment to this bill that dealt with the substantive concerns raised by the administration. Dr. Price was then turned away from the Rules Committee and denied the opportunity to even offer this amendment when the paper copies reached the Rules Committee door 5 minutes after the arbitrary deadline that was set by the Rules Committee staff. 
   Next, Mr. Speaker, when it became obvious that the Rules Committee was going to silence Dr. Price, my good friend and Texas colleague, Congressman JEB HENSARLING, modified one of his amendments to address the substantive concerns over the addition of wind coverage to the National Flood Insurance Program that he shared in common with Dr. Price and President Bush. Unfortunately, Mr. Hensarling, too, has been shut out by this rule. 
   Despite numerous campaign promises by the highest-ranking Democrats in the House to run the most transparent, open and honest House in history, this Democrat majority has once again provided the House with the rule where none of this would be available. 
   Out of 26 amendments offered to this legislation, not one of the seven Republican amendments offered is made in order under the rule. It can't be for lack of time. There is simply no good reason to rush reauthorization for this legislation which doesn't even expire until next year. And the Democrats certainly found time enough to provide 13 Democrat amendment sponsors enough time to come to the floor to try  and change this legislation. It can't be because these Republican amendments are not substantive. The Hensarling and Price amendments would have addressed the most substantive and contentious part of this legislation: the inclusions of wind coverage into a flood insurance program. However, the Democrat majority, once again, decided that political expediency is more important than allowing the representatives of half of this country to be heard. I wish I could say that I was surprised by the Democrat leadership allowing politics to triumph over policy or fair procedure. Unfortunately, this is precisely what we have come to expect from the new broken-promise Democrat majority. 
   What is worse, Mr. Speaker, is that this bill's real-world impact is as bad or worse as the process that brings us here to the floor today. It would expand the flood program to include a new risk before the effects of this policy have even been studied. Both the GAO, the Government Accountability Office, and the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, have reported to us that the program is already not financially sound. That means that, as the program exists that the new Democrat majority wants to put in place, we already know that it is not financially sound. And the addition of this new and untested liability threats to derail much of the much-needed reforms of this program, while vastly increasing taxpayer exposure for losses from natural disasters unrelated to flooding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule. I oppose its exclusion of every single Republican amendment that was offered to improve it in the Rules Committee. I oppose the raw, political gain represented by the ill-conceived underlying legislation that puts our National Flood Insurance Program in jeopardy. Most of all, Mr. Speaker, I oppose the new earmark loophole, uncovered last night, that provides the broken-promise Democrat majority with yet another opportunity to waive their already loose earmark rules on every bill as they see fit. 
   While this new development made here to the strict letter of the smoke-and-mirrors earmark rule the Democrats rushed sloppily through the House at the beginning of the Congress, it certainly does not meet the spirit of that rule either. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in opposing this rule, particularly Chairman Frank, who argued so eloquently for the inclusion of substantive amendments so that the new rule can be passed that would finally keep the Democrat promise of openness and inclusion alive. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, once again, in line with what we have stated earlier, that the 13 Republican amendments, which were presented to the Rules Committee, of course, there were others that were rejected because they were 1 or 2 minutes late, need to be discussed. The Rules Committee voted on a party line not to let them be on the floor today. But our Members represent important not only States, but important districts and important ideas. Another one of the persons who was denied the opportunity to have his amendment to be made in order is here with us today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) for that purpose.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, once again the Republican team that is on the floor today wishes to continue our voice of representation of millions of Americans for better ideas, to be included not only on this floor but in the Rules Committee for consideration and agreement to debate and vote on these good ideas. 
   We know that last night that there were 13 amendments that were made in order, all Democrat amendments, no Republican amendments. We know that several Republican amendments were rejected based upon being just minutes late, even though they had been electronically submitted. 
   So as a result of that, we are here on the floor today doing appropriately, properly, what we should be doing; we are talking about the good ideas that we have. You heard already a good idea from the gentleman from New Jersey. You heard already a good idea from the gentlewoman from Michigan. 
   At this time I would like to yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert).

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, part of what our last three colleagues who have been to the floor spoke about was that as members of the Committee on Financial Services they worked very diligently, not only in their States, not only within their delegation, not only within the committee, but also with the chairman on trying to make sure that these good ideas might be included. 
   Now, the Rules Committee, which I have only served on for 9 years, always finds itself in a difficult position. Always. That is part of the dilemma of being on the committee, in particular when a committee chairman and a member show up before the Rules Committee and they talk about working together, finding a bit of compromise, working together to get a bill and thoughts and ideas to where they are not only germane, but to where they better the bill. The Rules Committee just sits back and we say, boy, that is such a wonderful thing. We are so happy and so pleased, Republicans and Democrats. 
   Something has happened, something has happened since January that has poisoned that well. Not only time after time after time did we see yesterday when Republicans showed up and said to the committee, oh, I have worked very carefully with my Governor, or I have worked very carefully with people back home, I've worked with the administration, I have put in a lot of time, this is a thoughtful amendment, I've tried to gain the concurrence of working through the committee; and, oh, by the way, I have even worked with my committee chairman, which says something also about the committee chairman, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), who yesterday on his own standing said, by and large, look, I understand every issue that is related to this. I don't mind if any amendment, as long as they are not duplicative, and as long as they have substance, I think they ought to be made in order. Once again, one of those times when the members of the committee, Republicans and Democrats, say, boy, that is great. Thank you so much, Chairman Frank. 
   Something's happened, however, where people who were from the committee working with the committee chairman come and agree, and all of a sudden every single Republican amendment was rejected. It wasn't because they were duplicative; it wasn't because they didn't have substance. I don't know what it is. 
   We have tried this morning to have several people who have come to the floor to say I'd like to engage the new Democrat majority, Rules Committee members, to find out--what is it--Why was every single Republican amendment rejected while 13 Democrat amendments were made in order? What is it? 
   There's a change. I don't think it's open, I don't think it's transparent, and I question some other things behind the decisionmaking that is being made. 
   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) also took time to not only have thoughtful amendments, he not only sits on the committee, but also came to the Rules Committee, is here today also, because he believes, we believe, as Republicans we may get shut out, as we were in the Rules Committee; but we are still going to come to the floor and stand for the things which we believe in that would better the bill. 
   I would like to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question to give the Democrats yet another opportunity to live up to their broken promises and amend the rule to allow for consideration of H.  Res. 479, a resolution that I like to call the ``earmark accountability rule.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this Congress continues to see nondisclosed earmarks appearing in all sorts of bills. These rule changes would simply allow the House to openly debate and be honest about the validity and accuracy of earmarks contained in all bills, not just appropriation bills. If we defeat the previous question, we can address that problem today and restore this Congress's nonexistent credibility when it comes to the enforcement of its own rules.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend from New York, for coming back down to redo this rule. 
   Madam Speaker, we are here because earlier in the day, just a few hours ago, it was discovered that the 64th closed rule, which set a brand new record for a United States Congress, contained several errors. And so we debated this issue already on the floor. 
   Here we are for the 65th now closed rule, a brand new record for the United States Congress--one which I'm not proud of--and from a Speaker who says that this Congress would be the most open, honest, and ethical Congress ever, a brand new closed rule record has occurred today. 
   Madam Speaker, we went back up to the Rules Committee just a few minutes ago. The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) came back and was present to hear the Rules Committee slam dunk his request again, which was an opportunity based upon a colloquy that took place this afternoon just a few minutes ago between the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, and myself, about  consideration of Mr. Walden's amendment. The amendment is of grave nature not only to 41 States but thousands of communities. 
   And at this time I would like to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) to explain where we are in this process and what we're going to do on moving forward.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I thought we were going to get done real quickly here. We're not. 
   The gentleman is right. It's a simple matter. Republicans are upset, also, about the high price of oil. We do not want to pass on higher taxes. The Democrat majority seeks something every single day to have Big Oil pay more and more and more money in taxes. Well, all that does is raise the price of oil. And you're right. You're darn right. The Republican Party is not for that. 
   I would also remind the gentleman that it takes a two-thirds vote, not a simple majority. And so it failed on a higher standard. 
   I would yield at this time 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, I think unfortunately this whole argument today has boiled down to a desire from the Democrat majority to simply tax Big Oil, and it's used over and over and over and over and over and over and over again as the reason we ought to have pay-fors to get taxes paid for, to get schools paid for, stick it to Big Oil. There's almost no germaneness. There's no reason to do that. 
   The opportunity that we have in this country, the Republican Party stands here day after day saying we need oil companies to be able to deliver American resources in this country. And every time you just go and raise their taxes, all you do is do what we're very effectively doing, and that is, we have to buy our resources from somewhere offshore. That's why we've almost doubled the amount of payment now overseas. I mean, it's gone to $800 billion our foreign payments, and it's double. That's how they keep building Dubai, that's how they build big cities, big countries, because the Democratic Party wants that. They want America to come to its knees, to have to pay higher and higher taxes. 
   They don't like oil. They want oil to have to dwindle to nothing, and I think it's a sad day. I think it's a sad day that we have to do it in this bill. 
   We already know where they are. We know where the Democrat Party is. They do not like oil companies. They do not want to drill. They do not want the price of energy to come down. 
   If this election is held, the American people will have a chance to decide what the answer is. We already know what that answer is, but once again, on a simple bill, stick it to Big Oil. Well, that's how you stick it to consumers, and I think it's pretty sad. 
   Madam Speaker, we've been through this all day. The bottom line is that the gentleman from Oregon is going to get a vote on the amendment that we talked about. The Rules Committee did not make it in order, not once but twice did not make it in order.     
   I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question, of which I'm going to ask that the opportunity for the amendment offered by myself for Mr. Walden be a part of what the previous question, when it's defeated, we will do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I want to thank the gentleman, my friend, Mr. Arcuri, for the time that he has yielded me, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   ``Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this martial law rule and in opposition to the outrageous process that continues to plague this House. We have before us a martial law rule that allows the leadership to once again ignore the rules of the House and the procedures and the traditions of this House. Martial law is no way to run a democracy, no matter what your ideology, no matter what your party affiliation.'' 
   I strongly agree with these words, but I cannot, in good faith, take credit for them because I did not write them. I simply just read them. My staff did not write them, nor did any of the Republican staff on the Rules Committee. 
   In fact, as far as I know, not one Republican had any hand in the composition of this eloquent defense of democracy in the House of Representatives, because their author is actually the gentleman from Massachusetts and a senior member of the Democrat Rules Committee, the gentleman, Mr. McGovern. 
   He spoke these exact same words on the floor 2 years ago regarding what he eloquently and accurately called a martial law rule, which is what we are being asked to consider here today.     
   Although these are not my words, I associate myself with them fully because they are as true and relevant today as when they were first used. And since I have already borrowed one selection of the gentleman's words, I would like to point out another comment my esteemed Rules Committee colleague made regarding martial law rules. On December 6, 2006, just 1 month before Democrats were to take control of the House of Representatives, Democrats made a number of promises on how they would run the House which, unfortunately, have not held up well in the contrast to reality. 
   Before they had control, Mr. McGovern said, ``Mr. Speaker, there is a better way to run this body. The truth, Mr. Speaker, is that the American people expect and deserve better. That's why the 110th Congress must be different. I believe we need to rediscover openness and fairness in the House. We must insist on full and fair debate on the issues that come to this body.'' 
   I would like to ask my friends on the Democrat Rules Committee and this Democratic leadership: What happened? What happened? Where is that openness and the fairness? Where was the openness on the no-energy bill rule where over 90 amendments were closed out, including a Republican substitute? 
   Where was that openness when we first considered SCHIP reauthorization and we were handed two closed rules by the Democrat leadership? Where has it been over these last 2 years when Democrats have forced a record number of lock-down, closed rules through this House of Representatives with no opportunity for Members, Republicans or Democrats, to improve that legislation? And where is that openness today when we are being asked to consider this tax extenders rule by once again suspending regular order in this House of Representatives? 
   I know where it is. Our friends, the Democrats, left it out on the campaign trail. And with an upcoming election, I suspect that is where we will be able to find these broken promises once again this next January. It was an empty promise when they made it, and the emptiness of this promise was fulfilled on the opening day of the new majority when the Democrats wrote into the rules of the House closed rules for consideration of the first six bills that they were able to take up, in effect discharging the Rules Committee from its duties for the first six bills they were going to consider. Ah, yes, 6 in '06. 
   The remedy for examples of unfairness, they criticized the Rules Committee for the way they did their work, and that trend has started, sadly, and continues today. 
   As the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) said, ``Mr. Speaker, there is a better way to run this body. The truth, Mr. Speaker, is that the American people expect and deserve better. That is why the 110th Congress must be different. I believe we need to rediscover openness and fairness in this House. We must insist on full and fair debate on the issues that come before this body.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, with these wise words, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) has now for at least the last 2 years made himself available, built bipartisan support, spoken to people in both parties, built a case, invited people to see the circumstance, and talked on behalf of 42 States, people who live in rural areas that have timber. 
   The gentleman invited me out this last August, notwithstanding that I am a friend of his, but he invited me out. I landed in Portland, drove east on the beautiful highway that goes to Hood, Oregon, and had an opportunity to meet a lot of the people in the area. They are fabulous. They are outstanding people who live in the very midst of Mount Hood. 
   I had an opportunity to see Mount Hood from a different perspective than the three climbers from Dallas who were trapped and who died earlier last winter. I had a chance to see Mount Hood in the summertime. As I was there with the gentleman, Mr. Walden, he told me the story about the big blowout in the mountain which happened on a separate event, that devastated the area as a result of what Mother Nature had done. He spoke about how the communities got together, how they worked together and solved their problems, just as they did when the three climbers from Dallas perished on the mountain. 
   But he forthrightly, along with others, reminded me that it is really up to us to get our work done here in Washington. And by no means did the gentleman task me with doing it, but he knew, he knew that I would have the opportunity, along with our colleague, the gentleman from Pasco, Washington, Doc Hastings, who is also greatly affected, that we could come back to a committee that we have served on for 10 and 12 years respectively between the two of us, that we would be able to talk to our colleagues whom we have served with on that committee for the past 10 years, that we would be able to express to them the need and the desire for public policy to be addressed at the appropriate time. 
   Well, the appropriate time is now. The Senate has spoken. Today the bill came over from the Senate, overwhelming vote, and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) rushed to me to find out what the Rules Committee would do, really just to find out what was in the bill. We found out about the bill only minutes before, which once again is against the rules of the House that you don't consider a bill until it is laid out publicly for 24 hours. But that didn't matter again today. 
   And so we asked on behalf of the gentleman, Mr. Walden, the other members of the Rules Committee what we thought was a bipartisan basis because I believe it is true to say that there are five people on the committee who serve rural areas also or who had heard the compelling story that impacts people all across this country. 
   So I told Mr. Walden, I think we stand a good chance because we are able to come to our colleagues whom we have spent hundreds of hours with over the last 10 years and to say if it is not in your bill, and we found out it was not, but it is in the package that came from the Senate, will you please just include that?

   Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, you're hearing a story that happened just minutes ago up in the Rules Committee where the members of the committee had within their sole jurisdiction the ability to handle this issue, to take what is referred to as the ping-pong, the bill that moved over, that was completely in the bill that the gentleman, Mr. Walden, and the gentleman, Mr. Hastings, have worked so diligently for the last few years to do. 
   The Rules Committee chairman, the gentlewoman, Ms. Slaughter, said, well, you know, I had to wait 13 years for one of my bills. That was the response. 
   The answer was, we came back and reasked the Rules Committee if they would please vote for it. Well, what they did is they turned it down on a voice vote. So we asked for a recorded vote. 
   On a party-line basis, every single Democratic member of that Rules Committee said no to something that is completely within their jurisdiction, completely within their endeavor. And I fail to know where there's any opposition. 
   It was obstinate, and it was a slap in the face to the members of the committee who have served with them for making a very simple, honest request. 
   Open, honest, and ethical. These were the words that we were told and the American people were told. Well, the people in these 41 States are going to have to judge that, but they will know, they will know that it was the Rules Committee and the Speaker of this House, not the United States Senate, who voted 93-2. It's not the President of the United States. He's already said he'd sign the bill. It was the Rules Committee, under the complete jurisdiction of the gentlewoman, Ms. Slaughter, and the Speaker of this House. 
   So we're on the floor today, a little upset. Being slam dunked I can handle. I think being treated in the way that we were is wrong. I think it's wrong to this committee. I think it's wrong to the members who are on it. 
   We reserve the balance of our time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, in the remaining time I have, I want you to know that, however, despite everything you have heard, I have good news, good news for the American people. Right now with the passage of this continuing resolution yesterday, Republicans have finally removed the main Democrat roadblock to increasing the domestic production of American energy. 
   This underlying legislation--which I am going to put on the floor right now--which contains tax credits for energy efficiency and conservation will also help this House to implement what Republicans have advocated for months: an all-of-the-above strategy, including nuclear power. 
   So today I urge my colleagues to demonstrate the courage of these convictions by voting with me to defeat the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, I will move to amend the rule to allow this House to take up a measure right now right here today that will prevent Members from going home to campaign for reelection without actually passing a comprehensive energy bill into law. 
   It would make it plain and permanent for their support. It would allow States to expand their exploration and extraction of natural resources along the Outer Continental Shelf; it would open the Arctic energy slope and oil shale reserves to environmentally prudent exploration and extraction; it would extend expiring renewable energy initiatives; it would encourage the streamlining approval and refining of capacity for nuclear power facilities; it would encourage research and development of clean coal, coal-to-liquid, and carbon sequestration technologies and minimizing drawn-out legal challenges that unreasonably delay or prevent actual domestic energy production. 
   This requirement would force the Democrat leadership to take positive, comprehensive, permanent, and meaningful action to increase the supply of American energy. 
   Mr. Speaker, all across this country there are cities without gasoline--there are cities without gasoline--and it stands exactly at the feet of the Democrat leadership, the new majority, who is making sure that the American consumer pays record high prices and yet we've done nothing to make sure that the supply side is taken care of. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I want to thank the gentleman, my friend from New York, for yielding the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this new record-breaking 64th closed rule being offered by this Democrat-led Congress, the most open, honest and ethical Congress in the history, proclaimed by our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. But we have this new record-breaking 64th closed rule, so it makes me kind of wonder which conference she was really in reference to. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this underlying legislation also. Just in the last 24 hours, Senate Democrat Majority Leader HARRY REID referred to the introduction of this bill as the ability to ``snatch defeat from the jaws of victory,'' because it guts a carefully negotiated and bipartisan compromise reached in the Senate. So what the Senate has worked very closely and clearly on and passed the bill, this Speaker decided we are not going to do it that way. In the waning days of this session, we are not going to play ball with our colleagues in the Senate. So what it does is it leaves many of the deal's most important provisions in limbo, rather than addressing them responsibly today. 
   Two evenings ago, the Senate passed a comprehensive tax extenders package by an overwhelming and bipartisan vote of 92-3. This legislation included an $18 billion fully offset energy tax policy proposal, as well as a partially offset tax relief package, including an AMT patch to prevent middle class families from being hit with an unprecedented and unintended tax bill, along with important extensions of current tax policy, disaster-related tax provisions for the victims of the Midwest floods and Hurricane Ike, and for mental health parity legislation. 
   Understanding the delicate balance in that Chamber, Democrat Majority Leader HARRY REID 2 days ago begged Speaker Pelosi not to send the Senate back a different bill, because it won't pass, and that if the House messes, and I quote, ``messes with the package, it will die.'' 
   Today, news reports have surfaced that he is ``furious'' that House Democrats refuse to accept his bipartisan deal and has retaliated with procedural tactics intended to delay the House from continuing along the House Democrat leadership's preferred course of action. 
   But rather than heeding these dire warnings from their own leadership, from the Senate leadership of their own party, this House Democrat leadership has decided to chop up this legislation into pieces, making substantive and negative changes to many of them, and to engage in a game of legislative chicken with the Senate, rather than doing the responsible thing and making sure that important measures like, we will just name one, like helping the victims of natural disaster, or, as we have heard, tax relief for middle class families who are at risk of being unintentionally caught by a tax created for the super-wealthy, and fairness for our own Nation's rural schools. Each of these passed. They passed in the Senate bill, and we could do it here today. 
   I am disappointed, Mr. Speaker, that this Democrat majority thinks that scoring some sort of political points on the eve of an election is more important than passing these measures. But, unfortunately, this kind of political gamesmanship has come up all too often in what Speaker Pelosi once again, and we reiterate, promised would be the most open, honest and ethical Congress in history. 
   Included in this House Democrat package are a number of energy tax incentives for energy efficiency and conservation, which, along with the upcoming October expiration on the ban of drilling for American energy, will go a long way to fulfilling House Republicans' long-term commitment to an all-of-the-above strategy, which helps America achieve energy independence. 
   Also included in this legislation are important tax provisions for American families trying to make ends meet and for American business trying to create jobs here in America and to be competitive with companies around the world. These include measures like the Research and Development Tax Credit, the State and local sales tax deduction, and the deduction for out-of-pocket expenses for teachers. This is particularly important for families, schools and businesses in my home State of Texas, and I strongly support their inclusion in this legislation. 
   I do not support, however, the inclusion of measures to permanently raise taxes on the American economy during an economic crisis to simply extend these current job-creating tax policies. Tax increases are never the way to solve a soft economy. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to vote with me to defeat this rule so that the House can end this political charade and cover a vote for its vulnerable Members, and take up the better Senate option to provide American families and businesses with tax relief they deserve. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   The actual impact, and I am going to yield in just a minute to the gentleman from Oregon, who can more clearly enunciate, but the real impact on 41 States, rural communities, that have forests in their areas, is a real and genuine problem. I had an opportunity this year in August to go out to Oregon and see firsthand. 
   I had an opportunity firsthand to meet with people who tried to explain to me. They said, Congressman Sessions, please look at what we are asking for and the need.

I would, if I can, not take his words but to take his feelings and understandings in the way I accept this, as well as the gentleman from Oregon, that the majority leader has indicated that he will try before this session is over to address this issue. It is my hope that the majority leader, and so that we don't engage in talking past each other, would not do what happened on July 30 when the gentleman, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee said in a colloquy that he would also work with another Member of the Republican team before the bill came back on an amendment. That never happened. 
   It is my hope, without calling anyone's bluff around here, to take the gentleman's words that I believe he very sincerely stated, that he would initiate the opportunity to find a place in the budget, I'm sorry, in an appropriation bill, to get passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate because that's what we are talking about. We are talking about a bill today that could have passed because the President would sign it and the Senate would agree to it. So I have taken it that way. 
   Now, the gentleman from Maryland also indicated that he saw nothing controversial in this bill, but extending future taxes for 1 year, this provision is going to cost employers $1.474 billion. That is a tax increase. That means it makes it more difficult for employers to hire employees. It sounds like the same type of arrangement that some of our other States have done, up to and including the State of Illinois that raised taxes just like this which puts Illinois where they are 48 out of 50 in job creation. It places States in a position and employers in the position where they lay off employees. So there is a controversial piece in this package that I am disappointed is in there as a permanent tax increase. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Doolittle).

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from New York has hit upon a great idea, which means we can do this today, which means, if the previous question is defeated, we can just add the gentleman, Mr. Walden's amendment right to the bill. We can get it accepted. There's no need to go back to committee. It'll just be accepted as it is. 
   We've heard lots of people from the majority, including the majority leader, the gentleman from New York, who does care about schools. He cares about education. But today we can resolve this. 
   You see, what happened is I was just upstairs, Mr. Speaker, at the Rules Committee, and we lost 9-4 on a party-line vote. We tried the process. Republicans respectfully came and tried. Evidently we're making progress today. That makes me happy. 
   So the gentleman can, with respect, whatever his words may be, will have a chance today. We're not going to send anything back to the committee. We'll just add the amendment to the bill once the previous question is defeated.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I thank the gentleman. Reclaiming my time, you know, we could sit here and ping-pong back between you and me too. I'm trying to say that the gentleman, Mr. Walden, has respectfully brought the issue for over 2 years. 
   We were upstairs yesterday in the Rules Committee. The gentleman from Pasco, Washington, Doc Hastings, politely asked. He served on the committee 12 years. I've only served on it 10 years. We politely asked if we could get it in. And now we're down being nice to each other on the floor. 
   All I'm suggesting to you is we can go through our own parliamentary procedure properly. We can get it included in and then we know that all of our words did matter. 
   But without that, without that, the gentleman from Oregon is correct. Otherwise, then it is only the Democrat leadership, the Speaker and the Rules Committee who will be responsible for it not making it. The committee had that opportunity yesterday. We're going to give every single Member of this body the opportunity in just a few minutes. I'm hopeful that people take us up on it. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop).

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, it's my understanding that the bill that we're debating now and that was passed by the Rules Committee is not the package that is on the floor now, that there was a change that was made upwards of $100 million, and that the Rules Committee, in fact, met--and in my opinion should not have--and we passed a bill that's not on the floor. 
   And I don't know--I'm looking for some clarification on this. I'm saying that right now on the floor. This is not the same bill that is presently on the floor that we passed in the Rules Committee. 
   And I'm asking for the Speaker to rule this bill out of order or to tell me what we believe is the correct thing to do because we think that there's been a huge mistake.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, as you might guess, I rise in opposition to this rule, to the underlying legislation, and, I believe, to the entire process that got this bill here today, which I believe represents little more than an opportunity for this Democratic majority to thumb its nose at the Supreme Court's recent ruling upholding an individual's right to keep and bear arms, while also providing some of its vulnerable Members with a meaningless political cover vote leading up to this fall's election. 
   Since taking control of this House almost 2 years ago, Mr. Speaker, this Democrat majority has done everything in its power to prevent Republicans who agree with the Supreme Court that residents of the District of Columbia have the right to self-defense, like every other American citizen, having a vote on this issue, is very important. In fact, last year it was the Democrats' need to prevent a vote on this very issue that brought the debate on providing the District of Columbia with a voting Member of Congress to a screeching halt. 
   Today, however, the Democrat majority has been forced to bring this measure to the floor because of a rapidly growing bipartisan support for a competing measure to comply with the Supreme Court's affirmation of D.C. residents' constitutional rights. Isn't it amazing? The District of Columbia went to court and found out that they had to follow constitutional rights. 
   And there's also a fear by the Democrat majority that a discharge petition that has already won the support of 166 Members of Congress, the passage of which the Washington Post has recently said would be ``deeply embarrassing to the House leadership and could infrastructure the party's House contingent.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, instead of providing real, meaningful policy solutions to make the lives of law-abiding citizens of the District of Columbia safer, today we are taking up a measure that would continue to subvert the wishes of our Founding Fathers, as recognized and affirmed by the Supreme Court, while also allowing Members to have a vote on an excellent substitute amendment which I fear will be dead on arrival when it reaches the Democrat-controlled Senate. 
   This substitute amendment, which I strongly support and have cosponsored, along with 115 other bipartisan colleagues, would recognize that D.C.'s ban on handgun possession in the home violates the second amendment, as does the District of Columbia's prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense. 
   To correct this injustice, the substitute amendment would repeal the District's illogical ban on the most popular home and self-defense weapons, restore the right of self-defense in the home, repeal the District's intentionally burdensome registration process, and allow D.C. residents to finally purchase handguns and defend themselves in their own homes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I understand that as early as today, that the D.C. City Council may be meeting to address this issue. But I remain concerned about what the same authors of the so-called ``emergency'' legislation that violated the Supreme Court's ruling just a few months ago, may try to pass in order to continue to drag their feet and to deny D.C. residents their constitutional rights to protect themselves and their families in their own home. This Congress should not be on record trying to avoid what is the law of the land. 
   Because of the Council's demonstrated past willingness to abide by our Nation's laws, I believe that it is important that this House pass the substitute amendment on behalf of all law-abiding citizens who want to exercise their constitutional rights within the District of Columbia. 
   Additionally, as the administration notes in their statement of policy on this legislation, the underlying bill in its current form would do nothing more than direct the D.C. City Council to reconsider within 180 days the emergency firearms legislation it passed in July, and which will expire in October, regardless of this House's action on this matter. This means that if this legislation is passed without the substitute amendment provided for by this rule, the legislation's only effect would be to give the City Council even more time to drag its feet and remain non-compliant with the directives of the highest court in our land. 
   Mr. Speaker, it really should not be so difficult to write a law that is compliant with the Constitution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit this Statement of Administration Policy in opposition to this bill and in support of the substitute amendment in the Congressional Record.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the gentleman clarifying that. 
   Reclaiming my time, the gentleman accused those who are on the other side of the debate of forcing this issue today. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, this is an internal struggle within the Democratic Party. The gentleman who brought the bill to the floor today chaired the Rules Committee last night. I heard no voice opposition to the rule, to the substitute; and yet today we hear they were being forced into doing this by the other side, those who opposed the bill. But it's their bill. It's their internal fight. It's their internal disagreement. It's their argument that they're having among their own family members. 
   So for the record, let me just state the Republican Party is for following the law. We do believe the Supreme Court got it right. We believe that it is wrong to bring a bill to the floor as the majority party, the Democratic Party, has done to try and circumvent and lengthen out the time that was given by the Supreme Court for someone to come into compliance with the law. 
   And we do believe that what the Rules Committee did last night was not open and honest and not about more accountability. We believe what they did was to handle a political matter that is a fight that they're having among themselves. 
   The Republican Party is pleased to be here on behalf of taxpayers and law-abiding citizens who want to protect themselves. We believe that this substitute amendment, which has been made in order by the Rules Committee, is the better of the two bills. 
   But to say that somebody is struggling or some outside forces are forcing this bill upon this Democrat majority is absurd. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia and my former colleague on the Rules Committee, Dr. Gingrey.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, we respect this Congress's ability to consult with and work with city councils and local governments. But to suggest in any way that this Congress should be trying to help anyone or collude with them to extend time frames that have been established already by the highest court of this land, that I believe was a reasonable answer--the gentleman from Wisconsin believes it was a reasonable answer--is a different kind of issue. 
   And that's all this bill really does today, gives the city council more time; wait till after the election before this tough issue can be decided any further by that body and by this. 
   I think it's a mistake to wait. I think it's a mistake to intervene, and I think it's a mistake not to follow the law that the Supreme Court has laid out for the D.C. government. D.C. government needs to follow the law, needs to follow the Constitution. They've been told that a long time. They've fought it. They've done all they can. They lost. The Supreme Court issued the decision. It's time to follow the law.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, since taking control of this House, this Democrat Congress has totally neglected its responsibility to address the domestic supply issues that have created the skyrocketing gas, diesel and energy costs that American families today and in the future are facing. 
   By going on vacation for 5 weeks over August while I and 138 other of my Republican colleagues stayed in Washington to talk about real energy solutions for American families, this Democrat majority has proven that they do not believe that the energy crisis facing American families and businesses is important enough to cancel their summer beach plans or book tours to get their work done. 
   However, enough of their Members must have heard from their frustrated constituents over August who are tired of the political games that the Democrats are playing and they want some kind of action. Because today, we are considering yet another measure to provide their Members with a political  cover vote that will do nothing to bring down the cost of energy at the pump because it does nothing to encourage participation by States in a program to increase the amount of American-made energy. We are simply wasting our time on a sham, and something that will not materialize to help energy prices. 
   Mr. Speaker, last Friday, an influential Democrat Senator stated what everybody in this House knows, that any bill excluding energy production revenue sharing for the States will never pass the Senate, making the cynical and political exercise that the House will engage in shortly even more transparent. 
   So today, I urge my colleagues to vote with me to defeat the previous question so this House can finally consider a real and comprehensive solution to rising energy costs in addition to today's bill to buy the District of Columbia more time to avoid compliance with the Supreme Court's ruling on the second amendment. 
   If the previous question is defeated, I will move to amend the rule to allow for additional consideration of H.R. 6566, the American Energy Act. This real, all-of-the-above bill would increase the supply of American-made energy, improve conservation and efficiency, and promote new and expanding energy technologies to help lower the cost at the pump and reduce America's increasing costly and dangerous dependence on foreign sources of energy. 
   I encourage everyone that believes a comprehensive solution to solving this energy crisis and achieving energy independence includes increasing the supply of American energy to defeat the previous question. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of this amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in reluctant opposition to this unnecessarily restrictive rule and to a number of the provisions included in the underlying legislation in its current form. While I appreciate and support the committee's effort to provide for the safety and soundness of our Nation's housing financial system and our broader financial system, this legislation has a number of avoidable shortcomings, and I hope that at least some of them would be corrected during the restrictive amendment process provided for by this rule. 
   The Federal Housing Administration was created by the National Housing Act of 1934 to broaden homeownership, protect lending institutions, and to stimulate the home construction industry. In addition to providing stability and liquidity to the mortgage market, the FHA's efforts have led to the creation of the 30-year mortgage product and mortgage instrument standardization, both of which have contributed to the growth of our modern housing financial marketplace. And, as one of the very few Federal Government agencies to operate entirely on fees derived from the program, the FHA has accomplished all of this with no taxpayer dollars or subsidy. 
   The legislation that has been brought to the House floor today includes a number of important modernization provisions that will help American families across this country to own their own homes, like: increasing the FHA loan limit for high-cost areas, providing for flexible down payment requirements, simplified and improved condo loan requirements, and an expansion of the ability to utilize home equity conversion mortgages. 
   This bill closely mirrors H.R. 5121, Republican legislation that passed overwhelmingly last Congress, and would also supplement the FHA Secure Initiative unveiled by President Bush at the end of August. This program, which is aimed at borrowers who have fallen behind on their payments after a mortgage rate reset, is projected to help a quarter of a million families over the next year. By helping first-time, owner-occupied home buyers refinance into mortgages that they can afford, this already implemented program will help families and stabilize communities, while targeting this support to the real families in need and  away from speculators who do not need help from the Federal Government. 
   Unfortunately, despite all the positive elements included in this legislation, I do believe that this bill could be vastly improved. Chief among the problems with this legislation is its establishment of a new line of income for a poorly defined affordable housing grant fund linked to increased FHA receipts. FHA receipts are already recognized for future budgeting purposes to help determine subsequent affordable housing program appropriations at HUD, with any extra revenue from these programs deposited in the U.S. Treasury as a benefit to taxpayers. This legislation would divert this revenue to a housing fund with a poorly defined mission, reducing resources available for other existing HUD programs that already assist low-income families and individuals. 
   I believe it is bad public policy to tie the fate of families that need housing support to the success or failure of the FHA to bring in surplus revenue. Even worse, because the affordable housing funds would come from fees related to conforming loans and reverse mortgages, this bill levies a new stealth tax on the most modest home buyers and on seniors without even disclosing to them the costs associated with this new Federal mandate. 
   Other problems with H.R. 1852 include its failure to provide the FHA with the flexibility needed to implement risk-based pricing, which limits consumer choice as well as the FHA's ability to help additional home buyers. This bill's proposed 2 percent limit on home equity conversion mortgage loan origination fees proposed in the legislation, which attempts to protect senior citizens from potentially abusive lending practices, may also unnecessarily limit choice and flexibility in a changing marketplace. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank committee ranking Republican Spencer Bachus; subcommittee ranking Republican Judy Biggert; and the incoming ranking Republican on the Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee, my former Rules Committee colleague, Shelley Moore Capito, for all their hard work on this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will also insert in the Congressional Record the Statement of Administration Policy regarding this legislation and would like to take this opportunity to thank two people for their hard work from the White House, White House aides Chris Frech and Marty McGuinness, who have provided important information not only on this but worked with Members to make sure that they understood the White House's position on this issue.

   Mr. SESSIONS. The gentlewoman is waiting for an additional speaker, and I appreciate that very, very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, you know, we are here this morning, almost 11 o'clock in Washington, D.C. I don't know of much else we've got going here on the floor today. I think we're going to have four suspensions in addition to this bill, and yet last night the Rules Committee, our friends in the new Democrat majority, decided that they would shut down debate by having this rule without it being an open rule, shut out a number of amendments and Members who would choose to come down and debate things today. And so I'm disappointed that, in a day where really not much else is going on, that we could not include the full discussion and take this day to talk about affordable housing and where the ideas are that each and every Member might have on how we're going to increase homeownership and protect these homeowners. 
   I find it interesting, however, with some of the speakers that we've had today, that just a few years ago we were, with full knowledge of this United States Congress, very pleased that homeownership was increasing all across America and that credit was being extended to a number of people, including lots of families who would have an opportunity to finally own their own home. And now we find out today that, in fact, it's a lot of people who are to blame, who are these greedy people who were the lenders, who were trying to get people and bring them in to buy houses when, in fact, it was the national will. It was a good thing that they would have, virtually at no cost down, an opportunity to come and be in a house. We heard testimony where people really could get in houses for cheaper than they could living in an apartment. So millions of Americans went and did that. And they willingly signed on the line, yes, I will take this low-cost loan right now, and in 5 years I will have to go to a market-based rate to borrow the money. 
   This wasn't a mistake. This wasn't somebody being greedy. This was someone who was out offering an opportunity. And as all of us would have to predict the future, we don't know what the future would be, but it got people in homes, and now we do have some problems. And dealing effectively with the problem is, I think, what we should be remembered for, not looking back and saying what a bad idea it was to make sure that millions of families could get in their own homes. 
   So I respectfully disagree with those that come to the floor here today to argue about greed and all these people who took advantage of these poor and low-income homeowners. I think it was a good thing. I'm sorry it has not worked out in every single case. But guessing what something is going to be like in 5 years means that you have a chance to plan and be prepared for it. And so now we will be judged on how well we do to make sure that we lessen the activity of the number of people who have to bail out of their houses because they can't afford them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I had anticipated and hoped that the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) might be here. I have been notified that he is in a meeting with constituents at this time. 
   One of the amendments which Dr. Price brought to the Rules Committee yesterday, which the Rules Committee rejected on a party-line basis, was part of really the debate and discussion that I think needs to take place as we talk about taxpayer money being involved with housing in this country. And the amendment which was rejected by the new Democrat majority universally across the line, every single Democrat said, no, they did not want to hear the debate on this, and it is as follows: the amendment said that it would require that any individual or household receiving money from the affordable housing fund must present verification of legal residency by a secure identification document. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's be forthright about this. We have had discussion after discussion, debate after debate about health care, about public housing, about housing funds, of virtually every single topic that we get into here on the floor of the House of Representatives where we believe, the Republican Party believes, that people who are seeking assistance and help from funds, whether it be taxpayers or public systems like this that do utilize the attributes of the government, that there should be a verification that somebody is in this country legally and has legal status. 
   Mr. Speaker, repeatedly this new Democrat majority, whether it's for health care or whether it's now for this new housing fund, they do not want to require that someone even has to present verification of who they are. And we disagree with that. And I am sorry that the Rules Committee made a determination and the Democratic Party decided that they do not want to have to have anyone present verification of who they are or that they are in this country legally.     
   We disagree with that. I am sorry that the Rules Committee did not allow that in order for the gentleman, Mr. Price, to be able to argue that as part of the debate today. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I will be voting ``no.'' I will be voting ``no'' on this rule because I believe that what this new Democrat majority did was to shut down debate even in a day when we have lots of time to get the best ideas on the floor and to make sure that every single Member can be heard from. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Chairman, my amendment would strike section 111 of this legislation, which, as drafted, would have the same effect as language already included in a number of the Democrat majority's other appropriations bills which prevents funds from being spent to conduct public-private competitions. 
   While this policy may be good for increasing dues payments to private sector union bosses, it is unquestionably bad for taxpayers and for Federal agencies because agencies are left with less money to spend on their core missions when Congress takes the opportunity to use competition away from them. 
   In 2006, Federal agencies ``competed'' only 1.7 percent of their commercial workforce, which makes up less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire civilian workforce. This very small use of competition for services is expected to generate savings of $1.3 billion over 10 years by closing performance gaps and improving efficiencies. 
   Competitions competed since 2003 are expected to produce almost $7 billion in savings for taxpayers over the next 10 years. This means that taxpayers will receive a return of about $31 for every $1 spent on competition, with annualized expected savings of more than $1 billion. 
   Specifically at the Department of Labor, since May 2004, 27 public-private partnerships have competed, involving over 1,000 positions. And thanks to a 10 percent protection clause, 24 of these competitions have been won by the government. This overwhelming track record of government success in competing with private sector begs the question, why would the Democrat leadership insist upon preventing Federal agencies from running their operations in the most efficient manner when they have been successful in the past? 
   I think the answer is clear, Madam Chairman, that when this appropriations bill cuts the budget for the Office of Labor Management Standards, which monitors union compliance with Federal law, and prevents competitive sourcing from taking place, that the Democrat leadership is clearly hearing from labor bosses that this bill represents a good opportunity to increase the power of labor bosses at the expense of taxpayers and good government. 
   In this time of stretched budgets and bloated spending, Congress should be looking to use all of the tools it can to find taxpayer savings and reduce the cost of services that are already being provided by thousands of hardworking companies nationwide.  
   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense taxpayer-first amendment to oppose the underlying provision to benefit private sector union bosses by keeping cost-saving competition available to the government. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

I also rise with my colleagues who are here from El Paso, Texas, and also the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Tom Lea's birth. As a person who lived in El Paso, Texas, for a number of years, I also became aware of Tom Lea from living in San Antonio. Much of his artwork was displayed in San Antonio on a regular basis. 
   Tom Lea for many years painted pictures of the mountains and beauty that surrounds not only west Texas, but southern New Mexico also. El Paso is the beginning of what is called The Pass of the North, where two great countries come together, the history of Mexico and the history of the United States, and where these two great countries meet at the Rio Grande River. Tom Lea spent a lot of time writing, talking, thinking, pushing forward thoughts and ideas about these two great nations, and embodied a lot of that in artwork that I have several copies of. I have bought Tom's books over the years. 
   So today it is right and fitting that the United States Congress in its looking back, as we do on a regular basis, over many great Americans who have added not only to the artwork of America and the thought process, but also to the lives that they lived. Tom Lea, a great Texan and American, who added not only a spirit to the men and women who fought for this country in World War II, but also brought that beauty forward in artwork, the Franklin Mountains and places in New Mexico with just stunning beauty that have sustained so many people. It gives us an idea about why America is a great Nation and why we must continue to protect her.  
   Mr. Speaker, I stand today in support of this 100th anniversary of Tom Lea, a great man from El Paso and a great community, and people who loved him a great deal and miss him even more. It is a great day to say thank you to Lady Bird Johnson and Tom Lea, both great Texans, on a beautiful day in Washington, D.C.

   I rise today in opposition to the rule and the underlying legislation, which spends $3.2 billion more than last year's Republican-crafted legislation. It also spends $2.8 billion, almost 6 percent, more than requested by President Bush for this year's transportation and housing funding.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, under the agreement that we just had with the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), I'm going to go ahead and close, and then we are now through with our speakers and allow the gentleman to do the same thing. 
   Madam Speaker, I will be asking for a recorded vote on the previous question for this rule. Our country is facing a very serious problem that must be addressed before the House adjourns in August, and, to date, the majority Democrats have not shown a commitment to deal seriously nor quickly enough with one of the most serious threats facing America. 
   If the previous question is defeated, I will offer an amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that clarifies one very simple and critical thing; that the United States Government will no longer be required to get a warrant to listen to foreign terrorists who are not even located in the United States. 
   The Director of National Intelligence, Michael McConnell and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Michael Hayden, have testified to Congress that, under current law, their hands are tied. As Director McConnell recently testified, FISA is outdated and has been made obsolete by technology. Today our Intelligence Community is forced to obtain warrants to listen to terrorists outside of our Nation, and, as a result, ``We are actually missing a significant portion of what we should be getting.'' I'll say it in my own way: The things that we would expect our government to know and be prepared for. 
   We simply cannot allow ourselves to be deaf and blind to terrorist communications that threaten our very existence because of a law that is woefully outdated. All of us have heard public reports from the Department of Homeland Security that terrorist chatter is at record levels that we have not seen since 2001. We have to open our ears, we have to open our eyes to keep this Nation safe. It can be done tonight with our part of this, Madam Speaker. 
   If my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are serious about facing down the threat, they will join me in defeating the previous question so that the House will be able to address this very real and very serious threat immediately. 
   I ask unanimous consent to include my amendment and extraneous material in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I include for the RECORD a press release by the Employment Policies Institute and an op-ed by George Will that was in the Dallas Morning News on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today opposed to this bill, this bill that did not go through regular order nor through the Rules Committee, not even to be a secret vote in the Rules Committee. And I argue against this bill for the reasons we have not had a chance to vet the bill, to tell the truth that there will be over 1.6 million people that will lose their job directly related to this action by Washington, D.C., The Federalist Society, the Democratic Party in Washington, D.C., who will control not only their jobs but take away from small businesses the opportunity to be competitive in a competitive world. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are going to cause these 1.6 million people to lose their jobs as a result of their inability to be able to compete in marketplaces and to raise their own wages. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that these 1.6 million jobs were important to families and people. It may not be much of a job. It may be in a small rural community, but they were jobs that were important to those people. They are jobs, even if not high-paying jobs, that would provide them the opportunity to get up and find self-worth and go and do their very best, perhaps not just with limited resources but with the very best that community may offer. 
   These are the types of stories that would be told if we had followed regular order, if the committees had been able to vet this, if we had known more about the ability to hear experts testify about what is actually going to happen. 
   We hear the words about food on the table. We hear about having people earn more money. That is great. But 1.6 million jobs will be lost from our economy as a result of what the Democrat Party does. I say, shame on us. I will oppose this. I will be for the Republican alternative that encourages better jobs. 
   Employment Policies Institute: Minimum Wage Hike Threatens Healthy U.S. Economy 
   WASHINGTON, DC.--Despite the flourishing U.S. economy and record low unemployment level, low-skilled jobs--such as the retail and leisure and hospitality industries--are in decline. These jobs will be further threatened by the prospect of a federal minimum wage hike, warns the Employment Policies Institute (EPI). 
   Decades of economic research prove that raising the minimum wage reduces job opportunities, particularly for people with few skills. When faced with the increase in labor costs that attend minimum wage hikes, employers often respond by hiring more skilled applicants, automating jobs, or cutting back on customer service. 
   Contrary to the opinion of proponents of minimum wage hikes, a rising tide doesn't necessarily lift all boats, and an extremely healthy skilled job market often masks an ailing low-skilled job market. 
   ``The unintended consequences of a minimum wage hike will disproportionately affect low-skilled jobs while skilled labor may continue to flourish,'' said Jill Jenkins, EPI's chief economist. ``In other words, if two computer programmer jobs are created and one less grocery store checker is hired, the net job creation is positive, but you're still seeing a decline in entry-level job opportunities.'' 
   A study by economists at the Federal Reserve found that every 10% increase in the minimum wage leads to a 2%-3% decrease in employment overall. When you focus on the job loss suffered by low-skilled individuals such as high school drop-outs or minority teens, the increase in unemployment is as high as 8.5% for every 10% increase in the minimum wage, according to research from Cornell and the University of Connecticut. 
   ``Instead of pushing for a minimum wage increase, lawmakers could affect real change by promoting expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC),'' added Jenkins. ``The EITC effectively targets benefits to families in need without jeopardizing jobs.''  
   George Will: Here's a Better Proposal for the Minimum Wage 
   A federal minimum wage is an idea whose time came in 1938, when public confidence in markets was at a nadir and the federal government's confidence in itself was at an apogee. Today, raising the federal minimum wage is a bad idea whose time has come for two reasons: 
   The first is that some Democrats have a chronic and evidently incurable disease--New Deal Nostalgia. Second, the president has endorsed raising the hourly minimum from $5.15 to $7.25 by the spring of 2009. 
   Democrats consider the minimum wage increase a signature issue. Yet consider these statistics: 
   Most of the working poor earn more than the minimum wage, and most of the 0.6 percent (479,000 in 2005) of America's wage workers earning the minimum are not poor. 
   Only one in five workers earning the federal minimum lives in a family with a household earning below the poverty line. 
   Sixty percent work part-time, and their average household income is well over $40,000. (The average and median household incomes are $63,344 and $46,326 respectively.) 
   The federal minimum wage has not been raised since 1997, so 29 states with 70 percent of the nation's workforce have raised their own minimum wages. The problem is that demand for almost everything is elastic: When the price of something goes up, demand for it goes down. 
   But suppose those scholars are correct who say that when the minimum wage increased slowly, the impact on employment is negligible. 
   Still, because of large differences among states' costs of living and the nature of their economies, Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., sensibly suggests that each state should be allowed to set a lower minimum. 
   It should be the same everywhere: $0. Labor is a commodity; governments make messes when they decree commodities' prices. Washington, which has its hands full delivering the mail and defending the shores, should let the market do well what Washington does poorly. But that is a good idea whose time will never come again.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. So in other words, what the gentlewoman has said is that this five-step process that we are going through right now means that there will be no committee hearings, no expert witness testimony, no information that is available really to the membership of this body, but mostly would be necessary for new Members. And then when someone does come to the Rules Committee we are told before the session even starts there will be no amendments and a closed rule, and yet progress over partisanship is what we are doing here. Interesting day, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this closed rule and this underlying legislation which the Democratic leadership has decided to bring to the House today without the benefit of regular order, committee oversight or the opportunity for any Republican input or amendment, despite repeated promises to respect the rights of the minority and to increase Member participation in this legislative process. 
   Every Member of this body, Republican and Democrat alike, understands the importance of higher education in the competitive global world environment that our students and workers face in keeping the United States at the vanguard of the global economy. 
   I am greatly disappointed that the Democratic leadership has chosen to bring this narrow legislation of questionable effectiveness forward rather than engaging in an honest debate which has taken place for 12 years, as education has always been considered a bipartisan effort. 
   It is true that the gentlewoman did describe that it will be a bipartisan act that we do today, but this was simply the first step in education and doing the right things for our students. I disagree with that. I think members of the minority have been given the opportunity for 12 years to be a part of the progress that has taken place, offering amendments that would actually make college more affordable for parents and students, as well as the cost effectiveness of the American taxpayer who foot the bill for tens of billions of dollars each year spent on Federal student aid programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisanship that I talked about for 12 years was led by Republicans in support of making sure that college was more affordable. Over the past 6 years, spending on Federal student aid has increased by 57 percent, and funding for Pell Grants has risen by nearly 50 percent. 
   We also think about lower education also where, as a result of Republicans for the last 12 years, education has risen in spending from Washington, DC, 256 percent. Today, some $90 billion a year in Federal resources fund student aid programs from loans and grants to work study programs and educational tax benefits. 
   This is not a first step that we are taking today, it is another step that was not begun or born out of bipartisanship, but rather out of bumper sticker politics. 
   What we have talked about is that Republicans have more than tripled what spending was helping students over the last decade. Yes, it was done in a bipartisan way before today. Open committee hearings and feedback make bills better. 
   Republicans, through our leadership, have also made sure that more than $4 billion for new and high achieving Pell students pursuing degrees in math, science and critical foreign languages was included these last 12 years. We slashed the total loan fees so students can access more of the money that they borrowed for education purposes. We cut $20 billion in Federal subsidies to student loan lenders through the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2006, which provided substantial savings for U.S. taxpayers while ensuring that these tax programs would operate efficiently by not cutting one penny in student loans. 
   But rather than continue along this path of making college more affordable and increasing the transparency not only in this body, but also as it relates to college costs so that students and their parents can see why higher education costs are rising, today Democrats are imposing, in a closed rule, without feedback, upon the House legislation that would do nothing to expand college access or improve affordability. Instead, their plan will not benefit a single college student, only former students. 
   Let me say this very plainly, not one additional student will be able to attend college because of this proposal, unlike the bipartisan efforts of the past where we worked to make sure that it impacted more students' ability to go to college. In fact, today's legislation is no more than a flawed answer in search of a problem. 
   In 2004, the Federal Government spent less than four-tenths of a cent on every dollar in providing these student loans. Since 2001, the program the Democrats today seek to change, Republicans, through a bipartisan effort before today, returned over $12 billion to the U.S. Treasury because the cost of administering the program needed to be changed. 
   Once again, we find ourselves with a great example of the private sector doing a job better, more efficient, with less risk to the taxpayer, and the government and taxpayers will see the benefit. 
   This legislation also does not make good on a common Democrat campaign promise in the highly touted ``Six for `06'' program. Many Democrats on the campaign trail made broad promise about cutting interest rates in half immediately for all student loans, both subsidized and unsubsidized, as well as loans made to parents. Instead, in a classic bait-and-switch for voters, the Democrats are really bringing to the floor today legislation that only addresses subsidized loans and phases these savings in over 5 years before they sunset and then disappear. 
   Additionally, they proposed to pay for this weakened $6 billion plan with many of the same lender cuts passed by Republicans and Democrats in the last Congress, the same subsidy cuts that Democrats opposed because during the election they called a ``Raid on Student Aid'' when in fact it is exactly what they do today. 
   Mr. Speaker, Republicans have a comprehensive alternative to the flawed Democrat plan. The College Affordability and Transparency Act would provide students and parents with more and better information about college costs, helping students to become better consumers of higher education. It will add great transparency and accountability by establishing a user friendly college affordability comparison creating quality, efficiency task forces to determine the causes for tuition hikes at the schools with the greatest tuition increases and provide a demonstration project for up to 100 schools, freeing them from the costly regulatory requirements and driving down one of the main reasons that schools raise costs. 
   Mr. Speaker, today 80 percent of the student loans made are originated by the private sector at an efficient cost and enhanced borrower services, such as reduced charges, financial education tools and reduced student interest obligation, all of which would disappear if  we allow the Federal Government to crowd out the private sector. 
   Mr. Speaker, this was our idea, and we would have brought this forth if we were allowed to do so in a rule where Members could openly vote for this and have an honest debate through the entire committee system. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to oppose this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, at the Rules Committee, I saw something, well, I saw several things that I had not seen in the 8 wonderful years I have served on the Rules Committee, but I have been told by those who have longer tooth than I that they had not seen in the 12 years the Republicans were in the majority, where people were greeted to the Rules Committee by the chairman saying, your amendment will not be made in order and it is a closed rule. 
   The interpretation for the membership of this body was, you need not apply. Please, just don't even come and give your story because we are not open for business. We are closed before we are open. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of our colleagues, Ric Keller, did come up. And despite being told this right up front, in an honest way, by the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), he still stuck around for another hour. He still was there to present his thoughts and ideas, even though he knew before the meeting even took place, before a vote ever took place, that he would not have anything made in order, his ideas, which he has been presenting in a bipartisan way for the last few years, would not even see the light of day. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we are proud to be able to be on the floor today and to discuss this. He is a kind and wonderful gentleman who cares a lot about students and student aid, and so I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Orlando, Florida (Mr. Keller).

   So, Mr. Speaker, yet another good reason why I wish we had had regular order, so these new Members of Congress could speak from the facts of the case rather than holding hostage the truth.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Speaker. I also thank the gentleman, a dear friend of mine from South Carolina, for talking about how great this is for the budget. Yet the rule waives points of order that are contained in the budget. Being specific, it is an explanation of the waivers that we found out about. 
   The bill violates section 302(f) because its direct spending will exceed the Committee on Education and Labor's allocation, but that is good for the budget. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues have had an opportunity on this side to talk about why we are disappointed in this closed rule and in the Democrats' failure to provide a comprehensive solution to increasing higher education access for our students that will help keep America competitive. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would ask to insert in the RECORD an article printed in The Dallas Morning News, my home newspaper, from January 12, outlining the way today's Democrat proposal fails and falls short of their past promises.  
   Dems Push Rate Cut for Student Loans 
   WASHINGTON.--Following up on an election-year promise, House Democrats said Friday that they plan quick action to lower interest rates for student loans. 
   Their proposal, scheduled for a vote next week, would cut interest rates on some student loans in half. However, the college tuition plan has been scaled back since it was first touted on the campaign trail last year. 
   The interest rate relief would apply only to need-based loans and doesn't help people who take out unsubsidized student loans--a distinction not made in the campaign literature Democrats handed out before winning control of Congress last fall. The measure also abandons a pledge to reduce rates for parents who take out loans to help with their kids' college costs. 
   The rate cut for subsidized student loans--from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent--would be phased in over 5 years. 
   The measure would cost just under $6 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
   To avoid increasing the deficit, the bill's cost would be offset by trimming subsidies the government gives lenders and reducing the guaranteed return banks get when students default. Banks also would have to pay more in fees. 
   An estimated 5.5 million students receive subsidized loans. 
   Republicans pushed a budget bill through Congress last session that cut $12 billion from student loan programs. Democrats and student groups argued the money should have been preserved.  
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this closed rule and the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, the House will have the opportunity to debate this important amendment offered by Republican Ranking Member BUCK MCKEON so that convicted felons will be considered ineligible to receive the Democrat interest rate reduction. 
   Mr. Speaker, today this debate has been very succinct and to the point. That is that we believe that for 12 years that Republicans and Democrats have worked very carefully on education issues that will help this country out, through difficult times, through difficult processes, increasing the amount of money that is available, not only for people to attend school, but also reducing the costs that were impediments in the program. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that the way it is being pitched today is, well, the Republicans were just headed in a bad direction and had 12 years to do this, when in fact we have been doing this in a bipartisan way for 12 years. Today, we are going to hear it and have it the Democrats' way. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment and extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the gentleman Mr. Franks' amendment. Mr. Franks serves along with myself as cochairman of the Missile Defense Caucus. 
   This amendment restores critical funding to our layered missile defense system, which protects the United States and its allies from short and medium-range ballistic missiles. This bill that we have heard talked about cuts funding for missile defense to $719 million below the President's budget request of $9.3 billion, an unacceptable funding level to provide for our national defense. 
   The Democrats' authorization to the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System would not even cover the expenses incurred by the Missile Defense Agency to conduct what was recently the shootdown of the US-193 satellite, which cost the agency upwards of $100 million. I would add that the very recent successful shootdown of the satellite is evidence of the successes and importance of the missile defense program and the ongoing necessity to make sure these programs are fully funded and in development. 
   The Democrats have also authorized inadequate funding for the THAAD, or Theater High Altitude Area Defense System. I think it is an embarrassment that out of the $890 million requested for the project by the administration, only $75 million was authorized for THAAD; $75 million out of $890 million requested.  
   Finally, my friends in the Democrat majority inserted language into the bill that requires the Secretary of Defense to certify that the two-stage intercepter missile proposed for the European site ``has demonstrated through successful, operationally realistic testing, a high priority of operating in an operationally effective manner and the ability to accomplish the mission.'' 
   Unfortunately, the Democrats only provide an additional $25 million for these tests and targets. This not-so-subtle attempt to starve the program puts our country at risk and it is an attempt that I oppose. 
   Congressman Franks' amendment restores the $719 million to our missile defense program, putting the necessary defense capacities in the hands of our commanders and providing for the continued success of our short and medium-range ballistic missile program. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe this is a matter of national security and it is very important, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for extending me the time. 
   I rise in opposition to this new, record-breaking 62nd closed rule being offered by this Democrat-led Congress, and I object to the timing of bringing this underlying legislation to the floor at a particularly fragile and vulnerable time for American consumers, for American small businesses, and for the entire American economy. 
   As every Member of this House, in fact, probably every single person on this planet with a working television already understands and they're very acutely aware, the United States capital markets for commercial credit have been frozen. And later this week, this Congress is going to be asked to vote on a massive and currently unfinished proposal to try to stem this enormous threat to our economy and to prevent it from spilling over into everyday Americans' lives who are simply trying to make ends meet. 
   The enormity and complexity of this crisis and its corresponding legislative solutions makes me question why, Mr. Speaker, why, with all the other problems in our financial markets that require our immediate, fixed and unwavering attention, this House leadership would bring this bill to the floor under a closed rule, instead of focusing on the much larger problem that economists and editorial boards across this country believe has the potential to do catastrophic damage to global financial systems. 
   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, I'm confused as to why this Congress is choosing this path because, despite whether the House considers this Democrat majority's 62nd closed rule, or this legislation today, it makes no difference, absolutely no difference as to whether the issues contained in this legislation to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive practices will even be addressed in a timely fashion. 
   To protect consumers from questionable practices, the Federal Reserve has already proposed broad new rules. But rather than allowing the Fed to finish its job, this Congress thought it was important enough to pass a new law to give to them, and this Congress is passing a bill that preempts all of the work that Congress has asked these regulators to do, while doing nothing to strengthen the Federal Reserve's already existing consumer protection mandate. 
   Like every other Member of this House, I am concerned about the crushing economic impact that rising food and fuel prices are having on American families. I'm even more concerned that passing legislation like this will discourage investment in credit card lending to fewer consumers and smaller businesses getting access to the credit that they need to stay afloat. 
   Unlike the Democrat leadership bringing this bill to the House floor, I do not believe that it is wise policy to create a consumer credit crunch at the same time that our economy is already experiencing a massive commercial credit crunch. And I'm greatly concerned that current market conditions have the potential to greatly amplify the unintended consequences of this legislation at a time when families and small business need it the most. The ``it'' is credit. 
   Limiting the ability of consumer credit issuers to base their prices according to risk, as this legislation proposes to do, will only increase rates and fees for everyone, while also severely constricting the availability of credit to higher risk consumers altogether. 
   So, at a time when our constituents most need the flexibilities of these products, i.e., credit, this Democrat Congress is trying to preempt the focused efforts of three different regulators and restricting the access to credit card credit that is made available to American families and to small businesses. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe a far more reasonable course of action would have been the one that was suggested by 14 members of the Financial Services Committee, a bipartisan group of seven Democrats and seven Republicans, when they asked the chairman of the committee to hold hearings on the Federal Reserve proposed rules before deciding whether passing legislation limiting consumer credit was necessary. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert into the Record a copy of this bipartisan letter to Chairman Frank, as well as a copy of the administration's statement of administrative policy on this bill, which makes their concerns about unfair and deceptive practices as clear as their opposition to this underlying legislation that would ``result in less access to credit and higher interest rates for consumers.'' 
   That is what the White House has said, and I will once again quote: This legislation will ``result in less access to credit and higher interest rates for consumers.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this comes at a particularly bad time, when consumers in our economy already have had enough stress to deal with without having to worry about unintended consequences of legislation passed by Congress that would make it even more difficult for families and small businesses to make ends meet.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, since taking control of this House, this Democrat Congress has totally neglected its responsibility to address the domestic supply issues that have created the skyrocketing gas, diesel and energy costs that Americans are facing today, and no doubt, part of the credit crunch that we are facing today and credit card costs that Americans are facing today is as a result of the high cost of gasoline right now that all Americans are paying. 
   By going on vacation for 5 weeks over August, while I and 138 others of my Republican colleagues stayed in Washington to talk about real solutions for American families, this Democrat majority has proven that they do not believe that the energy crisis facing American families and business was important enough to cancel their summer beach plans or book tours to get the job done. 
   So, again, today, the Republicans are here on the floor of the House of Representatives asking each of our colleagues to vote with me to defeat the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, I will move to amend the rule to allow this House to take up a measure that will allow Members to be able to vote for a pro-energy bill and  prevent Members from going home to campaign for reelection without actually passing a bill which will pass and have meaningful reform so that we can lower the price of gasoline at the pump. 
   This legislation that I will be proposing that can be voted on today and that would turn into law would allow States to expand the exploration and extraction of natural resources along the Outer Continental Shelf. Not allowed in the Democrat bill that passed one week ago. 
   It would open the arctic energy slope and oil shale reserves to environmentally prudent exploration and extraction. Not included in the Democrats' bill of a week ago. 
   It would extend expiring renewable energy incentives. It would encourage the streamlining approval of new refining capacity and nuclear power facilities. Not included in the Democrat bill of a week ago. 
   It would encourage advanced research and development of clean coal, coal-to-liquid, and carbon sequestration technologies, which was not included in the Democrat bill a week ago. 
   Perhaps most of all, it would minimize drawn out legal challenges that unreasonably delay or prevent actual domestic energy production. Not included in the Democrats' bill of a week ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, this requirement would finally force the Democrat leadership to take positive, meaningful action to increase the supply of American energy. It would reduce the price at the pump for American families and use, what we term in the Republican Party, an all-of-the-above strategy combining increased supply of American-made energy, improved conservation and efficiency, and provide for new and expanding energy technologies to achieve American energy independence. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, we're here on the floor debating a bill today that may have unintended consequences of drying up the ability that families have and people have and small businesses have for getting credit. 
   I do acknowledge, I think every Member of this House acknowledges, that gasoline prices, energy prices are way too high. Food prices are way too high. But people who are trying to live their lives need the opportunity to have credit, the opportunity to be able to have a credit card, and to be able to place those expenses on their credit card, and then manage their own ability to pay back. That is the essence of what we should be about is trying to help people do that today. 
   Not about creating another credit card crunch. Not about creating credit cards where people don't know whether they're going to be able to get credit or not, and perhaps, more importantly, the opportunity for us to give this marketplace for American consumers stability where they know what they can count on and move forward to take care of their families and their small businesses. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to say also that we believe that the provisions that were put in the rule specifically addressing the earmark reform or earmarks is unacceptable. It's unacceptable to say that this House will quite likely be voting on a massive bill only to find out weeks later we'll find out what was in the bill and those earmarks that accompany that. 
   As the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake) noted, that is disappointing. It's disappointing because this House was advised over 2 years ago that this would be the most honest, open, and ethical Congress in history. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have seen very little to no action on behalf of this new Democrat majority that is open about what they do, that is transparent in what they do. And once again, today, with a record shattering breaking new closed rule, we find that they aren't even willing to take ideas from people in their own party, and I think that's disappointing. 
   As we wind down this last week that we're here before the election, we find that there are new tricks of the trade that take place in this Rules Committee. I'm disappointed that this new Democrat majority continues that. I support the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake) and what he said; and, Mr. Speaker, I would say that that's why I'm asking Members of this body not to support this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   I yield back my time, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to inquire if the gentleman has notified the Blue Dog Caucus that it is time for them to rush out front of their offices and put an extra $25 billion on the national debt. Have we given that notice yet for their offices to begin doing that? 
   We will find out whether they are going to vote for this 25 extra billion dollars that I think is way too much in the emergency supplemental. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again the Democrats are refusing to operate under the rules they campaigned on to open up the political process and use PAYGO rules to fully fund and offset any new mandatory spending. 
   Today is a particularly egregious example of their irresponsible leadership as they threaten to leave our troops in the lurch by micromanaging the war against the United States by terrorists, while also leaving American taxpayers holding the bag by declaring hundreds of millions of dollars in new mandatory spending as an ``emergency.'' 
   SCHIP is an important program where States are given a fixed annual allotment to assist them in providing health care coverage to near-poverty children and pregnant women. However, a few States want to use their SCHIP program to provide health care services to expanded populations that go well beyond the scope of the original program, even though they signed an agreement stating that they promised to pay for any additional costs with their own State funds or to offset those within the Medicaid program. 
   Despite this agreement, Mr. Speaker, a number of States have told Congress that overspending their Federal allotment was their intention all along. Once again they come to Uncle Sam to get a bailout. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not an emergency. This is a loophole being exploited by the Democratic leadership. So today the Democrat leadership is telling these States, You don't have to keep your promises to the Federal Government, and you don't have to worry. We don't mind exploiting a loophole in the rules and calling this an ``emergency'' even though we have known for years that this would happen. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am voting against this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this closed rule and to the blatantly unconstitutional measure that the Democrat majority is bringing to the House floor today. 
   There is not much to celebrate in this deeply flawed legislation that constitutional scholar and law professor Jonathan Turley has called ``the most premeditated, unconstitutional act by Congress in decades.''     
   But I am an optimist, and I have found a very small silver lining in what I think is a cynical political exercise that is designated for President Bush's veto pen, that is, if it ever makes it that far. 
   Today, the American taxpayer can be grateful that at least this week that the Democrat majority has trained its sights on simply trampling on the Constitution rather than propping up the fledgling ranks of big union bosses for the fourth week in a row. While this may not seem like much, it seems to be the best that the Democrat majority is willing to do at this time. 
   My opposition to this measure stems from its incompatibility with a pretty basic foundation of American Government, the Constitution. Section 2 of Article I clearly states that ``the House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the People of the several States.'' The way I see it, any fourth-grader in the country can tell you that D.C. is simply not a State. 
   Supporters of this legislation will claim that the ``District Clause,'' which gives Congress the power to legislate over our Nation's government seat, also gives Congress the power to grant D.C. a Member of Congress. But this same clause makes it clear that by its very nature, D.C. is not a State, which brings us back to the original problem of this bill being completely unconstitutional. 
   But do not take my word for it. If the Democrat leadership will not listen to reason, one would hope that at least they would listen to one of our Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton, who offered an amendment to the Constitution that would have provided D.C. with a vote in the House. Unfortunately, that amendment was defeated on July 22, 1788. 
   But if neither my word nor the Constitution nor the actions of our Founding Fathers is good enough, I wonder if the Democrat majority would be willing to listen to an equal branch of our government for their opinion on this matter. 
   In 2000, the Federal district court in Washington, D.C., concluded that ``the Constitution does not contemplate that the District may serve as a State for the purposes of apportionment of Congressional representatives.'' It seems pretty clear to me, but perhaps not every Member of this body. 
   So, for a moment, let us ignore my word, the Constitution, the actions of our Founding Fathers, and the decisions of the Federal judiciary. 
   What would it mean if Congress simply gave D.C. a seat in the House? Rather than going through the necessary process of passing a constitutional amendment, which, by the way, was attempted in 1978 and failed, it would create a precedent that said Congress would give the District three votes next year, or they could give them 10. It would mean that if Congress did not like the way the new Member from D.C. was voting, it could simply take the seat away, because if Congress has the power to create a seat, it certainly has the power to take that seat away, which it cannot do under the Constitution, the same Constitution that gives States those rights. 
   It would mean that Congress could deny D.C. voters the protection from, let us say, racial discrimination, given by the 15th amendment to the Constitution, or deny them protection from discrimination based on sex given to them in the 19th amendment. Is this the kind of precedent that we should be setting? 
   But rather than discuss the facts or logic of this approach, I suspect that the supporters of this legislation will come to the floor and simply talk about fairness. But I fail to see how it is fair that this would give every voter in Utah an unprecedented two votes,  one for their Member of Congress and one for a new at-large Member, while keeping the one man, one vote principle in every other State. 
   Perhaps a Member on the Democrat side would be kind enough to come down to the floor and explain this logic to me, but I am sure I will not hold my breath. 
   Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress, we take an oath to uphold and support the Constitution, not to trample on it. Personally, I think this is a fairly low bar that has been established. So last night in the Rules Committee, Congressman McHenry and I offered a commonsense amendment to have this new Member from D.C. act to preserve the individual right to keep and bear arms of the residents of the District of Columbia as also provided in the second amendment to the Constitution and upheld on March 9, 2007, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. 
   No matter what the supporters of this bill may claim to the contrary, the Constitution is not a cafeteria. You simply cannot pick and choose which part you are going to respect and which part you are going to ignore. 
   That is why our Framers, in their infinite wisdom, created an orderly, lawful process for amending the Constitution, if you so choose. So despite the fact that this underlying bill is designated for history's trash can, I am attempting to improve it slightly by forcing this entire body to recognize that the rights given in the whole Constitution, not just certain parts, should be recognized by anyone who claims to uphold and defend our government's founding document. 
   Unfortunately, this amendment was defeated on a party-line vote in the Rules Committee, which is fast becoming the graveyard of good ideas in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to reject this rule and the underlying assault on the Constitution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike section 8020 of this legislation which would have the same anticompetitive effect as language already included in almost every other one of the Democrat majority's appropriations bill by preventing funds from being spent to conduct public-private competitions. 
   In this case, it would prevent funds from being used to allow the private sector to compete against the government for commercial jobs by limiting the Defense Department's ability to spend money on this taxpayer friendly activity by putting arbitrary time constraints on the length of time that these studies can take place. 
   While this policy may be good for increasing dues to the public sector union bosses, it is unquestionably bad for taxpayers and for Federal agencies because agencies are left with less money to spend on their core missions when Congress uses this opportunity to take competition away from them. 
   In 2006, Federal agencies competed only 1.7 percent of their commercial workforce which makes up less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire civilian workforce. This very small use of competition for services is expected to generate a savings of $1.3 billion over the next 10 years by closing performance gaps and improving efficiencies. 
   Competitions completed since 2003 are expected to produce almost $7 billion in saving to taxpayers over the next 10 years. This means that taxpayers will receive a return of almost $31 for every dollar spent on competition with annualized expected savings of more than $1 billion.  
   This provision is obviously intended to stall public-private competitions for an entire fiscal year rather than allowing a proven process to work as it was intended, and it would harm taxpayers by denying the Department of Defense the ability to focus its scarce resources and funds and expertise on its core mission. 
   This concerted effort to prevent competitive sourcing from taking place at the Department of Defense demonstrates that the Democrat leadership is hearing clearly from labor bosses that the Defense Appropriations bill represents simply another good opportunity to increase their power at the expense of taxpayers and good government. 
   In this time of stretched budgets and bloated Federal spending, Congress should be looking to use all of the tools it can to find taxpayer savings and to reduce the cost of services that are already being provided by thousands of hardworking companies nationwide. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense, taxpayer-first amendment to oppose the underlying provision to benefit public sector union bosses by keeping cost-saving competition available to the government. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike language included on page 3 of this legislation, which would have the same anti-competitive effect as language already included in almost every other one of the Democrat majority's appropriations bills, by preventing funds from being spent to conduct public-private competitions. 
   In this case, it would prevent funds from being used to allow the private sector to compete against the government for jobs by limiting the Agriculture Department's Chief Financial Officer's ability to spend money on this taxpayer-friendly activity until he provides a redundant report back to Congress on the Department's contracting policies. 
   While this policy may be good for increasing dues payments to public sector union bosses, it is unquestionably bad for taxpayers and for Federal agencies because agencies are left with less money to spend on their core missions when Congress takes the opportunity to use competition and takes that ability away from them.     
   In 2006, Federal agencies competed only 1.7 percent of their commercial workforce, which makes up less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire civilian workforce. This very small use of competition for services is expected to generate savings of over $1.3 billion over the next 10 years by closing performance gaps and improving efficiencies.

   This provision is obviously needed to stall public, private competitions for an entire fiscal year, rather than allowing a proven process to work, as it was intended, and it would harm taxpayers by denying the Department of Agriculture the ability to focus its scarce resources and expertise on core missions. 
   This concerted effort to prevent competition sourcing from taking place at the Department of Agriculture comes just a week after the House passed an agriculture bill that goes way beyond the Federal scope and strips States of their ability to use competitive sourcing to improve their own food stamp programs, demonstrating that the Democrat leadership is hearing clearly from labor bosses that the Agriculture appropriations bill represents yet another good opportunity to increase their power at the expense of taxpayers and good government. 
   In this time of stretched budgets and bloated Federal spending, Congress should be looking to use all the tools it can to find taxpayer savings and reduce the cost of savings that are already being provided by thousands of hardworking companies nationwide.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this highly unorthodox rule and the unnecessary limiting process that is being proposed and that was even talked about here on the House floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, today, for the first time since my service in Congress, the House is considering a rule for the Agriculture appropriations bill that is something other than an open rule. It is also the first time since I began my service that the Rules Committee reported out a limited rule for an appropriations bill that self-executes amendments and revisions to the base text of the bill that may not have withstood the scrutiny of this Congress. 
   One of the self-executing amendments of particular concern that was inserted late last night in the Rules Committee is included in part A of this rule. It is described as adding a limitation, and I quote, to effectively eliminate three West Virginia earmarks from the committee report accompanying the bill. 
   Upon further review, it turns out that these three earmarks total more than $1.5 million and were requested by Congressman ALAN MOLLOHAN and would benefit the Canaan Valley Institute, a nonprofit established by Congressman Mollohan. 
   This highly irregular inclusion of this self-executing provision of the rule is particularly troubling, because the Canaan Valley Institute is currently under investigation by the FBI. In March, when he requested this funding, Congressman Mollohan certified that he had no financial interest in any of the earmarks and affirmed the worthiness of each project. 
   I strongly believe that this late-night maneuver was not properly vetted through the regular order processes. As a result of that, several serious questions have arisen. 
   I would like to engage the Democrat Member of the Rules Committee, my friend from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), on a few questions about this process. 
   The first question that I would yield to the gentleman on is, who asked the Rules Committee to take this highly unusual action and what explanation did they provide to justify the removal of Representative Mollohan's earmarks?

   Mr. SESSIONS. Continuing my dialogue with either gentleman, in as much as the Mollohan earmarks were approved by the entire Appropriations Committee, does the gentleman know whether the appropriation Members on both sides of the aisle have been advised about the reasons for canceling funding for the projects which they have overwhelmingly approved with the knowledge that it was appropriate at the time?

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, another question which I wish to ask is whether the Rules Committee could advise Members seeking to remove Member-supported earmarks from other pieces of legislation, whether they might take  advantage of the precedent we are setting here today and whether they might expect the Rules Committee to look favorably on similar requests for self-executing provisions in the future? 
   Mr. Speaker, the reason why we ask these questions is because the self-executing provisions of this rule are highly unusual and I believe raise lots of questions. We look forward to asking these questions and hope we get forthright answers.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6275, ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Vermont, for not only yielding me this time to discuss the proposed rule for consideration of the alternative minimum tax, but I want to thank him for his friendship in the committee and the professional nature of the way he conducts himself. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we are going to debate a tax increase on America. No surprise. The American public has gotten used to this. The tax-and-spend Democrat Congress, the new Congress, the new way to run Washington, D.C. has resulted in not only economic failures here in this country the last 18 months but also higher gas prices, the inability that we have to control the flow in energy that comes into this country and has made us now more than ever to where we have to go get our energy overseas, send our money overseas, and not be able to be energy sufficient here in this country. 
   But now I find out that the excuse for raising taxes on Americans today is that there's a loophole in the tax law--a loophole--and unintended consequences. The bottom line is that it's the tax law, it was therefore reasoned, and the opportunity for us to grow our economy and build jobs and have job creation and to protect the American consumer is why these were parts of the tax law. 
   It is not unintended consequences, it is not a loophole, it is the law, the tax law of the United States that I am very proud of, and I am disappointed to see that the Congress today will be debating new tax increases on the American people. 
   So I rise in strong opposition to this closed rule, yet another closed rule by this new majority that we have here, and to the underlying legislation, which takes the baffling approach, once again, of raising taxes on Americans and on the American economy during a downturn of our economy, rather than taking a way to prevent a tax increase on hardworking and unsuspecting middle class taxpayers, which sets the stage for even more job-killing tax increases in the very near future just to prevent the current low-tax policies that Republicans in Congress worked so hard to pass and to support on behalf of American taxpayers. 
   I think it's interesting, Mr. Speaker, that when Republicans bring tax bills to the floor of the House of Representatives, we are able to tout how many jobs our tax bill will create, how many jobs the economy will create. I have never, ever heard of a Democrat tax-and-spend bill that then touts how many jobs will be created, because they don't. They kill jobs. They kill jobs in America every time we do what we are doing today with the new Democrat majority to raise taxes on America.  
   Under the Democrats' flawed policy of pay-as-you-go logic used to defend this legislation, in just 2 short years--when a number of critically important tax policies like the $1,000 Republican tax credit and the Republican lower tax rate on income and capital gains and dividends are set to expire, that created job growth--the new Democrat majority pay-as-you-go rules will require more than $3.5 trillion in tax increases, and that is what they stand for today, increasing taxes on the American people, killing jobs all across the country, and yet they want to blame President Bush. Just incredible. 
   It makes no sense to me why we are hamstringing our economy and saddling working families with higher taxes when revenues aren't the problem. Washington is already collecting more taxes as a percentage of GDP than the historical average over the last 40 years. 
   We don't have a revenue problem. We have a spending problem. What Washington really has is a spending problem that this new Democrat majority can't fix and can't solve because they are all about taxing and spending. Federal spending is higher by nearly $530 billion more than the Congressional Budget Office's 2000 projection for the year 2007. So going back to 2000, and they projected how much money we would need to spend, we are $530 billion more this year, thanks to a new Democrat majority, making increased spending the main reason why 99 percent of our Nation's worsened budget picture over the last 7 years is occurring. We have got a downturn in the economy because we are raising taxes and spending to support a bloated government. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people have known for a long time that Republican Members of Congress support an economically responsible solution to solving the alternative minimum tax problem. Just contrast this year's Republican budget proposal, which prevented expansion of the AMT for the next 3 years and achieved full repeal in 2013, with the Democrat budget. If you compare them, the Democrat budget, which jammed a $70 billion tax increase into our economy to pay for simply a temporary 1-year fix, and did nothing about AMT for the next 5 years after that. A 1-year fix, raising taxes $70 billion, rather than fixing the problem. 
   Mr. Speaker, taxpayers are already aware that last month, House Republicans unanimously supported a clean AMT patch without tax increases to prevent more than 25 million families--including 21 million families who didn't owe AMT in 2007--from paying an additional $61.5 billion that's going to come due this next April, just like we did in December of last year and just like we will continue to do if Republicans once again become the majority party in Congress. 
   What taxpayers may not realize is that House Democrats used to be for the same thing--at least that was until they won the majority. And with it came the opportunity to salivate, to get all this money, and to couple what used to be a bipartisan, commonsense tax prevention policy with massive, unnecessary tax hikes that burden this country, and for 18 months we have seen the promise of higher taxes, and it's killing our economy. As recently as last December, the House passed a ``clean'' AMT patch, without crippling the economy with tax increases, by an overwhelming majority of 352-64. 
   The only thing worse than House Democrats' tax-and-spend flip-flops on this issue is the fact that their comrades in the other body--including Finance Chairman MAX BAUCUS--have already recognized the reality that at the end of this day, the AMT patch will not be paid for, and that this cynical exercise meant to provide political cover is in fact dead-on-arrival the moment it passes this House. But let it be said: It's another opportunity for the new Democrat majority to show how much they want tax increases to ruin our economy. 
   The cost of this political gamesmanship is really quite simple: the exposure of millions of middle class taxpayers to an average tax increase of $2,400, and the increased likelihood of a repeat of last year's mismanaged process in which the late enactment of the patch prevented the IRS from processing AMT-affected returns until about 4 weeks into the filing season. It was a disaster this year as a result of the new majority. 
   What is worse, Mr. Speaker, is how the Democrat Congress proposed to raise the additional $61 billion of additional taxes just to prevent this tax increase. That's right. We are going to have a tax increase on the tax increase on middle class families who were never intended to pay this. 
   First, and rather unsurprisingly, this Democrat ``Drill-Nothing'' Congress helps repeal a tax deduction that helps American companies to produce energy for American consumers, but they are going to take that advantage away from consumers. It will only hurt energy exploration in this country, and now what we are going to see is that the American consumer will pay more at the pump. 
   While this proposal is laughable at best for everyone tuning in on C-SPAN across America today, it is about par for the course for the Democrat Party that also thinks that suing OPEC, not increasing the supply of American energy, will help bring down prices for consumers. 
   Second, this bill increases taxes on entrepreneurs that create jobs and improve failing companies, and raises the long-term capital gains rate on them from 15 to 35 percent, or even higher. So the people that are the ``goose that are laying the golden egg'' are once again slaughtered by this new Democrat proposal. 
   Once again, I know that most people around this country watching this debate understand that raising taxes on job creators reduces jobs and hurts our economy. But don't worry. You can blame President Bush for that, for the actions of this Congress. 
   Unfortunately, this proposal is not a surprise, coming from a Democrat Congress that believes when real estate and credit markets are at their weakest, that is the optimal time to raise taxes and send our economy over the edge. 
   Finally, the bill goes back on America's word by increasing taxes on transactions with treaty countries by mandating a new reporting requirement on private companies so that the IRS can know directly how much is being paid to merchants every year, including the Social Security or tax identification numbers associated with those transactions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have got to hand it to the new Democrat majority. Every single week, they find out a new way to assault the taxpayer, every single week they find a way to raise taxes, to increase spending, and more rules and regulations. They did it again this week. Congratulations to the new Democrat majority. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this tax increase, and I will tell you that I will continue to stand up on the side of taxpayers and middle class Americans who say enough is enough. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will tell you--you've already heard me say it--this massive tax increase, once again, not only on the economy, but on Americans, could be done a different way. It could be solved. It could be solved by following through on promises that were made by both parties to do something about the AMT. 
   We've got to do something. We continue to see middle class Americans caught in the crossfire. Today, we see it's not just a crossfire with inability to solve the problem, it's partially solved for 1 year by raising $61 billion worth of new tax increases on Americans that they will have to pay this next April.     
   Mr. Speaker, since taking control of Congress in 2007, this Democrat Congress has totally neglected its responsibility to do anything constructive to address the domestic supply issues that have created skyrocketing gas, diesel and energy costs that American families are facing today. As a matter of fact, gas rose 10 cents a gallon across America just in the last few days. 
   So, today, I urge my colleagues once again to vote with me to defeat the previous question so this House can finally consider real solutions to the energy problems and the high costs that  we are facing. If the previous question is defeated, I will move to amend the rule to allow for consideration of H.R. 5656, which would repeal the ban on acquiring advanced alternative fuels, introduced by my good friend JEB HENSARLING of Texas back in March, almost 3 full months ago. 
   This legislation would reduce the price of gasoline by allowing the Federal Government to procure advanced alternative fuels derived from diverse sources like oil shale, tar sands and coal-to-liquid technology--in other words, marketplace answers--just by allowing the government to do that. 
   Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which this Democrat Congress passed, places artificial and unnecessary restraints on the Department of Defense in getting its fuel from friendly sources, like coal-to-liquid, oil shale and tar sands resources that are all abundant in the United States and Canada. Needless to say, it raises grave national and economic security concerns. 
   Mr. Speaker, this new Democrat Congress wants us to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to go build another Dubai. They want consumers in this country to pay higher costs. By doing so, it is a national security issue. We must do something. Adding alternatives to the supply chain is what is important. 
   Mr. Speaker, Canada currently is the largest U.S. oil supplier. It sent 1.8 million barrels per day of crude oil and 500,000 barrels per day of refined products to the United States in 2006. According to the Canadian Government, about half of the Canadian crude is derived from oil sands, with the oil sands production forecast to reach about 3 million barrels a day in 2015. Section 526, passed by this Democrat House, choked this flow of fuel from one of our Nation's most reliable allies and economic partners, and it increased our military's reliance on fuels from unfriendly and unstable governments around the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of that amendment and the extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3195, ADA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman, my friend from Ohio, for yielding me the time to discuss this proposed rule for consideration of the Americans with Disabilities Restoration Act of 2007. And a hearty congratulations to the new Democrat majority for their openness as we celebrate the 58th closed rule, a new record for the United States Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the underlying legislation, which would amend and improve the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA as it is called, that was enacted into law in 1990 by President George Herbert Walker Bush with the strong bipartisan support of Congress. 
   The ADA--which was passed to, and I quote, provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities--protects individuals from discrimination in hiring, firing, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment on the basis of a person's disability. 
   Often referred to as the world's first comprehensive disability anti-discrimination law, the ADA specifies what employers, government agencies, and the managers of public facilities must do to ensure that persons with disabilities have the opportunity to fully participate in our society. 
   The ADA consists of three major titles protecting Americans with disabilities: 
   Title I prohibits discrimination in public or private employment; 
   Title II prohibits discrimination at public entities, like public universities or hospitals; 
   And title III prohibits discrimination at places of public accommodations like hotels and restaurants. 
   Mr. Speaker, this law has made a world of difference for millions of Americans with disabilities. But, for all of the great results that have come from this law, I believe it can still be improved. For far too long, our Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, have wrestled with some of the contents of Congress' intent in defining the ADA key concepts. 
   For example, the ADA requires employers to make reasonable accommodations to facilitate employees with disabilities but not if this causes undue hardship, leaving the courts to decide what is reasonable and what is undue. Most of all, Federal courts have spent years being puzzled over exactly who is considered disabled under the law. But, today, we have the opportunity to pass this legislation and to clarify Congress' intent, finally settling these outstanding questions of law once and for all, or so we hope. 
   I want to be clear that these shortcomings do not in any way minimize the great things that this legislation has achieved for disabled people in America. Today, many public accommodations like hotels, restaurants, and recreation facilities have opted for voluntary compliance. We have cut curbs, the areas where sidewalks slope down, to be at a level of the street to allow easy passage for wheelchairs and for other mechanisms that aid the disabled, which were virtually unheard of before ADA was passed and that now are in compliance in most major cities. 
   Unfortunately, since 1999, several U.S. Supreme Court decisions have narrowly provided the definition of disabilities so much so that persons with serious conditions, such as epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, cancer, diabetes, and cerebral palsy have been determined to not have impairments that meet the definition of ``disability'' under the ADA. 
   H.R. 3195 builds upon the ADA's original intent by clarifying what disabilities qualify an individual for coverage, and they address a number of the statute's further limitations that have been raised by disability advocates. 
   Because of this ambiguity, today, I join with more than 250 of my colleagues in supporting this legislation, which passed out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous consent and out of the Education and Labor Committee by a vote of 43-1. Like my colleagues, I support expanding the definition of ``disabled,'' which was the main goal of this legislation, as well supporting to ensure that people with disabilities do not lose their coverage under the ADA because their condition is manageable and treatable with medication. 
   These policies have been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Society for Human Resource Management, the Human Resources Policy Association, and many other pro-business organizations. 
   From the disability community, this legislation was also supported by the National Epilepsy Foundation, the American Diabetes Association, the American Association of People with Disabilities, and other leading advocacy groups. 
   Mr. Speaker, the ADA has transformed the American society since its enactment, helping millions of Americans with disabilities to succeed in the workplace and making transportation, housing, buildings, services, and other elements of daily life more accessible to individuals with disabilities. 
   I applaud my colleagues for bringing this legislation, an important action, to the floor today, and I look forward to its passage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Since taking control of Congress in 2007, this Democrat Congress has totally neglected its responsibilities to do anything constructive to address the domestic supply issues that have created skyrocketing gas, diesel, and energy costs that American families are facing today, including costs that are unacceptable for many disabled Americans who are struggling to be able to get to work or to live their life. 
   So, today, I urge my colleagues to vote with me to defeat the previous question so this House can finally consider real solutions to the energy crisis. If the previous question is defeated, I will move to amend the rule to allow for consideration of H.R. 5656, yet another time this Republican party is on the floor to say we support consumers and that we support American independence and security. This bill, H.R. 5656, would repeal the ban on acquiring advanced alternative fuels, and this bill was introduced by my dear friend JEB HENSARLING of Texas way back in March, 3 months ago. 
   This legislation would reduce the price of gasoline by allowing the Federal Government to procure advanced alternative fuels derived from diverse sources like oil shale, tar sands, and coal-to-liquid technology, commonsense marketplace answers to make sure that the American consumer and America is competitive with the world, rather than sending billions of dollars overseas, funding American enemies and providing the world with jobs and opportunities outside of what the consumer intended in this country.  
   Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which this Democrat Congress passed, places artificial and unnecessary restraints on the Department of Defense. Perhaps it is no surprise that this Democrat Congress places artificial and unnecessary restraints on the Department of Defense in getting its own fuel from friendly sources, like the coal-to-liquid, oil shale, and tar sands resources that are abundant in the United States and in Canada, our friend to the north. Needlessly raising grave national and economic security concerns is what this Democrat Congress has done to our military. 
   Mr. Speaker, Canada is currently the largest U.S. oil supplier. It sent 1.8 million barrels every day of crude oil and 500,000 barrels per day of refined products to the United States in 2006. That is according to the Canadian government. About half of the Canadian crude is derived from oil sands, with the sands production forecast to reach almost 3 million barrels per day in 2015. 
   Section 526 is choking this flow of fuel from one of our Nation's most reliable allies and economic partners, and is increasing the military's reliance on fuels from unfriendly and unstable countries. On top of that, it is causing the American consumer to pay more at the pump. We saw a 10-cent rise in the price of each gallon of gasoline just in the last week. 
   Mr. Speaker, now is the time for action. Now is not the time to be suing OPEC and to be saying ``no'' to a balanced energy proposal. 
   I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Florida for yielding me this time, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This bill is real simple. It's real simple. For several years there was a negotiation with HUD to look at the best practices across this country from people who are in the housing industry to determine best how to go about and manage assets of housing units. This bill is all about taking away the best practices that exist for nongo vernment housing, the rest of the industry, because it will take money away from people who don't engage in best practices. Of course it will take money away from them. But what this is all about is to try to take a negotiation that has happened for about 7 years from what the previous Congresses have passed to say we think that public housing needs to raise its standards to where we do have proper public housing, public housing that works, public housing that can pass the smell test of asset management. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition. I rise in opposition not only to the rule, which I believe is unnecessarily restrictive, but also to the provisions in this bill and the underlying legislation that unilaterally and at the last minute seeks to abuse the Congress's power and to undo specific parts of a process that have previously been carefully negotiated over years with the private sector best practices and brokered over the last decade to make public housing more accountable for its spending and more accountable to the public housing units that we don't want to go into disrepair in the United States of America. 
   In 1998 Congress passed the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act, which among other things required a deliberate and negotiated rule-making proc ess to bring asset management at our Nation's public housing administrations up to a reasonable standard. What we are here to do today is to say we don't want that standard. 
   And you're right. The gentleman from Florida is right. Public housing units that cannot meet the standards would lose money. That's why we talk about waste, fraud, and abuse. People that do not use the money that has been given them by this Congress, by the taxpayer to work in the best interests, we thought, I think, as we vote to s pend money, of people who are in public housing, who, through some sometimes no fault of their own, have to end  up in public housing and find out they are in a rat-infested, bad housing project because asset management standards aren't followed. Amazing. 
   By adopting widespread private sector common practices such as project-based budgeting and accounting to ensure that costs are known, managed, and maintained at a reasonable level, which is what the current bill is about, which is what we're goin g to undo, Congress wisely gave public housing administrations the tools they needed, and just like private sector tools, to manage their own finances better, bringing them into line with every other operator of subsidized housing in this country and ensuring that spending moneys to support their tenant and tenants remain the highest priority. We are going to do away with that today. That's what we are going to do away with, and we call that new and approved. I call that a sham and disrespectful of the resi dents whom we are trying to help. 
   Today's legislation would overturn these longstanding negotiations and turn back the clock for public housing administrations nationwide by eliminating any restrictions on the amount of management fees they could charge, promoting inefficiency, reducing the level of funding available to tenants, and decreasing oversight and accountability. In other words, making sure that these public housing agencies stay on the watch list for waste, fraud, and abuse rather than using private sector standards of best practices to make them better. 
   Mr. Speaker, I cannot understand why this self-proclaimed most honest, ethical, and open Congress in history would use this time today to bring this legislation to the floor to make financial management of mid-sized public housing administrations less transparent, less responsive, and not even following the standards established by the private sector and by unilaterally overturning a lengthy and fairly negotiated rule-making process. But he re we are. 
   In fact, if Speaker Pelosi really wanted to demonstrate her commitment to honest, open, and ethical government, she could be using this time instead to take up a resolution that I and over 150 of my Republican colleagues have cosponsored, authored by my good friend, Representative Jack Kingston from Georgia, which is a continuation of House Republicans' long-term commitment to reform the earmark process. Congressman Kingston's bill would create a Joint Committee on Earmark Ref orm to conduct a full study of the earmark practices of the House, the Senate, and executive branch. Upon completion of this study, the joint committee would file a report of its findings and its recommendations. Most importantly, until this report is filed, the House would put in place an immediate moratorium on the consideration of all earmarks. 
   By the way, that's the people's money. That's the people's money that people really back home are worried about. 
   Instead, Mr. Speaker, this House, which r ecently tied the record as the most closed Congress in history, with 49 closed rules so far in the 110th Congress, will consider this legislation that will impede the successful transition to, and implementation of, asset management by overturning a long negotiated process that is consistent with proper standards of the private sector.     
   I know that other bills like the bipartisan Senate legislation to give our Nation's intelligence services tools that they need to protect Americans against terrorists is also trying to be taken up by the House. But, instead, this Democrat leadership has chosen to miss yet another opportunity to provide Americans with greater security by instead allowing the Protect America Act to expire. If there is any question as to why the public holds Congress in such low regard, with only about one in f ive Americans approving the job that this House is doing, one need not look any further than the congressional calendar this week, again, this week, and examine what both the Democrat leadership and the House are doing and what we are neglecting to do. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to insert in the Record a Statement of Administrative Policy explaining their strong opposition to H.R. 3521's passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would, very simply, provide sunshine and transparency for shareholders so that there is full disclosure about who is financing efforts to influence their vote on this new congressionally mandated, nonbinding shareholder resolution. Let me give an example of a substantially similar disclosure requirement that every Member of this body understands, because it is already a current practice. 
   As Federal candidates, we are each obligated to disclose to the Federal Election Commission the name, occupation and amount given from each of our donors. These funds can then be used for FEC-approved campaign purposes. We require this, as well as we create caps for the amount that can be donated over a legislation cycle, because public interest is advanced by letting those who cast votes for their Members of Congress know who funds these campaigns. 
   My amendment would not limit the amount that can be spent like the FEC does for political contributions on the amount that people or organizations like labor bosses, environmental groups or consumer advocates spend on influencing this new mandatory nonbinding vote. 
   The purpose of this amendment is not to impede the ability of organizations to influence this vote. If they hold shares in stock, they would be willing to express their desires. The point of this amendment is simply to provide voters, in this case, shareholders, with access to information about who is spending money to influence that vote. 
   My amendment tasks the Securities and Exchange Commission with setting a de minimis level of spending and with collecting important information about anyone or any organization that spends over that amount to influence this vote, including who is spending the money, what they are spending the money on and how much they are spending to influence the votes of other shareholders. If an individual wants to  spend more than this de minimis amount and not disclose their identity to shareholders, they are still perfectly able to do so. However, their votes would no longer count in this mandatory vote. 
   My amendment provides an appropriate level of transparency for shareholder elections. And if we believe that voters deserve this information, then we should also be willing to give shareholders this same level of transparency. 
   I firmly disagree with the Democrat majority, with the underlying premise of this legislation that it is the Federal Government's job to place this nonbinding mandate on private entities, especially because public companies are already empowered to take this shareholder vote if they so choose and because there is no obligation for anyone to own shares in the company if they do not like the way that it is being managed. 
   I am also confused by the Democrat majority's recent conversion to the merits of democracy in determining an organization's actions. Less than 2 months ago, the same leadership brought to the floor legislation that strips American workers of the right to use a secret ballot to decide whether or not to unionize, and provides for unprecedented intimidation of employees by union bosses under a fundamentally antidemocratic process known as ``card check.'' 
   But if we are going to pass this interventionist legislation, my amendment would be one small step in the right direction towards giving shareholders all the disclosures that they might need to make an informed decision. 
   Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record a letter of support from the American Shareholders Association that was sent to Speaker Pelosi in support of my amendment.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from California as well as the gentleman from Massachusetts, who, as the chairman of the committee, has forthrightly come before the Rules Committee, made himself available and is doing so again tonight on the floor. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is quite simple that this is about transparency, and I think that is what this bill is about. It is about bringing transparency and some clarity to a shareholder, to be able to know a little bit more and to express themselves about what they think about executive compensation. 
   I disagree with that. But let's add some more transparency and at least say that if someone else is going to become engaged in the effort, other than the individual shareholder, that they be given an opportunity to have to at least register their activities and what they are doing. The Securities and Exchange Commission, just like the Federal Election Commission, has a lot of knowledge about how business works and how transactions work. I have no reason to assume that, let's say, GE, that they would have a shareholder for GE held to some standard of $500 or $1,000 as the gentleman suggests, that some retiree could not influence as many people as they wanted, that they would have to go through a reporting process. 
   Mr. Chairman, the bottom line is that this should be about doing the right thing, where we would understand who was on what side, what they were attempting to influence and whether they were trying to influence the corporation in some way. I think shareholders should know about that. 
   I believe that the SEC could forthrightly understand that the size of the company, the size of the mailing and those things that happen would be appropriately determined. Obviously, if you are going to go on TV, that threshold might be less. If you are going to go in the mail, perhaps a different threshold. But what I am suggesting to you is it is not us setting the standard; it is the Securities and Exchange Commission that wants to regulate, in a fair and proper way, the marketplace.

   So I would ask this body to understand today that we might well be passing this bill, but that this amendment process is to bring forward ideas that bring clarity and understanding of transparency. I believe shareholders would also be entitled to know who is attempting to influence them and what those words might be that they choose, rather than just beating up a company. I don't think it is good for anybody in this country to receive a message that might be aimed at someone without full disclosure, without the proper notification about who they were and what their intentions were. This is about transparency. This is about sunlight. This is about doing the right thing that would enhance the bill that is before us today. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity for Mr. Frank to be able to not only forthrightly offer me the time in fairness, I would also like to thank the Rules Committee, of which I have been a member now for 9 years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule and to the underlying legislation, which I think constitutes an unnecessary and unwarranted Federal intrusion into the free enterprise system and the private sector. The legislation that the Democrat majority has brought to the House today would create a new Federal mandate on publicly held companies, but does so in a half-hearted way that would have absolutely no practical impact on its purported goal of improving disclosure and addressing ``excessive'' executive compensation. 
   The Democrats' Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act would force every publicly held company to bear the costs of administering a toothless, nonbinding shareholder vote on pay packages of its highest compensated officials during every proxy vote. It is unclear, however, what the outcome of this vote, which under current rules could already happen today at any publicly held company, would mean for the company, the board of directors, executives or the shareholders. 
   Yesterday in the Rules Committee, Chairman BARNEY FRANK testified that this vote was not intended to create a new fiduciary responsibility for board members. Even if a majority of shareholders agreed that a company's executives were being compensated too generously, there are no provisions in this legislation to obligate a board to comply with this decision. 
   So if a board does choose to ignore an affirmative vote, again according to Chairman Frank's testimony in the Rules Committee, since there is no fiduciary responsibility and no private right of action created by this new mandatory shareholder vote, there is no legal recourse provided in this bill for shareholders to force board compliance. 
   So rather than demonstrating the courage of their convictions that executive pay is wildly out of control in this country and that shareholders should be able to rein it in unilaterally through a ballot process, Democrats have chosen to bring legislation to the floor today, forcing private entities to take an action that they are already capable of taking by their very own nature. But this would make this new mandatory vote little more than a weak ``sense of the shareholder'' resolution that can be simply ignored by a board with impunity. 
   I am also extremely surprised, Mr. Speaker, by the Democrat leadership's recent conversion to the merits of democracy in determining an organization's actions. Less than 2 months ago, this same leadership brought to the floor legislation that strips American workers of their right to use a secret ballot to decide whether or not to unionize and provides for unprecedented intimidation of employees by union bosses under a fundamentally antidemocratic process known as ``card check.'' But I suppose the Democrats' new-found selective commitment to democratic principles is better late than never. 
   The reality is that shareholders already have a democratic option available to them if they think that a board is shirking its fiduciary responsibilities to investors. They can sell their shares and vote with their dollars. This is a basic principle of how markets work in a free enterprise system, and it has been the steadfast commitment to principles like these that has made the American economy the envy of the world over the last decade, even while economies across Europe have stagnated and shrunk. 
   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Frank has represented to the House that the real aim of this legislation is not to create a new class of lawsuits for the trial bar to exploit, and I take him at his word. But that leaves only one sensible explanation for why the Democrat majority would bring such a toothless bill to the floor of the House today, and that is to provide outsiders, such as Big Labor bosses, environmentalists and so-called ``consumer activists,'' with a new avenue to criticize the management of corporations and to compel boards to do their bidding.     
   Information about executive compensation is already fully disclosed to investors, who have every opportunity to determine whether or not it is too generous before becoming an owner of a listed security. And under this bill, even if they decide that it is too generous, the legislation contains no enforcement mechanism. This legislation simply provides a foot in the door for outside organizations to try to bully boards of directors in hopes of weakening management and gaining concessions down the road. This bill does nothing to improve corporate governance. It does nothing to improve board decision-making or increase shareholder value. That is why I have submitted an amendment that would force any person or organization who spends a significant sum on trying to influence the outcome of this new mandatory vote to disclose who they are, how much they have spent and on what activities so that investors can have a full picture of who is trying to influence them in this decision-making process. 
   While I think this amendment would improve a misguided bill, I am not holding my breath at all that the majority party will join me in standing up for increased transparency. But who knows? Today we learned that they have radically changed their opinion on the merits of secret ballots, so perhaps they will stand up for transparency in proxy vote influence-peddling also. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule and the weak underlying ``sense of the shareholder'' legislation. Congress can do better than this. And rather than mimicking the interventionist economic policies of Europe, I believe we should reject this legislation and stand up for what sets our economy apart and has spurred our continued economic and job growth while others sank, which would be a commitment to free markets and an understanding that when given information, investors can make good decisions on their own. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand up for the free enterprise system and the American way of doing business. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the gentleman from Massachusetts speaking so clearly about what is happening. I would clarify my words and say to the gentleman, I do believe that it would be appropriate to have anyone who is attempting to influence an outcome of a vote, that they should have a requirement upon them to identify themselves, to state how much money they are spending and the activities that they are engaged in. And I think that that is full disclosure also about the activities that could take place under this new nonbinding resolution that we are attempting to pass. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would yield 5 minutes to the ranking member of the Rules Committee, the gentleman from San Dimas, California (Mr. Dreier).

   Mr. SESSIONS. In response to the gentleman at this time, I do not have any additional speakers. I would use this time for my close. I thank the gentleman for the inquiry. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think the point that would be taken here would follow those words that DAVID DREIER spoke on, and that is, we simply call things what they are honestly. We don't try to call things what they aren't. We follow the regular order of this House, as has been established, going back at least to the 103rd Congress when Mr. Moakley, the chairman of the Rules Committee, said, this is what we will call things, this is what an open rule is, this is what a modified rule is. That is the point we are trying to make today, that you should call something what it is. 
   At this time, I would like to include a statement of administration policy on this bill.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, while the CBO estimate in the report from the Committee on Ways and Means does not identify any unfunded mandates, it's important to note that there are and that there is no such estimate for the amendment self-executed by the closed rule reported in the dead of night by the majority's Rules Committee. We have no way of knowing whether these new provisions, which we did not see before midnight last night, will impose strict new intergovernmental mandates on our State and local governments. 
   Furthermore, this new language appears to be littered with earmarks for hospital-specific projects. We do not have a list of the Members requesting those projects, and we do not know if the proper certifications have been filed with the authorizing committees. 
   Therefore, Madam Speaker, it is essential that we stop, take a breather and put off consideration of this hastily drafted legislation, which was totally rewritten in the dead of night, behind closed doors. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the question of consideration. 
   I yield to the gentleman from California.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, the new Democrat majority promised the American people and those Republicans who are now in the minority that this would be an open and transparent new way of doing business by Democrats. We were told back in January and February, oh, the only reason we're doing closed rules is because we've got to do them to get our agenda through quickly, because we're not going to allow anybody to stop that. Six in '06 has to be done. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, there were no hearings even done on this with the text of the bill that the committee could look at. Last night, 30 minutes before we went into Rules Committee, we had an opportunity to see the language. 
   On top of the $200 billion Medicare cuts, the Democrats have now slipped in extra hospital funding for powerful Democrat districts. That means where Democrats are they've slipped in these brand new earmarks, right there for them. 
   We have not had an opportunity to look at the bill, we don't know whether the proper notification has been done, and so what we're saying now today is that what we should do is take a few minutes and sit back and look.

And not one time, not one time, was the word let's make health care better for America, not one time was it about trying to make things better for  doctors and hospitals and patients. It was a slam dunk, hit 'em out of bounds, the doctors, who they claim make all this money, who it's all about the doctors making money. 
   And I had an opportunity to engage those people who represented the Ways and Means Committee and the Commerce Committee, and I said, hey, during your hearings, that you talk about you having all these hearings, did anyone ever bring up that specialty hospitals are those many times joint ventures with hospitals where they're trying to take care of patients who come for elective surgeries to get them out of hospitals that are full, emergency rooms that are backed up, and then we've got a problem with health because of bacteria in the hospitals. And these hospitals are safer and offer elective surgery to get people in and out that is much cheaper and safer and better. 
   They acted like it was a foreign concept. They acted like they had never heard about the marketplace before.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to yet another closed rule and to the ill-conceived underlying legislation. 
   While I do not support this bill nor the way it has been brought to the floor without a single legislative markup, I would like to thank the Democratic leadership for one thing: By cramming this bill through the House, they are giving every single Member of this body the opportunity to go on record regarding which vision for the future our Nation's health care system should take. 
   Madam Speaker, for that, I truly appreciate and respect what the Democrat leadership has done. 
   The first vision for our future, for them, is to slowly shift as many Americans as possible into a one-size-fits-all government program. You know what it has been called in the past: Socialized medicine. 
   I congratulate the Democrat leadership, because that vision is ably embodied in the bill today, H.R. 3162. Rather than using this bill as an opportunity to cover children who cannot obtain coverage through Medicaid or the private market, this bill uses children as pawns in their cynical attempt to make millions of Americans completely reliant upon the government for their health care needs. And you know what they say, Madam Speaker: If you think health care is expensive now, wait until it's free. 
   Democrat advocates of bureaucrat-run, Washington-run health care fails to disclose how they would achieve this vision. Republicans who actually care about covering children created SCHIP so that children who had no insurance coverage through Medicaid or the insurance market could get it without bankrupting the Federal Government or dislocating a healthy marketplace. 
   H.R. 3162 turns this innovative vision on its head by increasing government spending exponentially, leaving taxpayers holding the bag for these increased costs. This bill has no income limits for eligibility, no annual authorization limit, and allows States to determine who qualifies, despite the fact that the Federal Government is on the hook 100 percent of the time. This is on top of a current system which we know that some States already abuse. Minnesota spends 61 percent of its children's health care insurance on adults, while Wisconsin spends 75 percent of its children's health care money on adults, taking scarce resources away from the intended target, children. 
   But the real losers under this big government vision are patients. For 100 children who are enrolled in the new SCHIP proposal, 25 to 50 children will leave private insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office; 77 percent of children at between 200 and 300 percent of the Federal poverty level already had insurance in 2005. 
   As we all know, being a part of the government-run health care program does not mean better quality. Since most SCHIP programs reimburse at Medicaid rates, many of these new SCHIP enrollees will encounter significant difficulties accessing care. American Medicaid patients, for example, are currently waiting as long to see a specialist or to have surgery as patients in Canada. 
   If Democrats were serious about ensuring that every American has access to inexpensive and high-quality health care, we would be taking a different vision and a different direction for our health care; one that tackles the system's real underlying problems and revolutionizes and gives incentives to our health care system to provide better results. 
   All families should have access to tax exemptions up to $15,000 a year for health care, not just those who work for large employers. Congress should spend its time passing a law to give Americans the ability to purchase health insurance across State lines, because health insurance options should not be limited by your zip code. 
   Congress should be working to ensure that those who can't get insurance on the market have access to coverage through high-risk pools and low-income tax credits. 
   Madam Speaker, I am not here to oppose the idea of SCHIP. It was a Republican-controlled Congress that created SCHIP. I do support its true mission. But H.R. 3162 is a camouflaged attempt at slowly siphoning Americans away from insurance plans into a big, Washington, D.C. government-run system. 
   To pay for this flawed, big government vision, this legislation robs seniors by forcing many of them out of their existing Medicare coverage at a time when our Nation is looking for better ways to sustain Medicare's future. Medicare part C is an innovative plan that is working well by bringing choices into Medicare. After these seniors are harmed in the long run, it is the taxpayers who will be stuck with the rest of the bill for this incredible expansion of government and intrusion into our lives in taking away our choices. 
   Republicans have already proven this would be a positive, innovative vision that can work. Two years ago, Members from both sides of the aisle came together to pass the Dylan Lee James Family Opportunity Act, or FOA. We learned that many children with disabilities fell into a catch-22 circumstance in which their families made too much to qualify for Medicaid but could not afford or access private coverage, so these children often went without coverage. FOA was a commonsense solution which filled a void and provided coverage for these children up to 300 percent of the poverty level. 
   Madam Speaker, we have two serious issues facing our Nation that we are dealing with right now: Medicare's future, and making our Nation's health insurance system more affordable and accessible for all Americans. By focusing the wrong vision for our future, the bill does nothing to address either problem. 
   It ignores the fact that our Nation produced the greatest health care advocates in the world, many of which come as a result of a competitive insurance market. The American survival rate for leukemia is 50 percent. The European rate is just right at 35 percent. For prostate cancer, the American survival rate is 81.2 percent. In France, it is 61.7 percent, and in England, it is 44.3 percent. 
   Rather than trying to emulate the European socialized, outdated approach, we should be working on a vision to give every single American an opportunity to take part in our competitive insurance market. 
   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to oppose this closed rule and the underlying legislation to drag America into a one-size-fits-all model of defeatism. Returning the balance of power, once again, to Washington, D.C. to run our health care plan is what the new Democrat majority is all about. 
   Madam Speaker, I oppose that. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Sutton) for yielding me the time, the gentlewoman from Ohio, my friend on the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this rule and to the outrageous tax increase conference report that the Democrat majority is bringing to the House floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, we will reiterate, the Democrat Party says it's not a tax increase, but if it's not a tax increase, then it's several hundred billion dollars more worth of spending. It's one or the other, because what we see here today is exactly that. They are going to give us the largest single tax increase in the history of this country, and even though they say it's not a tax increase, then it's going to be an outrageous spending spree because they intend to spend more money or have more taxation, and that's why we're opposed to this bill. 
   I wish I could report to my colleagues that the majority Democrats had seen the downside of their tax-and-spend ways since the House last considered the budget in March, but on the positive side this budget does contain a 1 year Alternative Minimum Tax patch which prevents over 20 million middle class Americans from being slammed by this tax. 
   And this tax in this budget also represents the largest tax increase in history, not the first anyway, but I'm sorry to report that it's about as good as it gets from here because the massive and irresponsible tax increase included in the House budget would still be the second largest in American history, weighing in at least $217 billion over the next 5 years. 
   It also contains a trigger that could nearly double it by including increases in taxes in marginal rates, capital gains and dividend taxes, among other tax relief that was provided previously by the Republican majority. 
   As further evidence that the Democrats continue to ignore their campaign trail promises to demonstrate fiscal discipline, the additional spending envisioned by this plan will trigger an automatic tax hike that will affect every single taxpaying American. 
   This means that as Democrats continue to implement their true tax-and-spend agenda, important middle class tax relief provisions passed by the Republican majorities of the past, such as the marriage penalty and the child tax credit, will shrink or disappear, raising the Democrats' tax increase right back to the original House-passed level of $400 billion, or restoring it to its historic infamy, which it would truly be, as the largest tax increase in American history. 
   And if this insatiable appetite for taxing were not enough, Democrats leave themselves enough room in this budget to raise taxes even further to pay for more than $190 million of additional, unfunded spending promises. 
   This budget also promises and provides for a massive new spending spree by increasing nondefense appropriations by $22 billion over 2007 levels. This is in addition to the $26 billion that they have already proposed to spend outside the normal appropriations process through the omnibus and supplemental legislation that they have forced through the House. 
   This conference report abandons the emergency set-aside fund included in last year's budget and opens the way for unlimited future spending by dropping any limitation on what can be considered emergency spending. But it has new funds for peanut farmers and spinach growers, so I guess that's a good thing. 
   But in a surprising bit of consistency, the Democrats do hold true to their pay-for rules and allow the 23 shell reserve funds to spend an additional $190 billion, as soon as appropriate because these will be tax increases that they intend to identify and then pay for. 
   This irresponsible budget continues to ignore the brewing entitlement crisis and puts off any major reform for at least another 5 years. This is despite the fact that around 77 million baby boomers will be retiring in the near future and will begin collecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Funding this new spending represents the greatest economic challenge of our era, and it is a challenge that the Democrat budget has chosen to completely ignore while going on their own spending spree everywhere else. 
   And what's worse, this budget completely shirks its oversight responsibility to root out waste, fraud and abuse in Federal spending by providing only $750 million of reconciliation spending out of an $8.5 trillion Federal budget. This is the legislative equivalent of checking under the seat cushions to pay the Federal Government's rent, and I believe, for one, that the American people deserve better. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, despite these massive tax increases, the Democrats fail to provide a surplus large enough to halt the raid on Social Security, directly contradicting their previous campaign trail promises to do precisely that. This is something that the Republican budget provided a surplus large enough to do starting in the next 5 years, and it did so by controlling, among other things, spending, not raising taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe the voters watching this debate on C-SPAN can understand what these tax increases will mean for our economy and for our ability to compete globally. I think that they can see through this charade, and I know that they deserve better than this massive tax increase and spending spree that is on their dime and against the future of our children. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and the underlying tax increase. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I will be urging my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that I may offer an amendment to the rule, which will stop this Chamber from hiding behind a cheap procedural maneuver invented by former Democrat Majority Leader Dick Gephardt. This rule allows Members to duck the responsibility of taking a vote on raising a limit on a public debt, a painful but necessary exercise of this Chamber's legislative responsibilities. 
   Because of this rule invented by Democrats, Members who vote for this underlying conference report will also be recorded as voting to raise the public debt. Members need to be aware of this. They need to know exactly what they are voting for. 
   For a long time, Members on both sides of the aisle have been appalled by this practice. Members of growths as ideologically diverse as the RSC, Blue Dogs and the New Democrat Coalition alike have called for its repeal. It's time for members of the Blue Dogs and New Democrat Coalition to demonstrate the courage of their convictions and end this bait-and-switch practice.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, what we are debating here today is the largest tax increase that will take place in American history. As the Republican majority has done for a number of years, we recognize that America needs to be more competitive with the world in cutting taxes, making sure that the budgets, very clearly, help protect this country, help protect the men and women of the United States military. They are doing their daily job in trying to not only protect this country, but to defeat terrorists all around the world. 
   Today we have an opportunity to stand very clearly, talking about what a budget does. We have heard it's a moral piece of paper. It defines very clearly about what someone's priorities are. Well, we know what those priorities are. They are tax and spend.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority a few years ago heard the American people loud and clear that they wanted America to be competitive with the world. We were tired of losing jobs overseas. That is not happening. It has not happened in a couple years. As a matter of fact, there are signs all over this country that say ``workers needed.'' We need more workers in this country. And that comes as a result of the tax cuts that were offered to allow American business, corporations become competitive with the world, an opportunity to attract new capital, to retool our companies here in this country to give us the newest tools and the tool kits that are available. 
   We have a strong and vibrant economy. We have a strong and vibrant economy because we have people who have money in their own pockets creating jobs. We have some 5 million new jobs just in the last few years, 7 million since 2001, that have been created. 
   This economy is doing the right thing. It is giving the Americans their own dreams, their dreams to not only have their own homes, the highest level ever of people who own their own homes, but it is also giving America to save for our future because our stock market is back. 
   Just a few years ago, after 9/11, everybody was worried about their retirement. Big worries. At that time, what did we hear from the Democrat Party? Raise taxes. But that is not what the Republican majority or President Bush did. We cut taxes; we grew our economy. We have a strong and great economy today. 
   The Republican Party stands forth today on this day in Washington, D.C., to say we will vote against the largest or second largest tax increase in the history of the United States of America. 
   This budget that comes from the Democrat Party will raise taxes and raise spending. The Republican Party disagrees with that. The Republican Party disagrees with saying that we will have taxpayers who will be without jobs in this country, because we will take away the investment and the opportunity that goes forth to make investment possible to where jobs are available. The Republican Party stands today and says we are opposed to this new bill because of what it does by having all sorts of special accounts, just spending opportunities that sit out there in the future, undefined, but ready to spend money if the money comes in. 
   We believe that we should have had more responsibility, as we have tried to do for years, to do something responsible about Social Security. But we have heard from the Democrats for the last 6 years, there is nothing wrong with Social Security. There is no problem. Mr. Speaker, we disagree with that. Republicans are going to oppose this today. I ask my Members to join me in defeating the previous question. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Vermont, my friend, for not only his friendship, but also for our opportunity to engage today on this important bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this unorthodox rule and to a number of provisions in the underlying legislation in its current form. While I do appreciate and support the committee's effort to provide for the safety and soundness of our Nation's housing finance system and broader financial system, this legislation has a number of fatal shortcomings that I hope will be corrected during the modified open amendment process provided for by this rule. 
   Unfortunately, I cannot support this rule, which breaks with the longstanding, bipartisan precedent of providing Members with the certainty of a specific date by which their amendments must be printed in the Congressional Record so that they may be included in the debate under this rule. By changing this longstanding, established practice and only providing Members with the requirement that their amendments must be printed at an undetermined, unannounced time before the consideration that this bill begins, Members from both sides of the aisle are left vulnerable to the scheduling whims of the majority, which is neither an open nor a transparent way to run the House of Representatives. 
   I also find it odd that a majority of the Rules Committee members would vote to provide for such an open deadline. Just this week, they demanded such precision in timing from Members and an overworked Legislative Counsel Office with a filing deadline for the Defense authorization bill. That is an unprecedented move. Amendments filed less than 12 hours after this deadline were simply turned away at the door.     
   Members were informed that their noncompliance with the arbitrary deadline meant that their voices would not even have the opportunity to be heard in the House. 
   I wish I could say that I was surprised by this decision made by the Democrat members of the Rules Committee. Unfortunately, the majority's selective enforcement of amendment deadlines and disregard for other long-standing House precedents has become the status quo in the Democrat Rules Committee. So much for all of those campaign promises to run the most honest, ethical and transparent House in history. 
   While this bill does provide for a stronger regulator with increased powers to ensure the safe and sound operations of the housing government sponsored enterprises, I must rise in strong opposition to this bill's worst flaw: A new housing fund mandate that would create a de facto tax on the middle-class homeowners to finance an expensive and ill-defined big government housing program. 
   In its budget score of the legislation, the Congressional Budget Office acknowledges that the new government-mandated assessments on the GSEs could very easily be passed on to their customers in the form of higher fees, meaning that this fund would unfairly target the most modest home prices to finance this unprecedented government-mandated redistribution of wealth from the middle class. 
   I believe it is bad public policy to tie the fate of families that need housing support to the success or failure of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac's portfolios. Even worse because the affordable housing funds would come from loans that are less than $417,000, which in 12 metropolitan areas in the country is dangerously close to or below the median home price, this bill levies a new stealth tax on the most modest home buyers without even disclosing to them the costs associated with this new Federal mandate. Mr. Speaker, it is the same as a tax increase to these middle income home buyers. 
   To deal with this problem, I will be offering an amendment that provides useful information to home buyers about the real costs of this stealth tax. This amendment would require that the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency determine what the cost per $1,000 finance would be to home buyers whose mortgages are purchased by the housing GSEs. This information would need to be disclosed to the home buyer at or before closing for these mortgages, who qualify for future GSE purchase, and any additional cost for mortgage originators created by this new disclosure regulation would be paid for by the housing fund so that the new disclosure requirement does not create a new, costly private sector mandate. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we are going to pass along a brand new, stealth $2.5 billion tax increase on the middle class to pay for their affordable housing, I think that Congress should at the very least be up front about the true cost of this fund with those who are being asked to foot the bill. My amendment simply provides for transparency for mortgage consumers about the true cost of this new government $2.5 billion mandate, and I would encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to oppose this restrictive rule and the underlying legislation in its  current form, particularly this stealth tax contained in the affordable housing fund provision. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to notify my colleague from the Rules Committee that I have no additional speakers at this time. We had spoken about that before. But, in fact, as a result of the scheduling that has taken place this morning, none of my colleagues on my side are available to come down this morning. 
   Mr. Speaker, as is generally always understood in this House, the gentleman is generally correct, that the Rules Committee, in fact, did provide a good number of wonderful amendments that would be made in order. 
   The fact of the matter is that as part of this House majority and minority being able to understand what the Rules Committee is going to do, we were looking for some transparency and some consistency. I believe it is important for Members to be able to know when they can submit those amendments that they might want to have. 
   It is also true that the majority is the one that determines what this schedule would be. Members generally have no clue exactly when amendments are going to be due if you do not give them a deadline and if you simply say well, before the bill is called up. 
   The bottom line is we are simply asking that the Rules Committee would state very clearly when amendments would need to be placed for consideration, and that is what our point is. 
   The gentleman also makes other points about the GSEs and about this House voting on this money that would become available for affordable housing.     
   I recall that earlier this year this House provided for Katrina housing relief. We've done that, and yet that's now what this bill that is left over for, that was passed last year was for. And so now what we're doing is taking a bill that was passed last year through a huge number of votes in this House, did not pass the other body, was not signed into law, and yet earlier this year we provided for a housing fund for Katrina earlier. 
   Now we're asking for $2.5 billion increase on middle class homeowners. We're simply saying that we believe that there should be transparency. We believe that the processes by which this takes place should be more apparent to Members where they would have these opportunities to come down. 
   If the gentleman wants to support a $2.5 billion increase for middle class consumers, as he did last year by bringing the bill forward, as he's doing this year, then we will let the Members decide by voting on that. But I think there should be transparency to the people who will be footing or paying the bill as to why there's additional costs that may keep people out of the marketplace because of additional costs related to them by buying their new home. 
   Mr. Speaker, evidently at this time I have created an opportunity to continue dialogue, so I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The gentleman from Massachusetts makes important points. I think that the gentleman should also hear that we believe there should be transparency to make sure that these middle class homeowners who would be buying and paying for this $2.5 billion increase, that they would understand why that additional cost is being placed on them, and these are the transparency things that we think that good government can be about. 
   The process also has developed itself to where we began talking about the Rules Committee once again, and Mr. Speaker, two nights ago I was provided with a summary by the majority party of a breakdown of the rules, what we have done when I was in the majority in the Rules Committee versus the Democrats now being the majority party. 
   And the fact of the matter is through May 15, which is what this is talking about, the Democrats have had 13 closed rules. The Republicans had six closed rules over the same period of time. Six closed rules for Republicans; 13 closed rules for Democrats. Eight open rules for the Democrats, which they call open rules but that had a preprinting requirement, so they really should be modified open rules, but the bottom line is a number of those have been over suspensions that Republicans did not even place a rule on. We just brought them to the floor of the House of Representatives and let them see what that outcome would be. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would insert this into the Record at this point. 
   110TH RULE BREAKDOWN THROUGH MAY 15, 2007 
   43 Total rules:  
   8 open rules (7 with a preprinting requirement). 
   20 structured rules. 
   Thirteen closed rules. 
   1 conference report rule. 
   1 procedural rule. 
   60--Republican/minority amendments in order. 
   109TH RULE BREAKDOWN THROUGH MAY 15, 2005 
   29 Total rules:  
   2 open rules (1 appropriations bill). 
   15 structured rules. 
   Six closed rules. 
   2 conference report rules. 
   4 procedural rules. 
   51--Democratic/minority amendments in order.  
   Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party, my party, is very aware of the dramatic needs of housing in this country, the needs that people have, families who have children, elderly people, disabled people, who do need more affordable and better housing, and that's why you have seen in our past, as was undisputed on the floor today, about the number of people who have voted for providing these funds that would be available. 
   We do believe that there should be transparency. We believe that the people, the consumers, who will be paying this additional $2.5 billion should be told why, what it's for, just as anyone who closes on a house should understand if there's going to be a FedEx package that would be delivered or a title fee or some fee that would be associated even with a notary public, that that should be included as part of the closing cost of a house to make sure that the consumer knows why and what they are paying for. 
   So I would be offering an amendment that was made in order by the Rules Committee as part of our discussion about how to improve this opportunity to make transparency available to all the consumers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment will provide useful information to middle-class home buyers about the real cost of the $2.5 billion stealth tax included in this legislation, and how it will affect these consumers' wallets. 
   The amendment requires that the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will determine how much the new tax created by this housing fund will increase total costs for home buyers whose mortgages are purchased by housing GSEs. 
   This information would then be disclosed to the home buyer at or before closing for these mortgages to qualify for future GSE purchase. To ensure that it does not create a costly regulatory burden for mortgage originators, the amendment also provides that additional costs created by this new disclosure requirement would be paid for by the Housing Fund. 
   I believe that if we are going to pass a new stealth $2.5 billion tax on the middle class to pay for affordable housing, then Congress should, at the very least, be up front about the true cost of this fund with those who are being asked to foot the bill. 
   My amendment simply provides for transparencies for consumers about the true cost of this new government mandate. I would encourage all my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support it. 
   Mr. Chairman, a consistent fact about the free market is that new taxes to build big government programs are always passed on to the consumer. The Housing Fund created by this legislation raids the portfolios of the GSEs for funding. And the GSEs in turn, you guessed it, have to pass the increased costs associated with compliance with this new Federal mandate along to the middle-class home buyers in the conforming loan bracket. 
   I think it is bad public policy to tie the fate of families that need housing support to the success or failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's portfolios, as this Housing Fund does. I think that it is bad policy to discourage middle-class home buyers from achieving their American Dream of homeownership by creating a new $2.5 billion stealth tax. 
   But I think it is absolutely awful public policy to pass this stealth tax and not let consumers know how their pockets are being picked to fund this new big government program brought to us as the courtesy of the Democrat majority in Congress. 
   I encourage all my Members to support this amendment to provide transparency and funding for the Housing Fund.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I do thank the gentleman from North Carolina. So that he is aware, this is unlike any of the other amendments. 
   This is very straightforward. It offers an opportunity for consumers to see straight up exactly what those costs are that are being passed to them. There is no duplication. There is nothing about this amendment or about the reporting process that would be duplicative. It would be straightforward, and it would be full transparency. 
   As I recall it, just a few weeks ago the new Democrat majority was intensely interested in making sure that every single person who was a shareholder would have transparency and understanding about the compensation of executives, in the best interests of shareholders. 
   Now, here we are talking about middle class home buyers who are attempting to understand, to know what costs they are to pay for, whether there is a FedEx package, if there is a notary charge. We are trying to make sure that this money, which would add up to be about $2.5 billion over a short period of time that would be passed to them, they would simply have a statement of exactly what that charge was for. 
   I think this is good government. I think it is transparency. I do not find any way that it is duplicative. I do not find where there is necessarily additional work. It would be paid for by the fund. The fund that we are saying tonight we are supportive of would simply need to make sure that it becomes transparent to those people who will be paying the money. 
   I think if you checked out of any restaurant, if you checked out of any store, that you would want to know what you paid for. There would be a line item for it. That is what we are asking for. This is really not very confusing. It makes the bill a little bit better. 
   It provides transparency. In my opinion, that is still what Congress, both sides, Republicans and Democrats, should strive for, if middle class taxpayers are having to pay for it. I think it makes sense.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. 
   In reply to the gentleman from Georgia, this amendment does not require originators to provide this disclosure to home buyers. It simply says that the disclosure must be given if the originator wants the mortgage to qualify for the purchase by the GSEs. 
   This is not the first time that Congress has asked that mortgage originators provide blanket disclosures to home buyers, regardless of whether or not the disclosure applies to their specific mortgage. The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act mandated disclosure to consumers about the mere likelihood that a mortgage's servicing rights would be transferred without regard to whether any specific mortgage servicing rights would actually be transferred. The gentleman, Mr. Frank, was an original cosponsor of the bill in the 101st Congress, and voted in favor of it on August 1, 1990. 
   Mr. Chairman, I will insert into the Record an example of the precedent for this nonspecific mandated mortgage disclosure requirement supported by our chairman, Chairman Frank.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   You know, we are once again arguing what, first, is a ``de minimus'' amount of money. Then it turns out to be a lot of money. And now we understand it is really not that much money at all that these consumers are having to pay. 
   But somebody has to pay the $2.5 billion, and that is a new tax. And it is in this legislation. This money is just not going to come out of anywhere. We do expect if there is going to be money that is going to be owed by somebody, that they ought to know where it comes from. It just doesn't come from home buyers. It will come from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shareholders. And excluding them from the decision-making process seems like a significant backward step for shareholder rights. But just a few weeks ago the chairman brought legislation to the floor that would mandate a new, nonbinding shareholder vote on executive compensation. 
   I think that shareholders and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, if they are, in fact, the ones to foot the bill for this new fund, at least deserve a little bit of participation. They ought to understand it and know. 
   I ask the chairman in the name of shareholder rights and shareholder participation to include the language during any conference negotiations, and to make sure he does the same thing thereto. 
   The bottom line is that shareholders or middle class home buyers all deserve a right to know how much they are being charged. It is a simple request. The gentleman almost got it right. I think it is an American thing that consumers ought to know what they are paying for, and it is unAmerican not to know what you are paying for.

   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1868, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND MANUFACTURING STIMULATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of promoting technological innovation, bolstering the strength of our manufacturing industry and contributing to the overall global competitiveness of American business. However, I simply cannot support the closed rule process brought forward today by the Democrat majority that prevents all but one Republican amendment from being considered by the House. 
   This rule represents a substantial break with recent precedent because the last time that a comprehensive reauthorization of the National Institute of Standards and Technology was brought to the Rules Committee, the Republican majority provided the House with a completely open rule for its consideration. I know this, Mr. Speaker, because I had the privilege of managing that rule for our majority, and the Democrat minority position was then ably handled by the current chairman of the Rules Committee, my good friend Chairman LOUISE SLAUGHTER.  
   Unfortunately, Chairwoman Slaughter seems to have forgotten the merits of providing the House with an open rules process because today the committee that she chairs has provided the House with a closed process, through a restrictive rule, not an open rule, even using the more lenient definition of an open rule currently being employed by the Democrat majority, which under Republican leadership was reserved for modified open rules. 
   I include for the Record a copy of this rule, H. Res. 474, which provided for the consideration of H.R. 2733, the Enterprise Integration Act of 2002, to remind the majority that NIST reauthorization is, in fact, possible to do under an open process. 
   H. Res. 474 
   Resolved, That at any time after the adoption of this resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2733) to authorize the National Institute of Standards and Technology to work with major manufacturing industries on an initiative of standards development and implementation for electronic enterprise integration. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Science. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule the amendment in the nature of substitute recommended by the Committee on Science now printed in the bill. Each section of the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. During consideration of the bill for amendment, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole may accord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member offering an amendment has caused it to be printed in the portion of the Congressional Record designated for that purpose in clause 8 of rule XVIII. Amendments so printed shall be considered as read. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions.  
   Despite my objection to the rule, I do want to support the underlying legislation which makes a number of positive changes to an institution with a long history of helping to keep America globally competitive. 
   Since its inception in 1901, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has worked diligently to achieve its mission of promoting U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement, science, standards and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve the quality of life. 
   By focusing on its core mission of stimulating innovation, fostering industrial competition and competitiveness and improving quality of life, the NIST has become a valuable component in the ongoing struggle that the United States faces to remain globally competitive. 
   This legislation authorizes appropriations for NIST for the next 3 years, most notably doubling the Federal Government's investment in physical  science research, as proposed by President Bush's American Competitiveness Initiative. And this increased investment will yield real-world benefits across a number of diverse sectors, including developing performance standards for bullet-proof vests for our military and law enforcement, chemical and biological protection equipment for first responders, and measurement standards vital to leading-edge industries like nanotechnology and next-generation solar cells that will help America increase its energy independence. 
   This legislation strengthens oversight by requiring the NIST director to submit annual programmatic planning documents to Congress, ensuring that the NIST budget is spent on activities that meet the needs of American industry, and that the increased funds which the NIST is being entrusted with are spent wisely. 
   This legislation also takes steps to ensure the continued viability of the workhorses of the American economy, small and medium-size manufacturers.     
   By reauthorizing the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, Congress will help countless domestic manufacturers to improve their manufacturing processes, reduce waste and to train workers to use new equipment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the work of Chairman BART GORDON and my good friend, the ranking member of the committee, the gentleman from Rockwall, Texas, Mr. RALPH HALL, for all of their hard work and bipartisan cooperation on this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the Statement of Administration Policy for this legislation.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, as you can see by the last two speakers, the gentleman from Georgia (Dr. Gingrey) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Wu), they have approached this subject not only in a bipartisan way, but with a genuine friendship to each other in trying to promote NIST as well as American competitiveness. I think this flows all the way to the top, where Chairman BART GORDON and ranking member RALPH HALL have worked very diligently on this. I think it is a good thing when we are able to work in the Congress on behalf of the American people, in this case for the NIST laboratories. 
   I would like to talk for just a minute, if I can, about more of what they do, because I think it is an interesting exercise to go through. 
   Between 3 and 6 percent of the U.S. gross domestic products is attributed to measurements and measurement-related operations that rely on the NIST for accuracy, reliability and for international recognition. The NIST X-ray standards and proficiency tests ensure proper radiation exposure levels in  more than 9,000 facilities that perform more than 30 million mammograms yearly. 
   The NIST Internet time services are being used by NASDAQ, a key component of our wonderful American system of financial integrity, for NASDAQ members to time stamp hundreds of billions of dollars worth of stock trades and other financial transactions that are conducted in business every single day. 
   The United States, for the last 35 years, has helped the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FBI. During part of that time my father, for eight of those years, served as Director of the FBI.     
   The NIST helps improve the process of matching fingerprints found at crime scenes or collected from suspects with those that are on file. In cooperation with the American National Standards Institute, the NIST also developed a uniform way for fingerprint identification data to be exchanged between different jurisdictions and between scanning machines made by different manufacturers. 
   The Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award, the Nation's highest honor awarded by the President of the United States to U.S. organizations for their performance excellence in quality achievement, is managed by the NIST, and the award criteria are used by thousands of companies, hospitals, and schools to improve their products and services all across the United States. 
   The total economic benefit of the NIST Baldridge National Quality Program, which receives only a small amount of Federal funding, is estimated at almost $25 billion for a stunning benefit-cost ratio of 207 to 1. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are talking about something that is a laboratory that all Americans can be proud of. I came from a research organization years ago in New Jersey where I had a chance to also work in a lab. This lab is an asset to America. But, Mr. Speaker, it is part of an overall comprehensive and complex way that the United States chooses to do business not only in this country, but also to lead the world. 
   I found it interesting that just a few weeks ago there was a report issued by the Financial Times, which is a newspaper that reports on international monetary circumstances, and it reported that now the 25-member EU countries have a combined GDP that equals that of the United States of America, 25 member countries from the EU. But if you read on, you see that they now have a combined GDP that equals the United States where we were in 1985. 
   America truly is the world leader. We are the world leader in commerce and activities that create better lives for people. The EU is struggling. They are struggling because of high taxes, rules and regulations, and a single-payer system in health care, those things that we here in the United States Congress also debate and talk about. 
   And because we have a chance to have something like the NIST as well as a free-enterprise system that is vibrant here in America, because we shut off the heavy rules and regulations, the heavy taxation, and those things that would be related to a single-payer system for health care, we have been able to move America economically in the world marketplace. 
   So Republicans today come to the floor in full appreciation and respect with our colleagues to say we want to continue what this lab does, but we are also asking for them at the same time to recognize that growing medium and small business, ensuring that America stays competitive, and, most importantly, that we are prepared for the future where our competitors might be is what really this Congress should be doing. 
   Today is a small piece, part, a component of that competitiveness model that will keep America going, and I am proud to be a part of that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the gentleman from the State of Washington. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this closed rule and to the underlying 137-page, as they call it, omnibus appropriations measure that is being rushed to the floor of the House of Representatives today without committee oversight, regular order, or input from the vast majority of Members of this body. 
   Last night in the Rules Committee, I offered an amendment that would have eliminated $44.5 million in unspent funds from an earmark that dates back to the 2004 omnibus appropriations measure that would have created an indoor rain forest in Coralville, Iowa. Because the project failed to meet its non-Federal matching funds matching requirement, this money remains unspent. It is sitting waiting for it to be spent. 
   Last night, I offered an amendment that could be used for better purposes. It could be used to make sure that we move the money to the veterans health care program, and that is exactly what my amendment said. Despite their claim of support for veterans health care and their stated opposition to earmarks, Democrats rejected my commonsense proposal on a party line vote of 9-4. 
   They also rejected along the same party line margin an amendment offered by my colleague from California (Mr. Campbell) which would have replaced the Democrats' omnibus spending bill with a clean continuing resolution that would have saved taxpayers around $7 billion. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are on the floor today because we believe that the process that should have included more time and more opportunity for feedback but at least the ability in the Rules Committee to do the right thing was rejected by the Democrats who stand up and say that they are for an open and fair process. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote against this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, on Monday night the Rules Committee met and after hours of testimony from members of both parties, the Democrat members of the committee voted along party lines to shut out every opportunity for amendments to be a part of this debate of this  resolution today that we will be debating for the next 2 days. 
   Our colleague from Texas, Congressman Sam Johnson, brought an amendment that would have clarified that Congress and the American people support our troops and that funding for our Armed Forces serving bravely in harm's way should not be cut off or restricted in any way. 
   Our colleague from Virginia, Frank Wolf, also brought to the Rules Committee a very comprehensive amendment that would have made clear that Congress supports the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, with its emphasis on providing American commanders serving in Iraq with the strategy and tactical means that they need for success and accelerating cooperation with Iraqi leaders to meet specific goals, as the strategy for moving forward to success in Iraq. 
   A number of other Members also spent a lot of their evening sitting in the Rules Committee waiting to share their ideas about how to improve this resolution which thus would help America in our message to not only the President but also the world. However, the 13 members of the Rules Committee are the only ones who had the benefit of hearing and debating these good ideas because none of them were given the opportunity to be considered and voted on by the House. Instead, rather than allowing this body to consider good ideas, today we are continuing debate on the floor with a completely closed process to debate a nonbinding resolution with no teeth and serious logistical flaws. 
   In two short paragraphs, without explicitly stating that funds will not be cut off for our troops that serve in harm's way, the resolution asserts that Congress and the American people will continue to support the members of the Armed Forces who are serving in Iraq. This nonspecific language is something that every single Member of this House already supports. It also states that Congress disapproves of the President's plan to deploy 20,000 reinforcements to Iraq to bolster the mission and provide additional support to the troops already there serving on the ground. This resolution gives no direction on how we should proceed in Iraq. Instead, it settles for some generic language about supporting the troops without guaranteeing that Congress will continue to fund their efforts and stand behind them as they remain in harm's way. And it simply amounts to a vote for the status quo. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a serious debate about the serious challenges that America faces in not only this fight in Iraq but also against Islamic terrorism. We all understand the cost of failure in Iraq is too great to bear. It would embolden radical Islamic terrorists and give them a base from which to train from and to attack America for generations. But with this resolution, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle provide the troops with nothing: no guarantees that we will continue to fund their heroic efforts; no guarantees that Congress will heed the advice of the Iraq Study Group, which notes on page 73 of their report that it would ``support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad, or to speed up the training and equipping mission.'' Nor does this resolution provide the American people with a clear picture of our direction in Iraq. It simply says ``no.'' It says ``no'' to the only strategy for success that has been placed forward. President Bush said, ``If you disagree with me, then come outthink me.'' This resolution in its simple form does not do that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think Congress can do better than this nonbinding resolution for the status quo of Iraq. I know that a number of my Republican colleagues tried to improve this legislation but were denied that opportunity. But I know that our troops serving in harm's way and the American people deserve better than this simplistic resolution that provides no new ideas, outlines no strategy for victory, and makes no guarantees that we will continue to stand behind our troops with funding. I am greatly disappointed in this resolution and the Democrat majority's efforts to prevent this body from considering meaningful amendments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this modified closed rule that waives important portions of the Congressional Budget Act. 
   Last night in the Rules Committee, we learned that this special rule finds yet another way for the majority to break regular order. By waiving section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act, this rule undermines the integrity of the budgeting process by allowing legislation within the Budget Committee's jurisdiction to be considered by the House without the Budget Committee's review. 
   My friend from Pasco, Washington, DOC HASTINGS, asked the acting chairman of the committee, Mr. McGovern, if the rule being considered does indeed waive this budget rule that protects taxpayers and Members of this House of Representatives. The answer came back simple and clear: Yes, the rule waives this commonsense provision.     
   I wish that I could say that I am surprised by the Democrat leadership's decision to find yet another way to toss House rules and procedures out the window. Unfortunately, this is precisely what has come to be known as, and to expect from, the new broken promise Democrat majority. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us has the noble goal of strengthening and clarifying the authority, tenure, resources, oversight and independence of the Inspectors General in the various Federal Departments and agencies. 
   Many of the issues addressed by the legislation today enjoy bipartisan support and are of great importance to me and a huge number of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle. The bill establishes a council to identify, review and plan to promote efficiency and address waste, fraud and abuse. It provides for greater integrity by establishing a new committee to investigate allegations of wrongdoing and to report on their efforts to the executive branch and to Congress. 
   It requires reports to Congress on the cooperation of all Federal agencies with the General Accountability Office and requires that semiannual inspection and evaluation reports, in addition to audit reports, be submitted to Congress. 
   Despite all of the noble goals of this legislation, I do regret that this bill was not crafted in closer coordination with the administration to resolve some of the outstanding issues that prevent it from being signed into law. 
   Like me, the administration has publicly stated its strong support for the work of Inspectors General and their overall mission to improve agency performance and to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. However, the administration strongly objects to some of the provisions included in this legislation that are likely unconstitutional. 
   The end-run contained in this legislation around article II of the Constitution, which our Founding Fathers provided to the executive branch to ensure that all of our Nation laws are faithfully executed, guarantees that this  bill will not only be vetoed by the President but would also be overturned by the Supreme Court if this bill were ever passed by the House and the Senate. 
   Also, by requiring Inspectors General to circumvent the long-standing and constitutionally based budgeting process that currently exists, without even including the House Budget Committee in the decisionmaking process, is a thinly veiled political stunt intended to draw a veto threat from the President and to create a false disagreement over this bill when it is clear that both Republicans and Democrats support reducing waste, fraud and abuse at each of our Federal agencies. 
   Mr. Speaker, I insert in the Record a copy of the administration's statement of policy regarding their position on this legislation.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio and enjoy working with her. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so that I may amend the rule to allow for consideration of H. Res. 479, a resolution that I like to call the Earmark Accountability Rule. 
   During last year's campaign and again at the beginning of this Congress, promises were made to the American people and to the new minority about the Democrats' supposedly new and improved earmark rules. As the year has worn on, however, I have noticed that while the Democrats' rules changes may sound good as a cynical sound bite for the evening news, they haven't actually accomplished much since the majority has repeatedly turned the other way when it comes to their own actual enforcement. 
   We continue to see nondisclosed earmarks appearing in all sorts of bills, and even the House Parliamentarian has determined that the hastily drafted and passed Democrat earmark rule ``does not comprehensively apply to all legislative propositions at all stages of the legislative process.'' 
   I will insert this letter from the House Parliamentarian, JOHN SULLIVAN, to the Rules Committee chairman, LOUISE SLAUGHTER, into the Record at this point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding his time, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this unnecessarily restrictive rule and to parts of the potentially unconstitutional legislation that the Democrat majority is bringing to the floor today. 
   I would like to note at the outset of this debate that this legislation accomplishes a number of positive things, including making the Indian Housing Block Grant program more flexible and helping Native American tribes become less dependent on the Federal Government by giving them the tools that they need to exercise greater autonomy over their own affairs. I would like to commend my friend from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce) for his hard work on this legislation on behalf of his well-represented constituents and for Native American tribes across the United States. 
   However, this legislation does include language that places funding for Native Hawaiians at great risk because of its extremely suspect constitutionality. In 2000, the Supreme Court decided in Rice v. Cayetano that the current configuration of justices would likely strike down most Federal benefits flowing to Native Hawaiians as an unconstitutional racial set-aside, if given a chance. 
   I am already aware of this problem because these exact same constitutional concerns plagued H.R. 835, the Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2007, which the Democrat leadership allowed to fail under suspension of the rules earlier this year. 
   Title VIII of today's bill contains this same language and opens up today's legislation to all of the same concerns that were leveled against H.R. 835. I understand that my good friend from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) has submitted an amendment to correct this problem, and I look forward to hearing the debate on its passage later this afternoon. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned by the open-ended nature of this authorization. I understand that about $650 million has been appropriated annually for Native American housing over the last few years. Today's bill authorizes an unlimited amount of spending for the next 5 years for these programs. 
   While I understand very well the need for funding in a number of impoverished communities across this country, I believe that in the current fiscal climate, a climate in which Democrats have proposed an enormous $26 billion of additional new spending over last year, that authorizing an unlimited amount of money for the program is simply irresponsible. 
   Limits need to be set, Mr. Speaker, and it's the job of a majority to make tough decisions as to where spending is most needed and from which other programs it should be taken. By authorizing as much money as the appropriators care to spend, this legislation shirks its responsibility to provide guidance to an appropriate level of spending. As a fiscal conservative who is greatly concerned about runaway spending in this Democrat Congress, I believe this is simply wrong. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to oppose this restrictive rule that is not an open rule, despite Democrat claims to the contrary. I understand that they are in the majority and that the Democrat leadership has the ability to pressure their Members into supporting a resolution stating that Congress believes that two plus two equals five. However, that simply does not make it so and true. 
   In this same vein, despite their protests when they came to the floor and the claim that this modified open rule is open, that too is simply not so. It restricts Members who have ideas about how to improve this legislation during the debate from having their proposals heard, and there is simply no denying that fact. 
   I oppose this restrictive rule and the unconstitutional and irresponsible spending provisions included in the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, as I was preparing to come down here just a minute ago, I was met by one of my colleagues, the gentleman from Florida who said: Another closed rule? My gosh, I thought they said this was going to be an open Congress. I thought they said we are going to have closed rules only to get their political agenda, 6 in '06 done, and then we will quit that. 
   Well, to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller), another closed rule. However, this closed rule is just another manifestation of the new Democratic majority's philosophy. Just another one. And that is, if you can't support the bill in its current form, you shouldn't be given an amendment. That is the new philosophy at the Rules Committee. Democrats on the Rules Committee said at least twice last week that Members who are not willing to vote for the bill should not be allowed to offer amendments. 
   I would like to quote one of my colleagues. This took place this last week, and it says, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), ``I will argue for a closed rule. It makes no sense to have the minority presenting anything they might improve, that they might have agreed upon, and at the end not vote for the bill.'' 
   Hello? What's the Rules Committee for? The Rules Committee is there to perfect bills, to make them better, to listen to input from Members of Congress. Yes, that does include the minority in my opinion, but that is only upon 9 years of service to the Rules Committee, where the Rules Committee, for the 9 years prior to this, we were very careful to make sure that minority members had a say, could come before the Rules Committee. This is yet another example of the circular logic used by the majority. And it is only when you support a bill should you have the opportunity to amend it. 
   You know, this is tortured logic and it makes no sense, and it prevents good ideas from being considered by the House. But this is the way they are going to run the House, it seems like. New logic, move the goalposts. And make sure, if you are in the minority and if you don't completely agree with the Democrat majority, you have no need to come to the Rules Committee. We don't care, and you are not going to have a chance to even be heard or understood. It's a sad day.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this completely closed rule and to the underlying big government legislation to use eminent domain to strip property owners of their rights that the Democrat majority is bringing to the House floor today. 
   This is the first of two closed rules being brought to the floor today courtesy of the Democrat majority from the graveyard of democracy and good ideas in the House of Representatives, the Rules Committee. It represents yet another example of the procedural gimmickry being blatantly exploited by the Democrats as they continue to completely ignore their campaign to run the most honest, open Congress in history. 
   Mr. Speaker, as any 5-year-old could tell you, the opposite of open is closed, and that's precisely what the American people are getting from the Democrats once again, another closed rule. 
   In fact, as compared with last Congress, through the same date, as of July 30, the Democrats have brought exactly twice as many closed rules to the floor as Republicans did when we held the Speaker's gavel. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will insert in the Record a document prepared by the Republican staff of the Rules Committee comparing the Democrats' awful record of reporting out closed rules in the 110th with last year's record of those controlled by the Republican Congress.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the bill that is being brought forward today, I believe, is yet another example of the Democrat majority's attack on what I would refer to as constitutional balanced authority in this country. By virtue of bringing this bill forward, it means that what we will be doing is not allowing what I think is a fair process for people dealing with their own private land. 
   And I'm sure that you'll have lots of people who are my friends who are Democrats say, well, this is so important that we've got to have this land for the interest of all of the people, so we can have this pristine land. But, Mr. Speaker, we're talking about private property. And private property rights are those things under which this country, one of the things that this country is founded under that makes us entirely different than other countries. Other countries, many of them, all around the world, do not extend to their citizens the right for private property. 
   And so today, once again, what we're seeing is an assault, an attack, using Congress to come and use the powers of the Federal Government against private landowners. I'm sure if their story were being presented today, these private landowners may tell the story about how, for many, many years, I don't know the stories, but how many, many years, being from Texas we could tell the same story, in Connecticut it might be even longer, how people have passed these pieces of property down through generations. 
   But the fact of the matter is that any time that private property is being taken as a result of a force or a threat, in this case, to make a scenic wilderness area pristine and to preserve that as opposed to a single property owner keeping what they had, making those choices within the law and looking up and seeing the Federal Government staring down at them with all the resources of the Federal Government, knowing that the United States Congress brought this action on them, is regrettable. 
   It's regrettable that it had to happen this way. It's regrettable that we could not at least, through the Rules Committee, make a simple amendment in order that would say, why don't we clarify that we're not going to force this issue, that we'll hope that some compromise happens, but that we're not going to allow this condemnation. 
   Not at all. Can't have that kind of debate here. 
   And this Congress had claimed that we were going to be open and honest, and it would be the most open and honest Congress in the history of the United States Congress. 
   So that's what's regrettable. That's what's regrettable that here we find ourselves on a Monday at the end of July trying to help the big Federal Government to grab the land from private landowners. And I think that's wrong. I think it's wrong. I think it's wrong for this House to do that without being on record of saying we're not going to sick the Federal Government on these people who might be private landowners. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will be asking for a recorded vote for the previous question for this rule. And if the previous question fails, I will ask the House to amend the rule to provide for the separate consideration of H.R. 3138, which would amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to update the definition of electronic surveillance.     
   Our country is facing a very serious problem, and I said this on the floor of the House twice last week, that must be addressed before the House adjourns in August. That means last week we had two weeks to get it done; this week we have one week to get it done. The majority Democrats continue to shirk their responsibilities to keep Americans safe by ignoring the seriousness of this threat.  
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 11 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico, the ``Land of Enchantment'' (Mrs. Wilson).

   Mr. SESSIONS. By prior agreement, I will close at this time, and I thank the gentlewoman. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the Rules Committee wants to spend special time on the House floor debating these closed rules, I believe that we can do better than the Eightmile Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. 
   However, for some reason this Democrat leadership cannot seem to find time to schedule consideration of legislation that was just spoken about by the gentlewoman from New Mexico and the gentleman from California that clarifies one very specific thing, and that is that the United States Government will no longer be required to get a warrant to listen to foreign terrorists who are not even located in the United States of America. 
   Once again, Mr. Speaker, we have got time to pick on private landowners and to take their land by the use and force of the Federal Government, but we don't have time to schedule legislation to come and protect this country. Utterly incredible. 
   The Director of the National Intelligence, Michael McConnell and the Director of the CIA, Michael Hayden, have testified to this Congress that under current law their hands are tied. They are giving this body notice: we cannot do this under the law. And as Director McConnell testified, FISA is outdated and has been made obsolete by technology. 
   Today, once again, the Republicans are asking for us to support the intelligence community because they are forced to obtain warrants to listen to terrorists outside of our Nation, and as a result, and this is a quote, ``We are actually missing a significant portion of what we should be getting,'' directly from the Director of Central Intelligence. 
   This Congress has known about it for months. Republicans were on the floor last week. We are on the floor again this week. We are saying we are getting ready to go on break, we need to protect this country, we need to pass the law. We are asking the Democrat leadership once again if you have got time for this bill that is about a river, you certainly should have time to protect this country when our intelligence people are saying we need it. We have been saying for months we need it. The Republicans are on the floor today again to say there are 5 days left and then we will be on vacation.     
   Are they going to say to the American people and to the intelligence community, ``Too bad, we didn't have time to do that?'' 
   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are serious about facing down this threat, Mr. Speaker, they should come and join us. They should join us in defeating the previous question so that the House will be able to then address this issue since the Democrat leadership won't. 
   Don't hide behind something that deals with Republican or Democrat, and do the right thing for the country. This is a very real and a very serious threat. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include my amendment and extraneous material in the Congressional Record.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I do want to thank my friend from New York, the gentlewoman and chairman of the Committee on Rules, for yielding me this time to discuss this proposed rule for consideration of H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. 
   Like my colleague, I too rise in support of this rule which would allow the  House to agree with the Senate compromise and pass H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, or GINA. 
   As the gentlewoman knows, this legislation has a long history. She's worked on it for a long, long time, as we heard in testimony given to the Rules Committee yesterday and the accolades that were given the gentlewoman for her support of this, as well as the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert). First introduced in 1995, it has been cosponsored by 224 of our colleagues in this Congress. The House overwhelmingly passed this legislation last April, and with the Senate's recent approval and President Bush's pledged support, I look forward to seeing this legislation signed into law quickly. 
   Madam Speaker, genetics are extremely important to determining the health of every single individual. Each of us carries a handful of genetic anomalies, some of which might cause us to be affected by genetic conditions or affect the health of our children. There are currently 1,200 genetic tests that can diagnose thousands of health conditions. This number has grown exponentially from just around 100 genetic tests a short decade ago. 
   Every day scientists are learning more about the genetic causes of many devastating diseases. Stopping these debilitating illnesses will require the voluntary participation of hundreds of thousands of Americans in the clinical research area needed to identify, test, and approve effective treatments. This information is invaluable to managing our country's health and bringing down the overall cost of health care. 
   Currently, a few States provide protections for genetic information, but most provide none. This leaves Americans with little to no certainty about how their genetic rights are protected from State to State. 
   Additionally, genetic information is not properly covered under the current HIPAA regulations. It is necessary for Congress to provide legal protection for genetic information and clinical trials so Americans can get tested for health care concerns without fear of misuse or discrimination. This legislation ensures that all will be protected. 
   Currently, the fear of misuse of genetic information is preventing people from getting these important genetic tests done. The refusal to utilize effective genetic tests hurts individuals, researchers, and doctors alike. Lack of testing denies individuals important medical information that they could otherwise use to be proactively managing their health with their doctor. The information garnered by these tests also helps doctors to prescribe treatments and lifestyle changes with increased success. The same information can be used by researchers to effectively create targeted drugs and develop treatments. 
   Fear of discrimination has also caused a large number of people to opt out of clinical trials. With fewer participants in clinical trials, we will see slower development of treatments and beneficial drugs. In addition, clinical trials provide patients in late stages of the diseases with access to breakthrough treatments that might otherwise be unavailable. 
   This House has correctly recognized this issue by protecting those who obtain genetic tests in addition to those who volunteer to participate in clinical research for genetic diseases. I would like to commend my colleagues Sue Myrick, Kenny Hulshof, and Dr. Tom Price for leading the efforts to protect the importance of these clinical trials. 
   But none of this would be any good today, Madam Speaker, if the American public did not overwhelmingly support the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. About 93 percent of Americans believe that if someone has a genetic test, their employer should not have the right to know the results. Republicans and Democrats want to see their genetic information protected. 
   I rise in support of this rule and the underlying bill and look forward to its passage. 
   I once again want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) and the gentlewoman from New York, the chairman of the Rules Committee, for their hard work. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, ma'am, I am. 
   Madam Speaker, today I will be asking each of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question to this rule. If the previous question is defeated, I will amend the rule to make it in order for the House to consider any amendment that would actually do something to reduce our high gas prices that we have in this country, to help consumers, and to require the Speaker of the House to submit her secret plan to lower gas prices. 
   Back on April 24, 2006, over 2 years ago, Speaker Pelosi issued the following statement, which I quote, ``With skyrocketing gas prices, it is clear that the American people can no longer afford the Republican rubber stamp Congress and its failure to stand up to Republican big oil and gas company cronies. Americans this week are paying $2.91 a gallon on average for regular gasoline, 33 cents higher than last month, and double the price that it was when President Bush first came into office.''     
   Madam Speaker, most Americans would consider it a blessing if we were only paying $2.91 today for a gallon of gasoline and the only thing they really couldn't afford is this head-in-the-sand Democrat Congress that refuses to consider or to do anything to solve the problem. 
   In that same press release, Speaker Pelosi went on to claim, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' 
   Well, I am not sure what they are waiting for, because even after passing the no-energy energy bill through the House a number of times, the cost of the Pelosi premium price increase continues to rise, with the average cost of gasoline over $3.62, hitting consumers at the pump every time they go fill up their cars. 
   In fact, Madam Speaker, as yesterday's Politico article Gas Prices Fuel Effort to Jam GOP makes clear, rather than seizing the opportunity to create opportunities to do something about these high gas prices, to bring in commonsense, bipartisan, supply-side solutions to the problem that help consumers, the Democrats are using them as a wedge issue, as they see it, to score political points, which does nothing to bring down the high cost of gasoline and only contributes to the Congress' abysmal low ratings. 
   Madam Speaker, I would suggest to you that it really might secretly be this secret plan. This secret plan, even though Speaker Pelosi said it was to bring down gas prices, I think it is all about raising gas prices closer to $5 a gallon. Of course, we know what this does. This causes an American transfer of payments to overseas places, just like Dubai. It is American consumers that are paying for and building Dubai. And the reason why is because the Democratic policies have taken off-limits the opportunity for Americans to be self-independent, because we can't do our own drilling in this country, where billions of barrels of oil reside. 
   By voting ``no'' on this previous question, Members can take a stand; a stand against the statements that we have heard about trying to increase gasoline prices, but while only taxing oil companies. 
   We demand to see this ``private'' and ``secret'' plan to reduce gas prices that the Democrats have been hiding from the American people since taking office and control of Congress. I for one would love to see this plan. But I am afraid that, much like their other campaign promises to run the most open, honest and ethical Congress in history, it simply does not exist. 
   Madam Speaker, American consumers cannot handle the high prices at the pump. We are demanding to know what this secret plan is to reduce gasoline prices below the level of 2 years ago. We need help. Americans all across this country will stand behind those that vote ``no'' to do something now about the problems, rather than trying to blame it on somebody else. If it was Congress' problem 2 years ago, it certainly should be Congress' problem today. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material placed in the Record just prior to the vote on the previous question.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the gentleman yielding me the time. 
   Being from Dallas, Texas, does offer me the opportunity to come in and join the Suburban Caucus members here tonight from Illinois and Pennsylvania; and tonight I would like to speak about  something that I think is very, very important and that is our economy. 
   Just yesterday, there was a brand new study that was released in Europe that mostly you will see in Europe, you probably will not see in the United States, but talks about how the United States economy, as it was 20 years ago, is now the size, or said another way, Europe is now the size of, their economy, in 2007, what the United States economy was 20 years ago. It comes as a shock to many people in Europe, even though they have already seen incrementally where their countries fall out. 
   But what has happened in Europe is they have seen a continuation of high taxes, of overregulation, of requirements on single payer or what we might call single payer system in health care, as well as rules and regulations that are given to unions to not only organize but to put additional restrictions upon employers. 
   So, tonight, what I would like to say is, thank goodness we live in America. Thank goodness we live in an America where the free enterprise system is alive and well. 
   Tonight, the Suburban Agenda that is being talked about by the Republican party is a part of trying to make sure that we grow our economy, to where America has the very best not only economy in the world but also a leading-edge and moving-forward economy. 
   What I would like to talk about tonight is also a part of our Suburban Agenda of growing the economy, and that relates to making sure that we have the opportunity to have lower tax rates that allow investment in opportunity. 
   As we know, in just a few short years, I think it is about some 1,381 days from now, the tax cuts that were passed by the Republican majority over the past few years will be going away unless the Democrats were to allow a vote and we reauthorize those. What would be gone away is the marriage penalty, depreciation, capital gains; and our tax rates would rise, also.

   Mr. SESSIONS. That is exactly right. What happened was, when Republicans came into office 12 years ago, we talked about how important it was to make sure that every worker in a family, in this case a husband or a wife, would have an opportunity to only be taxed upon their own income. What happened is, after 40 years of Democrat control, we had taxes at this high, high level, and what happened is that a married person would be taxed at the highest rate of the person in that household, whoever made the most money. That meant that if a wife worked full time and a husband worked part time, he would be taxed at her high tax rate. 
   So what Republicans did with President Bush is we came and passed something that was known as the marriage penalty, and that is that every single person would be taxed only at their own rate, based upon what their own earnings were.

   Once again, said another way, a person would be taxed only at their own income, as opposed to combining that rate, which then would increase the amount of taxes that a person would pay. 
   What I am telling the gentleman is that in around 1,300 days, if the Democrat majority does not reextend these tax cuts, that all four of these taxes and more that I have talked about will go back to the rate that they were before the Republicans lowered those taxes.

The gentleman from Illinois is correct, that as a result of what Republicans have done, by cutting taxes, is that we have not only given people back more of their own money, we have allowed for America to be in a position to where we are more competitive with the world. 
   Is it not interesting that just a few short years ago all the talk was about outsourcing and these jobs that were going to other countries. Ever since we passed these tax cuts, the debate and discussion now is how do we get enough workers to do the work that we need done here in America. 
   The greatest threat against that would be that we do not have enough work that can be done here, and so companies go offshore to have work done on behalf of corporations and people here in this country.

Well, the fact of the matter is, since 2001, exactly on 9/11/01, when we had a balanced budget at that point, we have seen the deficit go up, and that is because we lost 1 million jobs on or about that day in the months forward. 
   So what Republicans did is they said, we have got to spur our economy. We have got to do the things that will bring America back to work. 
   I am pleased to tell you that the budget is virtually balanced and is expected to be balanced by next year as a result of a strong, strong economy. Just 1 1/2 years ago, we had a deficit of about $500 billion. This year, it is down to $140 billion. That comes from strong economic growth. That comes from the opportunity for people to go to work. That comes from investment and opportunity, but, most of all, we are competitive with the world, and these are the things that Republicans talk about that is a part of the Suburban Agenda but that is good for everybody.

   Mr. SESSIONS. The gentleman is correct, and if I could have the gentleman also continue to keep focusing on how we have done this, what has been done is we have turned to the free market, the free enterprise system, to Americans, and said, we need you to go work as hard as you can work and bring this country back. That is exactly what has happened. It was not because of a government program. 
   What we did is, we gave people back more of their own money, allowed them to invest that money in places like Dallas, Texas, where I live, Chicago, Illinois. And we have this robust economy that, since 2001, 5 million new jobs have been added. Tax receipts are up, 3 years ago, plus 8 percent over the year before; then plus 13 percent in this last year, plus 15 percent more than we had received the year before. 
   We have more people at work today. More people own their own homes. There is more money being made, and  the government has more money at its disposal. I hope and believe that next year this budget is going to be balanced.

   Mr. SESSIONS. As we close down our time here with Republicans being on the floor, I would like to remind the gentleman of something that is heard over and over and over again, and that is how great America is. But I would like to ask a rhetorical question. Have you ever heard of the China dream, the Brazilian dream, the French dream, the German dream? Probably not, but every single person in the United States and billions around the world have heard of the American dream, and the American dream is tied directly to not only the dream that they have about themselves, but a dream about their future. 
   This is where Republicans, working together on the suburban caucus, making sure we have a healthy and strong economy, where investment and opportunity and reduction in taxes happens directly in front of us, and then we can support this agenda that is so important for every one of us.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that there is anything even left to say about the depths to which the House has sunk under the ``broken promise'' Democrat majority. Today, once again, the American people are being forced to endure the results of yet another evening spent in the ``broken promise'' Democrat Rules Committee, with nothing to show for it except for yet another closed rule, which was referred to today as a ``traditionally closed rule'' on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this completely closed rule, which denies the minority even with a basic substitute amendment in this process, and to the fiscally irresponsible underlying legislation. 
   I also rise with great regret to report to the American people that, once again, as I have been forced to report on multiple occasions over the course of this year, the Democrat leadership is bringing legislation to the House floor which stacks the deck in favor of big labor bosses at someone else's expense. Today, that expense is on the American taxpayer, who is being targeted on behalf of big public sector union bosses to the tune of $2.2 billion, to be exact. 
   I would like to take a few minutes to discuss a number of the myths that will be discussed surrounding this legislation and provide my colleagues and the American people who are tuning in  on C-SPAN with some of the facts about the real effect of this special interest legislation and what it would mean to the taxpayer. 
   In 2004, Congress gave the IRS the ability to utilize the best practices and advantages created by the private sector to address its growing backlog of unpaid debt. Today, it is estimated that $345 billion of these unpaid taxes exist. That means that every year the average taxpayer who plays by the rules must pay an extra $2,700 to cover taxes not being paid by those who should legally be paying their taxes. 
   This new program, which began as a small pilot program that grows as it continues to succeed, is estimated to bring in about $2.2 billion in its first 10 years. And under this agreement, the IRS would get the first 25 cents of every single new dollar to hire new collections professionals, a provision that would have a positive, compound effect by helping to bring in even greater amounts of this uncollected revenue for the government into the future. 
   The program, even in its beginning stages and despite numerous attempts by the Democrat majority to kill it before it could succeed, has been hugely successful, bringing in over $30 million worth of unpaid taxes. It has received a 98 percent rating from the IRS for regulatory and procurement accuracy, as well a 100 percent rating for professionalism. Additionally, less than 1 percent of the taxpayers contacted by these private agencies have filed complaints with the IRS, none which have ever been validated. 
   Despite this program's track record of success on behalf of taxpayers who do play by the rules and pay their designated share, not to mention the increased revenue that it brings in to fund the Democrats' other new, big-spending legislation, there are many opponents on the other side of the aisle that want to prevent it from continuing to work, supposedly to protect the dues of the big government union bosses. 
   They have claimed, despite the fact that 40 out of the 50 States in America already use these same contract services, that this is something that only the government can do. You don't have to take my word for it that this is untrue. Even the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has found that ``the IRS may benefit from using private collectors, and it is reasonable to assume that the IRS could learn from their best practices as it works to resolve long-standing problems with its debt collection activities.'' 
   Opponents have also incorrectly claimed that private debt collectors do not follow the same rules as IRS collectors. Well, this one is partially true, because these private collection agencies are subject to both Federal and State laws that are collectively more restrictive than the laws that Federal employees must follow. Private collectors follow the same privacy protections, undergo the same background checks and are subject to the same penalties if they violate any of these laws. 
   Opponents have also claimed that allowing for private debt collection would cost untold union jobs, a statement which is also based in an alternate reality. The private collection agencies working in this program did not and do not replace a single IRS worker. 
   As of this past July, over 51,667 ``cold cases'' that the IRS was incapable of collecting were given to private agencies, resulting in over 5,300 full repayments to the Treasury and almost 2,000 agreements to repay these debts incrementally. This means that the government received over $24 million of gross revenue that it would not have received otherwise, of which only about one in eight went to pay for these otherwise nonexistent services. In fact, the IRS has publicly stated that no government employee will lose his or her job as a result of this highly effective private contracting. Instead, they will benefit from the opportunity to focus their talent, expertise and resources on high priority, more complex cases. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to understand all of the facts regarding this legislation before they are influenced by the scare tactics of a few Members who are determined to kill this highly-effective program that has already proven to be cost-effective in closing the ``tax gap'' of unpaid, hard-to collect taxes. 
   I wish I could say they would have plenty of time to learn all the facts surrounding this legislation that is being rushed to the floor today under a completely closed process. Unfortunately, last night in the ``Graveyard of Good Ideas in the House of Representatives,'' the majority Rules Committee Democrats voted three times along party lines to prevent any amendment authored by a Republican from being considered today. Despite numerous campaign promises by the highest ranking Democrats in the House to run the most ``transparent, open and honest'' House in history, this Democrat majority once again has provided the House with something which is a rule that is none of the above, which is the historical tradition. Instead, we have what is referred to as a closed rule. I wish I could say I am surprised by the Democrat leadership allowing politics to triumph over policy or fair procedure. Unfortunately, this is precisely what we have come to expect from the new ``broken promise'' Democrat majority. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this ill-conceived and costly legislation, and I encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for taxpayers by voting against this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we continue to hear arguments from my good friends about how this just won't work. But for 10 years it has worked very well, with a 99 percent accuracy, in providing billions of dollars to the taxpayer. 
   The bottom line is that Treasury simply focuses their activities on major accounts, and the others on smaller accounts, which is who have been handling these accounts and been very good at it, which is what we are asking to continue today. What is happening is that we found out the unions simply don't like that. They don't like somebody else perhaps getting something that they in fact never wanted to work on themselves. 
   So we are trying to say to the American people today, don't take away this stream of revenue. Don't take away this opportunity. Because the private sector is working on these accounts. They are not given any advantage. The  people who really end up winning is not only the Treasury Department, but, more specifically, the taxpayer. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from San Dimas, California (Mr. Dreier), the ranking member of the Rules Committee.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, and I will continue this dialogue, you know that we asked to have made in order one that would be in compliance with the PAYGO rules, and you and your colleagues turned that down. You specifically stated: We want an amendment that would be in compliance with the PAYGO rules; will you please give it to us. And we were turned down by the Rules Committee. I would engage the gentleman on that issue. 
   It was my amendment that I made, and I know how the gentleman voted, along with all of his colleagues. And to stand up on this floor and to say, Well, we would if they would abide by the rules, but they have to abide by the rules, is a blatant, blatant miscalculation and I think untrue and insincere. When we asked for that in the Rules Committee, we were turned down. 
   When we said, Give us an amendment we will make sure that the Parliamentarian and others say is compliant, we were turned down. 
   The gentleman, Mr. English, and I am getting ready to allow him to speak on this floor, he is in compliance with PAYGO rules. So there was not an opportunity that was given by the Rules Committee to allow us to do that. And then you stand up and say, Well, if Republicans played by the same rules as we do, then they would find them in order, that is not true. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 4 minutes to the co-chairman of the Zero AMT Caucus, the distinguished gentleman who has an amendment that would be compliant, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. English).

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, let's go to the heart of this. 
   $30 million worth of uncollected taxes that, by the IRS's own admission, never would have been collected because they were accounts they did not want to or were not working, which are the only accounts that ever go to private debt collectors, who as private collectors receive a 98 percent rating from the IRS for regulatory procedural accuracy, as well as a 100 percent rating for professionalism, and less than 1 percent of those accounts have any sort of complaints that are filed with the IRS, and none which have been validated. That's the substance of the case. That's why we oppose this bill and this rule. It makes no sense unless you're simply trying to do what union bosses ask you to do, which is evidently what this bill is doing. 
   I would also like to point out that what's very interesting is that this bill is supported by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and has a whopping nine cosponsors, a whopping nine cosponsors, and we're bringing that to the floor of the House today. Utterly amazing. 
   Mr. Speaker, I insert into the Record at this time the Statement of Administration Policy by the President, which this White House says that they will veto.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, we have had a good debate here on the floor. We talked about from the Republican perspective, we're trying to follow the rules, not only of the House, but also the statements that have been made by our new Speaker, the Honorable Nancy Pelosi, who said she would have the most honest, open and ethical House in history and that that would also extend to processes of amendments. 
   We are here on the floor of the House saying today, that's not happening, has not happened all year, and I would predict to say today probably is not about to happen. Still on the Web site for the Speaker it says this. The American people are waiting for this promise to be made. 
   Today, we are debating a rule and a bill that would say to the American taxpayer that the IRS and their ability to collect taxes on behalf of the American people is going to be changed, changed from accounts that the IRS has no reasonable reason to believe that they will be chasing after or trying to collect. And that's why in the first place we said from doing audits, you've got all these accounts, please pass them to someone who will do it on behalf of the taxpayer. Because if you're not trying to collect these bills, it means that people will never pay. 
   The result has been over $30 million worth of uncollected taxes that never would have been collected, not by the IRS, and they're done by someone, these private collection agencies, that receive a 98 percent rating by the IRS for regulatory and procedural accuracy, as well as a 100 percent rating for  professionalism and less than a 1 percent complaint rate of which not one has turned out to be validated. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an assault on not just the taxpayer. This is an assault on really good and effective and proper government, where the IRS utilizes best practice. They're utilized by over 40 State governments today to have help in collecting money that is owed not just to the government but to the taxpayers of this Nation. And today, despite the success, overwhelming success, that is occurring, the Democrat majority, with nine cosponsors plus the chairman, is interested in taking away this opportunity for the taxpayers, I will assume, because the taxpayer union of the Treasury Department does not like this happening. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to have best practices. The President is right. He will veto this bill. This is a valiant effort by this Democrat majority to pay back AFL-CIO and the labor unions for their support, but it is not in the best interests of not only the taxpayer but of good and proper government. 
   The Republican Party is here on the floor of the House today saying that what has happened with best practices that is happening today should continue. We should have these private services that work in concert with the IRS. We should continue to give the IRS and those particular departments that do go after this money to receive directly more money that is collected that would help them hire more tax collectors, but we should not stop this process dead in its tracks because not only is it successful, but it is working as a best practice would for other people to see how important a public/private partnership is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this closed rule and to the financially irresponsible underlying legislation. I also rise with great regret to report to the American people that for the third week in a row the Democrat leadership is bringing legislation to the House floor that stacks the deck in favor of big labor bosses at someone else's expense. 
   Madam Speaker, in just a few minutes I am going to ask that we submit this into the Congressional Record, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill will cost a new $20 billion for 4 years after it is implemented. $20 billion. Yet we have just heard from the other side that this is responsible and the right way to do things. What do we expect? An additional $20 billion worth of spending. It is a real sad day, Madam Speaker. 
   Two weeks ago, American workers were the main losers in the Democrat-controlled House when the majority leadership forced through legislation that would provide for an unprecedented intimidation of employees by union bosses under a fundamentally anti-democratic process known as ``card check.'' 
   Last week, in another unprecedented expansion of Davis-Bacon to important water projects across this country, the Democrat leadership set its sights on one of their all-time favorite targets, the American taxpayer. Other losers that were targeted in that bargain included some other perhaps more surprising targets, including local communities, small and minority-owned businesses and, perhaps most of all, the environment. 
   But I suppose that that is everything that the Democrat-controlled leadership says is good. Everything is a fair game when tilting the playing field in favor of labor bosses. That is what this new Democrat majority is about. 
   Given this well-established track record, it should come as no surprise that today, once again, the Democrat majority has placed a bull's eye squarely on the American taxpayers' back on the floor of this people's House. The legislation that we are being asked to consider today represents the triumph of politics over policy by attempting to taint every government contractor with the high-profile transgressions that only a few have done. 
   I do commend Chairman Waxman for his desire to provide proper and appropriate oversight for the use of government funds, and I do share his desire to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in government contracting. However, the approach that he has brought to the floor is far-reaching and intrusive, expensive; and it misses the mark. The problem is primarily one of enforcement, and this is where Congress should be focusing its efforts on behalf of the taxpayer. 
   While these proposals may seem beneficial and look good on paper, in practice they add up restrictions upon restrictions simply for the sake of regulation. They would increase the cost and reduce government access to the solutions it needs, while increasing the burden on an already-overworked Federal contracting workforce. 
   While I am concerned about fiscal responsibility as a Member of this body, I do not believe that adding layer upon layer of additional regulations is a way to save taxpayer money or to be responsible. 
   Every day, private contractors provide the entire Federal Government with effective cost-saving solutions, and this legislation represents a large step backwards in giving these contractors the flexibility they need to provide these vital services. Rather than taking Chairman Waxman's approach and discouraging the vast majority of contractors that do not play by the rules from wanting to do business with the government, Congress should focus on dealing with those bad actors that have violated the public trust.     
   Right here on our Capitol campus, private contractors provide us with the services that we need to function on a daily basis. They include inspecting and delivering the mail, mowing the Capitol grounds, installing signs, repairing sinks, providing IT consulting and technology systems maintenance, and they do so at the lowest cost to taxpayers through competition. 
   The Federal Government should not be competing with a vibrant private sector that can provide these services better, faster, and cheaper than we can do them ourselves. I find that a good rule of thumb that I have used for years is if you can open up the Yellow Pages and find professionals willing to do the same services listed, then the government should not try to perform these tasks on its own, because it will end up costing the taxpayers a great deal more money. 
   Madam Speaker, I do understand that the Democrat Party wants to change this slowly and to stack the deck in favor of big labor bosses whose ranks have dwindled to 12 percent from a high of 35 percent in the 1950s. I understand that a very few contractors have behaved dishonorably and illegally, and for that they should reimburse the taxpayer and be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 
   But I simply don't believe that limiting the Federal Government's flexibility to contract, especially in the case of an emergency, is the answer to this problem. Nor do I believe that this legislation that is a new private sector mandate and that the CBO estimates will cost taxpayers over $20 billion, 20 billion new dollars, should be considered reasonable or should be considered financially responsible. This is not the correct solution to this problem. 
   Madam Speaker, I include for the Record the CBO cost estimate for H.R. 1362. 
   H.R. 1362--Accountability in Contracting Act 
   Summary: H.R. 1362 would amend federal contracting rules. Specifically the legislation would require federal agencies to limit the length of noncompetitive contracts and limit the use of solesource and cost-reimbursement contracts when possible. H.R. 1362 also would authorize an increase in funds used to pay for contract oversight, planning, and administration equal to 1 percent of the value of an agency's contracts. The legislation would require various reports to the Congress on noncompetitive contracts and contractor overcharges and amend employment restrictions on federal procurement officials. 
   CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 1362 would cost $20 billion over the 2008-2012 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts to provide additional resources for contract oversight, planning, and administration. That estimate does not include any costs or savings that could result  from implementing the legislation's provisions regarding the use of noncompetitive and cost-reimbursement contracts. CBO has no basis for estimating any costs or savings for those provisions. Enacting the bill could affect revenues by increasing collections of civil penalties, but CBO estimates that any increase in revenue collection would not be significant. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending. 
   H.R. 1362 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Refonn Act (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. 
   H.R. 1362 would impose a private-sector mandate, as defined in UMRA, on certain former federal officials that were substantially involved in the awarding of contracts. CBO expects that the direct cost of complying with the mandate would fall well below the annual threshold for private-sector mandates ($131 million in 2007, adjusted annually for inflation). 
   Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated budgetary impact of H.R. 1362 is shown in the following table. The cost of this legislation falls within all budget functions that provide contract funding. 
     By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--     2008  2009  2010  2011  2012   SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION 
    Estimated Authorization Level   4,000   4,070   4,145   4,220   4,295     Estimated Outlays   3,440   3,900   4,090   4,165   4,240  
   Basis of estimate: H.R. 1362 would amend federal contracting rules and authorize the appropriation of additional funds for contract oversight, planning, and administration. CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 1362 would cost about $20 billion over the 2008-2012 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary funds. For this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill will be enacted before the start of fiscal year 2008 and that spending will follow historical patterns for contract oversight activity.

   Madam Speaker, this is a costly bill. This is a bill that is an intrusion not only upon a system that works well, but it is also aiming at an unintended consequence, and that is it is not only going to be more expensive for the government to pay for those services that it wants to buy, but it is going to make it also more costly to the taxpayer in the amount of spending that takes place.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in opposition to this rule, despite my long-term support for TRIA, because passing a bill that has already been pronounced dead on arrival in the Senate foolishly puts the reauthorization of this important program in jeopardy as its expiration date at the end of the year draws ever closer because  the Democrat House leadership has decided to continue to play political games on this issue. 
   By engaging in this game of what I call ``legislative chicken'' with the Senate, the House is setting itself up for potentially allowing this important program to expire, an outcome that I believe is bad for continued growth of the American economy and is an outcome that I strongly oppose. 
   But even if the Senate were somehow to miraculously pass this legislation, the Statement of Administration Policy regarding this legislation that was released by the Office of Management and Budget on Tuesday makes it clear that President Bush will veto this bill in its current form and that any extension of the TRIA program must be temporary and short term, include no program expansion and must increase private sector retentions.     
   At this time, I will submit a copy of the Statement of Administrative Policy for substantially similar legislation explaining the futility of today's legislative exercise in the Congressional Record.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, we are not negotiating with the Senate, we are negotiating with ourselves, and I believe that what we need to do is get it done. 
   Now, there are reasons why the gentleman has chosen to do what he has done. I really can't disagree with him. I really don't. From an institutional perspective, for making the bill better, I think every one of these are great arguments. I think my point would be similar to what we are trying to make on our side: Let's get our work done so the rest of the world and the rest of the marketplace can get their work done. It's pretty late. We are now moving on to the middle of December and this expires at the end of December. There are lots of paperwork issues, there are lots of legal issues, there are lots of contract issues. There are lots of things that need to be done, and it takes some period of time. We are doing the same thing with the AMT. We are trying to say, why don't we not rock the boat because what you are going to do is put in jeopardy the ability this next year for the IRS to even get their work done. So the wake-up call, the head snap is, today it's darn near the middle of December. I could have completely bought off on everything the chairman said, every single word, every single philosophy, everything he said if this were November 15. It is not. It is 1 month later. It is time that we get our work done so that the marketplace can get their work done so that investors can know that they are taken care of, so that we can have certainty in the marketplace and so that we know what we are going to pass. And that is the only disagreement.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Retrieving my time, I would say to the gentleman that we believe we should not continue doing what the gentleman is doing. We should do what the agreement should be and get it done, because we believe that there are overriding considerations, Mr. Speaker, in the marketplace, with people who need an answer today to be able to get their work done.

   We are not the start-all and end-all of the world by being the United States Congress. There is a marketplace out there. There are people who need things done. New York City is a fine example of where the business community and those that own property need TRIA. Let's get the thing done. I would have agreed completely with what the gentleman said 1 month ago. It is now time. We are asking, please, let's get this thing done. Let's come to an agreement. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate both the gentlemen from the Financial Services Committee offering their explanation about this process. I would once again remind my friends in this great body that there is a lot of work that needs to be done after this bill leaves both of these bodies, including a signature of the President of the United States. What we do does matter and is important. But it is time we get our work done to allow the people who really do matter, and that is the people who are in the marketplace to be able to buy the insurance, to make it available and to get it ready days from now. It is time to put aside our differences. It is time to enter the real negotiation, and that is either to have a real conference where we know where people are to get it done, or to find a way to cut a deal. And, instead, to come back to this body and to once again change the rechange of the change I think is a bad deal. 
   So we're going to vote ``no.'' We would like to get the deal done, but not to continue to deal. 
   You see, Mr. Speaker, in the world where I come from, it is results that matter, not just reworking the work to rework the work, just like what this body has gotten used to this year with 10 out of 11 spending bills not being done. I would remind the majority, you got a lot of work to do there, too, so that we can have the confidence of the American people that we can not only run the railroad on time, but we can make wise decisions. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, the conversation that has taken place today is one that was important. The Republican Party does support and thinks what the gentleman is doing is of a worthy nature. The gentleman, Mr. Frank, has, for a number of years, not only spoken about this issue but has worked hard for its resolution. We know that if we continue to work together on issues like this, we can get things done. But getting things done is also important, and we think that a bill should have been done, an agreement should have been reached before now and negotiations should have ended because it is now time to give to the President, it is now time to give to the marketplace. 
   But I also recognize that this is the 44th closed rule of this session, that somebody is not really interested in what we think. That's why we have 44 closed rules this year. So we come to the floor, once again, the Republican Party, saying, you can have it your way, we know you have the votes, 44th closed rule this year. But let's get our work done. Let's not have the American people waiting on the House of Representatives. 
   I know the Speaker of the House wants to do things in the way that she sees fit. But let's get our work done. The American people are waiting. They are waiting not just on AMT. They are not just waiting on this bill that we have today. They are waiting on, like the rest of the government, the other 10 out of the 11 spending bills. And I do think that the American people don't confuse a lot of work that is being done with progress. Progress is the end result where you get something done and then say, We're proud of our effort. All I have heard all today, notwithstanding the prior arguments, and these arguments, that everybody is trying to take credit for everything. We are far short of the runway. We are far short of the runway because what we do here must be done right, but must be finished and done so that the American people and the economy can move forward. 
   I know this is a closed rule. If it had been an open rule, and that is okay, we understand. If it had been an open rule, we would have said, let's get this thing done. Let's close it. I offered an amendment in the Rules Committee the other day that said, let's take the Senate language, let's decide we will just accept what they have done so that we can get it done in proper timing. On a party-line vote that was defeated. So there is a reason why the Speaker wants to continue this dialogue. There's a reason why the Speaker wants to wait and to hold this out. I don't understand it. But the Republican Party once again today is saying, we think we ought to get our work done. We think we should do what we said we were going to do, and we should then let the American public see what we have done and not hide things in secret.     
   Let's get this done, let's get TRIA done, let's get our AMT done, let's get the 10 out of 11 spending bills done, and let's show the American people we can do the work which we were sent here to do. That is the position of the Republican Party. 
   Mr. Speaker, we yield back the balance of our time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pasco, Washington. 
   Madam Speaker, we are sitting here watching our good friends on the other side talk about all this great work that they have done, how fiscal responsibility is so important and all these problems with the country, and yet we are sitting here in the middle of December with 10 out of the 11 spending bills not even done because the Democrat majority is interested in spending record levels of money, more and more and more money and talking about tax increases, taxes that continue and keep going.     
   And yet they want to stand up and eat both sides of that cake and talk about fiscal responsibility and how Nancy Pelosi, as our Speaker, has done such a great job. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, I would like to encourage my friends to go home maybe on a weekend sometime and talk to people and find out how well we're doing. How well we're doing is not yet well understood by the American people because we're up here and can't even get our work done, and yet we're up here crowing, trying to take credit for all this great work that has been done, and none of it is passed, not even a negotiation with the President and the White House. No negotiation; bills that show up, 1,700 pages worth of  a bill last week that we were given 20 minutes before the Rules Committee went in. 
   We find out all sorts of earmarks, billions of dollars worth of earmarks, and then we have people that come down here and start crowing about fiscal responsibility. That's malarkey. That is ridiculous. We're trying to get our work done, and we're over here standing up acting like we've just won the race. 
   The American people know the difference. The Republican Party is here to say we're going to try and get our work done, and we're here to show up and to try and do that work. We're waiting for those other 10 out of the 11 bills to come to the floor. We're waiting to be able to see those bills so that we can know what's in the bills. And then one side stands up and talks about fiscal responsibility. Absolutely ridiculous.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from the Rules Committee from Miami, Florida (Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart). 
   Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday evening at the Rules Committee, we met to bypass regular order once again, which seems to be a new regular order for the 10th time under the new Democrat leadership. I brought forth the ability to discuss a small tax item with the germaneness to the tax bill that we are debating here today. I wish that we were considering this rule under regular order that the Democrat candidates, out on the campaign trails, promised voters this last election cycle. I believe that the tax bill will end up enjoying bipartisan support on the House floor today. So since we are already bypassing regular order to consider this legislation, I offered an amendment to bring another tax bill to the floor that would enjoy also broad bipartisan support, making the State and local sales tax deduction permanent for residents of non-income-tax States. 
   This issue is a matter of fairness. It is quite simple in its honesty. It enjoys support from a huge number of Democrats and Republicans and would allow taxpayers a deduction for sales tax in lieu of income tax for taxpayers in States that do not have a State income tax. 
   Nine States currently have no income tax: Texas, Florida, Washington, South Dakota, Tennessee, Nevada, Wyoming, New Hampshire, and Alaska. The 1986 Tax Reform Act eliminated the sales tax deduction from the Federal Tax Code but maintained the State income tax deduction. That change has a disproportionate impact on States that do not use a State income tax. 
   A 2-year sales tax deductibility provision was signed into law as part of the American Jobs Creation Act. This law restored fairness to those in States with no State income tax for the first time in nearly 20 years and kept an estimated $3.6 billion in the hands of taxpayers that choose to deduct State sales tax in all nine affected States. This critical tax relief is said to expire at the end of this year and must be extended, or my constituents in Texas and taxpayers from eight other States will see a massive, unavoidable tax increase. 
   H.R. 60 would permanently restore fairness to taxpayers in the nine affected States. I am disappointed that the amendments did not include this one and it was defeated by the Rules Committee Democrats along a party-line vote. 
   While I support the legislation for continued tax fairness for small businesses that we are about to consider, I am sorry that we were not allowed to have this amendment on the House floor today as a golden opportunity for taxpayers to finally find this tax disparity and this loophole closed for good. 
   I appreciate the gentleman's extending the time to me. He also is from the State of Florida, which is hugely affected by this unwelcomed tax.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I'm starting to get it. The IRS has a lot of work to do, and then as accounts become older because they don't get to those and they become 2, 3, 4, 5 years old but they are still debts that are owed this country, the IRS now, or at least we are led to believe this, would go collect that money when they hadn't done it their first 5 years. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, it's not true. They will not go collect these accounts. They are old. And the point is it's still a debt that is owed to the United States Government. And that's where these private collectors come in. Private collectors that collect for at least 40 out of 50 States. Private collectors that have a 100 percent rating. 
   Mr. Speaker, what we're trying to say is that the IRS probably does do a good job with what it does do. But when it has not handled an account, it is unwise and bad for the taxpayer not to receive that money that is due from its services and from the taxes that took place, and that's what these collectors are all about. To say that they're not as efficient an outside collector as an IRS collector is silly because these cases are ones the IRS didn't want to handle in the first place.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   Mr. Speaker, as every American taxpayer is acutely aware, today is Tax Day, or the final day for individuals and families to file taxes without incurring financial penalties. 
   This is not to be confused with Tax Freedom Day, which the Tax Freedom Foundation has defined as the day on which the average American has finally earned enough money to pay this year's tax obligations at the Federal, State and local level, which won't arrive this year until next week, April 23. 
   In recognition of these two important days on every taxpayer calendar, today I will be asking each of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question to this rule. If this previous question is defeated, I will amend the rule to make it in order for the House to consider H.R. 2734, a bill offered by my friend, the gentleman from Michigan, Congressman TIM WALBERG. 
   This legislation repeals the sunset date of the 2001 Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act and makes the tax reductions enacted by that act permanent. Let me say that again in regular English. That means that we will make the tax cuts permanent to make sure that all these hardworking taxpayers that we are talking about won't have to pay an increase of taxes because the new Democrat majority wants tax increases for every single taxpayer in this country. 
   Today is an opportunity where we can make those tax cuts permanent to  make sure that our Tax Code encourages not only employers, but employees, and to grow our economy. It also repeals the termination date for provisions of the 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, thereby reducing income tax rates on dividends and capital gains. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to make permanent the tax deduction for State and local sales taxes, the tax deduction for tuition and related expenses, the increased expensing allowance for small business assets and related provisions, and the tax credit for increasing research activities.     
   In summary, I would just say this, that what it will do is to maintain in a time of uncertainty the ability for America to continue to grow jobs, which means that America can compete globally. On the other hand, if you are for tax increases, if you want to tax taxpayers more, just simply vote with the Democrat majority. 
   Finally, it expresses the sense of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Ways and Means that they should report legislation on or before the end of the year to simplify the Federal income tax system. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can think of a no more fitting action for Congress during the week between Tax Day and Tax Freedom Day to provide this kind of certainty to the American taxpayer. 
   By voting ``no'' on the previous question, Members will not be voting to kill or delay this debt relief legislation. They will simply be voting to provide tax relief to Americans as they provide debt relief the same day to the world's poorest countries. I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``no'' on the previous question. 
   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of taxpayers who want to continue economic growth in America, I say let's vote to make the tax cuts permanent. 
   Amendment to H. Res. 1102 Offered by Mr. Sessions of Texas 
   At the end of the resolution, add the following: 
   Sec. 3. That immediately upon the adoption of this resolution the House shall, without intervention of any point of order, consider the bill (H.R. 2734) to make the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and certain other tax benefits permanent law. All points of order against the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate on the bill equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means; and (2) an amendment in the nature of a substitute if offered by Representative Rangel of New York, which shall be considered as read and shall be separately debatable for 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent; and (3) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Chairman, between November 2006 and January 2007, Iran tested its long-range ballistic missile capacities twice. 
   In July 2006, North Korea also tested a number of its ballistic missiles, including one that has a range of 9,000 miles and could hit parts of the United States of America. 
   In response to North Korea's test, the United States' Northern Command made nearly a dozen of our anti-ballistic missiles operational, or ready to use, to defend the United States against an imminent danger posed by ballistic missiles. 
   North Korea's long-range missiles were detected by United States satellites within seconds, and, thankfully, the missile failed after 42 seconds and after only several hundred miles of flight but North Korea and many of our strategic rivals and enemies continue to develop their missile capacities. 
   Now, it is the time for America's adversaries to understand that America must not have an unwillingness to put its missile defense system on operational alert in the face of imminent threat. 
   Section 222 of this legislation that we are debating tonight would prevent the missile defense funds authorized by this legislation from being used for operational and support activities. 
   Specifically, the language in this bill states that the funds provided only be used for the research, development, test and evaluation of our Nation's missile defense system, and it specifically prevents these funds from being used for operational and support activities. 
   My amendment would clarify that nothing in this legislation would prevent the United States of America from placing our missile defense system on operational alert to respond to an immediate threat to our security posed by enemy ballistic missiles. 
   If this bill is adopted without my amendment, it would mean that we are telling countries like North Korea that they can take a free shot at the United States of America because we would be unwilling to stand up our current missile defense capacities, exactly the wrong message to send to our enemies. 
   This makes no strategic sense, and the position of every Member of this body also should be on record saying that. If you want to tie the President's hands in defeating and defending America from ballistic missiles and declare to our enemies our lack of will to defend ourselves against ballistic missile attack, you should oppose this amendment. 
   But if you believe that Congress should make clear that this legislation should not and would not prevent our defenses from being placed on operational alert to respond to an immediate threat posed by ballistic missiles, you must support this amendment. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to provide our military with the clearly stated flexibility that they need to defend our country. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Massachusetts for yielding me this time to discuss the proposed rule for consideration of the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act. 
   I rise in opposition to this so-called structured rule which makes in order no Republican amendments and the only amendment that it does allow is a Democrat manager's amendment, and to this legislation, which would provide government bureaucrats with benefits in excess of what four out of five hardworking private sector employees enjoy. 
   I disagree with the gentleman from Massachusetts, I think Federal Government work is very important to this country, but I believe that we do not need to extend benefits, to further ask for or to make ourselves available to as an incentive for hardworking people to come to work for the Federal Government. Thus, Madam Speaker, I am opposed to the underlying legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, as the father of two children, one of whom is a person with Down's syndrome and whose birth was more medically complicated than most children's, I understand the importance of families and their ability to deal with their problems. I return home each week to Dallas, Texas, after votes to be with my family, and families are important. I, like every other Member, understand the importance of family and how strong families are important to our country. 
   The question is not whether Congress should support families, but whether it makes sense when so many American families are already struggling with the high price of gas and other economic concerns to increase their tax burden to pay for this increased paid time off from work, especially in light of the fact that Federal workers don't really seem to need it or even be asking for it. 
   Currently, Federal Government employees between the ages of 20 and 45, those employees most likely to take advantage of this benefit expansion, have an average combined leave of over 7 weeks a year. But for even those workers with the least amount of Federal service, between 1 and 2 years, this program is duplicative because on average they already have a balance of 3.4 weeks of combined leave already at their disposal. 
   These generous paid leave policies already in place are why 88 percent of the 221,000 respondents to the 2006 Federal Human Capital Survey described themselves as ``very satisfied'' or ``satisfied'' with their paid leave for illness, including family care situations, for example what is talked about in this bill, childbirth, adoption or elderly care, and less than 5 percent described themselves as dissatisfied in any way.  
   What a shame we are trying to give away a benefit that taxpayers are going to pay for when it is not needed, and most of all, not even asked for. 
   Of course, creating this new, extra paid leave perk following the birth, adoption or fostering of a child, and include a provision that would allow the Office of Personnel Management to double the amount of paid leave to a total of 8 weeks, comes at a high cost. By the way, that 8 weeks may be asked for with no excuse or no reason necessary at all, simply by requesting it. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this new benefit in search of a problem would cost $850 million over 5 years. Pretty tough for a new majority that thinks that they want to have pay-as-you-go rules when now we are going to add a new $850 million worth of cost. 
   Madam Speaker, at a time when the average hardworking American families are already struggling and working more hours to fill their tanks because of this Democrat Congress's refusal to do anything constructive to address the high cost of energy, I don't believe it is appropriate for Congress to increase the paid leave of Federal bureaucrats beyond their already generous levels, and using taxpayer dollars. 
   As an alternative to today's legislation, the administration has proposed a fiscally responsible but functionally similar program: short-term disability insurance which would assist employees who need to use large amounts of time due to pregnancy, recovering from childbirth, accident or illness. 
   Because the majority of Federal employees, almost 60 percent, are not within the standard childbearing age, this proposal would be a better and more efficient fit for both employees and for the taxpayer and the Federal Government in dealing with the needs and costs associated with employees that need an extended period of time away for a number of reasons. 
   By providing Federal agencies with additional benefits that better meet the needs of the 21st century worker, the administration's short-term disability insurance proposal would safeguard Federal employees during a period of temporary inability to perform normal occupational duties while also safeguarding the pockets of the American taxpayer. 
   Despite the Office of Personnel Management providing this commonsense legislation proposal to Speaker Pelosi on March 4, 2008, today this Democrat-run House will only have the opportunity to vote on one functionally closed rule and the underlying legislation, with all of the other good ideas provided by Republicans completely shut out on this debate. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to vote against this rule and the egregious underlying legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I really do appreciate the gentleman, my friend from Massachusetts' characterization of Republicans wrecking the economy and all these things, negative things that the Republicans have done at the expense of the American taxpayer. 
   And yet I think that the American public understands who balanced the budget back in 1997. It was the Republican-led Congress. It was the American people who said we ought to balance the budget. 
   When I first came to Congress some 12 years ago, I did this under the pretext of balancing the budget and, secondly, growing the economy, growing the economy through the creation of new jobs. 
   So how well did Republicans do? Let's see. Balanced the budget in 1997 because we forced it; 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001. In 2001 this country was struck by terrorists. That's right. We've not balanced the budget since. But what we have done during that period of time is created economic opportunity, economic opportunity for millions of Americans, created 5.3 million new jobs. That was the free enterprise system that did that, but it was done through the policies of this body, lowering taxes, giving working families more money back home, taking 5 million people completely off the tax rolls so they could take care of themselves. 
   And now, here today what we see is a bigger government, a government that will cost almost a billion dollars more as a result of what we're doing here. 
   So it's amazing to see how my good friends on the other side come and talk about how irresponsible we were, and yet, what we've done, when Republicans led, was to create new jobs in this country, to make sure that we grew our economy. 
   I see nothing, nothing in the Democratic budget or the bills that they've passed that have created new jobs. As a matter of fact, the gentleman from Massachusetts referred to the Republicans and President Bush wrecking the economy. 
   In fact, what happened is, you can just look at it directly on a calendar. The day America began having economic problems was the day this new Democrat majority was elected; came in and promised higher taxes, promised the opportunity for a new direction, higher gas prices. 
   Then what are we told? 
   We're told by the leaders of the Democratic Party, America, you're going to have to change the way you live your life. This sounds a lot like the mid 1970s when we had President Carter around. We're going to have to change the way you live your life. 
   Government knows best. That's what we're here on the floor talking about today. Government knows best. We're going to give a group of very faithful Federal employees a new opportunity that will cost almost a billion dollars more to Federal employees. And yet, my colleagues will stand up and talk about Republicans ruining the economy. 
   Now that's not what ruins the economy. What ruins the economy is bigger government, bigger government, more spending and continuation of the assault on the investor in this country. 
   So the Republican Party, once again, is in favor of a balanced budget. We're not in favor of wrecking the economy. 
   The Republican Party is in favor of us allowing drilling to take place in this country. Some of my colleagues this morning talked about, you know, all these millions of acres. Well, there's not oil under all those millions of acres. Trust me. Energy exploration companies will go where the energy is. 
   And yet, now we're talking about adding almost a billion dollars' worth of new spending on the taxpayers that are already having trouble paying for their own gasoline. And we're going to talk about raising taxes. That is how you ruin the economy. That is how you lose jobs instead of job creation and balancing the budget. 
   The Republican Party does get it. We do recognize that there are tough times there. I go back every weekend. I've never missed a weekend going back home in 12 years. I do get it. I see people at the grocery store. I know how much the cost of a gallon of gasoline is. I'm not sure all the leaders of this House of Representatives do know that. 
   So we ought to be working to find ways to reduce cost, to make government more efficient, not to find a way to add overhead. Unfortunately, that's what this new Democrat majority is all about; raising taxes, more rules and regulation, making government more powerful by, in this instance, giving Federal employees who don't even ask for it, want it or need it, more time off, and have the taxpayer pay for it. 
   Madam Speaker, I do disagree with the legislation. And I will tell you that I think the American public, as they learn more about it during this debate, will come to the same conclusion. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I think what we have talked about today is an opportunity where the Republican Party presented an alternative to Speaker Pelosi, an alternative based upon a perception of a problem by the Democrat majority. 
   President Bush, last March, came to the table and said, let's use a free market approach that does allow families the opportunity, when they need time, to have that time and to utilize it. But let's let those individual families make their own decision, based upon disability insurance. 
   I understood a long time ago, from my previous job, when I had a very large team size of people that I worked with, that really, the American worker, at least where I was, was satisfied that they had a job and earned enough money to put food on the table, but also competed for family time and they needed time at home. That I understand. 
   But I encourage that in terms of being able to take time off. And having unpaid leave through a disability insurance program, is the right way to do this. So the Republican Party, through the President of the United States, brought this to Speaker Pelosi. 
   Instead, what we got was a billion-dollar answer to the taxpayer, a billion dollars more of spending, a billion dollars more of having the taxpayer have to pay things, and a billion dollars more, so the Republican Party comes to the table and says, why don't we try and balance our budget, rather than making government bigger and spending more money? 
   That's what we're doing here today. We are politely coming to the table in this constitutional body and saying, we disagree. 
   Since taking control of Congress in 2007, this Democrat Congress has totally been negligent in its responsibility to do anything constructive to address the domestic supply issues that have created the biggest problem that we have in America today, and that is energy and the cost of energy. Skyrocketing gas, diesel and energy costs are facing the American public today big time back home. 
   Meanwhile, we find that the Congress is trying to spend another billion dollars. 
   So today I urge my colleagues to vote with me to defeat the previous question so this House can finally consider real solutions to the energy costs. 
   If the previous question is defeated, I will move to amend the rule to allow for consideration of H.R. 2279, which would expand the American refinery capacity on closed military installations. That's right. We're suggesting that we will use Federal installations that have closed to have a better way to make sure that we have more gasoline available. 
   This bill was introduced by my dear friend, JOE PITTS of Pennsylvania, way  back in May of 2007, over a year ago. See, Republicans saw it a year ago as a problem, and came to the table with answers and questions about what we can do. 
   This legislation would reduce the price of gasoline by streamlining the refinery application process, and by requiring the President to open at least three closed military installations for the purpose of setting new and providing new, reliable American refineries. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I urge my colleagues to take a second look, to become a student, just as we're asking the American public, to look at who really is trying to address the issue of the cost of energy. We're asking the American public to look into, and to see who's really getting gouged. Who really is getting gouged? 
   And it's families back home. It's businesses that are trying to provide services. It is our airlines that are trying to make sure that we keep this economy going. 
   And what do we hear back from Washington, DC? Let's sue OPEC. Let's tax Big Oil. Let's stick it to Big Oil. 
   Well, in fact, what we ought to be saying is that energy companies are our friends. Energy companies need to and want to supply cost-effective and reliable opportunities for the American public to have gasoline without long lines.     
   What are the energy companies saying? They're saying, Please give us the opportunity to go where there is oil or the perception that there's oil and go looking for it and provide it to the American public. It's American security. It is the opportunity for America to be able to use its own resources. 
   Is this the final answer? Heck no. That's not the final answer. What we're trying to do is bridge us through this until the technologies of, as we know, the battery-operated car and other technologies are coming to fruition, but in the meantime, we should not be spending our hundreds of billions of dollars that this Democrat majority is allowing to happen because they're cutting off American energy to go overseas to keep building Dubai and the next cities and countries that are after that off American money. 
   Madam Speaker, I really believe that the American public, when they understand, because they will become students of this issue, they will see that the opportunities for American energy, American security, American independence, and American jobs are what are on the line. And then they will look up and know that there's very consistent behavior. They will know which group of people in Washington, DC is really for them. 
   Today, we see where that same group of people, the United States Congress, is going to come together and say who is going to add another billion dollars to the price tag of running government, who is the same party that cuts off and won't even accept the good ideas of allowing more drilling here in the United States for American security. They're going to draw a conclusion. And that conclusion is going to be, they're going to see which group of people has the best ideas to empower job growth and investment in this country. 
   Who are the people that really are aiming at balancing our budget? Who is the group of people that are trying to do every single thing that we can to protect this country? Madam Speaker, that is the Republican Party. The Republican Party is trying to make sure that the taxpayer of this country does not pay higher taxes. The Republican Party is trying to make sure that we have enough energy, American energy, available for consumers of this country. And we are standing up today saying we do not believe adding almost a billion dollars worth of new spending for Federal employee benefits is the right thing to do right now. 
   So we're going to ask that our Members vote against this bill. We're going to ask that we do something by voting against this bill and voting for the motion to recommit. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I want to thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me the time and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to these new record-breaking 65th and 66th closed rules being offered by this Democrat-led Congress under their ``anything goes'' martial law and to this process which continues to elevate politics over good policy and which continues to produce legislation that even Senate Democrat Majority Leader Harry Reid has referred to as an attempt to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. 
   These last few hours that we're here, this Democrat majority continues to do that because it guts a carefully negotiated and bipartisan compromise reached in the Senate, leaving many of the deal's most important provisions in limbo rather than addressing them responsibly today. 
   Earlier this week, the Senate passed a comprehensive tax extenders package by an overwhelming and bipartisan vote of 92-3. This legislation included an $18 billion, fully offset energy tax policy proposal as well as a partially offset tax relief package, including an AMT patch to prevent middle class families from being hit with an unprecedented and unintended tax bill, along with important extensions of current tax policy, disaster-related tax provisions for the victims of the Midwest floods and Hurricane Ike, and mental health parity legislation. 
   Understanding the delicate balance in his Chamber, Democrat Majority Leader Harry Reid begged Speaker Pelosi not to send the Senate back a different bill, he said, ``because it won't pass'' and that, if the House ``messes with our package, it will die.'' 
   Rather than heeding these dire warnings from their own party leader, this Democrat leadership has decided to chop the legislation up into a number of separate pieces, making substantive and negative changes to many of them, engaging in a game of legislative chicken with the Senate rather than doing the responsible thing in making sure that important measures like help for victims of natural disasters, tax relief for middle class families who are at risk of being unintentionally caught by a tax created for the super wealthy and fairness for our Nation's rural schools are passed by this Congress before we leave town.     
   I am disappointed that this Democrat majority thinks that scoring political points on the eve of an election is more important than passing these measures. 
   But, unfortunately, this kind of political gamesmanship has become all too common in what Speaker Pelosi once promised would be the most honest, open and ethical Congress in history. This new House Democrat package, just introduced as a legislative package at 5:30 this evening, includes much of the same legislative trickery that Democrats have already employed this week. Just before that, the Senate had already pronounced it dead on arrival, making it a pointless and wasted endeavor, and also making it yet another missed chance for this Democrat House to do the right thing for American businesses, families and for rural schools.  
   Since this legislation was just introduced, neither I nor most of my colleagues in the House know what is actually included in this legislation. If this rush to the floor with tax legislation feels familiar to some Members, it should. They have seen this in the past, and we have had enough. My colleagues and the colleagues on the other side of the aisle will remember that earlier this week, when this legislation was first rushed to the floor without proper review, it contained a $100 million disparity that forced the House to pull their first rule from the floor and amend it to correct their work in the Rules Committee. 
   According to the Democrat staff, the legislative gimmick now being used consists of bringing two separate bills to the floor. The first includes a number of energy tax incentives for energy efficiency and conservation, which along with the upcoming October 1 expiration of the ban on drilling for American energy will go a long way towards fulfilling the House Republicans' long-term commitment to making sure we have an all-of-the-above strategy to achieve America's independence. 
   The second bill includes important tax provisions for America's families trying to make ends meet and for American businesses trying to create jobs here in America, and to be competitive with companies around the world. Measures like the research and development tax credit, the State and local sales tax deduction, and the deduction for out-of-pocket expenses for teachers are particularly important for families, schools and businesses in my home State of Texas, and I am sure it would be true across the country. 
   I strongly support their inclusion in this legislation. 
   I do not support, however, the inclusion of measures to permanently raise taxes on the American economy during a time when the economic crisis is so great. To simply extend these, they could have simply extended tax policies, which would give people more money back home. Instead, we see what we have on the floor tonight. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to vote with me to defeat this rule so that this House can end this political charade and cover vote for its vulnerable Members and take up the better Senate option, which has already passed, to provide American families and businesses with the tax relief they deserve. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I really do enjoy having our colleagues come down and debating the issues at hand. I have heard over and over that there is really nothing objectionable in this bill, except there is a new billion dollar permanent tax that is in the bill. 
   I object to that. I object to that because what this is about is to tax employers a billion dollars more over a period of time than what they pay today. That's how you lose jobs. 
   The gentleman wants to suggest that tax cuts is the reason why we have this horrible economy. Oh, not true. It is because we spend too much. We spend too much money. 
   What we ought to be doing is we ought to be having more and more tax cuts to spur this economy, just like these tax cuts are doing here. We need to have a real energy plan, not a fake energy plan, and the plan we need supplies more gasoline and the availability for America and Americans to have more energy prepared and ready for us rather than having to seek what we need from overseas. 
   We need to quit paying an extra incremental $400 billion to our friends across the ocean who we buy oil from. They are using this $400 billion to build new cities and new countries. That is what Dubai is about. So it is not just a matter of blaming this on tax cuts. It is a reality that today what we need to do is to have a comprehensive plan that deals not only with energy and the tax cuts that are on the floor tonight, but to make sure that we quit spending so darn much money. That's what the problem is. 
   If we would approach that from a perspective that the American people understand, just like they do in their own homes, then I think we would get a better sense of things. 
   The bottom line is we are here. We are here on a weekend, after we should have been at home, because we are dealing with a national crisis, a national emergency. There is no question about that. But the way you deal best with it is not to then have new tax increases to take care of and pay for the tax cuts that you wanted that would offset each other. 
   So on the one hand you say sure, we are for you having a tax cut, but somebody else has to pay for it. In this case it is the employers. The employers in this country are the people who employ people. We should not be placing the tax on employers. 
   This is a similar plan to what has taken place all around the country. Many States tax employers. We can take one, for example, Illinois. The State of Illinois, 48 out of 50 in job creation because they enjoy doing what the bill does tonight, taxing employers. That is not a way to run a railroad. 
   It is very difficult for me to hear people say it is just a de minimis tax, but we are providing all of these tax cuts for business and research and development and all these things, and then turn around and say on the other side, it is not much of a tax. It is just de minimis. Well, it is equal. It is equal. That is what happened, they equaled this out. It is a offset. And the offset is a big tax on employers. That's a problem. 
   The Republican Party is pleased to be here tonight. We are pleased to argue the important issues of the day. But we are going to vote no on raising taxes. We are going to vote no on the things that will hurt employers and employment in this country. 
   It is a very difficult thing for the country to look up and know who to believe any more. That is why this Congress is at a 9 percent approval rating. You can't say on one side you've just got to do this and help out all these people, and then call whatever you did a de minimis tax on the other side because it is equal, it is harmful,  and it hurts people and it hurts employers. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, it's my understanding the gentleman is going to pull the bill, and that's okay. I can understand that. And I appreciate the gentleman letting me know that. 
   As best I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, you have heard very eloquent discussions tonight by both the majority leader of the United States House of Representatives, from the gentleman, Mr. Dreier, former chairman of the Rules Committee. 
   I would have added that there is one common denominator between the good times and the bad times, and that common denominator is the House of Representatives that was run by the Republican Party. 
   If you look at the first 4 years of President Clinton's tenure, it was a horrible economy. Once Republicans came in, it was all about getting a balanced budget. And we did achieve a balanced budget. We had to fight to do that. That's what 1994 was all about; 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001--until 2001, surpluses. During that period of time, we doubled the size of the economy in 12 years. Doubled the size of the economy in 12 years. That was a goal. That's growing the economy. 
   We did that because we need to do that in the face of world competition.  During our first 219 years, we went from a zero to a $6.5 trillion economy, and then in 12 years doubled it to $13.8. 
   I do admit, and I'm sorry, and I have to take the blame for it, we have had too much spending under Republicans not last year and this year, but for the years prior to that because we did things that were necessary to protect this country. Finally secured our border, made sure that we had, within this country, a safe airline system, the Department of Homeland Security. Lots of spending. Lots of money. Lots of employees. We've avoided getting an attack on this country since 9/11/2001. 
   I'm proud of what we're doing, and we need to keep giving confidence to the American people that the United States Congress can debate the ideas, and present them to the American public.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank you for not only taking time, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) for taking time to lead in this Congress the debate and the discussion on not only the fairness doctrine, which we oppose in this United States House of Representatives, perhaps, more importantly, a vision about what we are trying to have in this country, for not only free speech, but also the ability to speak fairly and freely about the things which we hold dear, not only in our hearts and in our minds, but also in this country and in America. 
   The gentleman from Oregon has already outlined previously that what happened is that prior to about 1987 we did have something that was called the fairness doctrine. The fairness doctrine essentially says this, that if you are on talk radio in this country that you would have to give the same time, the fair time, equal time to an opponent, someone who had an opinion different than your own. 
   As a result of the fairness doctrine, which I believe and others believe, and perhaps the Supreme Court believes, would be illegal, what has happened is that talk radio and the ability for the American people to speak freely, openly, without fear that what they are saying would be, they would be taken to task for. What has happened is that talk radio has flourished all around the country. Talk radio has flourished not only about thoughts and ideas, but about the greatness of this country. 
   I do believe that what the gentleman is talking about is the right thing to do. That is why I signed on as a cosponsor of H.R. 2905. 
   The gentleman from Oregon also talked rather freely and openly about my service and the service of three of my other colleagues who are Republicans on the Rules Committee. The Rules Committee is that body that is interested in making sure that the debate that comes to the floor of the House of Representatives has a chance, first of all, to be heard and all thoughts and ideas are debated. 
   We have rather openly, and the gentleman from Oregon knows this, whoever is in the majority, whoever is in the majority has a very difficult time as a result of the rules of the House with germaneness of amendments and the things which we do of trying to have a balance about hearing good thoughts and ideas, making in order amendments, without killing the general intent of what legislation is for. I think that that is part of what this fairness doctrine might be about from their perspective and where we disagree with the fairness doctrine, but being able to openly talk about things. 
   The fact of the matter is that the Rules Committee yesterday, or today, heard a discussion, and I think it was last week that the Democratic Party has a new record of closed rules, today a new record on closed rules to where they don't want any debate.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the gentleman, my friend from Oregon, the distinguished gentleman from Oregon for trying to get more information out of it. That's right, a closed rule says that the committee, the Rules Committee, would make a determination about what would be made, what we call in order, which means what would be debatable and anything outside of that order, even if you had a good idea sitting on the floor of the House of Representatives, you could not engage in the debate. You could not put an amendment forward.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Shutting down debate and amendments and making those in order. And so it's interesting that what has tried to be done here, with the fairness doctrine is actually, in this Member's opinion, a silencing. The fairness doctrine would silence talk radio, would put those that might be like Sean Hannity or might be like Rush Limbaugh or back home in Dallas, Texas, Mark Davis of a local radio station that we have in Dallas, it would mean that they would be required, if they're going to talk about a subject, that they would be required to have an opposing side to come and speak about that also. And I think that puts a chilling effect not only on free speech, one which I think is unconstitutional, but perhaps, more importantly, it is an intrusion upon the free thought processes of America and Americans. 
   And so tonight, what the gentleman is doing is correctly saying that we, in this body, the House of Representatives, believe that signing on to H.R. 2905 says that we're not going to go and step backwards in this country. We want free speech to continue and to flourish, and for talk radio and thought processes to be alive and well. 
   Now, I know, and I assume the gentleman from Oregon knows this too, that what's happened, what would happen as a result of this, or what is happening as a result of this is that Mrs. PELOSI and others recognize that talk radio talks about the Democratic agenda, the Democratic Party's agenda, raising taxes, more rules and regulations, more rules and regulations to where, on a regular basis, I feel compelled to tell the truth about the Rules Committee, that the Rules Committee seems to be a wholly owned subsidiary  of the AFL-CIO, that it appears as though the Rules Committee receives their instructions directly from union central, John Sweeney, telling them exactly which bills will be made in order. We've had so many bills which are under the construct of trying to say it's about worker safety or it's about making things fairness in the workplace, but in fact it is about further unionizing and empowering unions in this country against consumers and against the working people of this country with powerful unions. 
   And lastly, that the Republican Party will speak very openly about how dangerous we believe single-payer system to health care would be to this country. And so, there are, the Democratic Party in this country does not want those debates to take place. They want us to, talk radio and Republicans, if we're going to be heard, to allow the other side to have a chance to dispute everything we say. And I would say let the Democratic Party have their talk shows and let them speak freely about raising taxes, more rules and regulations, and empowering the unions in this country to become, once again, more powerful, and to talk about how the free enterprise system is something that they don't support, that they believe that raising taxes is the right thing to do. Let them have their own talk radio show. But I would say, equally, that they need to make sure that they are not intruding on the Constitution and people in this country who choose to stand up and speak about the things which we believe are important. 
   I thank the gentleman for allowing me time.

And I think it's interesting, as the gentleman may remember, just 2 weeks ago, we had a bill that came from the Financial Services Committee, one in which the gentleman from Massachusetts, the gentleman, Mr. Frank, as the chairman, had worked very closely with his members about talking about what they would make in order, and then working, can I say that word ``bipartisanship'' down here? They worked in a bipartisan fashion in the committee, only to come to the Rules Committee and the chairman of the committee to ask and to say, it's okay. We've worked these through. As a matter of fact, the gentleman from Massachusetts said, I feel comfortable enough as chairman of the committee that you could make, Rules Committee Chairman Slaughter, you could make any amendment that you choose to in order, and I believe I have the ability and our committee has the ability to work forth to where we could prevail on any issue. Whereupon we found out no, that's not the way it's going to be.

So I think the people on the committee have now figured out time after time after time after time when they're voting for a record number of closed rules that, in fact, I wonder what it was they meant when they said we were going to do that? I think they're questioning what was the intent they said one thing but they're doing something else.

And in homeland security, we know that there was a fight that took place that said, and the Democratic Party was very open about it, that they did not want to have Amtrak passengers to have to go through what is called Customs and Border Protection Database that looked at what would be like the TSA no fly list; in other words, someone that might be considered a terrorist or have terrorist ties, they would not allow any matching of a database against potential terrorists for anybody that used Amtrak. And so we said we believe that what should happen is that every single person, we're not talking about going in New York City, riding the subway. We're talking about Amtrak, that Amtrak would be allowed to have that database.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule and to the underlying legislation which imposes an 8 percent gross tax on all new mining claims made on Federal lands and will cause a significant reduction in domestic mineral production and future mining investments in the United States of America. 
   I do appreciate the lip service that the Democrat majority regularly pays to making America the top-ranked nation in the world on a number of fronts. However, after managing over what will surely rank as the least effective Congress in recent memory, I am surprised that there isn't more disappointment on their side of the aisle with this legislation because this bill fails to set new global standards for the highest tax on mining on the planet; it merely matches Germany's, which already holds the world record for the highest mining tax at 8 percent of gross receipts. Once again we see the new Democrat majority trying to equal what is done in the United Kingdom and across Europe, including Germany. 
   In the Committee on Natural Resources hearing held on this matter on October 2, James Cress testified: ``I am only aware of a single royalty that is as high as the royalty proposed in this bill, just one in my 20 years of practice. An 8 percent royalty would really be ruinous.'' 
   I suppose that neither Mr. Cress nor anyone watching this debate should be surprised, though. In what will surely go down as the least-productive Congress in recent history, this new Democrat majority has failed for the first time since 1987 to even send a single appropriations bill to the President for his approval by this point in the year. 
   This is the same Democrat majority that recently set another record of dubious distinction, a record for the most legislative ``busy work'' with the least amount to show for it. Since the beginning of this Congress, Members of this House have voted on over 1,000 roll call votes with just barely a tenth of those bills having been signed into law. 
   And of the 106 bills that have actually made it to the President's desk, 46 named post offices, courthouses or roads; 44 bills were noncontroversial measures sponsored by Republicans or passed with overwhelming GOP support; and 14 bills extended preexisting public laws or laws passed during the Republican-led Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I understand that with a track record as abysmal as this, the Democrat majority is eager to put just about anything on the floor in the hopes of claiming any kind of legislative victory. Unfortunately, the policies included in this legislation are quite simply wrong for America that will jeopardize the current and future domestic sourcing of minerals that are critical to our Nation's economic well-being and security. 
   In addition to imposing the world's highest royalty on mineral production, this legislation would also retroactively levy a 4 percent gross royalty on existing mines where business plans and investments have already been made without accounting for this after-the-fact cost. This provision, which is of doubtful legality but is doubtlessly unfair, is the legislative equivalent of one party changing the terms of a contract after it has already been signed. I believe that the Federal Government abusing its power to change the negotiated terms of these agreements is simply unfair, and I oppose it. 
   I also disagree with the inclusion of several provisions in this legislation that would empower political appointees to stop new mining projects even after these projects have met all applicable environmental and legal requirements. 
   No industry can or should be expected to operate with such regulatory uncertainty, and the net effect of all of these provisions will simply be to encourage companies to take their business overseas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule and the underlying legislation that harms the domestic American mining industry. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, you know, we hear it here again, every single member of the new Democrat majority talking about their desire to tax, a new tax of 8 percent on this industry which has been described as the final death nail which will disseminate the remnants of an already sadly diminished domestic mining industry, and here we go, tax them at 8 percent, put the death nail in.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, day after day we come down to the floor and we hear about all the new taxes, all the new rules and regulations, all the things that have to take place by this new Democrat majority, but I think we fail to recognize that what happens is that when you tax something, you get less of it. When you put more rules and regulations on something, less good things happen. 
   In this case, we are going to have an 8 percent tax on the industry; 4 percent tax on the new operations, 4 percent tax on the existing operations. The overwhelming indication that we have is that it will make us look more like Europe, and we are told that's a good thing, I guess. 
   The bottom line is that we spend a lot of time gnashing our teeth together trying to talk about jobs in country. Just yesterday, the Rules Committee, after we had done this bill, we had a trade adjustment assistance bill. We tried to bend over backwards, which some of it I do support, trying to make sure that those workers who have lost their jobs as a result of world competition in trade and manufacturing, that we do all we can do to help these employees who lost their job. 
   Yet the very next bill is this bill that literally will decimate workers' jobs in the West. I am sure what we will do is in a few years we will come back and say, oh, my gosh, we just can't compete. Let's now give them what we just did yesterday, trade adjustment assistance. It just keeps going on and on and on. 
   I suggested yesterday, will suggest today, let's not tax this. Let's not tax this industry for the benefit of the government. Let's let the industry be healthy. Let's let the industry compete globally. Let's let this industry provide those necessary and needed resources, precious metals and precious resources to the development and the benefit of the United States of America, including our United States military. 
   Let's not tax this at 8 percent so that we allow manufacturing not to have to go overseas to get those precious, hard metal products that they need to ensure that manufacturing is taken care  of in this country. Let's not tax this industry to where it decimates it, to where there are no jobs in this country, to where America has to seek these precious metals and hard metals overseas. 
   We believe that what you have got today is a circumstance where the new Democrat majority can't wait to tax this industry at 8 percent, which will see the industry go into demise. We think that is an obvious plan that they have had. They didn't just pull this out. This is something that they have had, been working on a long time. 
   The Republican Party opposes this new tax. We oppose the diminishment of the industry. We oppose what will eventually happen as a result of American manufacturers having to go overseas to seek new markets, many times countries which are not close friends and allies of the United States. We see a day when we will not only lose jobs but will be held hostage for the precious minerals that we need, which will provide not only our country the things it needs but perhaps the military and our industrial complex with the things that will keep America strong. 
   We oppose this bill. I believe that what you have heard today is not only Members state that equivocally, but we will continue to say to the Members who are listening to this argument, please vote ``no'' on the rule, and please vote ``no'' on the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, we understand this meaningful reform that's going on, a new 8 percent tax on the industry. We get that. The Republican Party understands that there will be a loss of jobs, loss of manufacturing base in the United States of America. And we know that that's part of the meaningful reform that the new Democrat majority wants and expects. This is not a new subject: taxation, spending at record levels that are taking place by this new Congress, combined with an incredibly poor record on efficiency for the bills that will be signed into law. 
   That's why the President of the United States has issued his administrative policy from OMB that says they're not going to sign this bill; they're not going to sign this into law because of the loss of industry jobs, the lack of competitiveness that the United States of America will have with hard metals, and the high taxation that would be imposed that will kill the industry. 
   We get it. Perhaps that's meaningful reform to the Democrat Party. That's loss of jobs, lack of ability for America to be competitive with the world and high taxation. And that's not our idea of good reform. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to notify the gentlewoman from  California that I have no additional speakers at this time, and so I will reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate not only the debate that's taken place today, but also your demeanor in this wise consideration. I appreciate the gentleman from New York very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, what we're debating here today is yet another opportunity for the new Democrat majority to raise taxes in this country, to put consumers at a disadvantage, and to raise more money for their Big Government plans and programs that they have. 
   New taxation is not something that is new to the Democrat Party. That's their mission: grow the size of government, to tax people. 
   What's interesting today is the debate that has taken place about the words ``meaningful reform'' that were necessary to justify the taxation that will take place. 
   The Republican Party opposes this bill. The Republican Party opposes new taxation. The Republican Party recognizes again today that we know that market forces will come into play yet again today, not only to further diminish this industry, which, by and large, is located in the west of our country, which means a loss of jobs in the west, which means that it will diminish, not only the few jobs that remain, but will make America in a less competitive circumstance as related to the marketplace of the world. 
   But what we've heard today that has been just very interesting were remarks by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo) where he talked about his knowledge of what the manufacturing base of this country needs, and that is, many times, the hard minerals that are directly affected by what this bill will do. 
   Raising taxes means that there will be less opportunity for people to go and mine these operations because the cost efficiency as it relates to the world marketplace will not be available to those companies. So what will happen is there will be a new taxation, this 8 percent tax. There will be a diminishment of the mining industry in America, and then there will be those people who utilize those raw materials, they still have a need to produce the products which they need, which many times are not only in the best interest of the United States of America, but also to produce products that will help the United States military and our infrastructure who now will have to go overseas to do business with countries that are not exactly our closest of friends and buy their products. 
   So once again, what we see is a philosophy that is followed by the Democrat Party, not just the new majority of the Democratic Party, but an old philosophy that, let's go and find a way to reform an industry and to tax them out of existence, to lose jobs in this country to where we have to come down to the floor and beg for further government assistance to take care of people, and then we whine and moan about the jobs that have been lost overseas and how this had something to do with trade. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the Rules Committee, we had an opportunity, the gentleman, Mr. Dreier from California; the gentleman, Mr. Diaz-Balart from Florida; the gentleman, Mr. Hastings from Washington; and myself and we said, why don't we do something that would be proactive to keep jobs in this country. Like, let's not do things that would put us at a disadvantage. Like, let's do things like lower taxation, for instance, with depreciation policies, tax policies that would allow us to be on an even footing with other countries who we compete with. 
   That fell on deaf ears, Mr. Speaker. It fell on deaf ears because, really, what this is about is getting more money to run this Big Government policy that the new Democratic majority wants to put in place. 
   We recognize that what's happening is that at this time we have a log jam of all these bills as they try and get to the President's desk. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so that I may amend the rule to have Speaker Pelosi, in consultation with Republican Leader Boehner, immediately appoint conferees and move forward on H.R. 2642, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill for 2008. 
   This week, a number of news publications, including the National Journal, reported that the Democrat leadership intends to play political games and to send a three-bill pile-up consisting of Labor-HHS, Defense and Veterans funding bills to President Bush so that they can try and leverage strong Republican support for the military and veterans funding to sneak a bloated Labor-HHS bill that proposes an 8 percent increase in spending over current funding past President Bush and this Congress. Once again, not just more taxation, more spending. 
   While the House Democrat leadership plays politics, however, our Nation's veterans are paying the price. The Senate has already done its work and appointed conferees for the Veterans appropriations bill. And for every day that House Democrats allow the veterans funding to languish without conferees for their own political advantage, our Nation's veterans lose $18.5 million that could be put to bear to help them for the intended reason why we're spending the money. That would be used for veterans housing, veterans health care, and other important veterans support activities. 
   The American Legion and the VFW have already made multiple requests, along with Republican Members from this House, urged Speaker Pelosi and Democrat Senate Majority Leader Reid to end their PR campaign and begin work on this conference report for veterans funding. Unfortunately, it appears as though all these commonsense requests have fallen on deaf ears and our Nation's veterans are being forced to pay the price for continued Democrat partisanship and lack of leadership on this issue. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to support this motion to defeat the previous question so that we can put partisanship aside and move this important legislation forward without any further games or gimmicks. I know that this is a bold idea that hasn't yet been focused directly by Democrat pollsters or agreed to by moveon.org, but I think our veterans deserve nothing less.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA CENTENNIAL COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to thank the gentlewoman, one of the original cosponsors of this important bill, H.R. 5872, the Boy Scouts of America Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. The gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) is 1 of some 297 cosponsors of this very important bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, back in 1909, Chicago publisher W.D. Boyce was visiting London and got lost on a foggy street in London when a Scout came to his aid and guided him back to his destination. The Scout refused Boyce's tip, saying that he was simply doing his duty as a Boy Scout. So, inspired by this young man, Boyce met with Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting in England, who was the head of the Boy Scouts Association at that time. Shortly after his return, Boyce founded the Boy Scouts of America. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are now headed to the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America, and this simple act of kindness that was shown in London, England became the forerunner of the Boy Scouts of America today. Founded on February 8, 1910, the Boy Scouts have become an integral part of the American society and culture. The Boy Scouts of America is the largest youth organization in the United States with over 3 million youth members and 1 million adult leaders in traditional programs that include Cub Scouting, Boy Scouting, and Venturing. Since 1910 more than 111 million youth have participated in Scouting's traditional programs. 
   The Boy Scouts of America was granted a Federal charter in 1916 by an act of the 64th Congress signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson. Here in the 110th Congress, there are 248 Members of the House of Representatives and Senate that have participated in Boy Scouts of America as Scouts or adult leaders. 
   The mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetime by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and the Scout Law. Every day, including for myself last night at Troop 890, Circle 10 Council, Boy Scouts of America, Dallas, Texas, I joined my troop in reciting what would be the Scout Oath: 
   ``On my honor I will do my best, 
   to do my duty to God and my country 
   and to obey the Scout Law; 
   to help other people at all times; 
   to keep myself physically strong, 
   mentally awake, and morally straight.'' 
   I joined in then with the Scout Law: A scout is ``trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.'' The Scout motto, ``Be prepared''; and the Scout slogan, ``Do a good turn daily.'' 
   In the past 4 years alone, Scouting youth and their leaders have volunteered for more than 6.5 million hours of service to their communities through more than 75,000 service projects, benefiting food banks, local  schools, charities, and many organizations that support disabled Americans. 
   H.R. 5872, the Boy Scouts of America Centennial Commemorative Coin Act, has vast bipartisan support with over 297 original cosponsors. We will celebrate and make this coincide with the celebration of the 100th birthday of Boy Scouting on February 8, 2010. This bill will create 350,000 $1 silver coins. At no cost to the American taxpayer, this coin raises also $3.5 million for the Boy Scouts of America Foundation for the purpose of serving Scouts in hard-to-serve areas. Boy Scouts of America will match this $3.5 million for the cause, totaling $7 million of nontaxpayer contributions to the Boy Scouts of America to help serve underserved areas. 
   I am confident that a commemorative coin would once again be a meaningful and well-liked gesture among Scouts young and old and would raise awareness of the importance of participating in the Scouting program for future generations. I am asking Members of this body to please join me in the recognition of the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America with this 2010 commemorative coin. 
   I would like to thank the following people for their support of this bill in addition to the 297 cosponsors: Bob Mazzuca, the Chief Executive Scout; James Terry, the Assistant Chief Scout Executive and Chief Financial Officer; my good friend John Green, the National Director of Programs for the Boy Scouts of America; Chris Frech, the White House Legislative Affairs Office; Marty McGuinness, the White House Legislative Affairs Office; Eagle Scout and Congressman Greg Walden, who serves in this body from Oregon; and Eagle Scout Jim Silliman, who works within my office. 
   Mr. Speaker, this opportunity for us to pass this bill today will lend not only support to the Boy Scouts of America but will help many underserved areas as they try to provide the same level of support that was provided to Mr. Boyce on that cold and foggy night in London, England. 
   We appreciate the time that the Speaker of the House has given for us to hear this bill, and I want to thank the gentlewoman for extending the time to me.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to start by thanking my colleague Congresswoman Baldwin for introducing this legislation along with 100-plus additional Members who have signed on as cosponsors to this important resolution. I would also like to praise the extensive grassroots effort made by numerous eye disease and prevention groups to ensure that this bill passes today in the House of Representatives. 
   It is an honor for me to speak in favor of this legislation today. This bill recognizes March 6, 2008, as the first-ever World Glaucoma Day. This day was established to increase awareness of glaucoma, which is the second leading cause of preventable blindness in the United States and worldwide. I can speak from personal experience regarding the importance of eye health and getting the appropriate screenings throughout a person's lifetime. 
   Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that cause progressive damage of the optic nerve at the point where it leaves the eye to carry visual information to the brain. This disease robs individuals of both peripheral and central vision. If left untreated, many types of glaucoma progress towards gradually worsening visual damage and could and may lead to blindness. Once incurred, visual damage is irreversible. 
   It is estimated that glaucoma affects 2.2 million Americans and 67 million people worldwide, that 4.5 million people globally are blind due to glaucoma, and that number will rise to 11.2 million by 2020. 
   There are several types of glaucoma. Some may occur as a complication of other visual disorders, but the vast majority occurs without any known cause. Glaucoma affects all age groups, including infants and children. In most cases, however, glaucoma appears later in life, and its frequency increases with age. 
   There is no cure for glaucoma yet, and vision loss is irreversible. Therefore, early detection is essential to limiting visual impairment and preventing the progression towards severe visual handicap or blindness. With early diagnosis and treatment, 90 percent of cases where blindness occurs can be avoided. 
   My colleague from New York just said this important fact: This is a preventable disease. Individuals with numerous factors and those over the age of 40 should have a regular comprehensive eye exam. World Glaucoma Day is one of the many efforts to increase awareness of the importance of eye health. There are several ways to detect and treat glaucoma to save sight, and it is essential that the message reaches every single person. 
   I'm honored to support this legislation and to work for its passage. But today, Mr. Speaker, we have a message that is there for all Americans and the world to hear, and that is glaucoma is preventable. Awareness is something we should all have and be mindful that we can work towards a cure in the very near future. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I too join my colleague from New York in talking about not only the importance of what we are doing here today, but also to thank the many groups from around the country that have taken time to touch base with their Member of Congress about the importance of not only treatments of glaucoma, but the awareness of glaucoma. 
   Today, we are on the floor for the first ever opportunity to say we are going to highlight this important effort and battle that we are doing, and we are going to make progress on that. It really comes about through awareness, where people who perhaps are hearing about glaucoma for the first time and understanding about the pressure that is put on the eye that can cause this blindness, but is preventable. I hope that the time that we spend today will find itself in messages to thousands of people who recognize that their time to come to Washington, DC to tell their story about this, really did matter, and paid off. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to notify the gentleman that I do not have any additional speakers, and I will find out if he does. But I would encourage him to run through his speakers.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a straightforward attempt to prevent any further taxpayer money from being spent to place additional unnecessary cost on Amtrak's 10 least profitable routes. 
   I would like to talk a little bit about what this amendment does not do. 
   This amendment does not remove any currently appropriated funds. 
   This amendment does affect the 10 routes that are affected by the amendment that currently cost the taxpayer $161 million per year and will continue to cost the taxpayers $161 million if it is enacted. 
   This amendment does not affect the funds made available in section 108, which would be used to upgrade and improve the Northeast corridor tunnels in New York City, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. 
   This amendment does not tie the hands of the administration, because it provides the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security with the flexibility to waive this provision should that Secretary deem that a security upgrade on one of these most unprofitable routes, or even a partial part of it, would be deemed to be critical to Homeland Security. 
   What this amendment does, and it does it very simply, is stop adding unnecessary costs to the 10 worst routes that already cost Amtrak $161 million a year. The worst route in Amtrak's system, called the Sunset Limited, which runs from New Orleans to Los Angeles, had a net loss of $20.4 million last year, or, on a cost basis to taxpayers, 25.5 cents per seat for every mile of that journey. 
   The tenth worst route in Amtrak's system is the City of New Orleans, which runs from Chicago to New Orleans, which had a net loss of $9 million last year, or a cost to taxpayers of 10.4 cents per seat for every mile of that trip. 
   This amendment seeks to prevent further good taxpayer dollars from being thrown after bad by limiting the costs on these already unprofitable routes. 
   All in all, it says that if Amtrak wants to compete for the $4 billion worth of funds made available under this Act, they must ensure that they are being used for routes that cost the taxpayer less than 10.4 cents per seat over every single mile, a hurdle that is hardly unreasonable. 
   This amendment will provide fiscal discipline and accountability to a system that has already received over $30  billion in taxpayer subsidies over its lifetime. 
   My amendment is supported by the National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste and Americans for Tax Reform, which are three of the most prominent groups committed to monitoring the effective use of taxpayer dollars. 
   On behalf of fiscal discipline, I don't know if there is anything that's possible that they could want to support on behalf of taxpayers that would be more. I encourage all of my colleagues to support my amendment.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, so that the gentlewoman from Texas is not confused, I will repeat what we have said. The routes that we have selected, the 10 most unprofitable routes, do not have enough people on them to support this additional security and additional necessary things that would come under the billions of dollars of this bill. 
   My amendment is straightforward. It allows the management of Amtrak to be able to reallocate those resources where there are a lot of people, namely, the east coast and the west coast, rather than providing all these new security concerns all across the country that has little to no passengers, that is unprofitable. 
   I am trying to allow Amtrak and the management, including the people who live in the east coast and the west coast, to be able to get the full measure of the security enhancements that would be necessary. 
   I am trying to allow the men and women, the management of Amtrak, to be able to run their own business where the allocation of resources should be made.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 835, HAWAIIAN HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in opposition to this closed rule and the potentially unconstitutional measure that the Democrat  majority is presently bringing before the House. 
   I also rise in opposition to the majority's gaming of the system by bringing this legislation up under a closed rule with no input from the minority, even after this measure failed to win the support of two-thirds of the House when it was considered under the suspension of the rules just last week. 
   I believe that the 162 ``no'' votes that were cast last Wednesday prove that this measure carries with it some measure of controversy. I have heard the gentleman from Florida explain very clearly and carefully in addressing this issue his desire for us to understand that in fact nothing more other than the words that are on the paper are intended and implied in this bill. However, I would say there is also room to make sure that is not only correct, but also to improve this legislation. 
   I am also confident that an overwhelming number of Members would likely support the final measure if they were given a chance to improve it through the amendment that perhaps we are hearing that the majority intended perhaps in the first place or at least did not unintend to make it happen. 
   Unfortunately, in what is becoming a standard practice for the Rules Committee, last night the Democrat majority rejected along party line the only amendment offered to this legislation that would have offered the solution on behalf of the 162 ``no'' votes. This amendment was offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) who simply would have made it clear that there is nothing in this legislation that should be constructed to confer a special relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people for the purpose of establishing a government-to-government relationship. 
   This amendment is necessary because in 2000 the Supreme Court decided in Rice v. Cayetano that the current configuration of Justices would likely strike down most Federal benefits flowing to Native Hawaiians as an unconstitutional racial set-aside if, given a chance, by accepting Mr. Neugebauer's amendment, or at least allowing its merits to be debated and voted on, Congress would have had the opportunity to make it crystal clear to any future court that this legislation should not be construed as Congress' abuse of its power under the Indian commerce clause to indirectly confer tribal status on the Native Hawaiian people. 
   I will take the words that have been given to me by the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) as well as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) from the Rules Committee that they do not intend this legislation in any way, and it should not be construed as told to the minority, that they would intend to pass power under the Indian commerce clause to indirectly confer tribal status on the Native Hawaiian people. I will take them at their word as the understanding and the basis and the intent of this legislation. 
   But by shutting out this amendment, the Democrat majority has done nothing to address the concerns of the 162 Members of this body who do believe that this legislation under consideration is vague at best and unconstitutional at worst.     
   Nor have they done anything to clarify the intent of this legislation to the courts. While, Mr. Speaker, you and I recognize that courts in their deliberations would look at congressional intent, we would like for it to be so stated. While the majority has indicated they do not intend this, we wish it had also been in the form of an amendment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that, once again, the majority has silenced the minority in this effort. I am disappointed also that, by failing to include this amendment, Congress may very well be opening up this legislation to be overturned by the courts. In doing so, Congress would be depriving Native Hawaiians access to the loan guarantee programs provided for in this bill simply for the sake of speed at the cost of accuracy and good legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule so that this legislation can be passed in a clear, constitutional way that makes it transparent to the courts that this is not a back-door attempt to lay the groundwork for other legislation to confer tribal status on the Native Hawaiian people. Native Hawaiians are just as much a part of America, this great land, as any of us. Their history is covered by the Constitution, and they are part of this country. I oppose this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   I would notify the gentleman from Florida I have no additional speakers. If he would engage with me in a quick colloquy, we can figure out where we are in terms of moving forward.

   We will take them at their word that they do not intend for this to be any sort of a back-door attempt to form a government-to-government relationship with the tribal Native Hawaiians. 
   I will tell you that we do believe that public housing and housing for Hawaiians, who are many times faced with increasing not only land costs but prices that escalate in the beautiful, beautiful State of Hawaii, that this is a good idea. We should be helping these people out. We simply wish that the amendment had been made in order for the proper clarification.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, we are here today to consider the Democrat leadership's proposed change to the current House practices to provide Delegates from U.S. territories with representation without taxation. 
   The Democrat leadership, in a political effort to pad votes, is willing to trample on the Constitution by allowing these Delegates to cast votes on amendments that could affect taxpayers across the United States of America without requiring that these residents pay taxes into the United States Treasury. According to a 2000 census, American Samoa had 60,000 residents, about one-tenth the size of an average congressional district. This too undermines the fundamental constitutional provision and principle of one man, one vote. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to oppose this bad policy and political effort by the Democrat leadership and majority to extend representation without taxation to nontaxpayers and to dilute the votes of the American taxpayers in the United States House of Representatives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule and to the underlying legislation which asks taxpayers from across the country to subsidize the risky housing choices of residents of one State at the expense of the private marketplace. 
   This legislation does nothing to promote responsible and effective disaster mitigation standards or any other risk-reduction measures to lower the costs in the terrible event of a natural disaster. Instead, it promotes widespread moral hazard and inefficient decisionmaking by distorting the costs associated with living in high-risk areas through national subsidies. 
   These bail-out mechanisms will promote overdevelopment in areas most vulnerable to hurricanes, flooding, and other natural disaster damage, which is why groups like the National Wildlife Federation have come out in opposition to this bill, recognizing that the legislation subsidies will ``result in continued encouragement of risky development in our Nation's coastal areas and floodplains,'' and that more development in these areas will lead to ``more loss of life, more loss of property, and more loss of wildlife habitat.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I include for the Congressional Record a letter signed by the National Wildlife Federation and the chairman of The Florida Coalition for Preservation, both of whom are opposing this bill.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so that I can amend the rule to have Speaker Pelosi, in consultation with Republican Leader BOEHNER, immediately appoint conferees to move forward a clean Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill for 2008. 
   Despite the fact that Veterans Day will likely come and go this year without the House living up to its commitments to our Nation's veterans, Democrats continue to play politics with this important funding for their own political gain. 
   While the House Democrat leadership plays politics, however, our Nation's veterans are the ones paying the price. The Senate has already done its work and appointed conferees for the veterans appropriations bill, and for every day that House Democrats allow the veterans funding bill to languish without conferees for their own political agenda, our Nation's veterans lose $18.5 million, money that could be used for veterans housing, veterans health care, and other very important veterans support activities. 
   The American Legion and the VFW already have, along with multiple requests from this Member, as well as Republican Members of the House, urged both Speaker Pelosi and Democrat Senate Majority Leader Reid to end their PR campaign and begin conference work on this important veterans funding issue. 
   Unfortunately, it appears as though all these commonsense requests have fallen on deaf ears, and our Nation's veterans are being forced to pay the price for continued Democrat partisanship and lack of leadership on this issue. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to support this motion to defeat the previous question so that we can put partisanship aside and move this important legislation forward without any further gimmicks or games. 
   I know that this is a bold idea that hasn't yet been focused on by groups around the Democrat Party or by pollsters or those who work with moveon.org, but I think that our veterans deserve nothing less.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for many years, our government has been involved in the funding of several successful conservation programs that are supported by recreational, sport and trophy hunting programs in Africa. The Committee wisely spoke to these important programs in the Statement of the Managers which accompanies the Omnibus Appropriations legislation. I support the language and welcome the USAID coming before the Appropriations Committee and detailing these important conservation projects. 
   Initially, the language in the State Foreign Operations Report denied USAID funding of recreational, sport and trophy hunting in its assistance programs in Africa. Again, the language in the Statement of the Managers to accompany the Omnibus legislation offers out the opportunity for the USAID conservation projects to continue and further states that they need to come before the Committee and explain these important conservation programs. I support this effort and commend the Committee on this language. 
   Tourist hunting in foreign lands has proven to be vital and critical to community-based natural resource management programs such as the CAMPFIRE Program in Zimbabwe and the LIFE Plus Project in Namibia. 
   These programs provide conservation and social benefits like growth, revenue, poverty reduction, improved livelihoods and empowerment--all of which alleviate human suffering. Isn't that what we are trying to accomplish with these programs? Closer to home, National Geographic News reported in March of 2007 that ``trophy hunting is of key importance to conservation in Africa by creating [financial] incentives to promote and retain wildlife as a land use over vast areas...'' 
   As I previously mentioned, the CAMPFIRE and the LIFE Plus Projects in Africa are just two examples of working conservation programs that involve controlled, regulated sport and trophy hunting. These programs literally support the entire tribal system in many areas of Africa. The programs which are funded with matching funds from groups like the World Wildlife Fund and the Dallas Safari Club supply money for drinking water wells and schools for the local population. Without these programs, literally millions of acres that are properly managed now would fall prey to poachers and the land would prove to have no economic value. Animals in this environment would be killed for food, over-hunted and poached. These programs provide conservation and social benefits like growth, revenue, poverty reduction, improved livelihoods and empowerment--all of which alleviate human suffering. 
   The USAID conservation programs are extremely important to the survival of many species worldwide and I thank the Appropriations Committee for recognizing that the language in the Foreign Operations House Report needed to be revised and I thank the Committee for speaking to it appropriately in the Statement of the Managers that accompanies the Omnibus legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I want to thank the gentleman, my friend from Vermont, for yielding. And, Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   ``I rise in strong opposition to this martial law rule and in opposition to the outrageous process that continues to plague the United States House of Representatives. We have before us a martial law rule that allows the leadership to once again ignore the rules of the House and the procedures and the traditions of this House. Martial law is no way to run a democracy no matter what your ideology, no matter what your party affiliation.'' 
   Madam Speaker, those are not my words nor are they the words of my Republican colleague from the Rules Committee, Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart, who spoke these same words on the floor on Monday. They are not the words of my staff or some journalist who is covering the Democrat majority heavy-handed floor tactics. No. These are the clear and clever words of the gentleman from Massachusetts, our Rules Committee colleague, Jim McGovern. He spoke these words on several occasions last year regarding what was then eloquently called ``martial law rule.'' 
   I will also use this opportunity to point out another comment that the gentleman from Massachusetts made about martial law rules.     
   His quote is particularly interesting because it was given to each of us on this floor last year on December 6, just a month before the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives, well after the election. He spoke about how the Democrats proposed to run the House, which today stands in sharp contrast to what they are actually doing. 
   About 1 year ago, the gentleman from Massachusetts said, ``Mr. Speaker, there is a better way to run this body. The truth, Mr. Speaker, is that the American people expect and deserve better. That is why the 110th Congress must be different. I believe we need to rediscover openness and fairness in the House. We must insist on full and fair debate on the issues that come before this body.'' 
   Now, I and all of my Republican colleagues must ask, a year into the new Democrat majority, where is the openness and fairness that Mr. McGovern spoke about? Where is the openness on the energy bill rule where over 90 amendments were prevented from being considered on the House floor, including a Republican substitute? Where was that openness when we considered SCHIP reauthorization and, what, we had a closed rule? 
   I can help my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to find out because I know exactly where it is; they left it off on the campaign trail. This, like their promises to disclose earmarks and to run the most ethical and open Congress in history, was an empty promise. It is an empty promise which is becoming more and more evident from the opening day of this new majority, when the Democrats wrote into the rules of the House closed rules for consideration of the first six bills that we were to take up, in effect, discharging the Rules Committee from its duties and setting a new partisan tone for this Congress. Not much has changed since then, Madam Speaker. 
   Lacking the courage of their convictions to change what they perceived to be problems with how Republicans ran the House, the Democrat remedy for changing unfair practices in the Rules Committee was to have no Rules Committee at all. And that trend of closing down the House to Members that started back then, sadly, continues to this day. 
   Madam Speaker, there is a better way to run this body. The truth is is that the American people expect and deserve better. That's why the 110th Congress must be different. I believe we must and we need to rediscover openness and fairness in this House. We must insist on full and fair debate on the issues that come before this body. 
   Oh, by the way, following the rules of the House of at least presenting a bill 24 hours before it comes to the House floor would be a great place to start, because I know it's on the Speaker's Web site saying that that's the way we should operate. We're still waiting. 
   Madam Speaker, a year ago at this time, despite the House passing all but one of our spending bills, Democrats were on the campaign trail railing against Republican leadership, calling it a ``do-nothing'' Congress. Well, if last year was a failure because of Congress' ability to get all but one appropriations bill to the President for his signature on time, then what does that mean that this year we should think about Democrats when Democrats have failed to get more than one to the President after holding back popular bipartisan bills like veterans funding for their own political partisan gamesmanship? 
   Madam Speaker, I agree with the Democrats of 2006, not the Democrats of 2007. So, I rise in opposition to this martial law rule. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida, my friend, for yielding me the time. 
   Madam Speaker, we are here right now for the purpose of providing for the consideration of the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 2764. That is what we are here for. I will repeat that. We are here for providing for the consideration of the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment. It is rather confusing, not just to Members of Congress. It is confusing, I think, to the American people, also. 
   Madam Speaker, today, I would like to just read from the Calendar, Wednesday, December 19 on the back page, ``Status of Major Bills, First Session.'' Here is essentially what it says. 
   It says that Homeland Security appropriations was completed on June 8 in the House and July 26 in the Senate. Never sent to conference. 
   Energy and Water appropriations, July 17. Never completed by the Senate. 
   Military Construction and VA, June 15 in the House, September 6 in the Senate. 
   The new fiscal year has already started. This new Democrat majority has been sitting on these bills, including the VA, since September 6. And yet they are coming to the floor today just a week before Christmas terribly upset, terribly upset, and yet it says here, let me see if I got this right, sent to conference, these are all blanks. They didn't go to conference. The Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader never had a conference. They didn't get together to try and work out the differences that they had. What they did is they let Members sit day after day after day. 
   Just 1 year and 75 days ago, when Republicans had completed all but one of these bills, we were called irresponsible and we couldn't do the people's business. And yet here we are, 1 year later plus 75 days, and only one of the bills has made it to the President. I could keep going. Financial Services and General Government; Labor, Health, Human Services and Education. 
   My gosh, what is happening?     
   What is happening to this House of Representatives and the United States Congress? What is happening is that I believe we had what I would consider to be false hopes and promises that were established in the first place about all these problems that were going to go away. Just give our good friends, the Democrats, that ability to hold the House and Senate, and they will do it. But, Madam Speaker, they didn't even get the work done between themselves, forget blaming things on the President of the United States or Republicans. They couldn't even appoint their own conferees. They couldn't even do their own work. 
   Today, we sit here and listen to all the things that are still wrong and about how Republicans have stood in the way and been obstructionists. That is not the facts of the case. The facts of the case are all these bills that I have talked about were never even sent to a conference, and today, the reason why we are still talking is because allegedly there is a glitch, a glitch, because the negotiations between the majority in the House and the majority in the Senate couldn't get it right. Well, if you do things in the dark, if you do things where nobody else is involved, that is  what you get. I am told it's a $70 billion mistake. 
   I just don't understand why business is done this way, when 1 year ago we had all but one bill done before the election. All but one. If you systematically go through a process and work through the bills in the light of day, where the information is posted on the Web site, where you give people time to read the bill, I think a better result happens. 
   I think it's deceptive. I think it's deceptive to say that this House would be the most honest, open, and ethical Congress in the history, when there was no attempt from the very beginning to even live up to that. 
   So here we are, just a few days before Christmas, still burning time, trying to burn time, because we know that the negotiators have to fix the problems, and that is a real problem to this House, and I think it is to the American people. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to take just a few minutes to say this. The Republican Party congratulates our colleagues and all of us today for presumably ending what we are doing, and I am pleased to say that it was a victory for the taxpayers because we are not going to increase taxes, as our good friends the Democrats wanted to do and have bemoaned all week long about not getting that massive tax increase. 
   We are going to go and make sure in SCHIP that we don't take 2 million children from their own private insurance to a government-run program that is still overburdened. We are going to make sure that we don't do, I think, bad things in dealing with our ability to find terrorists with the FISA bill. 
   So it's a great victory today for the taxpayer, for the people who want to protect this country, because what has prevailed is what we said should happen, and that is that the Republican minority kept after this process to make sure that the taxpayers don't lose on this last day before we leave before Christmas, and we are going to stay after that because we believe we are doing the right thing. 
   I am proud of what we will accomplish here today if we can find this $70 billion mistake that has happened and we can close the books on the year and know we went home with no further damage.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6003, PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today and want to thank my friend from California, a member of the Rules Committee, for yielding this time to me to discuss the proposed rule for consideration of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act. 
   I rise in opposition to this rule, and to the legislation, neither of which will meet the Democrats' campaign promises about how they said they would run the House in a fair and transparent manner, nor the American taxpayers'  expectations how the Federal Government should manage tax revenues that it takes from hardworking Americans. 
   The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 would reauthorize Government spending on Amtrak over the next 5 years at a cost of almost $15 billion without requiring any meaningful reforms in Amtrak's governance or operations and without allocating taxpayer dollars based on a demand for the service. 
   As we know, Amtrak is a private corporation that continues to receive large Federal operating subsidies, despite laws passed by Congress requiring after 2002, over 5 years ago, that they should be able to run their operations without Federal grant funds. 
   Despite the fact that the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved this legislation, I am not alone in believing that Amtrak should conduct its operations without picking the pockets of American families who are already being asked to do this by the do-nothing Democrat Congress to pay for record prices for energy, and can little afford to subsidize the inefficiencies of a transportation system that many of them will never use. 
   Like me and many of my Republican colleagues, President Bush has urged this Congress to pass legislation that would: (1) create a system driven by sound economics where services are provided based primarily on consumer demand; (2) promote competition; (3) focus Amtrak on core operating competencies; (4) establish funding partnerships with States; and, (5) improve investment in and management of the Northeast Corridor. 
   I include for the Record the Statement of Administration Policy for H.R. 6003.  
   Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget
   Washington, DC, June 9, 2008.  
   H.R. 6003--Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, (Rep. Oberstar (D) Minnesota and 41 cosponsors) 
   The Administration believes that a significantly reformed intercity passenger rail system has the potential to play a role of growing importance in providing transportation options in the United States, including helping to reduce congestion along heavily traveled intercity corridors. However, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 6003, which would reauthorize the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) for five years, because it would authorize an appropriation of more than $14 billion without requiring any meaningful reforms in Amtrak's governance or operations and without allocating resources based on the demand for passenger rail service. For this reason, and others set forth below, if the bill were presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisors would recommend he veto it. 
   Amtrak is a private corporation that continues to receive large Federal operating subsidies, despite longstanding existing law requiring that, after 2002, ``Amtrak shall operate without Federal operating grant funds appropriated for its benefit.'' H.R. 6003 authorizes an unprecedented level of funding but does not include basic measures to hold Amtrak accountable to taxpayers for its spending decisions. For example, H.R. 6003 provides scant opportunity for competition on existing Amtrak routes and does not include provisions that would condition Amtrak's funding based on progress on reforms. Measures to address these areas are included in S. 294 and should be adopted before Congress completes its work on this measure. 
   The Administration also would strongly object if bonding authority were added to the bill. Language in the introduced version of H.R. 6004, the Rail Infrastructure Development and Expansion Act for the 21st Century, permits State issuance of $24 billion in bonds, including but not limited to tax credit bonds. In particular, the use of tax credit bonds to finance the construction of high-speed rail capital projects would be expensive and highly inefficient, and costs would be borne by taxpayers, not system users. 
   To move Amtrak towards a sustainable business model, the Administration urges Congress to pass legislation that reflects the following core reform principles consistently articulated by this Administration: (1) create a system driven by sound economics where services are provided based primarily on consumer demand; (2) promote competition; (3) focus Amtrak on core operating competencies; (4) establish funding partnerships with States; and (5) improve the investment in and management of the Northeast Corridor. 
   The Administration appreciates that H.R. 6003 includes measures to promote private sector development of the Northeast Corridor and other potential high-speed routes. Making use of the private sector's operational and financial management capabilities could help new rail services to perform at a high level for the traveling public. However, the Administration is concerned that the authorized funding levels for high-speed rail in H.R. 6003 send the wrong message; any expansions of rail service should be based on a sustainable business model. 
   Titles III and V would establish certain capital grants programs requiring workers employed with funds obtained under these programs be paid pursuant to Davis-Bacon Act requirements. Thus, Titles III and V would expand Davis-Bacon Act coverage, which is contrary to the Administration's long-standing policy of opposing any statutory attempt to expand or contract the applicability of Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements. This expansion could undermine the effectiveness of the enumerated programs.   
   This statement, which outlines these goals for the improvement of Amtrak, makes clear that the President's senior advisers would recommend his veto of today's legislation that falls far short of this mark. 
   During testimony in the Rules Committee last evening, it was represented to the committee that the legislation would allow some minimal privatization of a few routes, and that some additional studies and the rearrangement of some management duties at Amtrak were included in the bill to improve its efficiencies. I appreciate these efforts, and although I do not think that they go nearly far enough, because as we speak Amtrak continues to hemorrhage money due to labor disputes, energy costs, and the requirement that they maintain service on very lightly used, long-haul routes through rural areas of the country. 
   Unfortunately, through their inaction, the Democrat majority has already demonstrated its lack of interest in doing anything serious to address this issue as well as soaring energy costs. Through its flurry of constant action on behalf of big labor bosses, they have demonstrated that they are equally unwilling to do anything to address that problem for Amtrak, its riders, or the American public. 
   That means that the only opportunity that Members have to reform Amtrak in this bill is through cutting the fat from these underused, rural long-haul lines that are often subsidized at a cost of multiple hundreds of dollars per ticket by American taxpayers. 
   To address this problem, I have offered an amendment that is very similar to my efforts in the past on this issue, but is this time even more direct in its approach. 
   In March 2007, I offered an amendment to the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act that would have prohibited Amtrak from subsidizing its 10 worst revenue losing long-distance routes, as determined by its own September 2006 monthly performance report unless the Secretary of Homeland Security determined that the route was critical to our homeland security needs. Unfortunately, this commonsense and fiscally responsible amendment failed. 
   So today, I will be offering an amendment that is even more direct in its purpose and even more clear in its intent, an amendment that will simply prohibit taxpayer subsidies from flowing to the absolutely worst, most wasteful, most expensive long-distance route that Amtrak runs, according to its own performance report as of March 2008, unless this route is deemed to be critical to our Nation's homeland security. 
   My amendment simply seeks to prevent further good taxpayer dollars from being thrown after bad by limiting the cost of Amtrak's number one least profitable route; the number one least profitable route, that's all we are asking in this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, if Members cannot support this simple, security-conscious amendment on behalf of fiscal discipline, I don't know if there is anything that we can possibly do to help the American taxpayers any more. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to vote against this rule which does not match the Democrats' rhetoric about running the most honest, open and transparent Congress in history. I also ask them to oppose this underlying legislation which even if my amendment were included does not go far enough to protect the hard-earned money of American taxpayers from wasteful spending at Amtrak. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, the gentleman from New York, my friend, really made a great argument on exactly what I've been trying to say. But we've got to get our friends to come around the corner and see that if we would get Amtrak to do the things that are in their mission statement, rather than running all across the United States trying to do things that are not cost effective, are not within their main core mission, then we could find the money that would be available for them to support, as the gentleman said, the Northeast Corridor, to spend the money within the corridor to make them safer. 
   But, instead, what happens is Amtrak is not held accountable, not by this Congress. We tell them, just go ahead and do whatever you choose to do, rather than focusing on their mission which they have, which is that which is required for traffic on the coasts, the west coast and the east coast. 
   So, Madam Speaker, once again, we can't expect Amtrak to do the things that would be in the best interest if they won't stick to their mission, if this Congress will not hold them accountable for the taxpayer dollars that they are utilizing. 
   Madam Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina, the distinguished gentleman, Mr. Brown.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Thornberry, said it best: no excuses. It's time for us to get our work done, and the bottom line is is  that the supply side of the equation is the problem. If we had lots of supply, prices wouldn't be what they are. We need to bring to the table American energy for America's independence, but quite frankly, we're not only tired of paying higher prices, we're also tired of building new Dubais across the world. And that rests at the feet of our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who has a policy that restricts Americans from drilling for oil and having energy independence. Today is no excuses. 
   Madam Speaker, since taking control of Congress in 2007, this Democrat Congress has totally neglected its responsibility to do anything constructive, constructive, to address the domestic supply issues that have created the skyrocketing gas, diesel and energy costs that American families are facing today. 
   So, today, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so this House can address the real solutions to energy costs. That's the supply side. By defeating the previous question, I will move to amend the rule to allow for consideration of H.R. 3089, the No More Excuses Energy Act of 2007, introduced by my friend Mac Thornberry of Texas, that he introduced back 1 year ago in July 2007. 
   This legislation would reduce the price of gasoline by opening new American oil refineries; investing in clean energy sources such as wind, nuclear and captured carbon dioxide; and making available more homegrown energy through environmentally sensitive exploration of the arctic energy slope and America's deep sea reserves. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of this amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.

And I admire the gentlewoman from Florida for asking these questions that she asks and posing the issues, the issues of our time, energy policy, tax policy, men and women who are hardworking Americans trying to pay their bills. And yet I would say the conclusion that came out, which I agree with, ``And this is why, thank goodness, we have a Democrat majority,'' the Democrat majority has now been in power for some 17 months, and yet we find the Democrat majority is simply coming to the floor asking questions, ``Oh, my gosh, what's happening?'' And the answer that I heard over and over was, we've got to make sure ``we,'' meaning the government, provide these low-cost loans. We've got to make sure that the government has all these things available for people. 
   The government should not be the answer to the problem. The answer should be that this Democrat majority needs to understand that they've got to accept responsibility that gas prices have gone up 60 percent since they have taken over, that it is their agenda that this country now operates under; that we have seen and we understood now through not just two budgets, but through the policy that is being enunciated all around this country on behalf of the Democrat Party of raising taxes and making sure that we have an economic policy that is not based upon trying to grow more jobs, but rather, about fairness. 
   We have seen the tax policy from this new Democrat majority of 17 months, raising taxes, going to double the capital gains tax. Well, Madam Speaker, what I would say to you is, no wonder we're in economic problems. Seventeen months ago, the people who planned for jobs in this country--that are called employers--have understood that they're going to pay higher taxes. We already have the second highest corporate tax rate in the world, but now we're going to tax investors. 
   So the tax policy is very plain and simple. The tax policy is that we are going to bleed, soak investors for more money so that the government can get the money so that we can then do more from the government perspective. Well, Madam Speaker, I would have to say to you, this could be the death of the free enterprise system. When you tax people, they make decisions. And when you tax something, you get less of it. In this case, we are now seeing economic downturn. We are now seeing dollars that are investment dollars, rather than coming to the United States, they're going overseas. The tax policy does have an impact on the economic viability of this country. 
   Secondly, the energy policy. We have seen the answer from the Speaker. Speaker Pelosi put forth an energy bill that was really pretty good, but it had nothing to do with supply side. The supply of energy, of gasoline is what America needs today. And so we passed this big energy bill, and we see prices continuing to rise. We're told we're supposed to make this transition to this green environment, and all the jobs that will come as a result of that. But, in fact, what will happen is we will lose the jobs that we have today and wait for that to come. 
   Madam Speaker, we're almost to the point where a majority of the gasoline is no longer oil, it's gasoline, because the jobs that produce the oil to gasoline are overseas because we don't want those jobs in this country. Dubai is being built and has flourished as a result of Democratic Party policies. The money from American consumers are building Dubai. Since 1995, the Republican Party, in trying to work with President Clinton, we said, let us supply more energy here. What do we do? We get a veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. So, Madam Speaker, today we come to the floor now worried about college students and families trying to pay for college expenses, and what we get is question after question after question. This majority is not prepared, in my opinion, to deal with the things that will produce jobs, which will produce the ability for people to have money in their pocket to pay for their education. And that comes from the policies of tax and spend of the Democratic Party, where they are not in favor of a tax policy for investors to invest in America, but rather, for investors to pay an incredible increase in taxes to Uncle Sam. So what happens is that America no longer can look up and say we are the beacon of freedom, we are producing jobs. 
   The production of new jobs means that the free enterprise system is alive and well, which means that we don't have to come to government for our needs. It is the policy of the Democratic Party and of our Speaker to tax and spend America to the highest level in the history of our country and it is the policy of this House not to have supply side for our energy. And without a supply side, without a tax policy that allows investment dollars to be here, we will continue to see this Democrat majority come and ask questions and lament about all the problems that lie ahead of us, and we will continue to hear ``and government is the answer.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I would suggest to you that the answer would be: The free enterprise system, lowering taxes, a supply side policy that helps get more energy available to consumers, and one where government is the backstop and not the first answer. 
   I will end by saying this: Without employers, we will not have employees, and that should be a challenge to the Democrat majority.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Vermont, for the time that he is yielding me to discuss H.R. 2634, the Responsible Lending and Expanded Debt Collection Cancellation Act of 2007. This legislation follows on the heels of legislation passed just 2 weeks ago providing aid to mostly African and Caribbean countries to fight AIDS and promote development programs in underdeveloped countries, including programs to improve food, water, the treatment of other infectious diseases, poverty alleviation programs, microcredit, schools and teachers, legal aid, agricultural assistance and biomedical research. 
   Today's legislation would follow up on this enormous prior financial commitment by further reducing or eliminating the debt obligations of the world's poorest nations. It attempts to accomplish this goal by creating a framework to having the debts of low-income countries owed to the United States and to international financial institutions eliminated. 
   To do this, this bill authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to negotiate the full cancellation of these countries' debts with the Paris Club, the IMF, and the World Bank, and to reach agreements on future creditor transparency and responsible lending. 
   It improves oversight by ensuring that countries receiving this debt relief have economies that are capable of redirecting their debt services payments, and requires a GAO audit of countries where illegal loans may have been made. Finally, it includes a sense of Congress that the U.S. should pay off $600 million worth of arrears to multilateral development banks. 
   Madam Speaker, no one in this body disputes the worthiness of this goal that is enshrined within this legislation. The reduction of global poverty and suffering around the world is a laudable goal, and it is certainly in our national interests to combat conditions that may breed the hopelessness and poverty that allows dictators and terrorists to thrive. 
   So it is doubtlessly important that the most heavily indebted poor countries be relieved of these kinds of crushing debt that prevents their future development, self-sufficiency and the improvement of their citizens' lives. 
   This policy should be implemented, along with other policies that increase public sector investment and decrease the barriers to trade with these countries, as well as ensuring that the countries eligible for this relief do not encourage terrorist activities or abuse human rights. 
   I am surprised, however, that Speaker Pelosi didn't see the irony in scheduling this step forward for developing nations on the first legislative week after handing them a serious defeat by turning off the fast track authority for the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. In other words, here we're trying to help poor countries and now the decision is made that we won't engage in trade with them that would help their countries also grow economically free. 
   While giving the most heavily indebted countries relief from crushing and unserviceable debt is necessary to increase their future development, it is simply not sufficient. The economies of these countries must be more integrated with the rest of the globe to provide their citizens with real choices and development alternatives for their future, and increased trade with America is a great way of accomplishing this. 
   So while I appreciate the Financial Services Committee's efforts on the issue of improving conditions for the world's poorest countries, I remind my colleagues that development does not occur in a vacuum, and that by postponing the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, we have effectively told all of these countries, people who should be our friends and we should be concerned about more than just their debt, but about their economic viability, we've said that Congress is less concerned about promoting trade with them and growing their economies than it is with complying with the demands of labor union bosses in an election year. 
   I encourage the Democrat leadership to take a long-term and more holistic view of global poverty, recognizing that these cycles of abject poverty cannot be broken without creating the conditions that encourage private sector investment, such as respect for contracts and rule of law and that it also encourages international trade. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe that a broader policy of understanding poverty and the United States' role in helping to make our world better would include trade and would include encouraging the private markets around the world. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that President Bush has selected a man of great integrity and one of our former colleagues who served in this Congress to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Jim Nussle. His chairmanship of the House Budget Committee gave us an opportunity to witness the expertise and responsible use of taxpayer dollars that he will bring to the OMB. 
   During his tenure in this body, Chairman Nussle's work made a positive impact on countless Americans. Without his hard work and leadership, the Family Opportunity Act, which provides badly needed medical care to children with disabilities, would never have become law. 
   To recognize Chairman Nussle's incredible talents, one should look no further than the very kind comments made by Chairman Nussle's former colleague across the aisle, my friend, Chairman John Spratt. He said, ``Jim was a fair and honorable chairman. In selecting Jim Nussle to succeed Rob Portman, the President is replacing one able and knowledgeable man with another.'' 
   I congratulate President Bush on this astute choice. I wish Chairman Nussle the very best during his confirmation hearing today at the Senate Budget Committee.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3524, HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from Florida yielding me the time. I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments, specifically as they relate to really the author of HOPE VI, who is Jack Kemp, at that time in the early nineties the Secretary of Housing in the United States of America.     
   I think that today, as we talk about HOPE VI and the wonderful attributes that HOPE VI has brought not only to inner cities but to thousands of people who live in these new areas as opposed to a large housing complex, it is a testament to the dream that, as Secretary, Jack Kemp brought to our great Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to this restrictive rule and to a number of the provisions included in the underlying legislation in its current form. This legislation, which alters a successful public-private partnership and housing program that encourages public housing authorities to work with the private sector to create more livable public housing, has a number of avoidable, and I repeat, avoidable shortcomings; and I hope that there will be at least some of them that will be corrected during this restrictive rule process as is provided for by the rule. 
   One of the provisions in this bill particularly threatens the continued participation of private developers in the program, which jeopardizes HOPE VI's continued success. I believe that is part of the success, the public-private partnership, in creating mixed-financed and mixed-income affordable housing. 
   By mandating compliance with privately developed green building rating systems, rather than providing market-based incentives to reach these goals, this legislation creates additional cost burdens for green compliance and adds further impediments to an already complicated financing structure which could discourage developers from undertaking future projects. 
   Further, because the legislation makes specific reference to only one green building rating system, this legislation federally mandates winners and losers and stifles future innovation and technology advancement in all aspects of green buildings. 
   I think it would be a flaw to say that the one standard that has been developed in 2007 and 2008 would be the only model as we move forward in public housing. I certainly would not want that in the free market where, as a user of the free market, I would be told one standard that was developed this year is what we will use. The future is bright, and I wish that our friends on the other side would recognize that there will be many, many more technological advances made in the future; and mandating one standard today is a flaw in this bill. 
   Thankfully, my former Rules Committee colleague and friend from West Virginia, the gentlewoman Shelley Moore Capito, has an amendment to this legislation that will require minimum green building standards, in other words, the floor, not the ceiling, that will make mandatory graded sections of HOPE VI application, requiring a minimum standard for green building, and allowing for developers who build to a more stringent green standard to receive even greater credits. That means that we could exceed the one standard. For instance, if you lived in a very cold area, or very hot area, you could exceed for maximum utilization the opportunity to build the house, up front, properly. 
   So our friends on the other side who are telling us the one standard is like a one-size-fits-all rather than a minimum standard, however, if a determination is made in the section of the country that might artificially or might otherwise be able to take advantage of a different standard, a different way that might improve economical standards of efficiency, it wouldn't be included. 
   By utilizing this market-based approach, rather than the one-size-fits-all  standard of our friends in Washington of a heavy-handed government mandate, this amendment achieves the goal of building green without stifling innovation for new and improved green building standards. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, because it will take our friends who are Democrats if we are going to pass this, to please support this commonsense fix to the legislation. 
   Another aspect of this legislation which requires improvement is the elimination of HUD's current authority to award demolition-only grants, which would prohibit the demolition of unsuitable public housing without the replacement of those units. Mr. Speaker, clearly there may be instances when demolition-only grants are appropriate; for instance, when public housing authorities may have already assembled a financing package to fund redevelopment and replacement housing activities, but are lacking the funds for the demolition itself. 
   Additionally, because of their age and denigration, it is certainly possible that some distressed public housing sites would not be viable candidates for redevelopment. There are lots of places in this country where something was built 15, 20, 30, 40 years ago that might not be easily accessible to the modern conveniences of today. And these sites, though only partially occupied or completely vacant, because they put a demand in a particular area, would be excluded. In these instances, other forms of housing assistance such as section 8 vouchers may be more appropriate in a community than public housing. 
   To address this flaw in the legislation, I have introduced an amendment to allow HUD to retain this commonsense authority, rather than trying to tie their hands by taking some of the options that had previously been available to them off the table. 
   For their part, HUD has noted that these grants have provided housing authorities with resources to raze, or to tear down, distressed developments and relocate impacted families. The result is a cleared site that more readily attracts Federal or private resources for the revitalization of the property. I encourage all of my colleagues to once again support this commonsense amendment to allow HUD to retain the flexibility to respond to individual cases, particularly in those cases where a public housing authority does not even have a HOPE VI renovation grant, leaving it with fewer options in revitalization in its most distressed or otherwise not as easily used sites. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the last five budget proposals to Congress, this Bush administration has advocated the elimination of the HOPE VI program, citing the completion of the program's mission and ongoing inefficiencies within the programs. These programs have been assessed by the administration's objective Program Assessing Rating Tool, what is called PART, which has deemed HOPE VI to be not performing, inefficient, and more costly than other programs that serve the same population. In addition to these fundamental problems, the PART assessment notes that ``the program has accomplished its stated mission of the demolition of 100,000 severely distressed public housing units.'' 
   I include a copy of this assessment as well as a Statement of Administration Policy on this matter for insertion into the Record. 
   Program Assessment: HOPE VI--Severely Distressed Public Housing 
   The HOPE VI program revitalizes distressed and obsolete public housing, usually replacing it with less dense housing combining a mixture of public and privately owned housing. The program awards grants through a competitive process to State and local public housing agencies for this activity.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, which strikes the prohibition of the demolition-only grants from the HOPE VI, allowing HUD to retain its current authority to issue these grants as conditions warrant. The original goal of HOPE VI was to eliminate severely distressed public housing, and demolition-only grants continue to play an important role in achieving this goal. 
   Currently, HUD is allowed to grant demolition-only grants only when necessary and in instances that benefit the community. That means it will be done in consultation with the community. As a result, HUD provides these grants with great discretion. In fact, a demolition-only grant has not been issued by HUD since 2003. Clearly, despite what the opponents of this legislation may claim, HUD has not covertly abused this power to tear down public housing units without reason and, I would suggest to you, without being asked to participate. 
   However, sometimes public housing authorities have already put together their own financing to redevelop housing, but they lack the funds to tear down the existing distressed facility. In instances like these, common sense dictates that a demolition-only grant under HOPE VI would be appropriate, once again, working with the existing local authority to make sure that what they want is accomplished. 
   As an added bonus, a cleared site also attracts more Federal and private resources for revitalization efforts, meaning that when local people ask for the support, then it can and would presumably be granted, making the site better. 
   Another instance in which demolition-only grants make sense is when a severely distressed public housing site is simply not a viable candidate for redevelopment, either because it is only partially occupied or completely vacant, once again, working directly with the local housing authority. In these cases, other forms of housing assistance, like section 8 vouchers, may be more beneficial to community members simply than reconstructing a new building, in particular on the same site, once again, at the discretion of local housing authorities. 
   The question that every Member should be asking themselves before they vote to eliminate this authority is, if there is no demand for public housing in a certain area, as evidenced by its partially or completely vacant status, and if the local housing authority is seeking this help, then why on Earth would Congress mandate that HUD create an unwanted supply? It makes no logical or fiscal sense to inefficiently direct these taxpayer dollars where there is no reason or demand to build. Prohibiting demolition-only grants almost guarantees this type of waste would occur. 
   Additionally and finally, Mr. Chairman, let's not forget that the ultimate goal of this program is to empower people to eventually get off public housing and become self-determined, not simply to create more public housing units. I would submit in the greater scheme of things, it is also to have the Federal Government, through HUD, have the flexibility to work carefully and closely with local housing authorities to make sure that the right thing happens. 
   By preventing HUD from having the authority to remove dilapidated housing without also rebuilding new units as Congress, we are certainly failing to live up to the spirit of this philosophy. I encourage all of my colleagues to support what I think is a commonsense amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   I think what we are doing is taking a tool away from the toolbox rather than flexibility. I believe it is local people who would ask for this to be done, anyway, and then the Federal Government can participate. But simply to say we have a house and we ought to keep it no matter what, is, in my opinion, a bad argument. It is a bad argument because keeping up something that is bad and needs repair and can't take care of itself, we need to get rid of those. We need to rebuild. That is what HOPE VI is all about. I hope you vote for my amendment.

   Madam Speaker, the Republican minority is very aware, as a result of Speaker Pelosi's Web site that is called Congress Working for All Americans, WWW.SPEAKER.GOV, that the Speaker has announced very publicly her intention to follow regular order for legislation. I would like to quote from that Web site at this time: ``Members should have at least 24 hours to examine a bill in a conference report text prior to floor consideration.'' 
   Madam Speaker, just minutes ago, we began the debate on this rule. Just before we began debate, as we began debate on this rule just hours ago probably, but as we began, we received the text of one of the most important bills to come to the floor of the House of Representatives at the time we began debate on the rule, which seems absolutely, just completely backwards from what the Speaker describes on her Web site. 
   Number two, the Suspension Calendar should be restricted to noncontroversial legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, here we are today on the floor of the House of Representatives not only with a bill that we had not seen the text to until we began debate but, secondly, the Suspension Calendar has very controversial legislation that we are handling today. 
   I would have to make a motion if we were in Rules Committee, and we did, we tried, that we should receive all of these bills. And, of course, we have not. 
   Very interestingly, part of the debate about this bill that we are on with foreign intelligence surveillance activities, there was a discussion just days ago in the Rules Committee whereby a Member of the Democrat majority, as part of the conversation, asked a Republican that was there: ``So you're asking to basically reduce probable cause and just basically throw probable cause out as a reason that we are trying to change the FISA rules?'' 
   The Republican answered: ``You shouldn't be having to get a warrant to listen into phone conversations between someone from Saudi Arabia calling somebody in Sudan, when neither one of them are Americans.'' The response from the Democrat was: ``Well, I don't know if I agree with that.'' 
   Madam Speaker, we are here on the floor today to also talk about the directions we are headed, the directions we are headed for protecting this country. And today, we are on the floor of the House of Representatives with the language only just given to us. On top  of that, it is one of the most controversial items that has come to the floor of the House of Representatives in the years that I have been here.

The House proposal is unacceptable, and I strongly oppose it. 
   ``The House proposal would not allow me to carry out my responsibility to provide warning and to protect the Nation, especially in our heightened threat environment.

   However, I also believe that we are missing an important opportunity to improve this legislation by offering an additional provision to be considered that was offered yesterday in the Rules Committee by our colleague, Dr. Michael Burgess from Texas. 
   Congressman Burgess' amendment would have doubled the tax credit for making biodiesel from recycled restaurant grease from 50 cents a gallon to $1 a gallon, thereby encouraging its further use and production. This incentive would encourage the marketplace to reduce petroleum use and the pollutant associated with removing this grease without removing arable land from food production. 
   Mr. Speaker, this technology works. This technology is something that we need to do more of. But, this amendment is not germane; it requires protection from a point of order, which is what the Rules Committee's job is all about. Unfortunately, yesterday, the Rules Committee voted it down along party lines with every Democrat on the committee voting to prevent this amendment from getting the protection that it would need to be considered by the House. Said another way, good ideas don't necessarily pass in the Rules Committee. 
   This amendment would allow the House to consider new and innovative ways to achieve our goal of energy independence in a responsible way. And I am disappointed that my Democrat colleagues on the committee prevented us from debating that and passing that in the bill today. 
   I support Congressman Burgess through his thoughtful legislation to provide incentives for the free market to create new, responsible and leading-edge solutions to end our dependency on foreign sources of energy. 
   I hope, despite the setback that he will likely encounter today, that Congressman Burgess will continue to offer his amendments in the future, and I also hope that he will continue to come up to the Rules Committee to make sure his ideas, thoughts, are well understood and communicated. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee is open for business. That should mean that the best thoughts and ideas that may or may not have been considered throughout the process of going through regular order would be permissible in the Rules Committee. Good ideas should find the light of day upstairs in the Rules Committee, and it is my hope that the majority will continue to allow not only an open process, but will perhaps allow itself to engage in these ideas for the betterment of people who want us to make sure that we work not only in a bipartisan way, but solve, through creativity, the problems of this great Nation.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party of this country is dedicated to coming to Washington, DC, and serving the people who believe that America's greatest days lie in our future. But there is also incumbent within that promise the opportunity to present new and better ideas that will help this country to deal with the things that lay ahead of us. 
   Yesterday, in the Rules Committee, Congressman Michael Burgess from Texas offered an amendment that would have doubled the tax credit for making biodiesel from recycled restaurant grease from 50 cents a gallon to $1 a gallon. This comes as a result of Mr. Burgess' working firsthand with people within his district who are trying to solve problems of not only air pollution, but also to take things that might normally be dumped into a recycle bin that ends up going somewhere to sit in a landfill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that Congressman Burgess deserves the respect of this House for new and better ideas that will help make sure that America is facing the problems that lie ahead of us and to make sure that we have answers for it. 
   I congratulate Congressman Burgess for bringing these ideas forward, and I hope we will continue to have other Members of this body do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the second time in a month in strong opposition to this closed rule, to these two closed amendment processes, and to the blatantly unconstitutional underlying measure that the Democrat majority is bringing to the House floor today. 
   I would like to say that I am surprised by the lack of respect for regular order and procedural gimmickry that the Democrats have used to bring this rule to the floor today. Unfortunately, in what has become an all too familiar scenario in the Democrat Rules Committee, respect for minority party rights and regular order are, once again, being trumped by political expediency and the Democrat leadership's willingness to abuse power for their own narrow political ends. 
   Last month, when this unconstitutional bill was first brought to the House floor, the Democrats sunk to an unprecedented new low by pulling the legislation from the floor just before it passed the House, using a provision that was intended to give the Speaker flexibility in scheduling votes, not to give her an escape valve when things were not going her way.     
   Today, the Democrats seem committed to outdoing that shameful effort by waiving the ``Pay-For'' rules that they imposed on this House floor just less than 4 months ago, after committing themselves to honor their pledge to increase taxes on the American public every time they increase spending. 
   They have also split the bill into two pieces, one that tries to skirt the Constitution and one that skirts their own ``Pay-For'' rule, all in the name of preventing the minority from offering the popular notion that a majority of the House was on the brink of passing just weeks ago. 
   And as if the process that brings us here today weren't bad enough, there is little to celebrate in this deeply flawed underlying bill, the same words that the constitutional scholar and law professor Jonathan Turley has called ``the most premeditated unconstitutional act by Congress in decades'' either. Thankfully, President Bush has made it clear that this cynical political exercise is destined for his veto pen, if it even makes it that far. 
   My opposition to this matter stems from its incompatibility with a pretty basic foundation of American government: the Constitution. Section 2 of article I clearly states that ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the People of several States.'' And as any fourth grader in the country can tell you, Washington, D.C., is simply not a State. There is simply no one that has moved into or lives in Washington, D.C., that thought that they would be given this ability. Washington, D.C., is not a State. 
   Supporters of this legislation will claim that the ``District Clause,'' which gives Congress the power to legislate over our Nation's seat, also gives Congress the power to grant D.C. a Member of Congress. But this same clause makes it clear, by its very nature, that Washington, D.C., is not a State, which brings us back to the original problem of this bill's being completely unconstitutional. 
   But don't take my word for it. If the Democrat leadership won't listen to reason, one would hope that they would at least listen to one of our Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton, who offered an amendment to the Constitution that would have provided D.C. with a vote in the House. Unfortunately, I know we all don't know this, but his amendment was defeated on July 22, 1788.  
   But if neither my word nor the Constitution nor the actions of our Founding Fathers is good enough, I wonder if the Democrat majority would be willing to listen to an equal branch of government, as they had an opinion on this matter. In 2000, the Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., concluded that ``the Constitution does not contemplate that the District may serve as a State for the purposes of the apportionment of congressional representatives.'' It seems pretty clear to me, but I guess not to every single Member of this body. 
   So for a moment let us ignore my word, the Constitution, the actions of our Founding Fathers, and the decisions of the Federal judiciary. What would it mean if Congress simply gave D.C. a seat in the House, rather than going through the necessary process of passing a constitutional amendment, which was attempted in 1978 and failed? Well, it would create a precedent that Congress would give the District three votes next year or they could perhaps give them 10. The way that this legislation is currently drafted, it gives the District two votes in the Committee of the Whole, more than any other voting Member, as well as a vote in the House. 
   But rather than discuss the facts or the logic of this approach, I suspect that supporters of this legislation will come to the floor and talk about ``fairness.'' But I fail to see how it is fair to give Washington, D.C., super-representation, two votes for amendments, or every voter in Utah an unprecedented two votes also, one for their Congressman and one for a new at-large Member, keeping the ``one man, one vote'' principle in every other State. Perhaps a Member on the Democrat side will be kind enough to come down to the floor and explain this logic to me; but I am not going to hold my breath. 
   Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress, we take an oath to uphold and protect the Constitution, not to trample on it. No matter what the supporters of this bill may claim to the contrary, the Constitution is not a cafeteria. You cannot pick and choose which parts you are going to respect and which ones you are going to ignore. That is why our Framers, in their infinite wisdom, created an orderly, lawful process for amending the Constitution. And despite the best efforts of the Democrat leadership, I am sure that the Framers' legacy to our country will prevail and will prevent this poorly drafted and ill-conceived measure from becoming law. 
   I urge each of my colleagues to reject this outrageous rule and the underlying assault on the Constitution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the minority believes that the means just don't justify the ends. We believe that there is a process for getting this done constitutionally and appropriately. We believe the way the rule is written, we believe that the supermajority that this would give to Washington, D.C. two voting Members as well as a super-Delegate Member who would be from Utah would violate the one man-one vote clause. We believe that the way that this is written is wrong and not correct, and we should not proceed under that matter. 
   Related to the gentlelady's comments about us delaying tactics several weeks ago, I find that curious because we were following regular order rules, rules that had been established. And I find it interesting that regular order would be called a delaying tactic. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am asking Members to vote against the previous question so that I might be able to offer an amendment to the rule which would strike the obvious attempt to nullify and mute the minority's ability to recommit a bill. 
   The provision says that if the minority has a valid motion to recommit and the majority of the House agrees to it, the bill is tabled. The majority has taken away the House's ability to send something back to the committee for further consideration. 
   The distinguished majority leader has spent a great deal of time telling Members in the press that the motion to recommit offered on March 22 would have killed the bill. Well, that just wasn't true. It would have sent the bill back to the committee. 
   The egregious provision makes the minority leader's wishes come true now. It causes any motion to recommit the bill other than a forthwith motion to effectively kill the bill. Why would the Democrat majority want to limit the minority's opinion in such a manner? Would it be so that they might be able to say with a straight face that a vote to recommit actually kills the bill? 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment and the extraneous material be printed just prior to the vote on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this rule and the unprecedented tax increase that the Democrat majority is bringing back to the House today. 
   I wish I could report to my colleagues that this legislation was improved since the last time the House considered it in March. Unfortunately, the massive and irresponsible tax increase included in the House version of this budget would still be the largest tax increase in American history, weighing in at a shocking $392.5 billion over the next 5 years. 
   This Democrat budget, which is balanced on the backs of everyday taxpayers, would be used to finance bloated new government spending that will grow well above the rate of inflation through 2012, while also ignoring the brewing entitlement crisis. Around 77 million baby boomers will be retiring in the very near future and will begin collecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Funding this new spending represents the greatest economic challenge of our era, and it is a challenge that the Democrat budget has chosen to completely ignore, while going on its own spending spree elsewhere. 
   In the 32nd Congressional District of Texas, which I have the honor to represent, the Heritage Foundation estimates that the passage of this budget will cost every single taxpayer an additional $2,920 in 2012. It will also mean a per capita loss of $474 in personal income, as well as 2,389 lost jobs as a result of a loss of $328 million to the local economy of the 32nd Congressional District of Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will insert into the Record this entire document which details the severe negative impact on the passage that this budget will have on every single taxpayer from every single district across the country. 
   Mr. Speaker, if fiscal discipline is what the Democrats promised voters this past fall, then, by my account, it took only 3 months for the Democrat candidates to abandon their campaign promises and an additional 2 months for Democrats to reiterate their really true support for tax-and-spend policies again here on the House floor today. 
   This deeply flawed budget would increase taxes on almost 8 million taxpayers just in my home State of Texas alone. It would collect these taxes by allowing the 2001 and 2003 tax relief provided by the Republican Congress to expire. 
   In real terms, for every American taxpayer, this means reducing the child tax credit for working families so that the government can collect $27 billion more to finance, yes, you've got it, Mr. Speaker, brand-new spending. 
   It means reinstating the marriage penalty and the death tax to collect an additional $104 billion so that the new majority Democrats can kick the can further down the road, rather than reforming and strengthening our Nation's entitlement programs. 
   And it means completely ignoring the alternative minimum tax crisis which is projected to hit 23 million middle-class families if not dealt with in a responsible manner. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe the voters watching this debate on C-SPAN understand what these tax increases mean for them, the economy, and for our ability to compete globally. But they may not realize what they mean for the average family of four with $60,000 in earnings. It will mean a tax increase of 61 percent. It means that a single parent with two children and $30,000 in earnings would see a tax increase of 67 percent. And it means that an elderly couple with $40,000 of income would see their taxes increase by a whopping 156 percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, you can see the advantages of the Republican tax cut and what it means to every single middle-class American. 
   Now, one would think that a hike of almost $400 billion impacting every American taxpayer would be enough to finance the Democrats' appetite for big government. But trust me, it's just the start. This budget also contains 12 reserve funds or pet initiative IOUs which set the stage for more than $115 billion in higher future spending which would have to be financed by, you guessed it, even higher taxes. 
   For the last 4 years, responsible budgets passed by the Republican Party kept discretionary spending at or below inflation for all nondefense, non-homeland security spending. This budget plan brought forward by the Democrats brings this fiscally disciplined tradition to a screeching halt by allowing about $25 billion more in discretionary spending than President Bush or even the spendthrift Senate, for that matter, which asked for about $7 billion less than the House. 
   Thankfully, it's not too late to stop this fiscal train wreck. By voting against this rule, every Member of this  body can demonstrate their opposition to the Federal largesse included in this budget, as well as their opposition to the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Without the meaningful tax relief passed by this recent Republican Congress, our economy would not have seen the massive job growth with 7.6 million new jobs created for American workers and tremendous economic growth of 3.5 percent per year that has our economy growing at the highest rate and has done so over the last 15 quarters. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to stand up for fiscal discipline, economic growth, and responsible budgeting by opposing this rule and the underlying tax increase. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, my wonderful colleague from Massachusetts is trying to have it both ways: We're going to balance the budget; we're not going to cut taxes. We're going to balance the budget; we're not going to cut taxes. But, in fact, what happens is this budget relies on every single tax cut going away so that they can then say they balance the budget, but the fact of the matter is that they do not even address the biggest issues and the problems that face the Nation. 
   He is correct. The gentleman from Massachusetts is correct. Republicans did produce a balanced budget as a result of cutting taxes and fiscal discipline in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000. And in 2001, the day America was attacked, we had a balanced budget. He is absolutely correct. Since that time, we have not had a balanced budget. One million jobs were lost within 1 month after 9/11, 2001. And so as a result of that, Republicans decided that in order for us to gain financial advantage, that we would have tax cuts. 
   It is true that, as a result of rules in the Senate, the other body, that we could not make these tax cuts permanent. It is also true that every single year since that period of time that Republicans have asked Democrats, please make every single one of these tax cuts permanent, well, that's like light to a vampire. Absolutely no, not for the Democrats, because they're opposed to the tax cuts. They're on record of opposing the tax cuts. And today they come to the floor, oh, we're not taking away any of the tax cuts. Of course they are. Because if they didn't, they couldn't then ``balance the budget'' that they have on the floor today. That is exactly what they are doing. 
   Second point, Social Security, as a result of our growing economy, every single new worker that comes in, Social Security has to add to its deficit the amount of money that is owed to Social Security every time we get a new worker, and that is more than half of this deficit. It's an accounting gimmick because what happens is that Social Security accounts for what they have to have as an unfunded liability out for 50 years. 
   So to talk about the irresponsibility, I will take part of the blame. But growing this economy, having increased tax revenue, having the greatest single economy we have ever had, more people than ever living in homes, their own homes and our challenging the Democrat minority and now majority to say, why don't we get on with the real things that are important like worrying about Medicare and Medicaid? Nothing. Why don't we make sure that families do not have to pay after-tax dollars for health care? Silence. Silence from our Democrat majority. 
   The new Democrats want to tax and spend. That's what they've always been about. That's what they're about on the floor of the House of Representatives today. And they're trying to get it both ways. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield such time as he may consume to the ranking member from the Budget Committee, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan).

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take just a second and highlight the admiration that this House has for the two gentlemen who have just been speaking. The gentleman, Mr. Spratt, and the gentleman, Mr. Ryan, have conducted themselves despite tough differences, and I applaud both of them, in particular my good friend from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) for the conduct that he has on this floor. 
   Now back to the real issues. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is the Republican minority is here on the floor of the House today opposing this bill. We are opposing this resolution because we do not believe that this properly talks about the future of this country for entitlement spending, raising taxes and not being responsible for the future opportunity for America to compete. 
   So we, once again, continue our opposition to the process that is happening today, as well as the underlying legislation. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from the Fifth Congressional District of Texas (Mr. Hensarling).

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, we are opposed to this bill. The first thing this is going to do is provide for higher taxes, $392 billion worth of new taxes between now and 2012. Secondly, this budget outspends inflation. It outspends inflation moving forward that will increase higher than the average of 2.4 percent. It is reckless entitlement spending increases. It is either empty promises or tax increases that they have. 
   Mr. Speaker, lastly, it is very obvious that there is no entitlement reform that will take place. They had a 5-year budget to do it. They had 5 years to look out and say, we are going to match our Republican colleagues. It is now our chance, because the Republicans tried and got no support from the Democrats for the last 12 years to make sure we could do entitlement reform. Now it is their turn. Nothing. Nada. They are ignoring the future. This is a bad precedent. 
   We know that the Democratic party is about taxing and spending. It is obvious. It is there today. We will let them vote for the tax increases. We will continue on the Republican side to make sure that we are for growing the economy and cutting taxes.

   Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the gentleman from Pasco, Washington, for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, in response to our good friends on the other side, this economy is the greatest economy we have ever had, 130 straight months of economic growth. 
   I am proud of what we have done. I am proud of what the Republican Party did by cutting taxes. I am proud of what the Republican Party did by making sure this country came back to work. I am proud of the Republican Party for doing the things that President Bush has led us to do. 
   I know what the Democratic Party is all about. They are all about making sure that we will raise taxes, that we will have more rules and regulations and that we will make sure that we cut off the ability that America has to be competitive with the world. That's what this debate is also about. 
   I rise with great regret to report to the American people that once again, as I have been forced to do on multiple occasions over the past few months and really during this entire year, to see the Democrat leadership bringing legislation to the House floor that stacks the deck in favor of Big Labor bosses at the American taxpayers' expense to the tune of $2.2 billion, to be exact. 
   Last night the Democrat Rules Committee voted along party lines to prevent me, a member of the committee, from having the opportunity to raise government revenue while reducing the size of our government by striking a provision unrelated to fixing the AMT. However, it was in the legislation that is before us in the House today. 
   I find it ironic that as this Congress works to protect American taxpayers from the AMT, a tax that they would pay but were never meant to pay, that the Democrats would include in this bill a provision preventing the IRS from effectively collecting other delinquent taxes, taxes that people were meant to pay but haven't. 
   In 2004, Congress gave the IRS the ability to utilize the best practices and advantages created by the private sector to address its growing backlog of unpaid debt. 
   Today, it is estimated that $345 billion of these taxes, unpaid taxes, exist, meaning that every single year the average taxpayer who plays by the rules must pay an average or an extra $2,700 to cover taxes not paid by others. 
   This new program, which began as a small pilot program that continued to grow and continued to succeed, is estimated to bring in $2.2 billion in the first 10 years alone. Under this agreement, the IRS would get the first 25 cents of every dollar for them to hire new collections professionals, a provision that will have positive compounded effects by helping to bring in even greater amounts of uncollected revenue to the government in the future. 
   This program, even in its beginning stages and despite numerous attempts by the Democrat majority to kill it before it can succeed, has been a huge success, bringing in over $30 million of uncollected taxes. It has received a 98 percent rating from the IRS for regulatory and procedural accuracy, as well as 100 percent rating for professionalism. 
   I wish that I could say that I was surprised by the Democrat leadership by allowing politics to triumph over policy or fair procedure. Unfortunately, this is precisely what we have come to expect from the new broken-promises Democrat majority. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to vote against this tax increase and this attempt to stack the deck in favor of labor union bosses. 
   I am opposed to this rule. I am opposed to the underlying legislation.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this rule and to the unprecedented tax increase that the Democrat majority is bringing to the House floor today. The massive and irresponsible tax increase included in this budget would be the largest in American history, weighing in at a shocking $392.5 billion over the next 5 years. This Democrat budget, which is balanced on the backs of everyday taxpayers, will be used to finance bloated new government spending that my colleague just spoke about that will be well above the rate of inflation through 2012 while ignoring the brewing entitlement crisis. Spending, more spending, and more spending rather than worrying about the brewing entitlement crisis that faces this Nation. Around 77 million baby boomers will be retiring in the near future and will begin collecting Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. Funding this new spending represents the greatest economic challenge of our era and is a challenge the Democrat budget has chosen to completely ignore while going on a spending spree everywhere else. 
   If fiscal discipline is what the Democrats promised voters this past fall, then by my count it took all of about 3 months for the Democrat candidates to abandon their campaign trail promises and show their true tax-and-spend stripes here again on the floor today. 
   This deeply flawed budget would increase taxes on almost 8 million taxpayers in my home State of Texas, costing each of them an average of $2,755 per year. It would collect these taxes by allowing the 2001 and 2003 tax relief provided by the Republican Congress to expire. In real terms, for every taxpayer, this means reducing the child tax credit for working families so that government can collect $27 billion more to finance the new spending that the Democrat majority chooses. It means reinstating the marriage penalty and the death tax to collect an additional $104 billion so that the majority can kick that further down the road rather than reforming and strengthening our Nation's entitlement programs. And it means completely ignoring the alternative minimum tax crisis which is projected to hit 23 million middle-class families if not dealt with quickly. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe the voters watching this debate on C-SPAN understand what these tax increases mean for our economy and our ability to compete globally, for, you see, I remember just a few short years ago when America was shipping thousands and thousands of jobs overseas and then the tax cuts took place and now we can't find enough workers in America. Madam Speaker, I would suggest to you, that is the way to be globally competitive, when you have plenty of jobs in America. But the voters and those people watching this debate may not realize that for a family of four with $60,000 in earnings, it would mean a tax increase of some 61 percent. It means that a single parent with two children and $30,000 in earnings would see a tax increase of 67 percent. And it means that an elderly couple with $40,000 in income would see their taxes increased by a whopping 156 percent. 
   Now, one would think that a tax increase of almost $400 billion impacting every American taxpayer would be enough to finance the Democrats' appetite for big government programs. But hold on. This is just the start. There's more to come. This budget also contains 12 reserve funds, or pet initiative IOUs, which set the stage for more than $115 billion in future higher spending which will have to be financed by, let me say, you guessed it, the taxpayer. Higher taxes. 
   For the last 4 years, responsible budgets passed by the Republican Party kept discretionary spending at or below inflation for all non-defense, non-homeland security spending. This budget plan brought forward by the Democrats brings this tradition to a screeching halt by allowing about $25 billion more in discretionary spending than requested by President Bush or even the spendthrift Senate, which asks for about $7 billion less than the House. 
   Thankfully, it is not too late to stop this fiscal train wreck. My friend, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Paul Ryan, has proposed an alternative budget that achieves balance by 2012 and ends the raid on Social Security without raising taxes. The Republican alternative maintains our strong economy, reforms and strengthens entitlement programs, and does this while keeping in place the tax relief that has contributed so much to our economy since 2001. 
   Without meaningful tax relief passed by recent Republican Congresses, our economy would not have seen the massive job growth--with 7.6 million new jobs or roughly 170,000 per month--and  economic growth of 3.5 percent a year that it has experienced over the last 15 quarters. 
   The Republican budget contains no increase in marginal rates and leaves in place the 10 percent bracket for low-income filers. It includes no reduction in child tax credit, no rollback of the marriage penalty or death tax relief, and no increase in capital gains or dividend tax rates. It provides for an extension of alternative minimum tax relief, the research and development tax credit, and the State and local sales tax deduction that is so important to people all across this country, including the 17 States that it benefits. It ends the raid on Social Security and fully funds the President's request for national defense and the war on terrorism. It also makes important budget reforms, such as a legislative line-item veto; earmark transparency; requiring PAYGO to be offset by spending reductions, not tax increases; discretionary spending caps; requiring a vote on any debt limit increase; and requiring a vote on any bill that seeks to spend or authorize more than $50 million. 
   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to listen very carefully today about what the choices are that are on the floor of the House of Representatives and what they can support and to stand up for fiscal discipline, economic growth and responsible budgeting by opposing this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee does not charge for people to come and attend our meetings, and it seems like a good number of Members probably needed to be there last night. 
   The gentlewoman from Connecticut would have heard that this big increase that she is talking about in SCHIP is in a reserve fund. It is not paid for. As a matter of fact, it is going to have to find an offset somewhere if they are going to get to it. So it is not reserved in the budget as necessarily to be paid for; it is in a reserve fund. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 1/2 minutes to the budget expert from the Republican Party from the Fifth District of Texas (Mr. Hensarling).

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have heard the debate today about this budget, about the priorities of the new Democrat majority, about how they have set aside all these 11 reserve funds; and we have seen Member after Member after Member from the new Democrat majority take credit for all these things that are going to be done. And yet, in fact, what they are is reserve funds set aside to find a way to either increase taxes or to find an offset. 
   We think that this is an irresponsible way to run the government. We think this is an irresponsible budget. We think raising taxes $395 billion, which is included in that budget; we heard the testimony last night from the chairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking member that the assumptions that are based on the Democrat budget are that the tax cuts will go away, that tax increases will fill their place. We disagree with that. We think that hardworking American families deserve the right and the opportunity to continue their best wishes for their families, for their children's education, and take care of their family needs through the hard-earned money that they earned, to be able to keep that rather than bringing it for more spending that this new Democrat majority has in mind. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so that I may amend the rule to make in order a very thoughtful amendment offered by Mr. Brady of Texas which was rejected by the Rules Committee last night. The Democrats in the committee voted down on party line. 
   Mr. Brady's amendment would amend the budget resolution to add reconciliation instructions to the Committee on Ways and Means to extend the State and local sales tax deduction through 2012. 
   Currently, the Democrat budget resolution does not contemplate the extension of any meaningful tax relief provided by Republicans in 2001 or 2003. In fact, the Democrat budget resolution is relying on tax increases to reach this balance. As Americans make their household budgets, they should be able to rely on a consistent and fair Tax Code. The Democrat budget resolution will undermine this goal by imposing double taxation and will help eliminate the stability in the Tax Code that Americans deserve.  
   So even if all the substitutes are defeated, we will still be able to consider and debate this very important amendment.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, we make a point of order with great respect to this body. We're here to do business today. We've asked this body to please consider an adjournment because we have a lot of Members who are in California. We were denied that request. 
   We also believe this point of order should be heard because it's important that last night a 293-page bill was brought forth to the Rules Committee, which we received only 25 to 30 minutes before that meeting took place, I believe, in violation of the regular order for legislation that Speaker Pelosi has outlined for all Members of Congress, as well as the American people, a Congress working for all Americans. 
   And under regular order for legislation, it states: ``Members should have at least 24 hours to examine bill and conference report text prior to floor consideration.'' Mr. Speaker, that has not happened again today. Again today we find that the legislation not following regular order is presented to this House. 
   Last night, as we began the discussion in the Rules Committee, we found out this is not even a House bill. No  one took responsibility for the bill that was coming to the Rules Committee last night. Every person there said this is a Senate bill; this isn't a House bill. 
   And then we tried to discuss what was in that bill. I don't know what's in that bill. Sure, we've had some time today, but we have not digested all 293 pages. And, Mr. Speaker, we believe that what is happening here today is not only in violation of what we have seen, a Congress working for all Americans, but also the establishment of the way this House would run itself under regular order and for the best interest of all Members of Congress.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, last Congress the distinguished chairwoman of the Committee on Rules thought it was so important to require at least 24 hours before voting on any rule that she authored a rules change, H. Res. 686, cosponsored by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui), senior members of the Rules Committee. The proposed change would have prohibited calling up a report by the Committee on Rules within 24 hours of presentation to the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would refer my colleagues to H. Res. 686 of the 109th Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wasn't really surprised when the new Democrat majority didn't actually follow through on their commitments on the opening-day package. However, I just wonder what happened to the dedication of Democratic Members who once showed the rights of preserving those things which they think are good for Members to have time to know what the heck they're voting on.     
   And I believe today a 293-page bill with zero cosponsors, and even the gentleman who brought the bill to the Rules Committee last night said ``not my bill, it's the Senate's bill,'' I believe we should be careful what we are doing and allow 24 hours and follow the rules of the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren).

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this 40th completely closed rule to be reported by the Rules Committee in the first session of the 110th Congress, a rule that fails even to provide the minority with a substitute amendment and to the underlying legislation that the minority did not receive until 7:30 p.m. last night. 
   Might I also add, perhaps the American public is sold on this, but there is not one cosponsor of this bill in this body. And when the bill was presented to the Rules Committee last night, no one even took credit for it. Those that brought the bill forward said, ``Not my bill, this is the Senate bill.'' An interesting twist of fate. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, for the third time in as many months, I oppose the way this legislation has been brought to the floor without a single legislative markup. I oppose the fact that despite Speaker Pelosi's promise to run the most honest, open and transparent House in history, today we are being provided with a process and a product that is none of the above. 
   Mr. Speaker, what we do have is a bill that neither the Republican leadership nor the Republican members on the Energy and Commerce Committee nor the administration had any opportunity to participate in crafting. 
   What we do have is a process that has been politicized and mischaracterized over and over again by the new Democrat majority in the hopes if the same skewed numbers and faulty facts are repeated enough times, then somehow they must be true. 
   Last night in the Rules Committee, we learned that when it comes to playing by their own PAYGO rules, the Democrat majority wants to have things both ways. We learned that this majority only agrees with the facts presented by the Congressional Budget Office when it suits their needs. When the CBO estimates that the bill raises taxes enough to pay for the additional $35 billion in spending that it creates, they would be for it. However, when confronted by the fact that CBO estimates that this legislation falls 26 percent short of the often-repeated claim of covering 10 million children, all of a sudden the CBO's calculator is broken and their ability to estimate anything accurately is certainly put at dispute. 
   The CBO also estimates, as my good friend and colleague from Texas, Dr. Michael Burgess, points out in his testimony late last night in the Rules Committee, this legislation will move 2 million children who are already being covered by private health insurance into a Washington-based system that deliberately undercompensates physicians for their services by approximately 40 percent, creating a net loss for the overall quality of patient care. 
   What we do have is a process that for the third consecutive time still increases government spending and dislocates the private marketplace, diverting much-needed funds away from helping our Nation's poorest children. 
   One new bit of information which has been represented about this legislation is that it finally prevents undocumented workers and adults from receiving those funds intended to pay for the medical cost of children of the working poor.     
   Since we got this 293-page bill just a few hours ago, I will have to take the Democrats at their word. But if this is the case, it means that despite all of their protests to the contrary, and consistent with now-vindicated Republican criticisms, the first two SCHIP bills passed by the House did cover undocumented workers and adults. 
   I would like to congratulate Speaker Pelosi and the rest of the new Democrat leadership team for finally agreeing with what Republicans have been saying all along, because we all began at the same point, and that is, you can't have a fix if there's no problem to begin with. We knew there was a problem, and they finally admitted it in this new bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm not here to oppose the idea of SCHIP. It was a Republican-controlled Congress that created SCHIP; and I support its original, true mission statement. But H.R. 3963 is yet another thinly camouflaged attempt at slowly siphoning Americans from insurance plans in the private market into a Washington-based, government-run, single-payer health care system. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we have failed to address one of the most serious issues facing our Nation, how to make the health insurance system more affordable and accessible for all Americans. So, most of all, I rise to oppose the Democrat leadership playing political games with children's health in order to score electoral points. 
   It is a well-known and often-cited axiom that ``success has a thousand fathers, but failure is an orphan.'' That statement is no more true than in Washington, D.C. today, where everyone clamors to be associated with success but sets new land-speed records in distancing themselves from responsibility. 
   You see, last night in the Rules Committee, we were told time and time again that the bill being brought forward by this rule is not a House product; it is a Senate compromise that we all just have to support. The chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, my good friend Mr. Dingell, reiterated the point over and over again to the committee in his testimony. 
   In fact, despite asking for one, I'm still unable to find one House Democrat willing to take responsibility for all the shortcomings of this bill. And if we can't find one Member of the House, much less a thousand, willing to take credit for this bill, then I guess if we're simply judging the bill a success or a failure, it's pretty obvious which category this falls into. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to oppose this completely closed rule that breaks every promise made in Speaker Pelosi's ``New Direction for America,'' and this politically motivated and ill-conceived legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, just so that the Members of Congress that are around understand this, that 10 million figure cannot be substantiated.

   The American Legion and the VFW already have, along with multiple requests from Republican Members, including this Member of the House, urged both Speaker Pelosi and Democrat Senate Majority Leader Reid to end their PR campaign and begin conference work on the Veterans appropriations bill. Unfortunately, it appears as though all these commonsense requests have fallen on deaf ears, and our Nation's veterans are being forced to pay the price for continued Democrat partisanship and lack of leadership on this issue. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to support this motion to defeat the previous question so that we can put the partisanship aside and move this very important legislation forward.

And I believe it's honorable and respectful to ask that on behalf of my colleagues that we not take up this important legislation today, that we allow ourselves respectfully to adjourn and then come back on Tuesday, as we normally might, to handle this piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida, a member of the Rules Committee, who I look up to and is a great mentor. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in strong opposition to this rule, which completely shuts out the minority from offering any amendments to improve this legislation. 
   Last night, the Rules Committee met to consider the 14 amendments offered by Members to improve this legislation; and the Democratic majority voted along party lines to prevent any amendments offered by a Republican from being considered. 
   I wish I could say that I was surprised by this outcome, but this is nothing new. This new Democratic majority decided to break its campaign trail promises to open up legislative process for all Members. Instead, they have chosen, once again, to play party politics and to help the Rules Committee to solidify its position and reputation as the graveyard of good ideas in the House of Representatives. 
   I offered one of the Republican amendments that will not be considered by the House today because of the partisanship in the Rules Committee. My amendment would have struck section 303, which mandates the automatic annual recertification of successful small businesses, whether this recertification is necessary or not. 
   Section 303 will create an administrative nightmare for small businesses  who wish to contract with the Federal Government. Mandating this annual recertification creates a disincentive for businesses to contract with the government, because filing this unnecessary paperwork takes time, takes money and takes manpower, proving that the actions we take here in Congress actually do have real-world consequences. 
   The Small Business Administration already has the discretion to determine how frequently small businesses must recertify, and the SBA studied and rejected this annual recertification because it would create, as they call it, an unnecessary burden for small business. 
   The SBA has already passed a recertification rule that goes into effect in June of this year. This rule will protect small business contracts without the added costs and headaches associated with the Democratic majority's heavy-handed proposal. Congress should have allowed the SBA rule to take effect before mandating this new, unnecessary statutory paperwork. 
   The failure of the Democratic majority to include my amendment proves that this bill is more about politics than it is about policy. Yesterday, person after person from both parties talked about how great it would be for us to help the great engine of this economy, small business. Yet we find out, when it really comes down to it, they want to put rules and regulations on small businesses, whether they are needed or not. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask to insert in the Record the Statement of Administrative Policy for the bill which specifically states that the bill would impose additional detailed reporting requirements on agencies and prime contractors that would increase costs without clear benefits.

    Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the expanded access to higher education that individuals with intellectual disabilities will have under the College Opportunity and Affordability Act being considered on the House floor today. 
   As many of my colleagues know, my son Alex, who just turned 14, has Down syndrome. As a student at J.L. Long Middle School in Dallas, Texas, Alex has made significant academic progress and received many of the same education opportunities as his peers as a result of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. While IDEA will provide invaluable education for Alex throughout his K-12 education, I also realize that IDEA will not be there to serve his needs after high school. 
   Currently, the education opportunities for most individuals with intellectual disabilities end with secondary school. Unfortunately, most remain unemployed and completely dependent. 
   As the parent of an individual with intellectual disabilities, I have worked to ensure that individuals with disabilities have access to the resources and opportunities to develop self-reliance and life skills, enabling them to achieve their potential and to contribute to our communities. 
   Mr. Chairman, in 2006, I authored legislative language to grant students with intellectual disabilities access to Federal work study funds for enrollment in comprehensive post-secondary education programs. 
   I am very pleased that the College Opportunity and Affordability Act not only includes my work study language, but it also builds on those efforts by providing access to Pell Grants and Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants. By providing access to Federal student aid, we will be empowering individuals with intellectual disabilities across our Nation to learn, develop, and achieve to the best of their abilities. 
   Additionally, I am pleased that this legislation will establish a model education demonstration for a comprehensive transition and post-secondary program for students with intellectual disabilities. By awarding competitive grants to higher education institutions, the development of this model demonstration will establish important first steps for the creation and expansion of additional transition and postsecondary programs for students with intellectual disabilities across our Nation. 
   To ensure the integrity and success of these groundbreaking programs for students with intellectual disabilities, this legislation also authorizes a coordinating center that will provide technical assistance, evaluation, and recommendations for the development of accreditation standards. 
   Mr. Chairman, the establishment of these vital programs will represent a historic victory not only for individuals with intellectual disabilities, but also for their families and for the educators and advocates who have worked diligently to establish these post-secondary education opportunities. 
   In particular, I would like to recognize Stephanie Lee and Madeleine Will with the National Down Syndrome Society for their invaluable expertise and support to ensure that dreams of student aid and transitional education programs for individuals with intellectual disabilities become a reality. 
   Today, we can ensure that individuals with intellectual disabilities have access to the educational resources and opportunities that can enable them to lead a very fulfilling life.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and to the woefully incomplete conference report that the Democrat majority is bringing to the House floor today. 
   Despite the repeated campaign promises made by Democrat leaders to the American people that they would take action on all of the remaining 9/11 Commission recommendations, that is not what is being done and not what is being brought to the floor of the House today. 
   It now appears that those claims were nothing more than just a hollow campaign promise because, as anticipated, they have failed to address a key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. 
   While the Senate included a simple sense of Congress that congressional operations should be streamlined so that overlapping and duplicative oversight issues could be addressed, even this simple symbolic measure was dropped from the final legislation. 
   The 9/11 Commission stated: ``Of all our recommendations, strengthening congressional oversight may be among the most difficult and important. So long as oversight is governed by current congressional rules and resolutions, we believe the American people will not get the security they want and need.'' 
   It went on further to say: ``Congress should create a single, principal point of oversight and review for homeland security.'' 
   In the 109th Congress, House Republicans provided the responsible leadership needed on this issue by making the Committee on Homeland Security a standing committee, but there are still 10 other House committees that have overlapping and redundant oversight over the Department of Homeland Security. 
   House Democrats could have enacted this change with a simple rules change at the start of the 110th Congress. They failed to do so then; and with this legislation, they are once again ignoring this important issue entirely, including a campaign promise. 
   Thankfully, Mr. Speaker, this conference report is not a complete failure. Thanks to the leadership of President Bush and House Republicans, two important provisions were fixed in this conference report that will help keep Americans safe and improve our ability to combat terror at home. 
   First, this legislation wisely does not contain a mandate that collective bargaining rights be required for the Transportation Security Administration screeners. This dangerous provision was originally buried in the House Democrat leadership's version of this legislation; and thanks to President Bush's veto threat, it has been removed from the legislation that we are considering today. 
   The 9/11 Commission did not recommend collective bargaining for TSA screeners. In fact, to the contrary. The commission stressed the need to improve airport security and screening procedures. Collective bargaining would have prevented implementing fluid operations for protecting our country by requiring TSA management to consult with union bosses before making critical homeland security decisions. 
   As Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff explained, ``Marines don't collectively bargain over whether they're going to wind up being deployed in Anbar province in Baghdad. We can't negotiate over terms and conditions of work that go to the heart of our ability to move rapidly in order to deal with the threats that are emerging.''     
   Secretary Chertoff also noted that the proposed negotiations with unions would have seriously threatened operations such as the interception of the London bombing plot or a response to Hurricane Katrina. Thankfully, in what may be the first missed opportunity for increasing the power of labor bosses this year in the House, good sense prevailed and this provision did not survive the legislative process. 
   Additionally, good sense and Republican-proposed policy prevailed in this conference through the inclusion of a provision to protect vigilant observers who support suspicious terror-related activity. By including these John Doe provisions, my good friend, the Homeland Security Ranking Member Peter King, won a great victory on behalf of the American people. 
   As Congressman King recently noted, in a post-9/11 reality, vigilance is essential to security. Despite the Democrat opposition to this Homeland Security measure, common sense has prevailed and heroic Americans who report suspicious activity will be prevented and protected from frivolous lawsuits. The American people were heard, and our country is safer because of it. 
   I commend Congressman King and other Republicans that served on this conference committee for insisting that Congress not let trial lawyers and the fear of litigation get in the way of promoting one of our best and most dynamic lines of defense against domestic terrorism, having everyday Americans report potential threats and terrorist activities to the proper authority. 
   While the Democrat party may not trust American men and women to use their good sense in reporting suspicious activity, I know as Republicans that's what we will do, and I really do appreciate Pete's efforts for this hard work. 
   I also appreciate all the hard work that was put into developing the conference reports on both sides of the aisle. I am also pleased to note that this conference report represents the first time that labor bosses and trial attorneys have been denied their every wish on this House floor. Unfortunately, I am not confident that we will see another commonsense bill that puts the safety and well-being of the American people over these special interests any time soon. 
   I also appreciate the Democrat leadership's attempt at almost fulfilling one of their many unfulfilled campaign promises by bringing this legislation back to the House floor today.

   Republicans tried our very best, other than demanding, that the terrorist watch list would be applied to trains and passengers for people like on trains and Amtrak. And I wonder if the gentlewoman can tell me whether that was added in this conference report.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, people stand up and talk about what a great job they are doing to protect this country, but they fail to get the essence because it might be a privacy concern. The fact of the matter is that all the people that are on our trains, Amtrak, that we are spending billions of dollars that are being spent for more security officers; and yet the Democrats fail to do the simplest thing, and that is, at the time you buy a ticket, seeing if you are on the terrorist watch list. 
   It is incredibly arrogant that this Congress would stand up and say we are doing all we can do, and yet we do not even apply the terrorist watch list to people who would be on our trains. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes at this time to the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I will be asking for a recorded vote on the previous question for this rule. If the previous question fails, I will ask the House to amend the rule to provide for the separate consideration of H.R. 3138, which would amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to update the definition of electronic surveillance. 
   Mr. Speaker, our country is facing a serious problem that must be addressed before the House adjourns in August. And to date the Democrat majority has continued to shirk their responsibility  to keep America safe by ignoring the seriousness of this threat. 
   Today the Rules Committee met to pass a rule for the Eightmile Wild and Scenic River Act; however, this Democrat leadership cannot seem to find time to schedule consideration of legislation that clarifies one very simple and critical thing, and that is that the United States Government will no longer be required to get a warrant to listen to foreign terrorists who are not even located in the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, repeatedly Members of this House have come to the floor for weeks and weeks and weeks asking for that ability to make sure we can get this done to protect the American people. The Director of National Intelligence, Michael McConnell, and the Director of the CIA, Michael Hayden, have testified to Congress that under current law their hands are tied. As Director McConnell recently testified, FISA is outdated and has been made obsolete by technology. I might also say, and the laws governing that. And today our intelligence community is forced to obtain warrants to listen to terrorists outside our Nation, and as a result we are actually missing, we are missing, a significant portion of what we should be getting. Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to be asleep; it is a different thing not to even wake up and see what you need to do. 
   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are serious about facing down the threat, they will join me in defeating the previous question so the House will be able to address this very real and serious threat immediately. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include my amendment and extraneous materials in the Congressional Record.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and to the underlying legislation, which is proof of not only the Democrat majority's careless disregard for the American taxpayer but also their complete disregard for the energy crisis facing Americans today. Mr. Speaker, today you will hear the other side of the story. 
   This legislation--submitted late last night after the House had already finished its business for the day--is proof that when the Democrats want to bring legislation to the floor in a hurry, they're very capable of that. It's just too bad that we aren't seeing some energy legislation which would make a difference to consumers all across America. 
   Mr. Speaker, despite the pleas of working families and small businesses across the country, Democrats have failed on every occasion to treat the serious issue of high energy costs with the same level of urgency that they're bringing to this debate over this massive bailout of two private companies. 
   This is not to say that there are not good parts to this hastily negotiated legislation. While I believe that Congressman Lee Terry, myself, and other Republicans had a better, more effective proposal, the inclusion of the first-time home buyer credit is wise and has the potential to help reinvigorate our slumping housing and homebuilding markets. 
   Additionally, I support the establishment of a more robust and competent regulator of the GSEs which will restore competence to the marketplace and ensure that these entities operate in a safe, sound, effective manner maintaining adequate capital and internal controls and ``contribute to the liquid, efficient, competitive, and resilient national housing financial markets that minimize the cost of housing finance.'' 
   If this were all that the bill did, I'm confident that the bill would pass this House unanimously. Unfortunately, there are a number of extraneous provisions--cynically added by the Democrat majority to an emergency bill that they are bringing to the floor today under a rushed and closed process--that either weaken the financial position of the GSEs that they claim to be helping, provide a taxpayer bailout of reckless financial behavior, or simply don't make logical sense. 
   Most perplexing of all is the logical inconsistency underlying the entire bill. On the one hand, this Congress is being asked to declare an emergency and authorize the use of unlimited taxpayer funds to become a part of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac problem while also raising the debt limit by $800 billion to lend these companies as much money as they may need. On the other hand, this bill creates an affordable housing trust fund that taxes the GSEs to support questionably effective low-income housing activities and to cover the losses that the FHA will surely incur after the Federal Government accepts financial responsibility for the most toxic loans in the marketplace. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I will ask my Democrat colleagues that drafted this legislation, which is it? Are Fannie and Freddie private companies teetering on the brink of financial disaster thereby justifying this unprecedented taxpayer exposure and government intervention into the marketplace? Or are they cash cows that can and should be forever milked to provide financial support to every low-income housing whim that this Congress can dream of? I ask this because the answer simply cannot be both. 
   Mr. Speaker, because this lockdown rule provides the minority with only 60 minutes to debate this 694-page bill, I'm going to use the little time that I have to let my Republican colleagues come to the floor and use this limited opportunity to discuss all of the shortcomings associated with this bailout of mortgage lenders, investors, and speculators. I will leave it to my Republican colleagues to talk about all of their problems associated with the creation of this permanent housing slush fund, this $800 billion debt-ceiling increase, and this new $4 billion liability that will allow local governments to expose themselves to the up-and-down risks of the real estate market. And perhaps most of all, I will leave it to my colleagues to let them explain why the multibillion-dollar tax increase included in this bill to fund all of the bad ideas I've just described and certainly many more is a bad idea. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, there are lots of reasons to oppose this bill. We've talked about the things that we have in common with the bill. But I think it's important that we talk about what this bill actually does. 
   First of all, the GSE bailout. The 18-month term of authority for the Treasury to extend Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's line of credit and purchase their equity is too long, we believe. Six months should be the limit. Not 18 months. The conditions under which a bailout is allowed should be clearly stated and should restrict the unlimited authority of the Treasury Secretary to act. The amount of Federal investment authorized should not be unlimited. 
   We've just given two great ideas, ideas that, because of a closed rule, you will not see on this floor of the House of Representatives. The conditions under which a bailout is allowed should be clearly stated and should restrict the unlimited authority of the Treasury Secretary to act. 
   Mr. Speaker, we believe the amount of Federal investment authorized should not be unlimited, and perhaps most importantly, we see that what Congress is doing is abdicating completely our authority and our role to the executive branch.     
   That's bad policy, and we should not be doing that on this floor of the House of Representatives today. 
   Secondly, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, this legislation would place a permanent Affordable Housing Trust Fund mandate on the GSEs. In light of their current liquidity and capital conditions, taking money from Fannie or Freddie is a bad policy. Taking money from two of these instruments should not be done. 
   Moreover, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund could be used as a slush fund for political activity purposes. We see one of the housing groups that actively engages in open partisanship on a regular basis, and yet, they quite likely will qualify for a lot of taxpayer money. For what purpose? More politics. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, the Republican Party is on the floor offering alternatives to this bad piece of legislation. We are not just saying ``no.''  What we're saying is this is an open slush fund and should not be allowed. 
   Mr. Speaker, we reserve our time.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Well, Mr. Speaker, we tried to get additional debate on this issue, but I know the closed rule we have got is intended entirely to squeeze down time and the amount of debate that would take place, confirming that again.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I will go ahead and close with the understanding that the gentlewoman is at that point in her presentation, also. Seeing an affirmation, I will go ahead and close. 
   Mr. Speaker, since taking control of this House, this Democrat Congress has totally neglected its responsibilities to address the domestic supply issues that have created the skyrocketing gas, diesel and energy costs that American families today are facing. 
   Today, they are proving that they can move a bill--like this housing bill--quickly when they choose to do so. However, they do not believe that the energy crisis facing American families and businesses is important enough to treat it with the same level of seriousness. 
   So today I urge my colleagues to vote with me to defeat the previous question so this House can finally consider real solutions to the rising energy costs in addition to this housing and GSE legislation. 
   If the previous question is defeated, I will move to amend the rule to allow for additional consideration of H.R. 6566, the American Energy Act. This bill would increase the supply of American-made energy, improve conservation and efficiency, and promote new and expanded energy technologies to help lower the price at the pump and help reduce America's increasing costly and dangerous dependence on foreign sources of energy. 
   I encourage everyone that believes that a comprehensive solution to solving this energy crisis and achieving energy independence includes increasing the supply of American energy should vote to defeat this rule and the previous question.

   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, we have given lots of reasons about ways we can make this bill better. The ways we can make it better is to make sure that what we do today is carefully understood, that we do not pass on to future taxpayers billions of dollars, and to any administration the opportunity simply to hand out money without an understanding and an expectation of performance. 
   Mr. Speaker, we've outlined our reasons today. We need to make sure that the Members of Congress who will vote today understand that opposing this bill and sending it back and making it better is the right thing to do. We also need to make sure that we take care of the American consumer who is having  increasing problems paying their bills, not just their housing bills, but also at the gas pump.

<DOCNO>Mr. SESSIONS. (RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF MALAYSIA'S INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Malaysia's 50th anniversary of their independence from the United Kingdom that was recently celebrated on August 31, 2007.  
   I am proud to serve as a Co-Chair of the Congressional Malaysia Trade, Security, and Economic Cooperation Caucus along with my good friend, the Honorable Gregory W. Meeks of New York. This is an important tribute from the House of Representatives to the people of Malaysia, as we honor a landmark day in their history. The United States was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the newly independent Malaysia 50 years ago, and I am proud of how the United States/Malaysian relationship has prospered since their independence. 
   Malaysia has a population in excess of 25 million, and is a moderate-Muslim democratic nation in a key geo-politically sensitive region of the world. Malaysia is currently our 10th largest trading partner, and I hope that our trade relationship with Malaysia will expand. We have inked a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with Malaysia, and our countries are currently in talks for a free trade agreement. I am hopeful that these talks will produce a free trade agreement accord that Congress will be able to pass. This enhanced economic partnership would be of great benefit to the businesses and citizens of both countries. 
   Malaysia has been a regional leader in many areas of mutual concern to the United States and Malaysia, they are a leader in counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics in Southeast Asia. Through intelligence sharing, close cooperation in law enforcement, participation in joint exercises and training, and other cooperative endeavors with its neighboring countries and the United States, Malaysia is a leader in many of our shared interests. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to thank our recently departed Ambassador to Malaysia, Ambassador Christopher J. LaFleur, for his service of representing the interests of the United States in Kuala Lumpur. Moreover, I would like to thank the current Charge d'affaires ad interim for the American Embassy in Malaysia, David B. Shear, and the Malaysia Desk Officer at the State Department in Washington, Michael P. Taylor, for their service and hard work. Recently, I had the opportunity to meet our new Ambassador to Malaysia, Ambassador James R. Keith. Ambassador Keith has my full confidence and gratitude; he is a seasoned diplomat of great skill, and I wish him a good start to his duties in representing the United States in Malaysia. 
   I have also had the pleasure of working with many fine diplomats from Malaysia; I would like to recognize the current Ambassador from Malaysia to the United States, H.E. Datuk Dr. Rajmah Hussain. I would also like to note her immediate predecessor, who I worked with for several years, H.E. Tan Sri Ghazzali B. Sheikh Abdul Khalid. Ambassador Ghazzali was Malaysia's long-tenured representative in Washington, and I am pleased that he is currently engaged in the free trade talks between our two countries. I thank Ambassadors Rajmah and Ghazzali for their services in representing Malaysia in Washington. 
   I congratulate the people of Malaysia on the occasion of this landmark day in their history, and firmly believe that our bilateral relationship will only continue to grow and prosper.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 700 follows an authorization that the Republican Congress provided for in the year 2000, which authorized $75 million in grants for alternative water source projects. 
   We learned that the population growth was causing a number of communities to have to explore alternative supplies through reclamation, reuse and conservation. And so Congress created section 220 of the Clean Water Act. This amendment to the Clean Water Act required a 50 percent non-Federal cost share. And it expired in 2004. 
   Today's legislation doubles this authorization, but the troubling part to me is it allows this authorization to continue indefinitely. So if this legislation passes, there will be no sunset, no further oversight and no review of the effectiveness of these grants. My amendment would provide for the expiration of this authorization in fiscal year 2008. 
   I think it is fiscally responsible and allows Congress to reevaluate these grants, and not just leave them forever without oversight. 
   Mr. Chairman, at this time I understand that the gentleman Mr. Oberstar would wish to engage with me in a colloquy on this amendment. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from California giving me time. 
   I rise in opposition to this closed rule and to the unprecedented creation of a new panel with no legislative jurisdiction and no authority to take legislative action. Mr. Speaker, it is like being air-dropped into this usually noncontroversial resolution without any committee oversight or consideration being given. 
   The cost to the taxpayers for this lopsided new committee to study the serious issue of climate change but that is not given the power by the Democrat leadership of actually doing anything; yet it costs $4 million. 
   This resolution also represents an increase of 14.3 percent over last year's Congress, raising the funding levels for these committees and staff salaries from just over $250 million to just over $291 million, one Congress to the next. 
   But with all of this new spending, the Democrat majority cannot find a way to adequately fund one of the most vocally stated priorities, at least on the campaign trail, the Ethics Committee. 
   This lack of funding is hindering the committee's struggle to untangle the confusingly drafted new ethics package passed by the new Democrat majority and to provide the training mandated by House Rules. 
   So, today, the American people can see where the Democrats' true priorities lie, in crafting and creating an unfunded mandate and leaving a campaign promise unfilled, while spending millions of taxpayer dollars on a new panel that has no authority to do anything. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do encourage all my colleagues to hear the straight story, and I also encourage them to vote against this rule and to defeat it.
